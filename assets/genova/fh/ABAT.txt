# ABAT

## Overview
The ABAT gene encodes the enzyme 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme involved in the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. This enzyme is categorized as an aminotransferase and plays a critical role in the GABA shunt pathway, linking GABA metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC) and supporting cellular energy metabolism. The ABAT protein typically forms a homodimer, which is essential for its stability and enzymatic activity. It is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it interacts with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase to efficiently process GABA. Mutations in the ABAT gene are associated with various neurological and metabolic disorders, including GABA-transaminase deficiency and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2019Loss; Hearl1984Interactions; Martirosian2021Medulloblastoma).

## Structure
The ABAT protein, also known as 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Its primary structure is composed of amino acid sequences that form distinct secondary structures, including alpha-helices and beta-sheets. These secondary structures contribute to the protein's overall three-dimensional conformation, or tertiary structure, which is essential for its enzymatic activity.

ABAT typically forms a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to function effectively. This dimerization is important for the enzyme's stability and activity. The enzyme is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent, which is a common cofactor involved in amino acid metabolism, and this dependency is crucial for its catalytic function.

Post-translational modifications of ABAT may include phosphorylation, which can influence the enzyme's activity and interactions. Additionally, there are known splice variant isoforms of ABAT, which can result in functional diversity and potentially affect its role in GABA metabolism. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the complexity and importance of ABAT in neurological processes.

## Function
The ABAT gene encodes the enzyme 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the amino group from GABA to α-ketoglutarate, resulting in the production of succinic semialdehyde and L-glutamate. This reaction is essential for maintaining GABA levels and linking GABA metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), thereby supporting cellular energy metabolism (Chen2019Loss; Martirosian2021Medulloblastoma).

ABAT is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the GABA shunt pathway, a bypass mechanism in the TCAC that produces succinate and NADH, intermediates used in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Martirosian2021Medulloblastoma). This process is particularly important in differentiated neurons and astrocytes, where ABAT expression is higher compared to proliferating neural stem cells, indicating its role in supporting the energy demands of mature neural cells (Martirosian2021Medulloblastoma).

In healthy human cells, ABAT-mediated GABA catabolism is vital for regulating the GABAergic system, influencing neural development, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and neuronal cell death (Chen2019Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABAT gene, which encodes the enzyme 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, are associated with several neurological and metabolic disorders. GABA-transaminase deficiency, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, results from mutations in ABAT. This condition is characterized by elevated levels of GABA in the cerebrospinal fluid, leading to severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and movement disorders. It often presents with symptoms such as hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and intractable seizures, and is associated with high childhood mortality (Kennedy20192Pyrrolidinone; Koenig2017Phenotype).

ABAT mutations can also lead to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS), a disorder marked by a significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA copy number. This syndrome manifests as severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, and seizures, and is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction (Besse2015The). Reduced expression of ABAT has been observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) due to high methylation levels, and in cancer, where it is associated with resistance to endocrine therapy and poor recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients (Chen2019Role).

ABAT mutations and altered expression levels are also implicated in various psychiatric and neurological conditions, including depression, autism, and sleep disorders (Chen2019Role).

## Interactions
4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) interacts specifically with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, forming a stable enzymatic complex. This interaction is crucial for the catabolism of the neurotransmitter 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) within the mitochondrial matrix, as both enzymes are part of the 4-aminobutyrate shunt. The complex formation enhances metabolic efficiency and prevents the leakage of harmful intermediates like succinic semialdehyde (Hearl1984Interactions).

Affinity chromatography studies have demonstrated that succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase is retained by immobilized ABAT, indicating a specific interaction. This retention is not due to non-specific binding, as control experiments with reduced immobilized aminotransferase showed no such retention. Other proteins, such as bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin, did not exhibit retention, supporting the specificity of the interaction (Hearl1984Interactions).

Fluorescence polarization techniques have further confirmed the interaction, showing an increase in fluorescence polarization when fluorescein-labeled ABAT interacts with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This suggests changes in the hydrodynamic properties of the macromolecules, providing additional evidence of their interaction (Hearl1984Interactions).
