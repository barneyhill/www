# CCDC144A

## Overview
CCDC144A is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 144A, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC144A protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of CCDC144A remain to be fully elucidated, its structural properties imply potential involvement in various cellular pathways. Further research is needed to determine its precise role and any implications in human health and disease.
