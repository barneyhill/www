# PRSS21

## Overview
PRSS21 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 21, commonly referred to as testisin. Testisin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored serine protease, which is primarily expressed in premeiotic testicular germ cells and plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. The protein is characterized by a trypsin-like serine protease domain and is involved in various proteolytic processes essential for testicular germ cell maturation and male fertility (Hooper2000Localization; Wong2005Identification). Beyond its reproductive functions, testisin has been implicated in tumor suppression, with its expression patterns suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Hooper2000Localization). The gene's expression is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions such as male infertility and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both reproductive and pathological contexts (Tang2005Testisin; NetzelArnett2009The).

## Structure
The PRSS21 gene encodes the serine protease testisin, which is characterized by a trypsin-like serine protease domain. The primary structure of testisin includes a sequence of amino acids that form a catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartate, and serine, which are typical of serine proteases (Hooper2000Localization). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in serine proteases, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Testisin is a membrane-anchored protein, tethered to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is a common post-translational modification that facilitates its localization to lipid rafts (Peroutka2020TestisinPrss21). This localization is significant for its role in processes such as basement membrane remodeling and endothelial migration.

The PRSS21 gene produces two isoforms of testisin, short (S) and long (L), through alternative pre-mRNA splicing. These isoforms differ by the insertion of two amino acids, tyrosine and serine, between the catalytic histidine and aspartate residues, potentially affecting the protein's catalytic activity (Hooper2000Localization). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the context provided.

## Function
PRSS21, also known as testisin, is a serine protease primarily expressed in premeiotic testicular germ cells, specifically pachytene spermatocytes, and is involved in the early stages of spermatogenesis (Hooper2000Localization). The protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, which targets it to lipid rafts in the sperm's outer membrane, suggesting a role in reproductive processes (Wong2005Identification).

Testisin is thought to regulate proteolytic events associated with testicular germ cell maturation, potentially impacting male fertility by facilitating sperm maturation and testicular development (Hooper2000Localization; Holcomb2019The). The expression of PRSS21 is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, with specific elements in the 5' flanking region influencing its testis-specific expression (Hooper2000Localization). Aberrant expression of testisin has been linked to male sterility and infertility, highlighting its critical role in normal spermatogenesis (Hooper2000Localization).

In addition to its role in the testis, testisin's expression in non-testicular tumor cell lines suggests it may have broader implications in cellular processes, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Hooper2000Localization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PRSS21 gene, also known as testisin, have been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and male fertility. Testisin is considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene for testicular cancer, as its expression is typically absent in testicular tumor cells but aberrantly expressed in some non-testicular tumor cell lines (Hooper2000Localization). In ovarian cancer, testisin is overexpressed, promoting malignant transformation and tumor growth. Knockdown of testisin in tumor cell lines leads to increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and survival (Tang2005Testisin).

In terms of fertility, PRSS21 is crucial for sperm maturation and function. Deficiencies in PRSS21 result in sperm abnormalities, such as decreased motility and structural defects, which contribute to reduced male fertility (NetzelArnett2009The). The absence of PRSS21 affects sperm's ability to respond to osmotic challenges, impacting fertilization competence (NetzelArnett2009The). These findings suggest that PRSS21 may be involved in secondary male infertility syndromes, such as 'easily decapitated' spermatozoa (NetzelArnett2009The).

## Interactions
PRSS21, also known as testisin, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored serine protease that participates in several protein interactions, primarily through its role in activating the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2). Testisin cleaves the N-terminal domain of PAR-2, leading to its activation and subsequent internalization from the cell surface. This activation triggers downstream signaling pathways, including intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and induces the expression of cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 (Driesbaugh2015Proteolytic).

Testisin's interaction with PAR-2 is specific, as it does not cleave PAR-1, another protease-activated receptor, highlighting its substrate specificity (Driesbaugh2015Proteolytic). The proteolytic activity of testisin is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors like AEBSF, leupeptin, and aprotinin, but not by metalloproteinase inhibitors such as EDTA, indicating its classification as a serine protease (Driesbaugh2015Proteolytic).

In addition to its role in PAR-2 activation, testisin is involved in regulating vascular permeability and angiogenesis. It influences the expression and phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, a key protein in endothelial cell junctions, thereby affecting vascular integrity and permeability (Peroutka2020TestisinPrss21). These interactions suggest that testisin plays a significant role in maintaining endothelial barrier function and cellular signaling.
