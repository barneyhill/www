# CDH11

## Overview
CDH11 is a gene that encodes cadherin-11, a type II classical cadherin protein primarily involved in mediating cell-cell adhesion through calcium-dependent interactions. Cadherin-11 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which facilitate its role in maintaining tissue integrity and architecture (Row2016Cadherin11). This protein is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts, and is integral to processes like cellular signaling, proliferation, and differentiation (Liu2020Cadherin‐11; Chen2021Research). Cadherin-11's interactions with other proteins, including components of the cytoskeleton and signaling pathways, underscore its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer and craniofacial disorders (Li2021Pathogenic; Chen2021Research).

## Structure
Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is a type II classical cadherin protein involved in cell-cell adhesion. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, typical of cadherin proteins, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of CDH11 is characterized by extracellular cadherin repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are common features in the cadherin family (Row2016Cadherin11).

The quaternary structure involves homophilic interactions between cadherin molecules on adjacent cells, facilitating cell adhesion. These interactions are crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and are mediated through the extracellular cadherin domains (Row2016Cadherin11). CDH11 is known to engage in calcium-dependent adhesion, a characteristic feature of cadherins, which is essential for its role in regulating extracellular matrix synthesis and tissue mechanics (Row2016Cadherin11).

Post-translational modifications of CDH11 may include glycosylation, which can affect its adhesive properties and stability. Alternative splicing of the CDH11 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially influencing its function in various tissues (Row2016Cadherin11).

## Function
Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is a type II classical cadherin protein that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion through calcium-dependent interactions. It is primarily expressed in mesenchymal cell types, including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and osteoblasts, and is involved in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular signaling (Liu2020Cadherin‐11; Chen2021Research). CDH11 mediates intercellular adhesion by forming homodimers that cluster via a zipper-like mechanism, which is essential for maintaining tissue structure and preventing excessive cell movement and proliferation (Li2011The).

In healthy cells, CDH11 is involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It interacts with proteins like p120 ctn, α-catenin, and β-catenin to mediate cell adhesion and regulate signal transduction (Chen2021Research). CDH11 also plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is crucial for the proliferation and survival of certain cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and osteosarcoma cells (Liu2020Cadherin‐11; Chen2021Research).

CDH11's interaction with the PDGFRβ-AKT signaling axis enhances cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy tissue function (Liu2020Cadherin‐11). This interaction increases the sensitivity of cells to growth factors, promoting rapid and sustained activation of signaling pathways essential for cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis (Liu2020Cadherin‐11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDH11 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer, CDH11 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its loss is frequently observed in human retinoblastomas and is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, specifically the loss of 16q, which is a late mutational event in the disease's progression. The absence of CDH11 leads to decreased cell death in tumors, suggesting its role in promoting tumor cell death (Marchong2010Cdh11).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CDH11 expression is significantly altered. High levels of CDH11 expression are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk factors for overall survival, although the statistical significance is not strong. CDH11 overexpression is linked to malignant progression, particularly in lymph node metastasis and perineural infiltration (Wei2023Expression).

Pathogenic variants in CDH11 are associated with Teebi hypertelorism syndrome (THS), a craniofacial disorder characterized by features such as hypertelorism, proptosis, and ptosis. These variants impair cell adhesion, leading to accelerated cell migration and altered gene expression during early embryonic development (Li2021Pathogenic). CDH11 variants have also been linked to Elsahy-Waters syndrome, which involves abnormal craniofacial development (Manohar2020Cadherin11).

## Interactions
Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is a transmembrane protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling pathways. CDH11 interacts with proteins such as p120 catenin, α-catenin, β-catenin, and plakoglobin (γ-catenin) to form complexes that mediate cell adhesion and regulate signal transduction. These complexes can further interact with α-actinin, vinculin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and the actin cytoskeleton (Chen2021Research).

CDH11 also binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), enhancing the activation of the AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. This interaction increases the sensitivity of PDGFRβ to its ligand, PDGF-BB, by approximately 10-to-100-fold, and is maintained even when the extracellular cadherin domains of CDH11 are deleted, suggesting a possible interaction through their transmembrane domains or via other bridging molecules (Liu2020Cadherin‐11).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, CDH11 interacts with inflammatory cytokines and mediates cell adhesion through its extracellular domains, promoting inflammation and cartilage erosion via MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways (Chen2021Research).
