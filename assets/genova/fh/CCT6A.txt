# CCT6A

## Overview
CCT6A is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 6A, which is a critical component of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is essential for the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins, including actin and tubulin, and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CCT6A protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding and stabilization, by preventing misfolding and aggregation. It is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, distinguishing it from its paralog CCT6B, which is specific to the testes. CCT6A has been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through its interactions with key signaling pathways and proteins (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin; Narayanan2016The; Ying2017CCT6A).

## Structure
CCT6A, also known as chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 6A, is a component of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex, which is crucial for protein folding. The CCT complex is composed of two stacked rings, each containing eight different subunits, including CCT6A (Machida2012Reconstitution; Zheng2023A). CCT6A is located on chromosome 7 at position p11.2 and has two isoforms with 14 and 13 exons, resulting in proteins of 531 and 486 amino acids, respectively (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).

The CCT6A protein, like other CCT subunits, consists of three domains: the apical domain, which is involved in substrate binding; the intermediate domain, which connects the other domains; and the equatorial domain, which contains the ATP binding site (Zheng2023A). The equatorial and intermediate domains are conserved across subunits, while the apical domains vary, suggesting different substrate specificities (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).

CCT6A is expressed in all tissues, unlike its paralog CCT6B, which is testes-specific (Narayanan2016The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCT6A gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCT6A acts as a negative regulator of SMAD2, a tumor suppressor, thereby promoting prometastatic TGF-β signaling. This interaction enhances cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, contributing to cancer progression. Overexpression of CCT6A in NSCLC is associated with poor survival outcomes and may result from chromosomal amplification (Zhang2020Chaperonin; Ying2017CCT6A).

In breast cancer, CCT6A is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor survival outcomes, including overall survival and relapse-free survival. Its expression is particularly high in triple-negative breast cancer and basal-like subtypes, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for prognosis (Huang2019Bioinformatics).

CCT6A is also overexpressed in colon cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis. Although not an independent prognostic factor, its expression correlates with various clinical stages and immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and immune modulation (Jiang2024Chaperonin).

These findings suggest that CCT6A could serve as a target for therapeutic intervention across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
CCT6A, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT or TRiC), is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCT6A interacts specifically with the MH2 domain of SMAD2, a key protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This interaction disrupts the formation of the SMAD2-SMAD4 complex, which is essential for the transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes, thereby promoting a prometastatic state in cancer cells (Ying2017CCT6A). CCT6A does not interact with other R-SMADs like SMAD3, highlighting its specificity for SMAD2 (Ying2017CCT6A).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCT6A enhances the stability of the STAT1 protein by preventing its ubiquitination, which in turn promotes the transcription of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a key enzyme in glycolysis. This interaction is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and migration (Yu2024CCT6A).

CCT6A is also part of the CCT complex, which assists in the folding of newly synthesized proteins such as actin and tubulin, and interacts with various proteins, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and Stat3, contributing to tumorigenesis (Zhang2020Chaperonin).
