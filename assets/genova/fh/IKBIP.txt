# IKBIP

## Overview
The IKBIP gene encodes the I kappa B kinase interacting protein, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the NF-κB signaling pathway. This protein functions as a negative regulator by inhibiting NF-κB activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby influencing inflammatory responses and immune regulation (Zhang2023Prognostic). IKBIP is also implicated in cancer biology, where it is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and various tumorigenesis pathways, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and metastasis (Yang2021IKBIP). The gene's expression levels have been linked to poor prognosis in several cancer types, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Bi2023I). Despite its recognized roles, the detailed mechanisms of IKBIP's interactions and functions in different cellular contexts remain an active area of research.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The IKBIP gene, also known as IKIP, has been identified as a significant biomarker in various cancers, with its expression levels linked to poor prognosis in several cancer types. High expression of IKBIP is associated with worse survival outcomes in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), bladder cancer (BLCA), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Bi2023I). In gliomas, IKBIP expression correlates with the World Health Organization (WHO) grade, indicating higher expression in more aggressive forms of the disease (Yang2021IKBIP). IKBIP is also involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that promotes tumor progression, and is associated with key EMT biomarkers and pathways like PI3K/AKT and TGF-β (Yang2021IKBIP).

IKBIP's role extends to influencing the tumor microenvironment by affecting immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathways, which may impact the efficacy of immunotherapy (Bi2023I). The gene's expression is linked to tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), factors that can affect cancer treatment responses (Bi2023I). These findings suggest that IKBIP could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
IKBIP, also known as I kappa B kinase interacting protein, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the NF-κB signaling pathway. It interacts with IKKα/β, acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling by inhibiting NF-κB activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Zhang2023Prognostic). Despite its potential role in NF-κB signaling, studies have not confirmed IKBIP's interaction with NOD2 through co-immunoprecipitation or Bioluminescent Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assays, suggesting that its interaction with NOD2 might be indirect or context-dependent (Thiébaut2016Characterization).

In cancer research, IKBIP has been linked to various cellular processes and pathways. It is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioma, correlating with key EMT biomarkers such as N-cadherin, vimentin, snail, slug, and TWIST1 (Yang2021IKBIP). Although specific physical interactions with these proteins are not detailed, the correlation suggests a role in modulating EMT-related pathways. IKBIP's expression is also linked to immune-related activities and tumorigenesis pathways, indicating its involvement in complex regulatory networks within the tumor microenvironment (Bi2023I). However, detailed physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
