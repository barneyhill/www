# FAM170B

## Overview
FAM170B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 170 member B, which is primarily involved in the process of spermiogenesis, particularly in the formation and function of the acrosome in sperm cells. The FAM170B protein is characterized by structural domains such as a coiled-coil domain and a zinc-finger C2H2 domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for acrosome biogenesis. Although FAM170B is essential for the acrosome reaction, studies indicate that it is not critical for male fertility in mice, as its absence does not impair spermatogenesis or sperm morphology. Beyond its reproductive role, FAM170B has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, where mutations in the gene are associated with altered survival outcomes and involvement in key signaling pathways (Li2015FAM170B; Abd2024Involvement; Devlin2020Knockout).

## Structure
The FAM170B protein is encoded by the Fam170b gene, which is located on chromosome 14 in mice and is conserved across several species, including humans (Li2015FAM170B). The protein consists of 378 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 43.8 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.79 (Li2015FAM170B). 

FAM170B contains several structural domains that suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions. These include a coiled-coil domain (residues 285-312), a zinc-finger C2H2 domain (residues 202-223), a serine-rich region (residues 71-96), and a glutamine-rich region (residues 277-376) (Li2015FAM170B). The coiled-coil domain is particularly noted for facilitating interactions with other proteins, such as GOPC, during acrosome formation (Li2015FAM170B). 

The protein is localized to the acrosome of spermatids and mature spermatozoa, as confirmed by immunostaining techniques (Devlin2020Knockout). Despite its localization and interaction with essential proteins for acrosome formation, FAM170B is considered dispensable for male fertility in mice, as its knockout does not affect fertility (Devlin2020Knockout). 

No specific information is available regarding the tertiary or quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of FAM170B.

## Function
The FAM170B gene encodes a protein that is primarily involved in the process of spermiogenesis, particularly in the formation and function of the acrosome, a specialized organelle essential for fertilization. This protein is exclusively expressed in the testes of mice and humans, with its expression beginning at postnatal week 3 in mice and increasing with age until adulthood (Li2015FAM170B). FAM170B is enriched in round spermatids and redistributes to the acrosome of elongating spermatids and spermatozoa, indicating its role in acrosome biogenesis and the acrosome reaction, which is crucial for sperm to penetrate the egg (Li2015FAM170B).

FAM170B interacts with GOPC during acrosome formation, and its inhibition can block the acrosome reaction, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Li2015FAM170B). Despite its significant role in acrosome formation, studies have shown that FAM170B is dispensable for male fertility in mice, as its knockout does not affect acrosome formation, spermatogenesis, or sperm morphology (Devlin2020Knockout). The protein contains a coiled-coil domain and a zinc-finger C2H2 domain, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins, suggesting its involvement in protein-protein interactions during acrosome formation (Li2015FAM170B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAM170B gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Somatic mutations in FAM170B have been observed in multiple cancer types, with high severity mutations noted in breast cancer, specifically in ductal and lobular neoplasms. These mutations are associated with improved overall survival in cancer patients, suggesting a potential prognostic significance (Abd2024Involvement). The FAM170B gene is also involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways, which are crucial in the biological processes of breast cancer (Abd2024Involvement).

The long non-coding RNA FAM170B-AS1, associated with the FAM170B gene, is upregulated in breast cancer patients and correlates with cancer stage, grade, and lymph node metastasis. It interacts with microRNAs such as hsa-miR-1202 and hsa-miR-146a-5p, potentially affecting the expression of genes like KRAS and EGFR, which are involved in cancer progression and therapy resistance (Abd2024Involvement). FAM170B-AS1 is proposed as a potential predictive marker for breast cancer, showing higher specificity and sensitivity than traditional markers like CEA and CA15.3 (Abd2024Involvement).

## Interactions
FAM170B is a protein that plays a significant role in the acrosome reaction during fertilization in mice. It interacts with GOPC (Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing protein), a protein involved in acrosome formation. This interaction is supported by co-localization studies and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that FAM170B may contribute to acrosome biogenesis through its interaction with GOPC (Li2015FAM170B). The presence of a coiled-coil domain in FAM170B is hypothesized to facilitate this interaction, which is crucial for the acrosome reaction and successful fertilization (Li2015FAM170B). Blocking FAM170B with an antibody has been shown to reduce the acrosome reaction and inhibit fertilization, highlighting the importance of its interaction with GOPC in these processes (Li2015FAM170B). These findings suggest that FAM170B's interactions are essential for its function in the acrosomal matrix and its role in fertilization.
