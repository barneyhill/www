# RNF8

## Overview
RNF8 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 8, a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms. The protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which facilitates its interaction with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain that is essential for recognizing phosphopeptides at DNA damage sites. RNF8 plays a pivotal role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination by ubiquitinating histones, thereby recruiting repair proteins necessary for maintaining genomic stability. It is also involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cancer progression, through its interactions with multiple proteins. Alterations in RNF8 expression or function have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it can act as both a tumor promoter and suppressor depending on the context (Huen2007RNF8; Kuang2016RNF8; Lu2012The).

## Structure
RNF8 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in DNA damage response and ubiquitination processes. The protein contains a RING finger domain at its carboxy terminus, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain follows a C3HC4 pattern of cysteine and histidine residues, enabling interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as UBC13 (Plans2005The; Zhou2019The).

Adjacent to the RING finger domain is a coiled-coil region, which plays a role in the protein's structural stability and interactions (Plans2005The). Near the amino terminus, RNF8 features a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, known for recognizing phosphopeptides in specific sequence contexts. This domain is essential for RNF8's role in DNA damage response, as it mediates binding to phosphopeptides and facilitates the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (Huen2007RNF8).

The quaternary structure of RNF8 involves the formation of a stable homodimer, which can simultaneously bind two Ubc13~Ub complexes. This dimerization is important for its function in DNA repair signaling, as it enhances the catalytic activity of Ubc13 (Hodge2016RNF8). The protein's structure and domain architecture are integral to its role in maintaining genomic stability and facilitating DNA repair processes.

## Function
RNF8 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response and repair processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination (HR) by ubiquitinating histones H2A and H2AX at DSB sites. This ubiquitination is essential for the recruitment of repair proteins such as BRCA1, RAP80, and RNF168, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Lu2012The; Wang2007Ubc13Rnf8). RNF8 also interacts with the MRN complex, specifically ubiquitinating Nbs1, which facilitates its recruitment to DSB sites and promotes HR-mediated repair (Lu2012The).

RNF8 is active in the nucleus, particularly at sites of DNA damage, where it forms ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) by promoting the ubiquitination of histones. This process is vital for the accumulation of checkpoint proteins and the proper functioning of the G2/M checkpoint, preventing cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis (Huen2007RNF8). The protein's FHA and RING domains are essential for its function, with the FHA domain facilitating its localization to DNA damage sites (Huen2007RNF8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RNF8 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, RNF8 is overexpressed in highly metastatic cell lines, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitating tumor progression and metastasis. This overexpression is linked to the inactivation of GSK-3β and activation of β-catenin signaling pathways, contributing to poor survival outcomes (Kuang2016RNF8). Conversely, RNF8 deficiency is associated with increased genomic instability and tumorigenesis, as seen in mouse models where its absence leads to spontaneous mammary tumors and increased DNA double-strand breaks (Zhou2019The).

RNF8 also plays a role in regulating Notch signaling, where its deficiency results in elevated Notch signaling, contributing to breast cancer development by promoting luminal cell-fate commitment and proliferation (Li2018Ubiquitin). In adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) associated with HTLV-1 infection, RNF8 is down-regulated, leading to genomic instability and promoting viral replication (Zhi2020RNF8). These findings highlight RNF8's dual role in both promoting and suppressing tumorigenesis, depending on its expression and functional context.

## Interactions
RNF8, a ring finger protein, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response by interacting with various proteins. It interacts with MDC1 through its FHA domain, which is crucial for its localization to chromatin following DNA damage. This interaction is phospho-specific and facilitates the recruitment of other repair proteins such as BRCA1 and 53BP1 to DNA damage sites (Huen2007RNF8; Zhou2019The). RNF8 also interacts with UBC13, an E2 conjugating enzyme, to catalyze the ubiquitination of histones like H2AX, which is essential for the accumulation of checkpoint proteins at DNA break sites (Huen2007RNF8; Hodge2016RNF8).

RNF8 forms complexes with proteins such as YBX1, promoting its ubiquitination, which is linked to cancer cell metastasis (Liu2022A). It also interacts with transcription factors like RXRα and ERα, acting as a transcriptional coregulator in tumor development (Zhou2019The). Additionally, RNF8 binds directly to SUMO2/3, promoting cell survival following DNA damage (Liang2017Direct). These interactions highlight RNF8's multifaceted role in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cancer progression.
