# P4HA3

## Overview
P4HA3 is a gene that encodes the prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 3, a critical component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme complex. This enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and plays a pivotal role in collagen biosynthesis by hydroxylating proline residues, a modification essential for the stability of the collagen triple helix (Shi2021Collagen). The activity of the P4HA3-encoded protein is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues, impacting processes such as wound healing and tissue repair (Zhang2023P4HA3). Beyond its physiological roles, P4HA3 is implicated in cancer progression, particularly through its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interactions with transcription factors that regulate its expression (Wang2020Prolyl; Song2018P4HA3). The gene's expression levels are associated with various cancers, making it a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention (Wu2023Systematic; Yu2024Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
P4HA3 encodes the alpha subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in collagen biosynthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, a post-translational modification essential for the stability of the collagen triple helix (Shi2021Collagen). The hydroxylation process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, where P4HA3 is active, ensuring proper collagen formation and contributing to the structural integrity and strength of various tissues (Shi2021Collagen).

In healthy human cells, P4HA3 is involved in maintaining the extracellular matrix and tissue homeostasis through its role in collagen biosynthesis (Zhang2023P4HA3). The enzyme's activity is vital for the proper folding and stability of collagen, impacting the overall strength and resilience of connective tissues. Although P4HA3 is primarily studied in the context of cancer, its fundamental role in collagen synthesis suggests its importance in normal physiological processes, such as wound healing and tissue repair (Zhang2023P4HA3). The regulation of P4HA3 expression and activity is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing pathological conditions associated with collagen dysregulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the P4HA3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. P4HA3 is significantly overexpressed in several tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), gastric cancer (GC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages (Wu2023Systematic; Shi2021Collagen; Yu2024Comprehensive). In gastric cancer, elevated P4HA3 expression correlates with poorer histological grades and advanced tumor stages, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Yu2024Comprehensive). The gene's overexpression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, contributing to cancer progression through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and alterations in the tumor microenvironment (Wu2023Systematic; Shi2021Collagen).

P4HA3 is also associated with immune-related pathways and immune cell infiltration, influencing the tumor immune microenvironment and potentially impacting the effectiveness of immunotherapy (Wu2023Systematic). Its expression is negatively correlated with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), suggesting that higher P4HA3 levels may predict a less favorable response to immunotherapy (Yu2024Comprehensive). These findings highlight P4HA3 as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
P4HA3, or prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 3, is a component of the prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzyme complex, which is essential for collagen synthesis. This enzyme complex is typically composed of two α-subunits and two β-subunits, with P4HA3 serving as one of the α-subunits. The β-subunit is encoded by the P4HB gene, and its presence is necessary for the proper configuration and enzymatic activity of the complex (Shi2021Collagen). 

P4HA3 is involved in interactions that influence cancer progression. It is associated with the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), P4HA3 interacts with proteins involved in EMT, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail. Knockdown of P4HA3 increases E-cadherin levels while decreasing N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail, indicating its role in promoting EMT (Wang2020Prolyl). 

P4HA3 also interacts with transcription factors that regulate its expression. In gastric cancer, the transcription factor Slug (SNAI2) binds to the P4HA3 promoter, enhancing its transcription and contributing to cancer cell motility and invasiveness (Song2018P4HA3).
