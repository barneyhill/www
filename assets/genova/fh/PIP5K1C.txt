# PIP5K1C

## Overview
PIP5K1C is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1 gamma (PIPKIg), which is a kinase involved in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by catalyzing the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a critical lipid molecule involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (Narkis2007Lethal; van2009PIP5Kdriven). PIP5K1C is essential for various physiological functions, including synaptic transmission, pain signaling, and cellular adhesion, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular activities and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wright2014The; van2009PIP5Kdriven). Mutations in PIP5K1C are linked to Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome Type 3, underscoring its clinical significance (Narkis2007Lethal).

## Function
PIP5K1C encodes phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I, gamma (PIPKIg), an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the phosphatidylinositol pathway by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Narkis2007Lethal). PIP2 is a vital lipid molecule involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization (van2009PIP5Kdriven).

In healthy human cells, PIP5K1C is essential for maintaining normal cellular activities that depend on PIP2. It is involved in synaptic transmission, where it regulates the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle proteins and interacts with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 (van2009PIP5Kdriven). PIP5K1C also plays a significant role in pain signaling and sensitization, particularly in dorsal root ganglion neurons, where it generates PIP2 necessary for the activity of pronociceptive receptors and TRPV1 channels (Wright2014The).

The enzyme is active at the plasma membrane and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cellular adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell migration and adhesion (van2009PIP5Kdriven). These functions highlight the importance of PIP5K1C in various physiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIP5K1C gene are associated with Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome Type 3 (LCCS3), a severe form of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by congenital joint contractures, muscle wasting, and atrophy, leading to prenatal death or death shortly after birth due to respiratory failure. The specific mutation identified is a homozygous substitution of aspartic acid with asparagine at amino acid 253 (D253N), which significantly reduces the kinase activity of PIP5K1C, disrupting the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and affecting synaptic vesicle trafficking (Narkis2007Lethal; McCrea2009Mutations; Staiano2015Mendelian).

In addition to its role in LCCS3, PIP5K1C is implicated in pain signaling and sensitization. Alterations in its expression can affect nociceptive signaling pathways, as demonstrated by the use of a small molecule inhibitor, UNC3230, which selectively inhibits PIP5K1C, reducing PIP2 levels and nociceptive sensitization. This suggests that PIP5K1C could be a potential therapeutic target for chronic pain management, offering an alternative to traditional analgesics like opioids (Wright2014The).

## Interactions
PIP5K1C interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the exocyst complex-mediated tethering, where it interacts with Arf6 to facilitate the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of the exocyst complex to membranes, which is necessary for vesicle delivery to the plasma membrane (Maib2021A). 

PIP5K1C is also directly targeted by the tumor-suppressive microRNA miR-4649-5p in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This interaction reduces AKT activation, enhancing the effects of AKT inhibitors and leading to decreased cell growth and migration in TNBC cells (Jonas2023MiR46495p).

In the context of pain signaling, PIP5K1C interacts with the TRPV1 receptor, where it is involved in generating PIP2, a lipid crucial for TRPV1 activity. This interaction is significant for nociceptive signaling and sensitization (Wright2014The). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PIP5K1C in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target.
