# BAX

## Overview
The BAX gene encodes the BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator protein, which is a pivotal pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of damaged cells that could lead to cancer (Basu1998The). Structurally, BAX is characterized by its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers with other Bcl-2 family proteins, influencing the cell's susceptibility to apoptosis (Oltval1993Bcl2). Upon activation, BAX undergoes conformational changes that facilitate its insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it oligomerizes to form pores, leading to cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptotic signaling (Dewson2011Bax; Dewson2009Mechanisms). Beyond its apoptotic functions, BAX also participates in non-apoptotic processes, such as modulating cell proliferation through interactions with nuclear components (Brayer2017The). Clinically, mutations and expression levels of the BAX gene have significant implications in cancer prognosis and treatment, highlighting its role as both a tumor suppressor and a prognostic marker (katkoori2010bax; Rampino1997Somatic).

## Structure
The BAX protein is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, characterized by its complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which includes several important domains such as BH3, BH1, and BH2, crucial for its apoptotic activity (George2007A).

In terms of secondary structure, BAX is composed of nine α-helices. The hydrophobic α5 helix is central to its structure, surrounded by other amphipathic helices, and plays a key role in maintaining the protein's stability and facilitating its oligomerization (Bloch2021The; Westphal2011Molecular). The C-terminal α9 helix acts as a transmembrane domain, anchoring BAX in the mitochondrial outer membrane upon activation (Westphal2011Molecular).

The tertiary structure of BAX involves the folding of these helices into a globular form in its inactive state, with the α9 helix sequestered in a hydrophobic groove, maintaining BAX in the cytosol (Garner2016An). Activation involves significant conformational changes, including the exposure of the N-terminal epitope and the mobilization of the C-terminal helix (Garner2016An).

Quaternary structure involves BAX forming symmetric BH3:groove dimers, which can oligomerize through additional interfaces, such as the α6:α6 interface, to form higher-order structures essential for its apoptotic function (Czabotar2013Bax; Westphal2011Molecular). These oligomeric forms are crucial for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, a key step in apoptosis (George2007A).

## Function
The BAX protein, encoded by the BAX gene, is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis. In healthy human cells, BAX is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by promoting apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress, such as DNA damage. This function is essential for preventing the accumulation of damaged cells, which could lead to cancer (Basu1998The). BAX can form homodimers or heterodimers with other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2, and the balance between these interactions determines a cell's susceptibility to apoptosis (Oltval1993Bcl2).

Beyond its apoptotic role, BAX also has non-apoptotic functions. It is found in the nucleus of interphasic cells, where it associates with chromatin and influences cell proliferation by modulating the expression of CDKN1A, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Nuclear BAX decreases CDKN1A expression, promoting cell proliferation in lung epithelial cells and primary human lung fibroblasts (Brayer2017The). This nuclear function of BAX is particularly significant in tissues undergoing remodeling and proliferation, such as fetal lung tissue and in conditions like lung cancer and fibrosis (Brayer2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BAX gene are implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In colorectal cancers with the microsatellite mutator phenotype (MMP), frameshift mutations in BAX are common and contribute to tumor progression by promoting genomic instability. These mutations occur independently of p53, suggesting BAX acts as a tumor suppressor in these cancers (Müllauer2001Mutations; Rampino1997Somatic). In MMR-deficient tumors, BAX mutations can lead to resistance against apoptosis-inducing therapies, such as death-receptor ligands, which are considered for cancer treatment (LeBlanc2002Tumorcell).

BAX expression levels also have prognostic significance. In transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, higher BAX expression correlates with longer survival, indicating its role as a positive prognostic marker (Hussain2003Proapoptotic). Similarly, in epithelial ovarian cancer, high BAX expression is associated with better progression-free and overall survival (Schuyer2001Reduced). In colorectal cancer, BAX expression serves as both a prognostic and predictive marker, influencing survival outcomes and response to chemotherapy (katkoori2010bax). These findings underscore the importance of BAX in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
BAX, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, interacts with various proteins to regulate apoptosis. It forms symmetric dimers through BH3:groove interactions, which are crucial for its function in apoptosis. These dimers can oligomerize to form apoptotic pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane, facilitating cytochrome c release (Dewson2011Bax; Dewson2009Mechanisms). BAX can also form heterodimers with another pro-apoptotic protein, Bak, through similar interactions, although homodimers are more prevalent (Dewson2011Bax).

BAX interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, which sequester its BH3 domain, preventing its oligomerization and inhibiting apoptosis (Lalier2007Bax; Westphal2011Molecular). The interaction with these proteins involves specific residues that form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Lalier2007Bax).

BAX is activated by BH3-only proteins like tBid and BIM, which induce conformational changes in BAX, exposing its BH3 domain and promoting its insertion into the mitochondrial membrane (Lalier2007Bax; Gavathiotis2008BAX). These interactions are part of a 'hit-and-run' model where tBid activates BAX and then dissociates (Lalier2007Bax).
