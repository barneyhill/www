# TRAPPC2

## Overview
TRAPPC2 is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 2, commonly referred to as sedlin. This protein is a critical component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complex, which plays a significant role in membrane trafficking and autophagy. The TRAPPC2 protein is characterized by a longin-domain fold, a structural feature shared with the regulatory domains of SNARE proteins, suggesting its function as a protein adaptor or regulator within the complex (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). TRAPPC2 is essential for the proper secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, particularly procollagen II, by chondrocytes, and is involved in the regulation of vesicle transport through its interactions with other TRAPP subunits (Brunet2014In; Zong2011The). Mutations in the TRAPPC2 gene are linked to X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT), a disorder affecting bone growth and development, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Zhang2020A; Lou2023Functional).

## Structure
The TRAPPC2 protein, also known as sedlin, is a component of the TRAPP complex involved in membrane trafficking and autophagy. Its crystal structure resembles the amino-terminal regulatory domains of SNARE proteins Sec22 and Ykt6, suggesting a regulatory role or function as a protein adaptor. This structure is characterized by a longin-domain fold, which is common in many trafficking proteins (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). TRAPPC2 interacts with several core TRAPP proteins, including TRAPPC3, TRAPPC4, and TRAPPC5, as well as complex-specific proteins like TRAPPC8 and TRAPPC9, indicating its involvement in the quaternary structure of the TRAPP complex (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC2 is evolutionarily conserved and can functionally replace its yeast homologue, Trs20, highlighting its structural and functional significance (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The protein is also known as MIP-2a, which regulates the transcriptional repressor MBP-1, suggesting potential post-translational modifications that could influence its function (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Variants in the TRAPPC2 gene are linked to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT), a skeletal disorder, which may be related to its role in collagen trafficking (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Function
TRAPPC2, also known as sedlin, is a component of the TRAPP complex, which is involved in membrane trafficking processes essential for cellular function. In healthy human cells, TRAPPC2 plays a critical role in the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins by chondrocytes, particularly in the secretion of procollagen II (PCII). It interacts with the collagen receptor TANGO1 at ER exit sites, promoting the inactivation of the GTPase Sar1. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the proper size of COP II carriers, which transport large PCII fibrils, thereby facilitating efficient collagen secretion (Brunet2014In).

TRAPPC2 is also implicated in the regulation of SNARE function or acts as a protein adaptor, given its structural resemblance to the regulatory domains of SNARE proteins. It is required for the stable attachment of TRAPPC8 and TRAPPC9 to the human TRAPP complex, indicating a conserved function across species (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). Additionally, TRAPPC2 may play a role in autophagy, particularly in cells with high secretion demands, such as chondrocytes, where ER-phagy might be necessary to manage unfolded proteins and prevent ER stress (Brunet2014In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC2 gene are primarily associated with X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda (SEDT), a skeletal disorder characterized by disproportionate short stature and early onset of degenerative osteoarthritis. This condition results from defects in bone growth and development due to mutations that often lead to premature termination of translation or misfolding of the TRAPPC2 protein, resulting in its degradation and loss of function (Zhang2020A; Lou2023Functional). 

Specific mutations, such as the D47Y mutation, impair the interaction of TRAPPC2 with other TRAPP subunits like TRAPPC8 and TRAPPC9, disrupting TRAPP complex formation and leading to the SEDT phenotype (Zong2011The). Other mutations, including a 3-bp deletion in an intron of TRAPPC2, have been shown to cause aberrant splicing, resulting in the deletion of exon 5 and the production of aberrantly spliced messages, which are likely pathogenic (Davis2013Whole).

The TRAPPC2 gene is also crucial for collagen secretion, and its loss-of-function variants can lead to defective structures of vertebral bodies and epiphyses of long bones, contributing to the clinical manifestations of SEDT (Won2019Novel).

## Interactions
TRAPPC2, also known as trafficking protein particle complex subunit 2, is a key adaptor protein within the TRAPP complex, which is involved in vesicle transport. TRAPPC2 interacts with several TRAPP subunits, including TRAPPC9, TRAPPC8, TRAPPC10, TRAPPC3, TRAPPC4, and TRAPPC5, facilitating the formation of TRAPPII and TRAPPIII complexes in mammalian cells (Zong2011The; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). 

Mutations in TRAPPC2, such as the D47Y missense mutation, disrupt its interactions with TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC8, indicating the critical role of aspartate 47 in these interactions (Zong2011The). TRAPPC2 cannot simultaneously bind TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC8, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Zong2011The). TRAPPC2's interaction with TRAPPC8 is particularly strong, as evidenced by increased TRAPPC2 protein levels when co-expressed with TRAPPC8, suggesting that TRAPPC8 may slow TRAPPC2 degradation (Zong2011The).

TRAPPC2 is also involved in the export of collagen from the endoplasmic reticulum by enhancing the inactivation of the GTPase Sar1, which prevents membrane constriction and allows vesicle growth (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These interactions highlight TRAPPC2's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the TRAPP complexes, with implications for understanding the molecular basis of associated diseases (Zong2011The).
