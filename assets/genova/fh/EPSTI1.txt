# EPSTI1

## Overview
EPSTI1 (epithelial stromal interaction 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune response regulation and cellular interactions, particularly within the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by EPSTI1 is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Kim2018Regulation). EPSTI1 is notably expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, small intestine, and lymphatic tissue, indicating its involvement in normal physiological processes beyond its role in cancer and immune responses (Kim2018Regulation). The protein plays a significant role in macrophage activation and polarization, influencing the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states (Kim2018Regulation). EPSTI1's interactions with proteins such as valosin-containing protein (VCP) and caspase 8 highlight its involvement in cancer progression and apoptosis regulation, making it a critical factor in the study of breast cancer and other malignancies (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast; Li2013Identification).

## Function
EPSTI1 (epithelial stromal interaction 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating immune responses and cellular interactions. In healthy human cells, EPSTI1 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, small intestine, salivary gland, testes, lymphatic tissue, and placenta, suggesting its involvement in normal physiological processes beyond its role in cancer and immune responses (Kim2018Regulation).

EPSTI1 plays a significant role in macrophage activation and polarization. It is highly expressed in macrophages when exposed to stimuli such as IFNγ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are associated with classical activation or M1 polarization. This indicates that EPSTI1 is crucial in modulating the balance between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage states (Kim2018Regulation). The protein encoded by EPSTI1 contains three coiled-coil domains, which may facilitate protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Kim2018Regulation).

In the context of immune cell infiltration, EPSTI1 expression is associated with increased infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and CD8 T cells, particularly promoting the presence of M1 macrophages known for their tumor-preventing activities (Wang2022EPSTI1).

## Clinical Significance
EPSTI1 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels influencing tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, EPSTI1 is significantly upregulated, particularly in invasive carcinomas and basal-like subtypes, which are associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation is linked to enhanced tumor cell migration, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast; Gabrovska2011Development). EPSTI1 interacts with apoptotic proteins, affecting pathways like the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and its modulation can alter cell viability and apoptotic responses in breast cancer cells (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), EPSTI1 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation and migration, indicating an oncogenic role. Conversely, in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), EPSTI1 is downregulated and appears to have tumor-suppressive functions (Fan2021Contrasting). The gene's expression also affects epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer, with specific splicing events being crucial for cancer cell motility and invasion (Rao2022Posttranscriptional). These findings highlight the contrasting roles of EPSTI1 in different cancers, enhancing malignancy in some while suppressing it in others.

## Interactions
EPSTI1 interacts with several proteins that play significant roles in cancer progression and apoptosis regulation. One of the key interactions is with the valosin-containing protein (VCP), where EPSTI1 binds to the N-terminal half of VCP, specifically the amino terminal 187 residual stretch (VCP-N187). This interaction is crucial for the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in cancer progression, by promoting the degradation of IκBα, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 (Li2013Identification).

EPSTI1 also interacts with apoptotic proteins such as caspase 8, which is central to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This interaction is supported by a strong co-expression profile with CASP8 in breast tissues, suggesting a role in apoptosis regulation (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast). Additionally, EPSTI1 interacts with AKT1, an antiapoptotic protein, indicating its involvement in modulating apoptosis through the PI3K pathway (CapdevilaBusquets2015Breast).

These interactions highlight EPSTI1's role in both promoting cancer cell invasion and regulating apoptotic responses, making it a significant factor in breast cancer progression and metastasis.
