# NOC2L

## Overview
NOC2L is a gene located on chromosome 1p36.33 that encodes the NOC2-like nucleolar associated transcriptional repressor protein, also known as NIR, NET7, NET15, and PPP1R112. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus and functions as an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), playing a critical role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression. By binding to histone tails, NOC2L prevents acetylation, leading to a condensed chromatin state that restricts RNA polymerase access to DNA, thereby inhibiting transcription (Lu2023Unmasking). NOC2L is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration, through its interactions with key proteins such as TP53, Aurora B, and MDM2 (Lu2023Unmasking). Its regulatory functions extend to rRNA biogenesis and modulation of P53-dependent pathways, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and preeclampsia (Zhao2023Preeclampsiaassociated; Lu2023Unmasking).

## Structure
The NOC2L protein, also known as NIR, NET7, NET15, and PPP1R112, is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1p36.33. It is a protein of 84,919 Da, consisting of 749 amino acids in humans (Lu2023Unmasking). The protein structure includes two INHAT function domains at the N terminus (amino acids 25-134) and C terminus (amino acids 633-749), a conserved NOC2 domain (amino acids 327-622), and a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS) domain (amino acids 645-666) (Lu2023Unmasking). The NoLS is predicted to be the sequence FPEIKRRK-MADRKDEDRKQFKD (Lu2023Unmasking).

NOC2L is primarily located in the nucleolus, with a small amount found in the nucleoplasm (Lu2023Unmasking). It functions as an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) by binding to histone tails, preventing acetylation and leading to a condensed chromatin state (Lu2023Unmasking). NOC2L interacts with core histones and nucleosomes through its INHAT domains (Lu2023Unmasking). The protein is expressed widely across various tissues and throughout embryonic development (Lu2023Unmasking). The context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The NOC2L gene encodes a protein that functions as a novel inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase (INHAT), playing a crucial role in regulating histone acetylation independently of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Lu2023Unmasking). NOC2L inhibits histone acetylation by binding to histone tails, preventing the interaction between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histones, which results in a condensed chromatin state that limits RNA polymerase access to DNA and inhibits transcription (Lu2023Unmasking). This regulation is essential for controlling gene transcription and expression, impacting various cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (Lu2023Unmasking).

NOC2L is primarily located in the nucleolus but can also be found in the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with several key proteins, including TP53, TP63, Aurora B, MDM2, RB, and EZH2 (Lu2023Unmasking). It acts as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in rRNA biogenesis, particularly in the processing of 18S, 28S, and 5.8S rRNA (Lu2023Unmasking). NOC2L's interaction with P53 is significant, as it modulates P53-dependent apoptosis and cellular growth by inhibiting histone acetylation at P53-targeted gene promoters and affecting the acetylation levels of P53 itself (Lu2023Unmasking).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOC2L gene have been implicated in the progression of various cancers. NOC2L acts as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor P53, and its increased expression is associated with poorer overall survival in several cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Lu2023Unmasking). In colorectal cancer, NOC2L is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by interacting with the retinoblastoma protein (RB), leading to its degradation and ubiquitination (Lu2023Unmasking). In breast cancer, NOC2L interacts with Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to promote methylation of the FOXO3 promoter region, resulting in the downregulation of the tumor suppressor FOXO3 (Lu2023Unmasking).

In the context of preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition, NOC2L is significantly downregulated in affected tissues. This downregulation is associated with impaired trophoblast cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Zhao2023Preeclampsiaassociated). The FEZF1-AS1/ELAVL1/NOC2L signaling axis is crucial in regulating these cellular processes, highlighting NOC2L's potential as a therapeutic target for preeclampsia (Zhao2023Preeclampsiaassociated).

## Interactions
NOC2L, also known as NIR, NET7, NET15, and PPP1R112, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with histone tails to inhibit histone acetylation by preventing the binding of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to histones, functioning independently of histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Lu2023Unmasking). NOC2L forms a complex with Aurora B kinase and the tumor suppressor protein P53, facilitating the phosphorylation of P53 at specific sites, which represses P53's transcriptional activity and its role in apoptosis (Lu2023Unmasking). It also interacts with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilizing the P53-MDM2 complex and promoting MDM2-mediated repression of P53 (Lu2023Unmasking).

NOC2L negatively regulates TAp63 by interacting with its oligomerization domain, with this interaction being cell cycle-dependent (Lu2023Unmasking). In cancer progression, NOC2L interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), promoting RB degradation and EZH2-mediated methylation, respectively, which are implicated in tumorigenesis (Lu2023Unmasking). In the context of preeclampsia, NOC2L interacts with the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1, which stabilizes NOC2L mRNA, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis in trophoblast cells (Zhao2023Preeclampsiaassociated). These interactions highlight NOC2L's role in regulating key cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
