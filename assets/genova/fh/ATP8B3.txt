# ATP8B3

## Overview
ATP8B3 is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B3, which is a member of the P4-ATPase family, a subclass of P-type ATPases. These proteins are integral membrane proteins involved in the translocation of phospholipids across cellular membranes, contributing to the maintenance of membrane asymmetry. ATP8B3 is specifically expressed in the testes, where it plays a crucial role in sperm development and function, particularly in the acrosome of sperm cells. The protein is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is essential for the redistribution of phospholipids, a process vital for sperm capacitation and fertility. Disruptions in ATP8B3 function can lead to impaired sperm function and reduced fertility, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Gong2009Expression).

## Structure
ATP8B3 is a P4-ATPase, a type of P-type ATPase, characterized by its ability to transport phospholipids across cellular membranes. The protein is composed of 1243 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 141 kDa (Harris2003FIC1). It is predicted to have ten transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-terminus located in the cytoplasm, aligning with the structural features typical of P-type ATPases (Harris2003FIC1). The protein includes a large intracellular loop containing P-type ATPase-specific sequences and an ATP-binding site, with a consensus motif DKTGT(L,I,V,M)(T,I,S) where the aspartic acid residue is phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle (Gong2009Expression).

ATP8B3 is part of Class 1b P4-ATPases, which also includes ATP8B1, ATP8B2, and ATP8B4. It consists of four main domains: the nucleotide (N) domain, the phosphorylation (P) domain, the actuator (A) domain, and the membrane (M) domain. The N-domain binds ATP, the P-domain contains a conserved aspartic acid residue that undergoes transient phosphorylation, and the A-domain facilitates dephosphorylation. The M-domain, predicted to contain 10 transmembrane segments, serves as the pathway for lipid substrate translocation (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP8B3 is expressed specifically in the testes, suggesting a specialized role in this tissue (Gong2009Expression).

## Function
ATP8B3 is a testis-specific P-type ATPase, primarily expressed in germ cells, particularly in haploid spermatids within the murine testis (Gong2009Expression). It is a Type IV P-type ATPase involved in the redistribution of phospholipids in the acrosome of sperm cells, a process crucial for sperm function and fertility (Gong2009Expression). The protein encoded by ATP8B3 is localized in developing acrosomes and exhibits ATPase activity, which is characteristic of P-type ATPases that mediate ATPase-dependent transport of substrates, such as ions, across biological membranes (Gong2009Expression).

ATP8B3 plays a significant role in acrosome development and sperm function during fertilization by maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating changes in ion concentrations, pH, and membrane compositions (Gong2009Expression). Disruption of the Atp8b3 gene in mice leads to abnormal phospholipid distribution in sperm, resulting in reduced fertility due to impaired sperm binding and penetration of the egg's zona pellucida (Gong2009Expression). The gene's expression is likely regulated indirectly by androgens through interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells (Gong2009Expression).

## Clinical Significance
ATP8B3 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly linked to its mutations are not well-documented. In cancer treatment, ATP8B3 is one of eight genes proposed to regulate the response to oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug used in colorectal cancer (CRC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATP8B3 have been correlated with increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin therapy, suggesting that these SNPs could serve as predictive markers for treatment effectiveness in CRC patients (Yazlovitskaya2023Type).

In reproductive health, ATP8B3 is expressed in the testis and is involved in sperm capacitation. Studies in mice have shown that ATP8B3 -/- sperm cells exhibit abnormalities in capacitation, which may affect fertilization efficiency. These abnormalities include premature exposure of phosphatidylserine, potentially impairing the sperm's ability to bind to the zona pellucida of the oocyte (Folmer2009P4).

Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified the rs45574836 SNP in ATP8B3 as being associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). This SNP leads to a missense mutation, and carriers of the risk alleles may have a higher vulnerability to vomiting (Nishizawa2023GenomeWide).
