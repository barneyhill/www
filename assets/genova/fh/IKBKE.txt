# IKBKE

## Overview
The IKBKE gene encodes the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε), a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses. As a kinase, IKKε is involved in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune response regulation and antiviral defense mechanisms. It achieves this by phosphorylating key proteins such as IκBα, leading to the activation of NF-κB, and interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, which are vital for the transcription of type I interferon genes (tenOever2007Multiple; Häcker2006Regulation). IKKε is also implicated in cancer progression, where it interacts with various proteins to promote cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in malignancies such as breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (Liu2018The; Yin2019Advances). The gene's expression is primarily found in lymphoid tissues and can be upregulated in response to cytokines and microbial products, highlighting its dynamic role in immune responses (Wang2013Contribution).

## Structure
The IKBKE protein, also known as inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit epsilon, is characterized by a significant degree of intrinsic disorder, which is crucial for its function in the innate antiviral immune response. Approximately 25.4% of its residues are predicted to be disordered, with 10 predicted disordered regions, the longest comprising 43 residues (Xue2014Intrinsic). This intrinsic disorder facilitates its interaction with multiple proteins, including MAVS/IPS-1, AZI2, SIKE1, TICAM1/TRIF, IRF-3, TOPORS, and CYLD, which are important for its role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway (Xue2014Intrinsic).

IKBKE contains specific structural motifs such as one anchor-induced binding site (AIBS) located at residues 679-698 and two α-MoRFs (molecular recognition features) at residues 495-512 and 542-559, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Xue2014Intrinsic). Despite the lack of detailed structural information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, IKBKE is known to possess a kinase domain, which is typical of serine/threonine protein kinases and is responsible for its enzymatic activity (Pei2023Computational). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is common in kinases and plays a role in regulating its activity (Pei2023Computational).

## Function
The IKBKE gene encodes the IKKε protein, a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in immune and inflammatory responses. In healthy human cells, IKKε plays a pivotal role in the activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune response regulation. It phosphorylates the NF-kB inhibitor protein IκBα, leading to its degradation and allowing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate immune response genes (Verhelst2013IκB; Häcker2006Regulation).

IKKε is also involved in the activation of interferon regulatory factors IRF3 and IRF7, which are crucial for the transcription of type I interferon genes and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This activation is vital for antiviral defense mechanisms, as it leads to the production of type I interferons in response to viral infections (tenOever2007Multiple; Reyahi2023An). IKKε functions as part of a dimer with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to phosphorylate and activate the STING pathway, which is essential for detecting viral DNA and initiating an immune response (Reyahi2023An).

IKKε is primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues and peripheral blood leukocytes, but its expression can be rapidly upregulated in other cell types in response to cytokines and microbial products (Verhelst2013IκB; Wang2013Contribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IKBKE gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, IKBKE is overexpressed in several malignancies, including breast cancer, glioma, esophageal squamous cell cancer, gastric cancer, and renal clear cell carcinoma. Its overexpression is associated with increased tumor proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Yin2019Advances). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), IKBKE is amplified in about 30% of cases, contributing to survival signaling through the NF-κB pathway. Targeting IKBKE with inhibitors like CYT387 has shown potential in impairing TNBC growth by disrupting NF-κB and STAT activation (Barbie2014Targeting).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IKBKE is upregulated and promotes MYC expression, contributing to cell survival. Inhibition of IKBKE leads to apoptosis and reduced viability of AML cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2018The). Additionally, a rare genetic variant in IKBKE has been linked to recurrent HSV-2 meningitis, indicating its role in immune response and susceptibility to viral infections (Reyahi2023An). These findings underscore the importance of IKBKE in disease progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
IKBKE, also known as IKKε, is involved in various physical interactions with proteins that play significant roles in cancer progression and immune response. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IKBKE interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), where mutant EGFR phosphorylates IKBKE at tyrosine residues Y153 and Y179. This phosphorylation is crucial for IKBKE's kinase activity, which activates downstream signaling pathways such as AKT and NF-κB, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Challa2016IKBKE).

IKBKE also interacts with and phosphorylates several proteins involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, including TRAF2, enhancing its ubiquitination and recruiting the IKK complex to activate NF-κB (Yin2019Advances). It phosphorylates AKT at Ser473 and Thr308, crucial for AKT activation, and interacts with FOXO3a, leading to its degradation and inhibition of apoptosis (Yin2019Advances).

In the context of antiviral immunity, IKBKE phosphorylates STAT1, facilitating the formation of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers necessary for the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (tenOever2007Multiple). IKBKE also interacts with TSC1, phosphorylating it and affecting its stability, which influences the mTOR/S6K pathway (GÖKTUNA2018IKBKE).
