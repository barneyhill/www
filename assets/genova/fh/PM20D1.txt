# PM20D1

## Overview
PM20D1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme peptidase M20 domain containing 1, which is involved in the metabolism of N-acyl amino acids (NAAs), a class of bioactive lipids. This enzyme functions as both a synthase and hydrolase, facilitating the bidirectional conversion of NAAs, which are crucial for regulating energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Long2018Ablation; Kim2020A). PM20D1 is categorized as a metabolic enzyme and is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma, enhancing its enzymatic activity (Kim2020A). The enzyme is secreted from various tissues, including brown fat and liver, and is involved in the production of NAAs that promote energy expenditure (Kim2020A). Genetic variations and environmental factors influence PM20D1 expression, impacting its role in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, such as obesity and Alzheimer's disease (Benson2019Natural; Wang2020Longitudinal).

## Function
The PM20D1 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of N-acyl amino acids (NAAs), which are bioactive lipids involved in energy metabolism and thermogenesis. PM20D1 functions as both a synthase and hydrolase, catalyzing the bidirectional synthesis and hydrolysis of NAAs. This activity is significant in regulating energy expenditure and maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Long2018Ablation; Kim2020A).

In humans, PM20D1 is associated with lipoproteins in plasma, particularly high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which co-activate its enzymatic activity. This interaction enhances the conversion of specific NAAs, influencing cellular respiration and energy homeostasis (Kim2020A). The enzyme is secreted from tissues such as brown fat, liver, kidney, and intestine, and is involved in the production of NAAs like N-oleoyl phenylalanine and N-oleoyl leucine, which are linked to increased energy expenditure (Kim2020A).

PM20D1's activity is also regulated by genetic variations that affect its expression, particularly in adipocytes, where it is influenced by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). This regulation is important for thermogenesis and may impact the risk of obesity and metabolic diseases (Benson2019Natural).

## Clinical Significance
The PM20D1 gene has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in metabolic regulation and its association with neurodegenerative conditions. Alterations in PM20D1 expression have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), where changes in DNA methylation at the PM20D1 locus are associated with disease progression. Hypomethylation of the PM20D1 promoter is observed in early stages of AD, leading to increased expression, while hypermethylation in later stages results in reduced expression, potentially compromising its protective role against AD-related pathologies (Wang2020Longitudinal). 

PM20D1 is also associated with obesity and metabolic disorders. Genetic variations, such as the SNP rs823080, influence PM20D1 expression and are linked to body mass index (BMI) and metabolic traits. The rs823080-A allele is associated with silenced PM20D1 expression, lower BMI, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (Benson2019Natural). Additionally, PM20D1 expression is influenced by environmental factors, such as cold exposure and thiazolidinedione drugs, which can induce its expression in adipose tissues, affecting thermogenesis and energy expenditure (Benson2019Natural). These findings suggest that PM20D1 plays a significant role in both metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.
