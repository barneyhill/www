# PRMT2

## Overview
PRMT2 is a gene that encodes the protein arginine methyltransferase 2, a member of the protein arginine methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of arginine residues on histones and other proteins, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. PRMT2 is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a catalytic core with a SAM-binding domain, which are essential for its function and interactions (Vhuiyan2017PRMT2; Cura2021Structure). The protein acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor and is involved in various cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and alternative splicing (Vhuiyan2017PRMT2; Meyer2007PRMT2). Clinically, PRMT2 has been implicated in cancer, with its expression levels influencing tumor progression and patient outcomes in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Oh2014PRMT2; Hu2020PRMT2).

## Structure
PRMT2 is a member of the protein arginine methyltransferase family, characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein features an N-terminal extension with a 50-residue Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and exhibits a classical SH3 fold with five antiparallel β-strands (Vhuiyan2017PRMT2; Cura2021Structure). The catalytic core of PRMT2 includes a canonical PRMT methylation core with an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-binding domain adopting a Rossmann fold, followed by a β-barrel domain composed of eight strands (Cura2021Structure). The helical dimerization arm connects these domains, facilitating the formation of homodimers, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Cura2021Structure).

PRMT2 exists in several isoforms due to alternative mRNA splicing, with six identified in humans. Four of these isoforms, isolated from breast cancer cells, lack the β-barrel domain containing the dimerization helix-coil and the THW loop, rendering them catalytically inactive (Cura2021Structure). PRMT2 is primarily localized in the nucleus but is also present at low levels in the cytoplasm (Cura2021Structure).

## Function
PRMT2 is a member of the protein arginine methyltransferase family and functions primarily as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) in healthy human cells. It enhances AR-mediated transactivation, particularly in the presence of an AR agonist, by binding to the AR and facilitating its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for its coactivator function (Meyer2007PRMT2). PRMT2 interacts with AR through its C-terminus, while its coactivation function requires the N-terminal part. It is transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner, piggybacking on the agonist-activated AR, as it lacks its own nuclear localization signal (Meyer2007PRMT2).

PRMT2 also plays a role in regulating E2F transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression. It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) to repress E2F activity, which is crucial for controlling the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle (Yoshimoto2006The). PRMT2's methylation activity, although relatively low compared to other PRMTs, is significant in modulating transcription through histone modification, particularly histone H4 (Lakowski2009Kinetic). Additionally, PRMT2 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of the BCL-X gene, influencing cellular responses to inflammation (Vhuiyan2017PRMT2).

## Clinical Significance
PRMT2 (protein arginine methyltransferase 2) has significant clinical implications in cancer, particularly breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In breast cancer, PRMT2 expression is generally decreased in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduction is associated with enhanced DNA repair activity and improved distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in breast cancer patients, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Oh2014PRMT2). PRMT2 also influences cell cycle regulation by modulating the expression of cyclin D1 and p21, which are critical for cell cycle progression and arrest, respectively (Oh2014PRMT2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PRMT2 is aberrantly expressed, promoting tumorigenesis by activating the BCL2 gene through histone methylation. This activity is crucial for maintaining chromatin modifications that support cell proliferation and survival, indicating PRMT2's potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Hu2020PRMT2).

PRMT2 also interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in breast cancer, enhancing ERa-mediated transcriptional activity. This interaction is particularly significant in ERa-positive breast carcinomas, where PRMT2 and its splice variants are more strongly expressed, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and cancer progression (Zhong2011Identification).

## Interactions
PRMT2 (protein arginine methyltransferase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB) to repress E2F transcriptional activity in an RB-dependent manner. This interaction requires the AdoMet binding domain of PRMT2 and is crucial for modulating E2F activity, affecting cell cycle progression (Yoshimoto2006The). PRMT2 also forms a complex with E2F and RB, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Yoshimoto2006The).

PRMT2 acts as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing its transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of PRMT2, while the N-terminal domain is essential for coactivation. PRMT2's coactivator function is influenced by its methyltransferase activity, and it shows synergistic interactions with other coactivators like GRIP1 (Meyer2007PRMT2).

PRMT2 also interacts with splicing factors, including SAM68, influencing alternative splicing regulation. Its SH3 domain is crucial for these interactions, which affect the BCL-X(L)/BCL-X(s) ratio in cells under inflammatory conditions (Vhuiyan2017PRMT2). These interactions highlight PRMT2's role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing.
