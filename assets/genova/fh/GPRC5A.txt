# GPRC5A

## Overview
GPRC5A, or G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member A, is a gene that encodes a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically categorized as a receptor. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs, and it plays a crucial role in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by GPRC5A is involved in modulating key signaling pathways such as cAMP, NF-κB, and STAT3, which are essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation (Hirano2006Novel; Iglesias2023The). GPRC5A is primarily localized in the plasma membrane but is also found in other cellular compartments, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Zhou2014The). Clinically, GPRC5A has been implicated in several cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts, such as non-small cell lung cancer, while promoting tumorigenesis in others, like pancreatic cancer (Lin2024GPRC5A; Zhou2016GPRC5A). Its expression and interactions make it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Lin2024GPRC5A).

## Structure
GPRC5A is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helix domains, an extracellular N-terminal domain, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Iglesias2023The). The N-terminal domain of GPRC5A is notably short, ranging from 20 to 53 amino acids, and lacks the Venus fly trap (VFT) ligand-binding domain typical of class C receptors, suggesting that its ligand might be a small molecule or ion (Iglesias2023The). The predicted 3D structure of GPRC5A, generated by AlphaFold 2, is available, indicating its structural features (Iglesias2023The).

The protein is composed of 357 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 40.3 kDa (Wei2021IMUP). It is a stable protein with an instability index of 38.49 and is predominantly hydrophobic, as indicated by a grand average of hydrophobic value of 0.310 (Wei2021IMUP). The protein contains 29 negatively charged amino acid residues (Asp + Glu) and 32 positively charged amino acid residues (Arg + Lys), with a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.39 (Wei2021IMUP). There is no evidence of conserved serines and threonines, suggesting limited S/T dependent phosphorylation, and no consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation or palmitoylation sites (Kurtenbach2011Molecular).

## Function
GPRC5A, a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a significant role in various cellular signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cAMP signaling, where it forms a feedback loop by downregulating Gsα expression, leading to reduced intracellular cAMP levels (Hirano2006Novel; Zhou2014The). This regulation is crucial for controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis, as GPRC5A expression can decrease cell numbers and increase caspase activity, indicating its anti-apoptotic effects (Hirano2006Novel).

GPRC5A also modulates the NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways, influencing cell survival and inflammation. Knockout studies in mouse lung cells have shown that the absence of GPRC5A results in increased NF-κB activation and persistent STAT3 activation, which are linked to cell transformation and resistance to cell death (Zhou2014The). In the context of EGFR signaling, GPRC5A inhibits EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of EGFR, thereby reducing cell proliferation (Richter2020RhoAC).

In terms of cellular localization, GPRC5A is primarily found in the plasma membrane but is also present in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and extracellular vesicular exosomes, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Zhou2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The GPRC5A gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression and interactions playing significant roles in tumor progression and cell survival. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GPRC5A acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Its deletion is linked to enhanced tumorigenic properties through the Stat3 signaling pathway, particularly in the presence of tobacco carcinogens, leading to lung adenocarcinoma with KRAS mutations (Lin2024GPRC5A; Zhou2014The). In pancreatic cancer, GPRC5A is significantly upregulated, promoting cancer cell growth and migration, and its interaction with the RNA-binding protein HuR is crucial for the efficacy of the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine (Zhou2016GPRC5A).

In breast cancer, GPRC5A's role is complex, with some studies suggesting it may inhibit EGFR signaling, affecting cell adhesion and proliferation (Iglesias2023The). In colorectal cancer, hypoxia-induced HIF-1α upregulates GPRC5A, activating YAP1 and promoting cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis (Iglesias2023The). The gene's expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression in NSCLC, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Lin2024GPRC5A). Overall, GPRC5A's role in cancer is multifaceted, varying by tissue type and tumor stage.

## Interactions
GPRC5A interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It physically interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, specifically affecting the binding of eIF4G1 and eIF4A1 to the mRNA cap, which is crucial for translation initiation. This interaction is mediated through the 71-190 amino acid region of GPRC5A, which is essential for its function in translation regulation (Wang2016GPRC5A). GPRC5A also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), disrupting its dimerization and activation, thereby inhibiting EGFR autophosphorylation and reducing downstream activation of STAT3 (Iglesias2023The).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, GPRC5A mRNA interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR, which binds to the 3′-UTR of GPRC5A mRNA, stabilizing it and increasing protein levels, particularly in response to gemcitabine treatment (Zhou2016GPRC5A). GPRC5A is also involved in interactions with non-coding RNAs, such as miR-103a-3p, which targets its mRNA for degradation (Zhou2014The). These interactions highlight GPRC5A's role in modulating translation and signaling pathways, impacting processes like tumorigenesis and response to chemotherapy.
