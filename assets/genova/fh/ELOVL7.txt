# ELOVL7

## Overview
ELOVL7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7, which is a member of the ELOVL family of enzymes involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the first step in the elongation cycle of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The ELOVL7 protein plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by contributing to the synthesis of fatty acids with chain lengths of 18-22 carbons, which are vital for maintaining cell membrane integrity and function (Wang2023A; Deák2019Novel). The gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the pancreas, kidney, prostate, and colon, and is implicated in several diseases, including prostate cancer and glioblastoma, through its influence on cell signaling, proliferation, and survival (Wang2023A; Korbecki2022Glioblastoma).

## Function
ELOVL7 (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), which are essential components of lipid metabolism. This enzyme is part of the ELOVL family and is responsible for catalyzing the first step in the elongation cycle of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, contributing to the synthesis of fatty acids with chain lengths of 18-22 carbons (Wang2023A; Deák2019Novel). ELOVL7 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the production of diverse lipids that are crucial for maintaining cell membrane integrity and function (Wang2023A).

ELOVL7 is expressed in most tissues, with high expression levels in the pancreas, kidney, prostate, and colon, and low expression in the lung, ovary, spleen, and thymus (Wang2023A). The enzyme's activity is significant for the formation of triglycerides and phospholipids, which serve as energy reservoirs and integral components of cellular membranes, respectively (Wang2023A). By influencing the structure and fluidity of cellular membranes, ELOVL7 plays a role in cell signaling and membrane protein organization, impacting cell proliferation and survival (Wang2023A).

## Clinical Significance
ELOVL7 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genetic variations. Although no direct causal relationship between ELOVL7 and human disease has been established, single nucleotide polymorphisms in ELOVL7 are associated with early onset Parkinson's disease (Deák2019Novel). In cancer biology, ELOVL7 plays a crucial role in prostate cancer by influencing cancer cell migration and metastasis, contributing to tumor growth and survival through the metabolism of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (Wang2023A).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ELOVL7 expression is lower in tumors compared to the peritumoral area, with a noted decrease in expression in women compared to men (Korbecki2022Glioblastoma). This gender-specific difference in expression may have implications for understanding the biology of GBM and developing personalized therapies (Korbecki2022Glioblastoma). Hypoxic conditions in GBM cells also lead to a reduction in ELOVL7 expression, suggesting that environmental factors within the tumor microenvironment can influence its expression (Korbecki2022Glioblastoma). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ELOVL7 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
ELOVL7, a member of the ELOVL family of fatty acid elongases, is involved in the elongation of long-chain fatty acids. In zebrafish, the Z-FADS protein, which is involved in fatty acid desaturation, has been shown to interact with ELOVL7. This interaction was studied using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, which confirmed the interaction when ELOVL7 was tagged with DsRed at the N terminus. However, no FRET signal was observed when ELOVL7 was tagged with FLAG at the C terminus, suggesting that the interaction may depend on the tagging method used (Chen2013Identification).

ELOVL7 shares structural similarities with TMEM120A, a membrane protein, particularly in their transmembrane domains and CoA binding properties. Both proteins have a 6-TM α-helical barrel structure and possess a conserved HxxHH motif crucial for catalytic activity. This structural similarity suggests potential functional parallels, although specific interactions between ELOVL7 and TMEM120A have not been detailed (Xue2021TMEM120A).

While ELOVL7 is implicated in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in humans have not been extensively documented in the available literature.
