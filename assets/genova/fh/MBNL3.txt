# MBNL3

## Overview
MBNL3 (muscleblind-like splicing regulator 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process in gene expression that allows for the generation of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. The MBNL3 protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by its zinc finger domains, and is categorized as an RNA-binding protein. It plays a significant role in RNA processing, particularly during early developmental stages, where it influences mRNA stability and trafficking. Unlike its paralogs MBNL1 and MBNL2, which promote muscle differentiation, MBNL3 inhibits this process, highlighting its unique function in cellular differentiation and muscle regeneration (NAVVABI2021Altered; Konieczny2017MBNL). MBNL3's interactions with RNA and other proteins are crucial for its role in splicing regulation and polyadenylation, impacting various physiological and pathological processes, including myotonic dystrophy and cancer (Yuan2017The; Grammatikakis2010Identification; Poulos2013Progressive).

## Structure
MBNL3 (muscleblind-like splicing regulator 3) is a protein characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, primarily facilitated through its zinc finger (ZnF) domains. The protein contains four CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, organized into two pairs: ZnF1/2 and ZnF3/4. These domains are crucial for its function in RNA binding and splicing regulation (Grammatikakis2010Identification; Poulos2013Progressive). The ZnF1/2 pair exhibits a higher RNA-binding affinity, while the ZnF3/4 pair is significant for splicing activity (Poulos2013Progressive).

MBNL3 exists in multiple isoforms, with the two main ones being Mbnl3 ZnF1-4 (38 kDa) and Mbnl3 ZnF3/4 (27 kDa). These isoforms differ in their zinc finger motifs and subcellular localization, with the larger isoform found in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and the shorter isoform predominantly cytoplasmic (Poulos2013Progressive). The full-length MBNL3 protein, which includes both ZnF pairs, is essential for its nuclear function, while the truncated isoform containing only the ZnF3/4 pair relocates to the nucleus in certain conditions, such as in Mbnl3 knockout mice (Poulos2013Progressive).

The protein's splicing activation and repression functions are mediated by a 74-amino acid region located between the zinc finger pairs, which is distinct from the RNA-binding domains (Grammatikakis2010Identification). MBNL3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
MBNL3 (muscleblind-like splicing regulator 3) is a protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to produce multiple protein variants. In healthy human cells, MBNL3 plays a crucial role in RNA processing, particularly influencing the splicing patterns of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) during development. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it impacts mRNA stability and trafficking, although it can also relocate to the nucleus in certain isoforms (Konieczny2017MBNL; Sznajder2016Mechanistic).

MBNL3 is expressed predominantly during early developmental stages and is involved in inhibiting muscle differentiation, contrasting with the roles of its paralogs, MBNL1 and MBNL2, which promote differentiation (NAVVABI2021Altered). It has the weakest influence on alternative splicing changes compared to MBNL1 and MBNL2, which is attributed to differences in its sequence and structure (Sznajder2016Mechanistic). Despite its lower splicing activity, MBNL3 is essential for efficient myotube reconstitution following muscle injury, indicating its role in muscle regeneration (Konieczny2017MBNL). MBNL3's involvement in maintaining normal splicing patterns and cellular differentiation highlights its importance in healthy cellular function (NAVVABI2021Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MBNL3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In myotonic dystrophy, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, MBNL3 is sequestered by expanded CUG repeat RNAs, disrupting its normal function. This sequestration contributes to muscle weakness and age-associated muscle wasting observed in the disease (Poulos2013Progressive). MBNL3 deficiency in mice has been linked to age-associated pathologies similar to those seen in myotonic dystrophy type 1, including glucose intolerance, cardiac dysfunction, and cataracts, suggesting its role in these conditions (Choi2016Muscleblindlike).

In cancer, MBNL3 expression is altered in various types. In hepatocellular carcinoma, MBNL3 is upregulated and promotes tumor growth by influencing alternative splicing mechanisms (Yuan2017The). In colorectal cancer, decreased MBNL3 expression is associated with changes in alternative splicing patterns, which may contribute to tumor progression (NAVVABI2021Altered). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MBNL3 in both neuromuscular and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
MBNL3, a muscleblind-like splicing regulator, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence RNA processing events. MBNL3, along with its paralogs MBNL1 and MBNL2, binds to specific RNA motifs to regulate alternative splicing and polyadenylation. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of exon inclusion or skipping, as well as the selection of polyadenylation sites (Batra2014Loss; Grammatikakis2010Identification).

MBNL3 interacts with spliceosomal components or co-regulators, facilitating splicing regulation through protein-protein interactions. The domains required for these interactions are distinct from the RNA-binding domains, suggesting that MBNL3 may mediate its effects through complex formation with other proteins (Grammatikakis2010Identification).

In the context of alternative polyadenylation, MBNL3, along with MBNL1 and MBNL2, binds to RNA targets, influencing the use of proximal and distal polyadenylation sites. This binding is position-dependent and affects the recruitment of 3' end-processing factors, such as Cpsf160 and Cstf2, thereby modulating polyadenylation site selection (Batra2014Loss).

MBNL3's interactions are also implicated in the regulation of RNA-protein interactions under stress conditions, such as TNF-α induced stress, where it is involved in modulating alternative splicing events linked to metabolic disorders (Louis2021Global).
