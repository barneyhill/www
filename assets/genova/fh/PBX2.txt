# PBX2

## Overview
PBX2 is a gene that encodes the PBX homeobox 2 protein, a member of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its homeodomain, a conserved motif that facilitates DNA binding, thereby playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation (Aguado1995The). PBX homeobox 2 is involved in the formation of heterodimeric and trimeric complexes with other proteins, such as HOX and MEIS/Prep family members, which enhance its DNA-binding specificity and affinity (Selleri2004The; van1995Hox). These interactions are essential for regulating gene expression during developmental processes, including cellular differentiation and organogenesis (Monica1991PBX2). Although PBX2 is widely expressed during embryonic development, its function is not critical for normal development or survival in mice, likely due to redundancy with other PBX family members (Selleri2004The). The gene's involvement in various cancers, such as colorectal and cervical cancer, underscores its clinical significance, with potential implications for disease prognosis and susceptibility (Ramachandran2021Association; Hu2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
PBX2 is a homeodomain-containing protein that belongs to the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) family of transcription factors. The protein is characterized by a homeodomain, a conserved protein motif involved in DNA binding, which suggests its role in transcriptional regulation (Aguado1995The). The homeodomain is highly conserved among PBX family members, with PBX2 showing extensive sequence identity with PBX1 and PBX3, particularly within and flanking the homeodomains (Monica1991PBX2; Selleri2004The).

PBX2 can form heterodimers with Hox proteins, enhancing DNA binding affinities and specificities. This interaction is crucial for its function in regulating developmental gene expression (Selleri2004The; van1995Hox). The protein also forms trimeric complexes with Meis/Prep subfamily proteins on DNA sites (Selleri2004The).

The PBX2 gene undergoes differential splicing, resulting in different isoforms, although the specific functional consequences of these variants are not fully understood (Monica1991PBX2; Aguado1995The). The protein's structure includes a serine/threonine-rich C-terminal region, which may be involved in transcriptional activation (Monica1991PBX2). The presence of a GCX trinucleotide repeat encoding a stretch of alanines is also noted, which may play a role in its structural configuration (Monica1991PBX2).

## Function
PBX2 (PBX homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression during development. It is part of the TALE (three amino acid loop extension) family of homeodomain proteins and is involved in forming heterodimeric complexes with other proteins, such as HOX transcription factors, to enhance DNA binding affinities and specificities (Selleri2004The; van1995Hox). These complexes are crucial for processes like cellular differentiation, proliferation, and organogenesis, contributing to the proper formation of tissues and organs (Monica1991PBX2).

PBX2 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene regulation by forming DNA-binding complexes with proteins like HOXA9 and MEIS1, particularly in myeloid cells (Shen1999HOXA9). Despite its widespread expression during embryonic development, PBX2 is not essential for normal development or long-term survival in mice, likely due to functional redundancy with other PBX proteins such as PBX1 and PBX3 (Selleri2004The). This redundancy suggests that while PBX2 contributes to developmental processes, other family members can compensate for its absence, ensuring normal development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PBX2 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer, PBX2 mRNA expression is linked to shorter disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. The expression of PBX2 is lower in colorectal cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its levels correlate with clinical tumor stage (Hu2021Comprehensive). 

In cervical cancer, a specific genomic variant at the PBX2 locus, rs2856437, has been identified as a novel susceptibility locus. This variant is significantly associated with an increased risk of cervical disease, including invasive squamous cervical cancer, with an odds ratio of 1.56, indicating that PBX2 may play a role in cervical cancer susceptibility (Ramachandran2021Association).

Despite its involvement in these cancers, studies in mice have shown that PBX2 is not essential for development or survival, as Pbx2 knockout mice do not exhibit significant phenotypic abnormalities. This suggests that other Pbx family proteins may compensate for the lack of PBX2, highlighting potential redundancy within the family (Selleri2004The).

## Interactions
PBX2 is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It forms cooperative DNA-binding complexes with HOX proteins, such as Hoxb-7 and Hoxb-8, enhancing their DNA-binding specificity and affinity. This interaction is crucial for the specificity of homeotic selector proteins, which are involved in the establishment of body structures (van1995Hox).

PBX2 also interacts with MEIS1 and HOXA9 in myeloid cells, forming trimeric complexes that regulate gene expression. These complexes are formed both in the presence and absence of DNA, with MEIS1 significantly enhancing the binding of PBX2 to HOXA9. This interaction is important for understanding their roles in myeloid leukemic transformation (Shen1999HOXA9).

In addition, PBX2 can modulate the DNA-binding activity of other proteins, such as Engrailed-2, to different target sites, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation and potential implications in oncogenesis (van1995Hox). These interactions highlight the versatile role of PBX2 in cellular processes and its potential impact on development and disease.
