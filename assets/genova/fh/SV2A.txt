# SV2A

## Overview
SV2A is a gene that encodes the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain. As a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), SV2A is characterized by its 12 transmembrane helices, which form a central cavity essential for its function as a transporter (Yamagata2024Structural). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in the brain and is involved in modulating synaptic transmission by interacting with synaptotagmin, a calcium sensor crucial for vesicle exocytosis (Rossi2022Synaptic). SV2A's interactions with other synaptic proteins and its role in maintaining the readily releasable pool of vesicles underscore its importance in synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release (Stout2019The). Clinically, mutations and altered expression of the SV2A gene are associated with epilepsy, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2022Connectivity).

## Structure
The SV2A protein is a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and consists of 12 transmembrane helices, which are organized into two pseudo-symmetrical halves, each containing six helices. These halves form a central cavity, which is crucial for its function as a transporter (Yamagata2024Structural). The protein adopts a canonical MFS fold, with the transmembrane helices contributing to its tertiary structure (Yamagata2024Structural).

The SV2A protein also features a large fourth luminal domain (LD4), which is involved in binding interactions with botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and antiepileptic drugs like levetiracetam (LEV) and brivaracetam (BRV) (Yamagata2024Structural). The binding site for these drugs is located at the base of the central cavity, with specific aromatic residues forming the binding pocket (Yamagata2024Structural).

Post-translational modifications of SV2A include glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, which enhances its binding interactions (Yamagata2024Structural). The protein can exist in both monomeric and dimeric states, although the functional relevance of the dimeric form is debated (Liu2024Recognition; Yamagata2024Structural).

## Function
SV2A (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A) is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the brain. It is ubiquitously expressed in the brain and is found in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, playing a significant role in synaptic transmission by modulating vesicle exocytosis (Stout2019The; Rossi2022Synaptic). SV2A interacts with synaptotagmin, a calcium sensor, which is important for calcium-induced vesicular fusion, although SV2A itself is not a calcium transporter (Rossi2022Synaptic). This interaction is specific and calcium-dependent, mediated by the cytosolic amino terminus of SV2A, and is crucial for regulating the abundance of synaptotagmin in synaptic vesicles (Rossi2022Synaptic).

SV2A is involved in maintaining the readily releasable pool of vesicles during calcium-induced exocytosis, ensuring vesicles are in a fusion-competent state (Rossi2022Synaptic). It also plays a role in vesicle trafficking, ensuring that vesicles are properly positioned for fusion and recycled after neurotransmission (Stout2019The). The absence of SV2A leads to decreased calcium-induced neurotransmission and altered synaptic facilitation, indicating its role in modulating calcium sensitivity (Stout2019The). SV2A's precise regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, which is essential for normal brain function (Bartholome2017Puzzling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SV2A gene are significantly associated with epilepsy. Specific mutations, such as the homozygous R383Q missense mutation, lead to severe symptoms including infantile-onset intractable epilepsy. Other rare heterozygous variants like R570C and G660R have been identified in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, indicating a link between SV2A mutations and treatment resistance (Zhang2022Connectivity). The L174Q mutation in SV2A affects GABA release in the amygdala, contributing to increased seizure susceptibility (Tokudome2016A).

SV2A expression levels are also crucial in epilepsy. Reduced expression is observed in epileptic foci of patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, focal cortical dysplasia, and tuberous sclerosis complex (Bartholome2017Puzzling; Zhang2022Connectivity). In animal models, decreased SV2A expression correlates with increased seizure activity and resistance to certain antiepileptic drugs, although levetiracetam remains effective due to its specific targeting of SV2A (Löscher2016Synaptic).

In a chicken model, a mutation causing abnormal splicing of SV2A leads to photosensitive epilepsy, highlighting the gene's role across species (Douaud2011Epilepsy). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SV2A in epilepsy and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SV2A (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for synaptic vesicle dynamics. It interacts with synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), forming nanoclusters on the plasma membrane that are essential for synaptic vesicle recycling. This interaction occurs through the C2B domain of Syt1 and the N-terminal region of SV2A, specifically involving lysine residues K326/K328 on Syt1 and the T84 epitope on SV2A (Small2021SV2ASyt1; Small2022Surface). The SV2A-Syt1 interaction regulates the organization and trafficking of Syt1, influencing its entry into recycling synaptic vesicles (Small2021SV2ASyt1).

SV2A also binds to clathrin adaptor proteins such as AP2-α and EPS15, which are involved in endocytosis. The Y46A mutation in SV2A reduces its binding to these proteins, highlighting the importance of this motif in endocytosis (Yao2010Cotrafficking). SV2A's interaction with these adaptors is crucial for the proper internalization of synaptotagmin and SV2A itself (Yao2010Cotrafficking).

Additionally, SV2A interacts with synaptophysin and synaptogyrin-1, indicating its role in synaptic vesicle protein networks (Wittig2021Crosslinking). These interactions contribute to the regulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release.
