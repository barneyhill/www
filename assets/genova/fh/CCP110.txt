# CCP110

## Overview
CCP110 is a gene that encodes the centriolar coiled-coil protein 110, a crucial component in the regulation of centrosome function and ciliogenesis. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in controlling centriole duplication and length, which are essential for proper cell division and genomic stability. CP110 acts as a suppressor of ciliogenesis by capping the distal ends of centrioles, thereby preventing premature cilia formation. This regulatory function is vital for the timing of ciliogenesis, as CP110 must be removed to initiate cilia formation. The protein interacts with various partners, including CEP290 and CEP97, forming complexes that influence centriole growth and cilia assembly. Dysregulation of CCP110 has been linked to ciliopathies and cancer, underscoring its importance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2013USP33; Yadav2016Centrosomal; Liu2021NudCL2).

## Function
CP110, or centriolar coiled-coil protein 110, plays a critical role in centrosome function and ciliogenesis in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of centriole duplication and length, ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability (Li2013USP33). CP110 caps the distal ends of both mother and daughter centrioles, acting as a suppressor of ciliogenesis by preventing premature cilia formation (Yadav2016Centrosomal; Liu2021NudCL2). This capping function is crucial for the timing of ciliogenesis, as CP110 must be removed from the mother centriole to allow axoneme outgrowth, marking the initiation of cilia formation (Liu2021NudCL2).

CP110 interacts with various proteins, including CEP290, to regulate ciliogenesis. It suppresses primary cilia formation by antagonizing CEP290, which is involved in promoting ciliogenesis through the recruitment of Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for cilia assembly (Tsang2008CP110; Liu2021NudCL2). CP110 is also involved in the assembly of subdistal appendages and ciliary vesicle docking, which are essential early steps in cilia formation (Yadav2016Centrosomal). Its regulation is vital for proper cilia function, and its dysregulation can contribute to ciliopathies, a group of syndromes associated with cilia dysfunction (Liu2021NudCL2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCP110 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In endometrial cancer (EC), CCP110 is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with shorter overall survival in patients, indicating its role as a carcinogenic factor in EC. The gene's regulation is influenced by the lncRNA XIST and miR-129-2-3p, where miR-129-2-3p targets CCP110 to attenuate EC cell growth and migration. The XIST/miR-129-2-3p axis modulates CCP110 expression, affecting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of EC cells (Chen2023lncRNA).

CCP110 is also involved in centrosome amplification, a common feature in EC cells that promotes tumor growth by inducing chromosome mis-segregation and enhancing cell migration and invasion. This suggests that CCP110 contributes to the aggressive behavior of cancer cells and may be a potential therapeutic target (Chen2023lncRNA).

While the context does not explicitly mention specific diseases caused by mutations in CCP110, its dysregulation is implicated in cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Chen2023lncRNA).

## Interactions
CCP110, also known as centriolar coiled-coil protein 110, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in centrosome duplication and ciliogenesis. CCP110 interacts with CEP97 to form a complex at the distal end of centrioles, which is essential for regulating centriole growth and capping microtubule ends (Aydogan2021Centriole). This complex is involved in controlling the growth of the centriole cartwheel, influencing the rate and period of cartwheel growth (Aydogan2021Centriole).

CCP110 also interacts with CEP290, a positive regulator of ciliogenesis, and plays a role in antagonizing its function. This interaction is part of a complex network that includes other proteins such as Cep97 and Kif24, which are known to suppress cilia formation (Yadav2016Centrosomal). The removal of CCP110 is necessary for cilia formation, indicating its role as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis (Yadav2016Centrosomal).

Additionally, CCP110 is involved in the recruitment of recycling endosomes towards basal bodies, interacting with the SDA complex, which is critical for cilia biogenesis (Yadav2016Centrosomal). These interactions highlight CCP110's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to centrosome and cilia function.
