# TRIM45

## Overview
TRIM45 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 45, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING-finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, all of which are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Zhang2017TRIM45; Hatakeyama2017TRIM). The TRIM45 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby contributing to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Zhang2017TRIM45; Shibata2012TRIM45). It is predominantly localized in the perinuclear region of cells and is involved in modulating critical signaling pathways through its E3 ligase activity (Xia2022TRIM45; Shibata2012TRIM45). Alterations in TRIM45 expression have been linked to various diseases, including gliomas and septic encephalopathy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2017TRIM45; Huang2023TRIM45).

## Structure
TRIM45 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes a RING-finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Zhang2017TRIM45; Hatakeyama2017TRIM). 

The RING-finger domain is crucial for binding ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes, enabling the ubiquitination process (Williams2019Emerging). TRIM45 also contains a filamin-type immunoglobulin (FLMN) domain in its C-terminal region, which is essential for its interaction with the p53 protein, a key tumor suppressor (Zhang2017TRIM45). The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and may contribute to the formation of homodimers or heterodimers, enhancing substrate recognition and enzymatic regulation (Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

TRIM45 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as K63-linked ubiquitination, which stabilizes target proteins like p53 by preventing their degradation (Zhang2017TRIM45). This modification is critical for its role in tumor suppression, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme (Zhang2017TRIM45). The protein's structure and modifications are vital for its function in cellular processes, including autophagy and immune responses (Huang2023TRIM45).

## Function
TRIM45 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, characterized by a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are typical features of E3 ubiquitin ligases. In healthy human cells, TRIM45 plays a crucial role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator. This regulation is significant for controlling cell proliferation and inflammatory responses, as NF-κB is a key factor in these processes (Shibata2012TRIM45).

TRIM45 is also involved in the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53 through K63-linked polyubiquitination, which prevents its degradation. This activity is essential for maintaining p53 stability, allowing it to perform its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby contributing to tumor suppression (Zhang2017TRIM45). The protein is predominantly localized in the perinuclear region of cells, which is important for its function in these signaling pathways (Shibata2012TRIM45).

TRIM45's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis, particularly in tissues where it is highly expressed, such as the brain (Zhang2017TRIM45).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TRIM45 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly gliomas and septic encephalopathy. In gliomas, TRIM45 is significantly downregulated, especially in high-grade gliomas, which correlates with increased tumor proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This downregulation impairs the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to its degradation and diminished tumor-suppressive functions, such as apoptosis induction in response to cellular stress (Zhang2017TRIM45; Giannopoulou2022Emerging). Overexpression of TRIM45 in glioblastoma cells has been shown to suppress tumor growth by stabilizing p53 through K63-linked ubiquitination, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2017TRIM45).

In septic encephalopathy, TRIM45 is upregulated and contributes to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment by promoting microglial pyroptosis through the Atg5/NLRP3 axis. Knockdown of TRIM45 in experimental models has been shown to alleviate cognitive deficits and reduce neuronal damage, suggesting its role in exacerbating the condition (Huang2023TRIM45). These findings indicate that TRIM45's expression levels and interactions are crucial in the pathogenesis of these diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TRIM45, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence key cellular pathways. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting K63-linked polyubiquitination of target proteins, which stabilizes protein interactions and signaling pathways. TRIM45 interacts with TAB2, facilitating its polyubiquitination and promoting the formation of the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. This interaction is crucial for activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and immune responses (Xia2022TRIM45).

In the context of septic encephalopathy, TRIM45 regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway through its interaction with Atg5. TRIM45 promotes the ubiquitination of Atg5, affecting the NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis pathway, which is a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation (Huang2023TRIM45).

TRIM45 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, stabilizing it through K63-linked ubiquitination. This interaction prevents p53 degradation, enhancing its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (Zhang2017TRIM45). These interactions highlight TRIM45's role in modulating critical signaling pathways through its E3 ligase activity.
