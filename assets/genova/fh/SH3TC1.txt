# SH3TC1

## Overview
The SH3TC1 gene encodes the SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 1 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. This protein is characterized by the presence of SH3 domains and tetratricopeptide repeats, which facilitate the assembly of protein complexes and influence cellular functions such as cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and signaling pathways (Mehrabipour2023A). The SH3TC1 protein is notably expressed in the thymus, suggesting a potential role in immune function, although its specific functions in this organ remain to be elucidated (Lee2005Effects). Additionally, SH3TC1 has been implicated in cellular processes related to cancer and cardiac hypertrophy, highlighting its potential significance in disease contexts (Yan2010Global; Zhou2020Novel).

## Function
The SH3TC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes through its involvement in signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. The protein contains SH3 domains, which are crucial for binding to proline-rich motifs, facilitating the assembly of protein complexes and influencing various cellular functions such as cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (Mehrabipour2023A). These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, as SH3 domains are involved in processes like endocytosis and immune system function (Mehrabipour2023A).

The SH3TC1 protein is also characterized by tetratricopeptide repeats, which are involved in protein complex assembly, further contributing to its role in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is active in various cellular compartments, impacting cell signaling pathways and potentially affecting cellular growth and differentiation (Mehrabipour2023A). The expression of SH3TC1 has been identified as higher in the thymus compared to other tissues, suggesting a potential novel role in this organ, although it is not currently associated with specific thymus functions (Lee2005Effects). This indicates the potential for SH3TC1 to be involved in novel cellular processes that are yet to be fully understood.

## Interactions
SH3TC1 is involved in protein-protein interactions primarily through its SH3 domains, which facilitate binding with proline-rich motifs in other proteins. These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including endocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell migration (Mehrabipour2023A). The SH3 domains in SH3TC1 are part of a larger superfamily known for their role in cellular signaling and are implicated in the formation of multiprotein complexes (Mehrabipour2023A).

In the context of gastric cancer cells, SH3TC1 has been identified as an adaptor protein with altered phosphorylation at the Y1287 site upon treatment with genistein, a natural tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This suggests that SH3TC1 may participate in genistein-regulated signaling pathways, although the specific interactions and roles require further investigation (Yan2010Global).

SH3TC1 is also mentioned in studies exploring the effects of valosin-containing protein (VCP) in cardiac hypertrophy, indicating its involvement in transmembrane protein interaction and receptor transport. However, specific details on SH3TC1's interactions in this context are not provided (Zhou2020Novel).
