# PGK2

## Overview
Phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) is a gene that encodes a testis-specific enzyme involved in glycolysis, primarily expressed during spermatogenesis. The PGK2 protein, a kinase, plays a pivotal role in the energy metabolism of sperm cells by catalyzing the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, a reaction that generates ATP necessary for sperm motility and fertility (Yang2013Sequencespecific; McCarrey1996Analysis). Unlike its X-linked counterpart PGK1, PGK2 is an autosomal retrogene that compensates for the inactivation of PGK1 during spermatogenesis, ensuring continued glycolytic activity in developing sperm (Yang2013Sequencespecific; McCarrey1996Analysis). The protein is synthesized in round and condensing spermatids and is distributed into mature spermatozoa, highlighting its essential role in maintaining energy production throughout sperm maturation (McCarrey1996Analysis).

## Structure
Phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) is a sperm-specific isoform from Mus musculus involved in glycolysis. The primary structure of PGK2 consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall bilobal shape, which is typical of kinases (Sawyer2007X‐ray). The tertiary structure of PGK2 forms a two-domain hinge-bending enzyme, with the N-terminal domain binding 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), and the C-terminal domain containing the ADP/ATP binding site (Sawyer2007X‐ray). 

PGK2 undergoes conformational changes between open and closed states to facilitate substrate binding and product release. In the open conformation, the domains are separated, allowing substrate access. Upon binding 3PG, the N-terminal domain rotates, partially closing the enzyme and stabilizing helix 13 (Sawyer2007X‐ray). The closed conformation, necessary for catalysis, involves further rotation and interaction of the b-phosphate of ADP with helix 13 (Sawyer2007X‐ray). 

PGK2 functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure (Sawyer2007X‐ray). The enzyme is encoded by an autosomal retrogene and is expressed during spermatogenesis (Sawyer2007X‐ray).

## Function
Phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) is a testis-specific enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis, particularly in the energy metabolism of sperm cells. It catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, a key step in glycolysis that generates ATP, which is essential for sperm motility and fertility (Yang2013Sequencespecific; McCarrey1996Analysis). PGK2 is expressed in meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells, where it compensates for the repressed expression of the X-linked PGK1 gene due to X-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis (Yang2013Sequencespecific; McCarrey1996Analysis).

The PGK2 protein is synthesized mainly in round and condensing spermatids and is distributed equally into mature spermatozoa and residual cytoplasmic bodies, indicating its role in maintaining high phosphoglycerate kinase activity in spermatozoa (McCarrey1996Analysis). This distribution suggests that PGK2 does not have a specialized intracellular localization signal but is crucial for establishing a stockpile of the enzyme, as new synthesis is not possible in mature sperm cells (McCarrey1996Analysis). The stability and activity of PGK2 throughout sperm maturation highlight its importance in supporting the energy demands of sperm cells (McCarrey1996Analysis).

## Interactions
Phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) is known to interact with various proteins and participate in multiprotein complexes, particularly in the context of sperm motility and energy metabolism. One significant interaction is with the testis-specific calcium-binding protein CABYR. This interaction was identified through co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments, suggesting that PGK2 and CABYR form a complex in human sperm cells. CABYR is involved in the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which regulates sperm motility, indicating that PGK2 may play a role in this process as part of a larger multiprotein complex (Shen2019Testis‐specific).

PGK2 also interacts with nucleic acids through its role in transcriptional regulation during spermatogenesis. The transcription of the Pgk2 gene is regulated by protein-DNA interactions involving transcription factors such as SP3 and the PBX4-PREP1 complex. These factors bind to specific enhancer regions of the Pgk2 promoter, facilitating its expression in spermatocytes and spermatids (Yoshioka2007In). The presence of these interactions highlights the complex regulatory mechanisms governing PGK2 expression and its involvement in testis-specific functions.
