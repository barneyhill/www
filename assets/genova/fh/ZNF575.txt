# ZNF575

## Overview
ZNF575 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 575, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. These proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, influencing the expression of other genes. Zinc finger protein 575 is implicated in various biological processes, including development and cellular differentiation, through its role in modulating gene expression. The gene's expression and its epigenetic modifications have been associated with several health conditions, such as neurodevelopmental changes due to prenatal exposure to antidepressants and increased cancer risk, particularly in lung and colorectal cancers (Chang2008Base; Xu2024PFDN6; Cardenas2019Prenatal).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF575 gene have been associated with various health conditions. Prenatal exposure to maternal antidepressants has been linked to changes in DNA methylation of the ZNF575 gene in offspring. This epigenetic modification was observed in infants and persisted into early childhood, suggesting potential implications for long-term mental health or neurodevelopment, although the clinical significance remains to be fully characterized (Cardenas2019Prenatal). 

In the context of cancer, the ZNF575 gene has been implicated in lung cancer risk. A study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the ZNF575 gene, rs2256507, which was associated with an increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer among Latinos (Chang2008Base). 

Additionally, ZNF575 has been identified as a target of the PFDN6 gene, which is involved in colorectal cancer progression. This interaction suggests that ZNF575 may play a role in the transcriptional regulation processes that contribute to cancer development (Xu2024PFDN6). 

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ZNF575 in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and implications in these conditions.
