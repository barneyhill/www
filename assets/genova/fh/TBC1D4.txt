# TBC1D4

## Overview
TBC1D4, also known as AS160, is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 4, a Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) involved in the regulation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) trafficking. This protein plays a pivotal role in glucose uptake by modulating the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin signaling, primarily in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (Henriques2020WNK1; Sakamoto2008Emerging). TBC1D4 is characterized by multiple domains, including phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains and a GTPase-activating (GAP) domain, and is regulated through phosphorylation by kinases such as AKT and AMPK (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated). Mutations in TBC1D4 have been linked to metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, particularly in specific populations, underscoring its clinical significance in glucose metabolism and cardiovascular health (Manousaki2016Toward; Binsch2023Deletion).

## Structure
TBC1D4, also known as AS160, is a multidomain Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) involved in the regulation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) trafficking. The protein is composed of two N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, a central calmodulin-binding (CB) domain, and a C-terminal GTPase-activating (GAP) domain (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated). TBC1D4 forms oligomers with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa, facilitated by the N-terminal PTB domains and a 130 amino-acid-spanning C-terminal tail (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated).

The protein contains multiple phosphorylation sites, with 19 identified, including Ser 324, Ser 348, Ser 577, Ser 595, Thr 649, Ser 673, Ser 711, and Ser 758. These sites are targeted by kinases such as AKT and AMPK, which regulate TBC1D4's interaction with other proteins like 14-3-3 and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated). Phosphorylation does not significantly alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity but affects protein interactions crucial for GLUT4 trafficking (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated).

TBC1D4 is expressed in insulin-responsive tissues and has several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles (Treebak2010Identification). The protein's structure and function have been studied using recombinant full-length TBC1D4 expressed in insect cells (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated).

## Function
TBC1D4, also known as AS160, is a Rab GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose uptake in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, where it modulates the trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane in response to insulin signaling. This process is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body (Henriques2020WNK1; Sakamoto2008Emerging).

The function of TBC1D4 is regulated by phosphorylation events, particularly by protein kinases such as AKT. Upon insulin stimulation, AKT phosphorylates TBC1D4, which facilitates the translocation of GLUT4 storage vesicles to the cell surface, thereby increasing glucose uptake (Henriques2020WNK1; Sakamoto2008Emerging). TBC1D4 contains multiple phosphorylation sites, including Thr-642 and Ser-666, which are critical for its role in GLUT4 translocation (Treebak2009Potential).

TBC1D4 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins upon phosphorylation, which may influence its function in glucose uptake and insulin signaling (Treebak2009Potential). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of glucose transport, and disruptions in its function can lead to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Henriques2020WNK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D4 gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly in Arctic populations. The p.Arg684Ter loss-of-function variant is prevalent among the Inuit, leading to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. This mutation results in elevated postprandial glucose levels and can cause underdiagnosis of diabetes unless oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are performed (Manousaki2016Toward). The variant affects the expression of GLUT4 in muscle tissues, contributing to postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (Schnurr2021Physical).

Physical activity has been shown to mitigate the effects of the TBC1D4 mutation, particularly in homozygous carriers, by lowering postprandial plasma glucose levels and reducing the probability of developing type 2 diabetes (Schnurr2021Physical). In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, TBC1D4 is crucial for cardiac glucose uptake. Deficiency in TBC1D4 can exacerbate myocardial damage following ischemia/reperfusion injury, highlighting its significance in cardiovascular health (Binsch2023Deletion). These findings underscore the importance of considering TBC1D4 mutations in the diagnosis and management of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
TBC1D4, also known as AS160, is a Rab GTPase-activating protein that interacts with several proteins involved in glucose transport regulation. One of its key interactions is with Akt, a kinase that phosphorylates TBC1D4 at multiple sites, including Ser 324, Ser 595, Thr 649, and Ser 758. This phosphorylation is crucial for the regulation of GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated; Sakamoto2008Emerging).

Phosphorylated TBC1D4 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which bind to specific phosphorylated residues such as Ser 348 and Thr 649. This interaction is important for GLUT4 translocation, as it modulates the inhibitory effect of TBC1D4 on GLUT4 traffic (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated; Sakamoto2008Emerging).

TBC1D4's interaction with the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) is disrupted upon phosphorylation by Akt and AMPK, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for GLUT4 vesicle recruitment. This disruption indicates that phosphorylation alters TBC1D4's access to Rab GTPases associated with GLUT4 vesicles rather than its catalytic activity (Eickelschulte2021AKTAMPKmediated). These interactions highlight TBC1D4's role in integrating insulin and exercise signals to regulate glucose uptake.
