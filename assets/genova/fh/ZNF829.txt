# ZNF829

## Overview
ZNF829 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 829, which is part of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to DNA and are involved in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 829 is implicated in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and tumor suppression, through its interaction with the KAP1/TRIM28 protein, a known corepressor (Czerwinska2021Low). The gene is located on chromosome 19 and is part of a cluster of zinc finger proteins that may play roles in local adaptation and disease processes (Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic). ZNF829 has been associated with better survival outcomes in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and is considered a potential biomarker in colorectal cancer due to its altered methylation patterns (Naumov2013Genomescale; Czerwinska2021Low). Additionally, it is included in a prognostic gene signature for triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its significance in cancer research (Wang2022Prognosis).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF829 has been implicated in several types of cancer through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), high expression of ZNF829 is associated with better survival outcomes, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. It is part of a group of KRAB-ZNF transcription factors that interact with the KAP1/TRIM28 protein, which is linked to cancer stemness. This interaction may contribute to its prognostic value in KIRC, although its specific clinical significance in other kidney cancers is not observed (Czerwinska2021Low).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF829 is identified as a top-ranking gene with significant differences in DNA methylation patterns, although its functional role in CRC remains unclear. The hypermethylation of ZNF829 in CRC suggests it could be involved in tumor aggression and may serve as a potential biomarker for early detection and diagnosis (Naumov2013Genomescale).

ZNF829 is also included in a 10-gene signature for prognosis prediction in triple-negative breast cancer, indicating its potential role in stratifying patient risk and influencing survival outcomes (Wang2022Prognosis).

## Interactions
ZNF829 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with the KAP1/TRIM28 protein, a known corepressor involved in epigenetic repression. This interaction is significant in the context of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where ZNF829, along with other KRAB-ZNF proteins, is associated with better survival outcomes for patients. The interaction with TRIM28 suggests a role in tumor suppression and regulation of cancer stemness (Czerwinska2021Low).

In addition to its interaction with TRIM28, ZNF829 is part of a cluster of zinc finger proteins on chromosome 19, which may be involved in local adaptation and disease processes. However, specific details about its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond TRIM28 are not well-documented in the available literature (Micci2010Array‐CGH; Perdomo-Sabogal2019Genetic).

The mutation of TRIM28 at lysine 304 to glutamine (TRIM28-K304Q) has been shown to affect the expression of ZNF829, indicating that changes in TRIM28 can influence ZNF829's activity, although the specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Chang2020Mutation).
