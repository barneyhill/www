# MYO16

## Overview
MYO16 is a gene that encodes the protein myosin XVI, an unconventional myosin primarily expressed in the brain. Myosin XVI is categorized as a motor protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, playing a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic function. The MYO16 gene produces two isoforms, Myo16a and Myo16b, with Myo16b being the predominant form characterized by a unique C-terminal tail that facilitates interactions with various proteins, including those involved in actin remodeling and signal transduction (Telek2021The; Telek2020Myosin). Myosin XVI is implicated in several cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and synaptic plasticity, and has been associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (Roesler2019Myosin; Liu2015Autism). The protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its significance in maintaining proper neuronal function and development (Telek2021The; Kengyel2015Ankyrin).

## Structure
Myosin XVI (MYO16) is a member of the myosin superfamily, characterized by a conserved motor domain and unique structural features. The MYO16 gene encodes two isoforms, Myo16a and Myo16b, which differ in the length of their C-terminal tails. Myo16b, the predominant isoform, includes a distinctive 590 amino acid tail extension known as Myo16Tail, which contains a WAVE1 interacting region, a neuronal tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (NYAP) homology motif, and proline-rich regions (Telek2020Myosin).

The Myo16Tail is characterized by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which contribute to its structural flexibility and dynamic nature. These regions are involved in various biological processes, including interactions with binding partners such as PI3K and WAVE1 (Telek2021The). The secondary structure of Myo16Tail includes both α-helical and β-structured elements, with a significant amount of disordered content, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Telek2021The).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are prevalent in the disordered regions of Myo16Tail, suggesting regulatory roles in signaling pathways (Telek2021The). The N-terminal ankyrin domain (Myo16Ank) interacts with protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), influencing phosphatase activity and potentially regulating phosphorylation processes (Kengyel2015Ankyrin; Telek2020Myosin).

## Function
MYO16, also known as myosin XVI, is an unconventional myosin primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and function. It is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, particularly within dendritic spines of Purkinje cells, which is crucial for synaptic structure and transmission (Roesler2019Myosin). MYO16 interacts with the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), acting as an upstream activator of the WRC-Arp2/3 pathway, essential for the formation of branched F-actin (Roesler2019Myosin). This interaction is vital for maintaining proper actin dynamics, which is fundamental for processes associated with learning and memory (Roesler2019Myosin).

MYO16 also plays a role in cell cycle regulation. It is localized in the nucleus and its expression fluctuates during the cell cycle, peaking in late G1 through S-phase and decreasing as cells enter M-phase (Cameron2013Myosin). The protein is involved in responding to DNA replication stress, where its downregulation is critical for mitotic entry (Cameron2013Myosin). MYO16's interaction with protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) suggests a role in modulating phosphorylation levels, which may influence cell cycle progression and synaptic plasticity (Kengyel2015Ankyrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MYO16 gene have been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants within MYO16 have been linked to schizophrenia, with studies identifying specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes associated with the condition. Increased expression of MYO16 has been observed in the frontal cortex of schizophrenia patients, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathogenesis (RodriguezMurillo2013Fine).

MYO16 is also implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Genetic evidence suggests that common variations at the MYO16 locus are associated with an increased risk of developing ASD. The gene's role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and synaptic function is thought to contribute to these associations (Roesler2019Myosin; Liu2015Autism).

Deletions involving MYO16 have been linked to intellectual disabilities and developmental delays. Patients with such deletions often present with a range of symptoms, including language developmental disorders, microcephaly, and visual impairments (Liu2015Autism).

MYO16's involvement in neuronal migration and brain development, as well as its interactions with signaling pathways like PI3K, further underscores its clinical significance in neurological and psychiatric disorders (RodriguezMurillo2013Fine; Cameron2013Myosin).

## Interactions
MYO16, also known as myosin XVI, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. The ankyrin domain of MYO16 (My16Ank) interacts with skeletal myosin and nonmuscle Myo2B heavy meromyosin (HMM), enhancing the actin-activated ATPase activity of these motor domains, which suggests a role in modulating motor function (Kengyel2015Ankyrin). My16Ank also binds to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunits (PP1c) α and δ isoforms, inhibiting their phosphatase activity, which indicates a regulatory role in dephosphorylation processes (Kengyel2015Ankyrin).

The C-terminal tail of Myo16b (Myo16Tail) interacts with the N-terminal ankyrin domain, with the IQ motif modulating the interaction strength. This interaction is characterized by a dissociation constant (K_D) of approximately 2.5 µM, suggesting a moderate binding affinity (Telek2021The). Myo16Tail is also involved in interactions with proteins such as PI3K and WAVE1, which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton remodeling and signal transduction (Telek2021The).

MYO16 interacts with KIRREL3, a synaptic adhesion protein, suggesting a role in regulating the synaptic actin cytoskeleton and neuronal morphogenesis (Liu2015Autism). These interactions highlight MYO16's involvement in complex regulatory networks within cells.
