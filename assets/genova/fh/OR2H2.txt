# OR2H2

## Overview
The OR2H2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily H member 2, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in olfactory signal transduction. Beyond its traditional role in the detection of odorants, OR2H2 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of autophagy and cellular senescence in human vaginal epithelial cells, as well as myoblast differentiation in muscle cells. The receptor is activated by specific ligands, such as aldehyde 13-13, which trigger intracellular signaling pathways like CaMKKβ-AMPK-mTORC1 and PI3K, influencing cellular energy balance and muscle regeneration. OR2H2's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, including gestational hypothyroidism, preeclampsia, and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Kim2023OR2H2; Hirata2023Exploring; Kalbe2018OR2H2; GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Function
The human gene OR2H2 encodes an olfactory receptor that is involved in various cellular processes beyond its traditional role in olfaction. In VK2/E6E7 human vaginal epithelial cells, OR2H2 is the most highly expressed olfactory receptor and plays a significant role in activating the CaMKKβ-AMPK-mTORC1 signaling pathway. This activation leads to increased intracellular calcium and cAMP levels, which stimulate autophagy and suppress cellular senescence. The activation of this pathway is associated with maintaining cellular energy balance and combating aging by reducing the expression of senescence markers such as P16 and P19, and restoring cell proliferation in senescent cells (Kim2023OR2H2).

In human myoblast cells, OR2H2 is involved in the regulation of myoblast differentiation. Upon activation by its ligand, aldehyde 13-13, OR2H2 induces a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium levels through PI3K signaling. This process is crucial for muscle cell development and repair, as it influences myoblast fusion and differentiation (Kalbe2018OR2H2). The receptor's role in these diverse cellular contexts highlights its potential involvement in broader physiological processes, including muscle regeneration and cellular longevity.

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR2H2 has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression levels. In the context of gestational hypothyroidism and preeclampsia, OR2H2 is downregulated, which may serve as a compensatory mechanism against increased blood pressure. This suggests a potential link between thyroid dysfunction and olfactory receptors outside the olfactory epithelium, with OR2H2 being a gene of interest in these conditions (Hirata2023Exploring). The study also highlights the potential of using circulating ORs, including OR2H2, as biomarkers for predicting preeclampsia onset before 20 gestational weeks (Hirata2023Exploring).

In Parkinson's disease, OR2H2 is expressed in the frontal cortex, and its dysregulation is observed even in the absence of significant cognitive deficits or Lewy bodies. This suggests that alterations in OR2H2 might occur in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, potentially contributing to the disease's pathology (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). However, the study did not find differences in the subcellular distribution of OR2H2 between control and Parkinson's disease brains, and the lack of suitable antibodies prevented validation of OR dysregulation at the protein level (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Interactions
The OR2H2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that participates in several signaling interactions, primarily through its activation by the ligand aldehyde 13-13. This activation leads to the stimulation of the CaMKKβ-AMPK-mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for inducing autophagy in VK2/E6E7 cells. The activation of this pathway results in decreased phosphorylation of mTORC1, S6K, and S6, which are downstream components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway (Kim2023OR2H2). OR2H2 activation by aldehyde 13-13 also enhances the phosphorylation of AMPKα1, mediated by CAMKKβ, an upstream kinase of AMPK, leading to the inhibition of mTORC1 (Kim2023OR2H2).

In human myoblasts, OR2H2 activation by aldehyde 13-13 results in a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular calcium ions (Ca2+), mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. This interaction affects myoblast differentiation by modulating intracellular calcium levels and influencing the expression of differentiation markers like myosin heavy chain (Kalbe2018OR2H2). The increase in Ca2+ is independent of extracellular sources, suggesting it originates from intracellular stores (Kalbe2018OR2H2). These interactions highlight OR2H2's role in cellular processes beyond olfaction, including autophagy and myoblast differentiation.
