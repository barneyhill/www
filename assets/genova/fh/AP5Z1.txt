# AP5Z1

## Overview
AP5Z1 is a gene that encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 5 subunit zeta 1, a component of the AP-5 adaptor protein complex. This protein complex is involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the retrieval of proteins from late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting (Hirst2018Role). The AP-5 complex serves as a backup pathway for the retromer complex, facilitating the transport of specific proteins such as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) (Hirst2018Role). AP5Z1 also plays a significant role in lysosome dynamics and trafficking, interacting with motor proteins to regulate lysosome movement and function (Pierga2023Spatacsin). Mutations in the AP5Z1 gene are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 48 (SPG48) and a novel lysosomal storage disease, underscoring its importance in neuronal health and cellular processes (Hirst2015Loss; Khundadze2019A).

## Function
The AP5Z1 gene encodes a subunit of the AP-5 adaptor protein complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the retrieval of proteins from late endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting. In healthy human cells, the AP-5 complex acts as a backup pathway for the retromer complex, facilitating the retrieval of proteins such as the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR), GOLIM4, and GOLM1 from endosomes to the Golgi (Hirst2018Role).

AP5Z1 is also involved in the regulation of lysosome dynamics and trafficking. It interacts with motor proteins like p150 Glued, a subunit of the dynein/dynactin complex, which is crucial for the formation and motility of tubular lysosomes. The balance between AP5Z1 and spastizin is important for regulating the directionality of lysosome movements, affecting cellular processes such as metabolism and membrane repair (Pierga2023Spatacsin; Pierga2022Spatacsin).

Mutations in AP5Z1 can lead to hereditary spastic paraplegia, characterized by neurological abnormalities, highlighting its importance in neuronal health and function (Hirst2018Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP5Z1 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 48 (SPG48), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness. SPG48 is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and presents with a range of clinical features, including sensory and motor neuropathy, ataxia, dystonia, myoclonus, and Parkinsonism, in addition to spastic paraplegia (Hirst2015Loss; Khundadze2019A). The AP5Z1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 5 (AP-5), which is involved in intracellular trafficking. Disruption of AP-5 function due to AP5Z1 mutations leads to impaired autophagic lysosome reformation and a block in autophagic flux, resulting in the accumulation of autophagic cargo and subsequent axon degeneration (Khundadze2019A).

Mutations in AP5Z1 have also been linked to a new type of lysosomal storage disease, characterized by the accumulation of aberrant endolysosomes and enlarged multilamellar structures filled with storage material (Hirst2015Loss). Clinical manifestations of these mutations include spastic paraplegia, neuropathy, parkinsonism, and cognitive impairment, with some features overlapping with those caused by mutations in related genes SPG11 and SPG15 (Hirst2015Loss).

## Interactions
AP5Z1, a subunit of the AP-5 complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in lysosomal trafficking and dynamics. It forms a stable complex with spatacsin (SPG11) and spastizin (SPG15), which are essential for its role in the endosomal pathway (Hirst2015Loss). AP5Z1 interacts with motor proteins such as p150 Glued, a subunit of the dynein/dynactin complex, facilitating retrograde transport of lysosomes (Pierga2023Spatacsin; Pierga2022Spatacsin). This interaction is vital for the formation and motility of tubular lysosomes (Pierga2022Spatacsin).

AP5Z1 also competes with spastizin for binding to spatacsin, influencing the localization of spastizin to lysosomes (Pierga2023Spatacsin). The regulation of AP5Z1 levels by spatacsin, through UBR4-mediated degradation, affects lysosome trafficking directionality, with overexpression of AP5Z1 promoting retrograde movement and downregulation promoting anterograde movement (Pierga2022Spatacsin). These interactions highlight the role of AP5Z1 in maintaining the balance of lysosome dynamics and positioning within cells, particularly in neurons (Pierga2023Spatacsin).
