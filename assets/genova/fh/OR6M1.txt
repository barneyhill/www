# OR6M1

## Overview
The OR6M1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily M member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their function in signal transduction across cell membranes (Kajii2019Wholeexome). While primarily associated with the detection of odorants, the OR6M1 protein also plays roles in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where it is involved in processes like ATP release and activation of purinergic receptors (Abaffy2015Human). Despite its established presence in various tissues, the specific physiological and pathological roles of OR6M1 remain under investigation, with some studies suggesting potential links to conditions such as breast cancer and neurolymphomatosis (Cerri2022Clinical; Fidalgo2014Lymphovascular). Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of its functions and clinical significance.

## Structure
The OR6M1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structural feature is common among olfactory receptors and is crucial for their role in odorant signal transduction (Kajii2019Wholeexome). The seven-transmembrane domain allows the receptor to span the cell membrane, facilitating the interaction with odorant molecules and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways.

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of OR6M1 are not provided in the available context, it is known that GPCRs, including olfactory receptors, often undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications can influence receptor stability, localization, and function, although specific modifications for OR6M1 are not detailed in the context provided.

The OR6M1 protein is involved in cell-cell communication, particularly in non-olfactory tissues such as the skin, where it plays a role in processes like ATP release and activation of purinergic receptors (Abaffy2015Human). This highlights the receptor's functional versatility beyond traditional olfactory roles.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR6M1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases. However, some studies have explored its potential involvement in various conditions. In a study on breast cancer, deletions at chromosome 11q24.1 and 11q24.3, which include the OR6M1 gene, were more frequently observed in tumors with lymphovascular invasion, suggesting a possible link to the aggressiveness of breast cancer (Fidalgo2014Lymphovascular). Another study on neurolymphomatosis found that OR6M1 was among the most down-regulated genes in affected patients, indicating a significant alteration in its expression in this context, although the clinical implications remain unclear (Cerri2022Clinical).

In a Japanese pedigree study on mandibular prognathism, a non-synonymous single-nucleotide variant in OR6M1 was identified, but it was not considered a plausible candidate for the condition, highlighting the gene's uncertain role in this specific phenotype (Kajii2019Wholeexome). Overall, while OR6M1 has been implicated in various genomic studies, its direct clinical significance and association with specific diseases require further investigation.
