# PRDM13

## Overview
PRDM13 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 13 protein, a transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of neuronal development. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal PR domain and multiple C-terminal zinc-finger domains, which facilitate its role in transcriptional repression by mediating protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions (Chang2013Prdm13; Mona2017Repression). Although the PR domain is related to the SET domain typically associated with histone methyltransferase activity, it is not essential for PRDM13's function (Mona2017Repression; Hanotel2014The). PR/SET domain 13 plays a critical role in the central nervous system by influencing the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons, primarily through the repression of genes associated with excitatory neuron specification (Chang2013Prdm13; Hanotel2014The). The gene's dysregulation is linked to several clinical conditions, including North Carolina Macular Dystrophy and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Whittaker2021A; Manes2017A).

## Structure
PRDM13 is a transcriptional repressor characterized by an N-terminal PR domain and multiple C-terminal zinc-finger (ZF) domains. The PR domain is related to the SET domain, which is typically involved in histone methyltransferase activity, although in PRDM13, this domain is not essential for its function (Mona2017Repression; Hanotel2014The). The zinc-finger domains are crucial for PRDM13's activity, facilitating protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions necessary for transcriptional repression (Chang2013Prdm13; Mona2017Repression). 

The molecular structure of PRDM13 includes a PR domain and four zinc-finger motifs, with one zinc finger located immediately 3' to the PR domain and the others clustered at the C-terminal end (Hanotel2014The). These zinc fingers are essential for the protein's function, as mutations in these regions abolish its activity (Chang2013Prdm13). PRDM13 may not directly bind DNA but rather interacts with chromatin indirectly, possibly through protein-protein interactions (Chang2013Prdm13). 

PRDM13 is also involved in a feedback loop with PTF1A, where it represses Ptf1a transcription, ensuring transient expression during neural development (Mona2017Repression). The protein's role in neuronal specification is critical, as it represses excitatory neuronal gene programs within inhibitory neuronal lineages (Mona2017Repression).

## Function
PRDM13 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system by regulating the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. It functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, targeting and suppressing the expression of genes such as Tlx1 and Tlx3, which are associated with excitatory neuron specification. This repression promotes the development of Pax2+/GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons over Tlx1/3+/glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons, thus maintaining the necessary balance for proper somatosensory information processing (Chang2013Prdm13; Hanotel2014The).

PRDM13 interacts with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors like Ascl1 to modulate their activity, switching Ascl1 from an activator to a repressor, which is significant for the progression of cells toward the GABAergic neuronal lineage (Chang2013Prdm13). It is also involved in the specification and survival of Ebf3+ amacrine cells in the retina, where it influences the development of glycinergic amacrine cells (Goodson2018Prdm13).

PRDM13 may exert its repressive functions through intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity or by recruiting histone-modifying co-factors, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Mona2017Repression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the PRDM13 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One notable condition is North Carolina Macular Dystrophy (NCMD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by macular lesions with relatively preserved visual acuity. This condition is linked to a 98.4 kb tandem duplication encompassing the PRDM13 gene, leading to its upregulation. The duplication includes a DNase 1 hypersensitivity site, which may contribute to the dysregulation of PRDM13 expression, affecting retinal development and resulting in abnormal macular development (Manes2017A).

PRDM13 mutations are also implicated in congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and cerebellar hypoplasia. A recessive mutation in PRDM13 can lead to a range of phenotypes, including developmental delay, scoliosis, and intellectual disability. These mutations disrupt the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the cerebellum, affecting GABAergic cell fate and leading to cerebellar hypoplasia (Whittaker2021A). The gene's role in the development of Kiss1 neurons in the hypothalamus is crucial for regulating GnRH secretion, and its deficiency can contribute to CHH (Whittaker2021A).

## Interactions
PRDM13 is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of neuronal development. It acts as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors such as ASCL1, PTF1A, and NEUROG1/2. These interactions allow PRDM13 to be recruited to specific DNA motifs, such as E-boxes, where it suppresses the transcriptional activity of these factors (Mona2017Repression). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that PRDM13 physically interacts with PTF1A and ASCL1, but not with E-proteins like E47, E12, and HEB (Mona2017Repression).

PRDM13 is also involved in forming repressor complexes. It is suggested to interact with PTF1A to form a complex that represses Ptf1a transcription through its autoregulatory enhancer, potentially by displacing RBPJ from the PTF1A complex (Mona2017Repression). Additionally, PRDM13 interacts with NEUROG1 and NEUROG2, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays, to inhibit their activity and regulate neuronal identity by restricting Prdm12 expression (Mona2017Repression).

The zinc finger domain of PRDM13 is predicted to have DNA binding properties, suggesting that it may directly interact with DNA, although this requires further experimental validation (Mona2017Repression).
