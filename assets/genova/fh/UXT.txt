# UXT

## Overview
The UXT gene encodes a protein known as the ubiquitously expressed prefoldin-like chaperone, which is a member of the prefoldin α-like family. This protein functions primarily as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and stabilization of other proteins within the cell. UXT is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcription regulation, apoptosis, and autophagy, by interacting with key proteins such as NF-κB, Foxp3, and p62. The protein is expressed in numerous tissues, underscoring its essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function. UXT's involvement in critical pathways makes it a significant factor in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and retinal degeneration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2007UXT; Han2023UXT; Yoon2021UXT).

## Structure
UXT is a protein that belongs to the prefoldin α-like family, characterized by its role as a molecular chaperone. It is structurally similar to the hexameric chaperone prefoldin, suggesting a possible oligomeric structure for UXT, which may form oligomers to enhance its function (Yoon2021UXT). The protein is 157 amino acids long and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues (Yoon2021UXT).

UXT interacts with the p62 protein, a key mediator in aggrephagy, by binding to the LB domain of p62. This interaction is crucial for the formation of p62 bodies and the clearance of protein aggregates (Yoon2021UXT). UXT's chaperone function is enhanced by its ability to form oligomers, which may provide multiple binding sites for p62, facilitating the formation of a reticulated structure that increases affinity for ubiquitinated protein aggregates and LC3 (Yoon2021UXT).

The protein has two isoforms, UXT-V1 and UXT-V2, which differ in their N-termini. UXT-V2 is involved in NF-κB signaling and is subject to ubiquitination and degradation by the SCF(Fbxo7) complex (Spagnol2021The).

## Function
The UXT gene encodes a protein that functions as a molecular chaperone, playing a critical role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nucleus. UXT is involved in the regulation of transcription factors, including Foxp3 and NF-κB, which are essential for immune response and inflammation regulation. In regulatory T (Treg) cells, UXT interacts with the transcription factor Foxp3, facilitating its nuclear localization and function. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the suppressive phenotype of Treg cells, which are important for immune homeostasis (Li2013UXT). UXT's role as a molecular chaperone extends to the NF-κB transcriptional enhanceosome, where it stabilizes NF-κB's presence in the nucleus, ensuring its proper transcriptional activity. This is vital for the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes involved in immune responses (Sun2007UXT).

UXT is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. The UXT-V1 isoform modulates TNF-induced apoptosis by interacting with components of the TNF receptor signaling pathway, thereby preventing the formation of the apoptotic complex II. This protective role highlights UXT's involvement in cell survival mechanisms (Huang2011UXTV1). Overall, UXT's activities in the nucleus and its interactions with key transcription factors underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and immune system balance.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the UXT gene, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed prefoldin-like chaperone, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In cancer, UXT is implicated in tumor progression and immune response regulation. It interacts with the mTOR protein to regulate autophagy, preventing excessive autophagy and cell death, which is crucial in cancer progression (Han2023UXT). UXT-V2 inhibits the P53 signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and migration, contributing to cancer progression (Han2023UXT). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), UXT is upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes, acting as a pro-oncogene by enhancing EZH2 activity, which represses tumor suppressor genes (Zeng2019Ubiquitous).

In neurodegenerative diseases, UXT plays a role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by interacting with the ALS2 protein and modulating the cGAS-STING1 signaling pathway, potentially offering neuroprotective effects (Han2023UXT). UXT also facilitates the degradation of toxic protein aggregates through its interaction with p62, which is crucial for maintaining motor neuronal health in ALS (Yoon2021UXT).

In retinal degenerative diseases, UXT deficiency in mice leads to features resembling retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its role in maintaining retinal structure and function (Pan2020Mice). These findings suggest that UXT is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and retinal degeneration.

## Interactions
The UXT protein, also known as ubiquitously expressed prefoldin-like chaperone, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. UXT interacts with the PIAS2 protein, as confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence microscopy, indicating colocalization in the cytoplasm and nucleus (KONG2014Ubiquitously). It also interacts with the NF-kB component P65, acting as a transcriptional cofactor and influencing NF-kB signaling pathways (Sun2007UXT; Han2023UXT). UXT is a part of the NF-kB transcriptional enhanceosome, essential for its nuclear function (Sun2007UXT).

UXT binds to the p62 protein, enhancing p62 body formation and playing a role in autophagy (Yoon2021UXT). It interacts with the LRPPRC protein, influencing mitochondrial distribution and apoptosis (Han2023UXT). UXT also associates with the EZH1-SUZ12 complex, regulating NF-kB target activation (Han2023UXT). In breast cancer cells, UXT interacts with the lysyl oxidase proenzyme propeptide region (LOX-PP) and modulates estrogen receptor alpha activity (SánchezMorgan2017UXT). These interactions highlight UXT's multifaceted role in transcription regulation, apoptosis, and cellular signaling pathways.
