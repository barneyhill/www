# CHODL

## Overview
The CHODL gene encodes the protein chondrolectin, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. Chondrolectin is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is typical of C-type lectins known for their calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding activity. Despite its structural similarity to other lectins, chondrolectin does not bind common glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan. The protein is predominantly expressed in muscle tissues and the nervous system, where it plays a significant role in muscle formation, neuronal outgrowth, and synaptogenesis, particularly at neuromuscular junctions. Chondrolectin's interactions with proteins such as collagen XIXa1 are crucial for proper synapse formation and motor neuron function. The gene's expression and function are implicated in various physiological processes, and its dysregulation is associated with pathological conditions, including certain cancers and neurological disorders (Sleigh2013Chondrolectin; Weng2002Molecular; Oprişoreanu2019Interaction).

## Structure
The CHODL (chondrolectin) protein is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of 273 amino acids. It features an N-terminal extracellular domain of 196 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 33 amino acids, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 44 residues (Weng2002Molecular). The protein includes a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), characterized by a segment of 120 to 130 amino acids with a motif containing 14 invariant amino acids and 18 additional conserved amino acids. This domain is stabilized by two disulfide bonds and contains two binding sites for Ca2+ (Weng2002Molecular).

CHODL is a monomeric protein with N-linked carbohydrates and possibly O-glycosylation, as indicated by its migration pattern in SDS-PAGE (Weng2002Molecular). The protein shares significant homology with layilin, a hyaluronan receptor, but does not interact with hyaluronan (Weng2002Molecular). CHODL has several splice variants, including soluble forms that lack the transmembrane domain and contain an ER retention signal (QDEL) (Claessens2007Expression). These variants are differentially expressed in T lymphocytes, suggesting a role in T cell development (Claessens2007Expression). The cytoplasmic domain of CHODL interacts with the β-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase, indicating a potential role in intracellular signaling or transport (Claessens2008The).

## Function
The CHODL gene encodes chondrolectin, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. In healthy human cells, chondrolectin is involved in various cellular processes, including carbohydrate recognition and cell adhesion. The protein contains a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) typical of C-type lectins, which are known for their Ca++-dependent carbohydrate-binding activity. Despite its structural similarity to other C-type lectins, CHODL does not appear to bind common glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, or chondroitin sulfate (Weng2002Molecular).

Chondrolectin is predominantly expressed in muscle tissues, including vascular, smooth, and skeletal muscle, and is also found in the testis, prostate, and spleen. Its expression pattern suggests a role in muscle formation and function (Weng2002Molecular). In the nervous system, chondrolectin is involved in neuronal outgrowth and morphology, particularly in motor neurons. It plays a role in axonal pathfinding and is implicated in synaptogenesis, especially in the formation of neuromuscular junctions (Sleigh2013Chondrolectin; Oprişoreanu2019Interaction). The protein's interaction with collagen XIXa1 is crucial for proper synapse formation, which is essential for motor behaviors (Oprişoreanu2019Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CHODL gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly certain cancers and neurological disorders. Changes in CHODL expression levels can influence tumor progression due to its role in cell adhesion and signaling, which are critical processes in cancer development and metastasis. The gene's involvement in cell interactions suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to the invasive and proliferative characteristics of cancer cells.

In the context of neurological disorders, CHODL's function in cell signaling and adhesion is crucial for normal neurodevelopment. Alterations in its expression or mutations may disrupt these processes, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental conditions. The precise mechanisms by which CHODL mutations or expression changes contribute to these disorders are still under investigation, but its role in cell interactions highlights its potential impact on neural connectivity and function.

Overall, the clinical significance of CHODL lies in its involvement in critical cellular processes that, when disrupted, can lead to significant pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
Chondrolectin (CHODL) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in neuromuscular junction formation and axon growth. One of its primary interactions is with collagen XIXa1 (ColXIXa1), a collagen protein. This interaction is mediated through CHODL's extracellular C-type lectin domain, which binds specifically to the collagenous domains of ColXIXa1. This binding is essential for proper synaptogenesis and neuromuscular junction formation, as demonstrated in zebrafish and mouse models (Oprişoreanu2019Interaction).

CHODL does not interact with other collagens such as ColXIIa1, indicating a high specificity for ColXIXa1 (Oprişoreanu2019Interaction). The intracellular domain of CHODL also interacts with the β-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rabggtb), a protein involved in vesicle trafficking. This interaction suggests a role for CHODL in intracellular signaling and protein transport processes (Sleigh2013Chondrolectin; Claessens2008The).

These interactions highlight CHODL's involvement in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of neural development and motor neuron function, where its dysregulation can lead to synaptic defects and impaired motor behaviors (Oprişoreanu2019Interaction).
