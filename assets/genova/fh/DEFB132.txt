# DEFB132

## Overview
DEFB132 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 132, which is part of the beta-defensin family known for its role in the innate immune system. This protein is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, although its specific antimicrobial properties have yet to be fully confirmed. DEFB132 is predominantly expressed in the testis, indicating a potential function in reproductive health and the protection of sperm from microbial threats. The gene is characterized by a high degree of polymorphism, particularly among hunter-gatherer populations, suggesting a role in human adaptation to diverse environmental pressures. This genetic variability is less pronounced in agricultural populations, reflecting different evolutionary pressures. The study of DEFB132 provides insights into the complex interplay between genetic diversity, immune function, and reproductive biology (Hollox2008Directional).

## Structure


## Function
DEFB132, or defensin beta 132, is a member of the beta-defensin family, which plays a significant role in the innate immune response. This gene is primarily expressed in the testis, suggesting its involvement in reproductive processes and potentially in protecting sperm from microbial infections (Hollox2008Directional). The protein encoded by DEFB132 is likely secreted and may possess antimicrobial properties, although this has not been definitively confirmed (Hollox2008Directional). 

In terms of genetic variation, DEFB132 exhibits a high degree of polymorphism, particularly in hunter-gatherer populations, where a single codon can code for four different amino acids (V/A/T/I). This diversity is less pronounced in agricultural populations, where valine is predominantly present at this position (Hollox2008Directional). The gene shows significant genetic differentiation between African and non-African populations, as well as between agricultural and non-agricultural groups, indicating that different selective pressures may have influenced its evolution (Hollox2008Directional). 

The evolutionary dynamics of DEFB132, including its potential role in antimicrobial defense and reproduction, highlight its importance in human adaptation to varying environmental and social conditions (Hollox2008Directional).
