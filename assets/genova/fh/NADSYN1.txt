# NADSYN1

## Overview
NADSYN1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme NAD synthetase 1, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme essential for various cellular processes. NAD synthetase 1 is a bifunctional enzyme that belongs to the synthetase class, featuring both glutaminase and synthetase activities. It catalyzes the final step in NAD+ synthesis, converting nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) into NAD+ in an ATP-dependent manner. This enzyme is vital for maintaining cellular NAD+ levels, which are necessary for energy metabolism, including glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. NADSYN1 is expressed predominantly in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the liver and kidney, and its activity is particularly important during embryogenesis. Mutations in the NADSYN1 gene can lead to congenital NAD deficiency disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular and organismal health (Szot2020Biallelic; Meijer2023Metabolic; Ghanem2024Inhibitors).

## Structure
The NADSYN1 protein is involved in the biosynthesis of NAD and features a complex molecular structure. It is a bifunctional enzyme with distinct active sites for glutaminase and synthetase activities, connected by an ammonia tunnel to prevent the release of toxic intermediates (Zhu2024Advances). The enzyme's structure has been resolved to a 2.84 Å resolution, revealing a homodimer in one asymmetric unit, with four units forming an octamer, which is the biologically active form (Zhu2024Advances). 

The N-terminal glutaminase domain (GD) of NADSYN1 is structurally similar to the nitrilase superfamily and contains a catalytic triad composed of Lys114, Cys175, and Glu45 (Zhu2024Advances). The C-terminal synthetase domain (SD) features a substrate binding cleft with a buried SGGVDS motif in the PP-loop, and the NaAD+ binding site is located at the homodimer interface (Zhu2024Advances). 

Mutations in key residues within the glutaminase domain can affect synthetase activity, leading to NAD depletion (Szot2020Biallelic). The enzyme's activity is regulated by a loop containing Tyr123, Arg124, and Glu125, which assists in orienting the catalytic geometry in the GD and gates the glutaminase active site (Zhu2024Advances).

## Function
NADSYN1 (NAD synthetase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital coenzyme involved in numerous cellular processes. It catalyzes the final step of NAD+ synthesis by converting nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) into NAD+ in an ATP-dependent reaction that requires magnesium ions (Mg2+) and uses glutamine as a nitrogen source (Hara2003Molecular; Ghanem2024Inhibitors). This enzyme is essential for maintaining cellular NAD+ levels, which are crucial for energy metabolism, glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the electron transport chain (Meijer2023Metabolic).

NADSYN1 is expressed abundantly in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the small intestine, liver, kidney, and testis, while its expression is weaker in skeletal muscle and heart (Hara2003Molecular; Ghanem2024Inhibitors). The enzyme's activity is particularly important in maintaining NAD+ levels during embryogenesis, as deficiencies can lead to congenital NAD+ deficiency disorders characterized by multiple organ defects (Szot2020Biallelic; Meijer2023Metabolic). NADSYN1's function is non-redundant, highlighting its critical role in cellular and organismal health (Szot2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NADSYN1 gene, which encodes NAD synthetase 1, are associated with a range of congenital malformations and metabolic disorders. Bi-allelic mutations in NADSYN1 can lead to congenital NAD deficiency disorders, characterized by multiple organ defects such as vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb abnormalities. These defects are often severe and can be incompatible with life, as seen in cases where affected individuals did not survive beyond three months postnatally (Szot2020Biallelic; Szot2021New). Specific mutations, such as p.Ala573Thr and p.Cys49Arg, have been linked to cardiac and renal phenotypes, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome and absent kidneys (Schüle2021A).

NADSYN1 deficiency affects NAD+ synthesis, crucial for cellular metabolism and embryonic development. This deficiency can result in metabolic alterations, such as inhibited glycolysis and altered flux through the pentose phosphate and polyol pathways (Meijer2023Metabolic). The gene's role in NAD+ biosynthesis is particularly critical during embryogenesis, with disruptions leading to significant developmental malformations (Meijer2023Metabolic). The study of NADSYN1 variants highlights the complexity of NAD-involved biological processes and the potential for gene-environment interactions to influence the severity of congenital defects (Lin2021Disruptive).

## Interactions
NADSYN1 interacts with several proteins, including the dcTPR proteins AIP and FKBP51. These interactions were confirmed using GST pull-down assays and proximity ligation assays (PLA). The study found that NADSYN1, along with other proteins such as Usp19 and DNAAF2, interacts with both AIP and FKBP51, and these interactions require an intact C terminus. In HEK293 cells, PLA results showed moderate to strong labeling for NADSYN1 interactions with AIP, indicating a significant interaction. The binding strength of NADSYN1-derived peptides to dcTPR proteins was analyzed, with an estimated IC50 of 28 µM for FKBP51 and 18 µM for AIP, suggesting a moderate affinity (Bernadotte2018In).

NADSYN1 is also phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a role in maintaining cellular NAD+ levels. AMPK phosphorylates NADSYN1 at Ser641, promoting its transcription through FOXO3a phosphorylation. This phosphorylation enhances NADSYN1 mRNA levels and increases NAD+ production, which is reduced when NADSYN1 is knocked down. This interaction highlights a pathway involving AMPK, FOXO3a, and NAD+ in regulating cellular energy status (Marin2015Identification).
