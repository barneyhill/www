# TCTN2

## Overview
TCTN2 is a gene that encodes the protein tectonic family member 2, which is a critical component of the ciliary transition zone in eukaryotic cells. This protein is categorized as a membrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of primary cilia, which are essential for various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Tectonic family member 2 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia and regulating the protein composition of the ciliary membrane by acting as a gatekeeper for proteins transported into and out of the cilium (Truong2023Tectonic; Zhang2020Two). Mutations in the TCTN2 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, such as Meckel-Gruber syndrome and Joubert syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and development (Fang2023Novel; Shaheen2011A).

## Structure
The TCTN2 gene encodes a protein that is primarily located in the ciliary transition zone and is considered a membrane protein. The longest open reading frame of the human TCTN2 gene generates a 697-amino-acid peptide. The protein structure includes a signal peptide consisting of the first 25 amino acids, followed by a 643-amino-acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino-acid transmembrane domain, and an 8-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain (Zhang2020Two). 

TCTN2 is part of the tectonic complex, which includes TCTN1 and TCTN3, and is involved in maintaining the protein composition of the ciliary membrane by acting as a physical barrier to slow the diffusion of membrane proteins (Truong2023Tectonic). The protein is thought to function as a gatekeeper for proteins transported into and out of the cilium, forming complexes with other proteins in the ciliary transition zone (Zhang2020Two). 

Nonsense mutations in the TCTN2 gene, which introduce stop codons, result in truncated proteins that are presumed to be loss-of-function. These mutations are located in the extracellular domain (Zhang2020Two). The TCTN2 protein is also associated with the MKS module, crucial for neural tube development and Sonic Hedgehog signaling (Szymanska2012The).

## Function
The TCTN2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the tectonic family, which is involved in the formation and function of primary cilia. These cilia are essential for various cellular signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for neural tube patterning and embryonic development (Gong2018Tectonic; Sang2011Mapping). TCTN2 is located at the transition zone of cilia, where it regulates the protein composition of the ciliary membrane and facilitates the transport of proteins into the cilia (Gong2018Tectonic; Zhang2020Two).

In healthy human cells, TCTN2 plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed, and in maintaining the structural integrity of cilia. It is involved in the processing and function of Gli3, a component of the Hh pathway, and is necessary for the proper response to Hh signaling (Sang2011Mapping). TCTN2's activity is particularly important in tissues such as the neural tube, where it is highly expressed and contributes to the regulation of developmental processes (Sang2011Mapping). The protein's dysfunction can lead to severe developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in normal cellular function and development (Shaheen2011A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCTN2 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JS). MKS is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder characterized by occipital encephalocele, polycystic kidneys, and postaxial polydactyly. It is linked to dysfunction of primary cilia, with TCTN2 mutations contributing to the disorder's genetic heterogeneity (Zhang2020Two; Shaheen2011A). In MKS, severe mutations such as nonsense and frameshift variants in TCTN2 are more frequently observed (Zhang2020Two).

Joubert syndrome, another ciliopathy, is characterized by the molar tooth sign on MRI, developmental delay, and hypotonia. TCTN2 mutations in JS patients are associated with intellectual disability and are less likely to cause renal, hepatic, or retinal involvement (Fang2023Novel). The genetic diversity and phenotypic variability in JS highlight the role of TCTN2 in nervous system development (Fang2023Novel).

Alterations in TCTN2 expression also play a role in heterotaxy syndrome, a disorder affecting left-right body patterning. TCTN2 is crucial for proper left-right patterning, potentially through its role in ciliary function, which is essential for early development (Liu2018Rare).

## Interactions
TCTN2, a member of the tectonic family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in ciliogenesis and signaling pathways. TCTN2 interacts with MKS1, a protein involved in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and neural tube patterning, as part of the NPHP-JBTS-MKS protein network associated with ciliopathy diseases (Sang2011Mapping). This interaction is validated through coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells, indicating a direct physical association (Sang2011Mapping).

TCTN2 is also part of a protein complex in the ciliary transition zone (TZ), where it functions as a gatekeeper for proteins transported into and out of the cilium. In TCTN2 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, proteins such as adenylate cyclase III (ACIII) and Pkd2 are absent from cilia, highlighting TCTN2's role in their proper localization (Czarnecki2012The). The absence of TCTN2 affects the ciliary translocation of Smoothened, a key component of the Hh signaling pathway, further emphasizing its role in ciliary function and signaling (Czarnecki2012The).

Additionally, TCTN2 interacts with miR-216b, a microRNA, as shown by RNA immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in neuronal apoptosis and autophagy, particularly in the context of spinal cord injury (Ren2019Overexpression).
