# PLEKHB1

## Overview
PLEKHB1, or pleckstrin homology domain containing B1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics. The protein is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology domain, which typically facilitates interactions with phosphoinositides and G protein signaling subunits. However, the PLEKHB1 protein uniquely does not bind phosphoinositides due to its low lysine content, instead interacting with beta-gamma subunits of transducin, a key player in visual signal transduction. This interaction suggests a specialized role in the visual system and potentially other central nervous system functions. Additionally, PLEKHB1 is implicated in maintaining cellular structure through interactions with myosin tails and is involved in post-Golgi protein trafficking, particularly in cells with high membrane production. Its expression and regulation have been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis (Marques2020Motor).

## Function
PLEKHB1, also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing B1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane dynamics. The protein contains a pleckstrin homology domain (PHD), which typically binds to phosphoinositides and G protein signaling subunits. However, the PHD domain of PLEKHB1 does not bind to phosphoinositides due to a low number of lysine residues. Instead, it binds to beta-gamma subunits of transducin, a signal transduction mediator in the visual system, and is suggested to interact with other G protein subunits in the central nervous system (Marques2020Motor).

In sensory cells, PLEKHB1 interacts with myosin 1c and VIIa tails, potentially anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This interaction may play a role in maintaining cell shape and facilitating movement (Marques2020Motor). PLEKHB1 is also implicated in post-Golgi protein trafficking in cells that produce large amounts of membrane, indicating its involvement in cellular transport processes (Marques2020Motor).

In the retina, PLEKHB1 is an integral membrane protein located in the outer segment of both cones and rods, suggesting a role in visual function (Marques2020Motor). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of PLEKHB1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The PLEKHB1 gene has been implicated in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly in models driven by mutations in the TARDBP gene, which encodes the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. In these ALS models, PLEKHB1 is found to be downregulated in motor neurons, suggesting a potential role in disease progression (Marques2020Motor). Despite this downregulation, PLEKHB1 knockout mice do not exhibit ALS-like symptoms, indicating that reduced levels of PLEKHB1 alone may not be sufficient to trigger the disease (Marques2020Motor). However, the altered regulation of PLEKHB1 could influence the timing of ALS symptom onset, particularly in the context of mutant TDP-43 (Marques2020Motor).

The study by Marques et al. highlights the importance of understanding the expression patterns of PLEKHB1 in motor neurons, as its deregulation correlates with the transition to overt motor symptoms in ALS models (Marques2020Motor). These findings suggest that PLEKHB1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS, although its exact clinical significance in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Marques2020Motor).

## Interactions
PLEKHB1, also known as pleckstrin homology domain containing B1, is involved in several protein interactions. Although its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) typically binds to phosphoinositides (PIPs) and G protein signaling subunits, PLEKHB1's PHD does not bind to PIPs due to a low number of lysine residues. Instead, in vitro studies have demonstrated that PLEKHB1 binds to the beta-gamma subunits of transducin, a key mediator of signal transduction in the visual system (Marques2020Motor). This suggests a role in G protein signaling, potentially extending to other central nervous system (CNS) cell types.

PLEKHB1 also interacts with myosin 1c and VIIa tails, which are crucial for anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in vestibular and cochlear sensory cells (Marques2020Motor). This interaction indicates a role in maintaining cellular structure and function in sensory systems. Additionally, PLEKHB1 has been shown to interact with CVB3 VP1, a major structural protein of coxsackievirus B3, which can cause CNS diseases (Marques2020Motor). These interactions suggest that PLEKHB1 may play a role in motor neurons in disease contexts, potentially involving altered interactions with motor neuronal G-protein signaling complexes and myosin subunits at the plasma membrane, and may be related to viral infections affecting the CNS.
