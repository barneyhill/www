# UGGT1

## Overview
UGGT1 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a crucial enzyme involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. The protein product of UGGT1 is a glucosyltransferase that plays a pivotal role in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle by recognizing and reglucosylating misfolded glycoproteins, thereby facilitating their proper folding and trafficking. This enzyme is characterized by its N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and C-terminal glucosyltransferase domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with a variety of substrates (Takeda2016Effects; Modenutti2021Clamping). UGGT1's function is critical for maintaining protein homeostasis, and its absence can lead to severe developmental and metabolic disorders, as well as influence viral replication and pathogenicity (Adams2020Quantitative; Kuribara2020Metabolic; Huang2017UGGT1).

## Structure
UGGT1 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1) is a protein involved in the quality control of glycoprotein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum. The primary structure of UGGT1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain and a C-terminal glucosyltransferase domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Takeda2016Effects). The secondary structure of UGGT1 comprises alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of UGGT1 involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, essential for its role in recognizing and reglucosylating misfolded glycoproteins (Modenutti2021Clamping). This structure allows UGGT1 to interact with a wide range of substrates, highlighting its flexibility and substrate promiscuity (Modenutti2021Clamping). UGGT1 may also form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not extensively documented.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can affect UGGT1's activity and stability, with the protein being fully N-glycosylated at specific sites (Daikoku2015The). Splice variants of UGGT1 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
UGGT1 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1) is a crucial enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells, including humans, where it functions as a folding sensor in the quality control system of glycoprotein folding. It recognizes misfolded glycoproteins and selectively glucosylates high-mannose-type glycans on these proteins, facilitating their interaction with lectin chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin. This process is part of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, ensuring that only properly folded glycoproteins are released from the ER, while those that are misfolded are retained for further folding attempts (Takeda2016Effects; Ito2015Functional).

UGGT1 is involved in the reglucosylation process, which is essential for the engagement of lectin chaperones that assist in the proper folding and trafficking of glycoproteins like the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The absence of UGGT1 significantly impairs the trafficking of IGF-1R, indicating its critical role in optimizing glycoprotein trafficking (Adams2020Quantitative).

UGGT1's activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, as its deletion in mice is embryonically lethal, and its absence leads to misfolding of certain proteins. It is predominantly active in the ER and partially in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (Adams2020Quantitative; Takeda2016Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UGGT1 gene have significant clinical implications. UGGT1 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, which ensures proper folding of glycoproteins. Mutations in UGGT1 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting multiple systems due to improper protein folding (Tax2023Rescue). In the context of rare diseases, UGGT1 plays a role in the retention and degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. For instance, the Trop-2-Q118E mutant glycoprotein, associated with gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDLD), is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to UGGT1 activity. Knocking out UGGT1 in mammalian cells can rescue the secretion of this misfolded glycoprotein, suggesting that UGGT1's modulation could be a therapeutic strategy for diseases caused by such mutations (Tax2023Rescue).

UGGT1 also influences viral replication and pathogenicity. It acts as a positive regulator of viral replication in enteroviruses, with its knockdown resulting in lower viral titers. This suggests that UGGT1 expression levels can influence disease severity in viral infections (Huang2017UGGT1). Additionally, alterations in UGGT1 expression and activity are associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, potentially affecting glycoprotein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (Kuribara2020Metabolic).

## Interactions
UGGT1 (UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1) is involved in several protein interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a co-receptor involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry. This interaction is crucial for the N-glycosylation and proper folding of SR-BI, which in turn affects HCV entry. Silencing UGGT1 reduces SR-BI protein levels and HCV infection, indicating a proviral role for UGGT1 in HCV entry (Huang2019SRBI).

UGGT1 also interacts with calnexin, a chaperone protein involved in the calnexin cycle, which is essential for protein quality control in the ER. This interaction facilitates the proper folding of glycoproteins by reglucosylating them, allowing their recognition by calnexin (Huang2019SRBI).

Additionally, UGGT1 has been shown to interact with polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 18 (ppGalNAc-T18) in the ER. This interaction is independent of N-glycosylation, as demonstrated by the retention of ppGalNAc-T18 in the ER even when N-glycan deficient mutants are used (Jia2021Polypeptide). These interactions highlight UGGT1's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and its involvement in various cellular processes.
