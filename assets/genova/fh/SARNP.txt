# SARNP

## Overview
The SARNP gene encodes the SAP domain containing ribonucleoprotein, a critical component in the regulation of mRNA splicing and export. This protein is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein and is predominantly active within the nucleus, where it interacts with various proteins and RNA molecules to facilitate essential cellular processes. SARNP is notably involved in the TREX complex, interacting with components such as UAP56 and Aly, which are vital for mRNA export (Kang2019SARNP). The protein's role extends to influencing gene expression and cellular outcomes, with significant implications in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions, including various cancers (Kang2019SARNP). Its interactions and regulatory functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Kang2019SARNP).

## Structure


## Function
The SARNP gene, also known as SAP domain containing ribonucleoprotein, plays a crucial role in mRNA splicing and export, processes essential for proper gene expression and cellular function. SARNP is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA and other proteins to facilitate these processes. It is particularly involved in the interaction with UAP56, an RNA helicase component of the TREX complex, which is critical for mRNA export (Kang2019SARNP). This interaction suggests that SARNP is a participant in the TREX cycle, a process related to mRNA export (Kang2019SARNP).

In healthy human cells, SARNP's involvement in mRNA processing is fundamental, as these processes are vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development. Although the primary focus of studies has been on its role in cancer, the implication is that SARNP's functions in mRNA splicing and export are also crucial in non-cancerous cells (Kang2019SARNP). The protein's activity in the nucleus and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in the regulation of gene expression, impacting cellular and organismal outcomes (Kang2019SARNP).

## Clinical Significance
The SARNP gene, also known as SAP domain containing ribonucleoprotein, plays a significant role in mRNA splicing and export, and its altered expression is implicated in various cancers. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SARNP is crucial for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype of cancer cells, which is associated with metastasis. Overexpression of SARNP enhances mRNA splicing and promotes cell proliferation, while its knockdown leads to increased E-cadherin expression, reduced tumor growth, and decreased lung metastasis in mouse models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in TNBC (Kang2019SARNP).

SARNP is also overexpressed in other cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer, indicating its broader role in cancer progression. Additionally, SARNP has been identified as a novel MLL fusion partner in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), highlighting its involvement in hematological malignancies (Kang2019SARNP).

The interaction of SARNP with proteins like UAP56 and pinin (PNN) is crucial for its function in mRNA processing. SARNP's interaction with PNN negatively regulates E-cadherin expression, a key factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), further implicating its role in cancer metastasis and progression (Kang2019SARNP).

## Interactions
SARNP, also known as SAP domain containing ribonucleoprotein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA processing. It interacts with UAP56 and Aly, components of the TREX complex, which is crucial for mRNA splicing and export. SARNP's binding to UAP56 and Aly has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy, indicating its role in promoting mRNA splicing and export (Kang2019SARNP).

SARNP also interacts with the protein pinin (PNN), negatively regulating E-cadherin expression. This interaction is significant in the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer cells, where SARNP's knockdown induces E-cadherin expression (Kang2019SARNP).

In the TREX complex, SARNP acts as a multivalent disassembly factor, interacting with UAP56 through a specific motif known as the UAP56 clamping motif (UCM). This interaction is essential for the disassembly of the TREX complex, facilitating mRNA export by preventing UAP56 from re-binding to the THO complex (Hohmann2024A).

SARNP's interactions extend to its role in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, where it has been identified as having antiviral specificity for MERS-related viruses (Flynn2021Discovery).
