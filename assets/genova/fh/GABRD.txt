# GABRD

## Overview
The GABRD gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor subunit delta, a critical component of the GABA-A receptor complex, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is integral to the central nervous system's inhibitory neurotransmission, primarily mediating tonic inhibition by allowing chloride ions to enter neurons, thereby reducing neuronal excitability. The delta subunit is predominantly associated with extrasynaptic receptors, which play a vital role in maintaining the balance of neural circuits and regulating neuronal excitability (Mulligan2012Complex; Shang2023GABRDpromotes). Beyond its neurological functions, the GABRD gene is expressed in various tissues, including the testis and CD4-T-cells, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological processes (Yan2020Distinct). The delta subunit's interactions with other proteins, such as CDK1, also implicate it in pathological conditions like breast cancer, highlighting its multifaceted role in both health and disease (Shang2023GABRDpromotes).

## Structure
The GABRD gene encodes the delta subunit of the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel involved in mediating tonic inhibition in the nervous system. The primary structure of the GABRD protein consists of a sequence of amino acids, with specific missense mutations identified at positions T126I and R252Q, resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2889475 and rs2376805, respectively (Lin2022SpliceSite). These mutations are located in exon 1 of the GABRD splicing variant 1 (SV1) (Lin2022SpliceSite).

The secondary structure of the GABRD protein likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of ion channel subunits, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its function in forming extrasynaptic receptors. The quaternary structure of the GABA-A receptor involves the assembly of five different subunits, including the delta subunit encoded by GABRD, contributing to the receptor's functional properties (Lin2022SpliceSite).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in GABA-A receptor subunits, although specific modifications for the delta subunit are not detailed in the context. The GABRD gene has multiple splice variant isoforms, with GABRD SV1 being the longest and most studied in relation to amphetamine use in opioid-dependent patients (Lin2022SpliceSite).

## Function
The GABRD gene encodes the delta (δ) subunit of the GABA A receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor allows chloride ions to enter neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. The δ subunit is primarily associated with extrasynaptic receptors, which contribute to tonic inhibition, a form of inhibition that regulates neuronal excitability and maintains the balance of neural circuits (Mulligan2012Complex; Shang2023GABRDpromotes).

In healthy human cells, the GABA A receptor, including the δ subunit, is involved in various cellular functions such as cell junction formation, signal transduction, and serving as an integral component of the plasma membrane (Yan2020Distinct). The δ subunit's role in tonic inhibition is significant for processes like mood regulation and seizure susceptibility, as it influences the overall excitability of neurons and the stability of neural networks (Shang2023GABRDpromotes).

The expression of GABRD is not limited to the central nervous system; it is also found in the testis and CD4-T-cells, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes beyond neurotransmission (Yan2020Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRD gene, which encodes the delta subunit of the GABA-A receptor, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. These mutations are associated with epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Specific mutations such as E177A, R220C, and R220H in the GABRD gene have been linked to these conditions. These mutations can lead to gating defects and impaired trafficking of the receptor, contributing to the epileptic phenotype (Kang2009Making).

Alterations in the expression or function of the GABRD gene can also impact the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition, potentially influencing the progression of neurological diseases. This imbalance is crucial in conditions like epilepsy, where disrupted neuronal signaling can lead to seizures (Yuan2015Ionotropic).

In addition to epilepsy, mutations in GABRD and other GABA receptor genes have been associated with complex neurological disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and addiction disorders. These mutations can result in receptor dysfunction through mechanisms like impaired receptor activation and reduced cell surface expression, further affecting neuronal excitability and signaling (Yuan2015Ionotropic).

## Interactions
The GABRD gene encodes the delta (δ) subunit of the GABA A receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions. In the context of breast cancer, GABRD has been shown to interact with CDK1, a critical protein involved in cell cycle regulation. This interaction is significant in promoting breast cancer progression by regulating the cell cycle, particularly affecting the G2/M phase transition. The interaction between GABRD and CDK1 was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays, indicating a direct physical interaction between these proteins (Shang2023GABRDpromotes).

In the context of the GABA A receptor complexes, the δ subunit is known to interact with other subunits to form functional receptor complexes. It is involved in the assembly of GABA A receptors, particularly influencing the diversity of receptor subtypes by interacting with subunits like α6. The δ subunit's interaction with α6 is suggested by decreased δ expression in α6 knockout mice, indicating a role in receptor assembly and function (Chen2024Proteome). These interactions highlight the δ subunit's role in both cancer progression and neurotransmission.
