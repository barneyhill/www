# KCNMB4

## Overview
The KCNMB4 gene encodes the potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M regulatory beta subunit 4, commonly referred to as the β4 subunit. This protein is a critical component of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are integral membrane proteins involved in regulating neuronal excitability and calcium signaling. The β4 subunit is characterized by its two transmembrane helices and a large extracellular domain, which modulates the gating kinetics and pharmacological properties of BK channels. Predominantly expressed in the brain, the β4 subunit plays a significant role in shaping neuronal firing patterns and synaptic function. Its interaction with the pore-forming α subunit of BK channels confers resistance to certain toxins, such as charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin, thereby influencing the physiological roles of these channels. Alterations in KCNMB4 expression have been linked to neurological disorders, including epilepsy, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal homeostasis (Meera2000A; Whitmire2017Downregulation; Behrens2000hKCNMB3).

## Structure
The KCNMB4 gene encodes the β4 subunit of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, which is characterized by two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2) and a large extracellular domain (EC domain) that forms a 'crown' on top of the Slo1 channel (Tao2019Molecular). The β4 subunit's EC domain is well-ordered, containing β strands, α helices, and loops, stabilized by disulfide bonds (Tao2019Molecular). The β4 subunit also features two N-glycosylation sites located at the outer periphery of the EC domain, confirmed by tandem MS/MS (Meera2000A; Tao2019Molecular).

The β4 subunit influences the gating kinetics of the Slo1 channel, slowing its activation and deactivation, which is attributed to specific regions of the β4 subunit, particularly the N-terminus (Tao2019Molecular). The β4 subunit is closer in sequence similarity to the β3 subunit than to β1 and β2, and it contains a consensus sequence for protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation at the C terminus (Meera2000A). The β4 subunit is expressed predominantly in the brain, with its mRNA showing strong signals in all brain regions (Meera2000A).

## Function
The KCNMB4 gene encodes the β4 subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are crucial for regulating membrane potential and calcium signaling in neurons. The β4 subunit is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in modulating the activity of BK channels by altering their gating kinetics and pharmacological properties. It slows the activation kinetics of BK channels, increases their calcium sensitivity, and makes them resistant to pore blockers such as charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin by slowing the toxin association rate (Behrens2000hKCNMB3; Echeverría2024Large; Meera2000A).

The β4 subunit's presence in BK channels is associated with a reduction in the channels' sensitivity to these toxins, which are typically used to study the physiological roles of BK channels. This resistance is attributed to the extracellular loop of the β4 subunit (Meera2000A). The β4 subunit is involved in shaping the properties of neuronal firing, influencing the duration of action potentials, and contributing to synaptic function and neurotransmitter release (Echeverría2024Large). Its expression in the nervous system suggests a specialized function in regulating neuronal excitability and response to calcium signals (Behrens2000hKCNMB3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the KCNMB4 gene, which encodes the β4 subunit of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, have been implicated in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy. The β4 subunit plays a crucial role in regulating the trafficking and function of BK channels, which are important for modulating neuronal excitability. In the absence of the β4 subunit, there is an increase in BK channel currents, which can lead to spontaneous seizures, as observed in knockout animal models (Shruti2012The). 

Following seizure activity, there is a downregulation of KCNMB4 expression in hippocampal granule neurons, leading to a shift from type II BK channels, which are iberiotoxin-resistant, to type I channels, which are iberiotoxin-sensitive. This shift is associated with increased neuronal excitability and may contribute to the development of epilepsy (Whitmire2017Downregulation). The downregulation of the β4 subunit is considered maladaptive, potentially promoting further seizures and increasing seizure sensitivity (Whitmire2017Downregulation). These findings suggest that the β4 subunit has protective effects against epilepsy, and its downregulation or mutation could have significant physiological consequences, potentially increasing susceptibility to seizures (Whitmire2017Downregulation).

## Interactions
The KCNMB4 gene encodes the β4 subunit of large conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (MaxiK) channels, which are crucial for neuronal excitability. This subunit interacts with the pore-forming α subunit of the MaxiK channel, modulating its pharmacological properties and rendering it resistant to toxins such as charybdotoxin (CTx) and iberiotoxin (IbTx) (Meera2000A). The β4 subunit's extracellular loop is particularly important for this resistance, as it significantly slows the association rate of these toxins with the channel (Meera2000A).

KCNMB4 is also involved in protein-protein interactions within the BK channel complex. It interacts with the BK channel via its S0 transmembrane region, and its intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) facilitate these interactions (Peng2014Intrinsic). The β4 subunit's interaction with the α subunit is essential for forming CTx/IbTx-insensitive MaxiK channels in neurons, which play a role in neurotransmitter release regulation (Meera2000A).

Following seizure activity, the expression of KCNMB4 is downregulated, leading to changes in BK channel subtypes and affecting neuronal excitability (Whitmire2017Downregulation). This downregulation disrupts the association between the BK channel α and β4 subunits, highlighting the dynamic nature of these protein interactions in response to neuronal activity (Whitmire2017Downregulation).
