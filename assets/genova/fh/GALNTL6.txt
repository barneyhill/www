# GALNTL6

## Overview
GALNTL6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-like 6, which belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initiation of O-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that adds N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for various cellular functions, including protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Bennett2011Control). The GALNTL6 protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the synthesis of mucin-type glycoproteins, influencing cellular communication and immune responses (ZamoraFuentes2022Oncogenic). The gene is expressed in multiple human tissues, such as the brain, spinal cord, and testes, and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease and endurance athlete status (Flanigan2021Candidate; Semenova2019Genetic; Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Function
The GALNTL6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) family, which is involved in the initiation of O-linked glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification crucial for protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Bennett2011Control). GALNTL6 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the synthesis of mucin-type glycoproteins, impacting cellular communication and immune response (ZamoraFuentes2022Oncogenic).

In healthy human cells, GALNTL6 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, trachea, testes, and skeletal muscle (Flanigan2021Candidate). It is involved in the O-glycosylation of fibronectin, a process not performed by other GalNAc-T isoforms like GalNAc-T1 and GalNAc-T2 (Kato2021Polypeptide). This specific glycosylation activity suggests a unique role for GALNTL6 in cellular processes such as cell maturation and differentiation, particularly in the brain and testis (Hama2017Genomic). The gene's expression is also altered in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, where it may play a protective role by reducing β-amyloid generation (Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Clinical Significance
GALNTL6 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genomic variations. In the context of multiple system atrophy (MSA), genomic copy number variations (CNVs) affecting GALNTL6 have been identified. These CNVs, located in intronic regions, may influence gene function by affecting transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements. Although the association was not statistically significant, a deletion in the GALNTL6 region was observed more frequently in MSA patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential link that requires further investigation (Hama2017Genomic).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), GALNTL6 has been associated with lipid metabolism and body mass index. It is part of a co-expression network involved in synaptic transmission processes. Lower expression of GALNTL6 has been observed in patients with primary tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) compared to controls, indicating its potential role in excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and enhanced amyloid-beta production, which may contribute to neuronal loss in AD (Strickland2020MAPT).

Additionally, GALNTL6 has been linked to endurance athlete status, with a specific SNP, rs558129 G allele, showing a positive association with this trait in a multi-ethnic study (Semenova2019Genetic).
