# TBC1D3C

## Overview
TBC1D3C is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3C, which is part of the TBC1D3 gene family. This protein is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), where it plays a role in modulating signal transduction. TBC1 domain family member 3C is categorized as a signaling protein due to its involvement in these pathways, which are crucial for regulating cell growth and metabolism. The protein's function in delaying the ubiquitination and degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) underscores its significance in cellular processes that can lead to oncogenesis when dysregulated (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3). The gene's expression and interactions have been linked to various cancers, making it a subject of interest for potential therapeutic interventions (Zhao2017Calmodulin; Wang2021TBC1D3).

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D3C, a member of the TBC1D3 gene family, has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. It is overexpressed in several cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), prostate, breast, pancreatic, and bladder cancers. In KIRC, high expression levels of TBC1D3C are associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is linked to immune infiltration, particularly involving CD4+ T cells and macrophages, and is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes (Wang2021TBC1D3).

TBC1D3C's role in oncogenesis is further supported by its involvement in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, where it enhances signal transduction by delaying the ubiquitination and degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). This action contributes to uncontrolled cell growth and malignant transformations, particularly in breast and prostate cancers (Wainszelbaum2012TBC1D3).

Alterations in TBC1D3C expression or its interactions with cellular components can significantly impact cancer progression. For instance, its interaction with calmodulin in breast cancer cells inhibits its degradation, promoting cell migration and tumor progression (Zhao2017Calmodulin). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.
