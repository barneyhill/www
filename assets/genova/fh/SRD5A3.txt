# SRD5A3

## Overview
The SRD5A3 gene encodes the enzyme steroid 5 alpha-reductase 3, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the conversion of polyprenol to dolichol, a process essential for N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which are typical of proteins involved in lipid metabolism (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). The SRD5A3 protein is integral to the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which are necessary for the glycosylation of proteins, impacting their stability, function, and cellular localization (Cantagrel2011From; Gründahl2012Life). Mutations in the SRD5A3 gene are linked to a rare congenital disorder of glycosylation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and development (Kousal2019Review; Kara2014Adult).

## Structure
The SRD5A3 gene encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the conversion of polyprenol to dolichol, essential for protein glycosylation. The protein structure includes eight transmembrane α-helices, as revealed by 3D modeling using the I-TASSER server (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). The core structure of the wild-type SRD5A3 (SRD5A3w) is detailed with specific residues forming each helix. A novel missense variant, c.460T>C p.(Ser154Pro), affects the α6-α7 loop, which may act as a lid for the ligand-binding cavity (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). 

The SRD5A3 protein is a membrane-bound enzyme with multiple transmembrane domains, which is typical for proteins involved in lipid metabolism. The tertiary structure of SRD5A3 includes a potential active site where S-ADENOSYL-L-HOMOCYSTEINE (SAH) is predicted to bind (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). The protein's structure was validated using tools like ERRAT and Verify3D, indicating reliable quality (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are likely given the protein's role in glycosylation processes, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The SRD5A3 protein does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as no such information is provided.

## Function
The SRD5A3 gene encodes the enzyme polyprenol reductase, which is crucial for the conversion of polyprenol to dolichol, a key step in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for the proper assembly of N-linked glycans, which are critical for protein glycosylation (Cantagrel2011From; Gründahl2012Life). Dolichol acts as a lipid anchor for the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), which are necessary for the glycosylation of proteins, impacting their stability, function, and cellular localization (Garapati2024Nglycoproteomic; Taylor2017Association).

In healthy cells, SRD5A3 facilitates the reduction of the terminal alpha isoprene unit of polyprenol to dolichol using NADPH, ensuring the availability of dolichol for glycosylation processes (Gründahl2012Life). This function is vital for maintaining normal levels of dolichol, which is necessary for the synthesis of LLOs and proper protein glycosylation (Cantagrel2011From). The enzyme's activity is crucial for various cellular functions, including brain development, neuronal migration, and synaptic physiology (Ben2021SRD5A3‐CDG:3Dstructure). Deficiencies in SRD5A3 can lead to hypoglycosylation, affecting cellular homeostasis and leading to various clinical manifestations (Garapati2024Nglycoproteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRD5A3 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder known as SRD5A3 congenital disorder of glycosylation (SRD5A3-CDG). This condition is characterized by a range of clinical features, including severe early visual impairment, intellectual disability, cerebellar ataxia, and various ocular anomalies such as coloboma, optic nerve hypoplasia, congenital cataract, and glaucoma (Kousal2019Review; Kara2014Adult). Patients may also experience neurological symptoms like hypotonia, ataxia, and movement disorders, as well as dermatologic abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cardiac defects (Daescu2023Characterization; Kamarus2021SRD5A3CDG:).

The disorder is caused by recessive truncating mutations in the SRD5A3 gene, with several different mutations identified, including the common c.57G>A, p.(Trp19Ter) variant (Kamarus2021SRD5A3CDG:; Taylor2017Association). This mutation has been associated with early-onset retinal dystrophy and other ophthalmic manifestations, such as nystagmus and myopia (Taylor2017Association). The phenotypic expression of SRD5A3-CDG varies significantly among individuals and even within families, highlighting the lack of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation (Kara2014Adult).

## Interactions
SRD5A3, a type 3 5α-steroid reductase, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in cellular processes. In breast cancer, SRD5A3 is part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes functional partners such as DOLK, SRD5A1, and HSD17B3. These interactions are associated with protein binding, oxidoreductase activity, and various metabolic pathways, suggesting SRD5A3's role in metabolic and signaling pathways in cancer (Zhang2021Overexpression).

In the context of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), SRD5A3 is crucial for synthesizing lipid precursors necessary for N-linked glycosylation. The deficiency of dolichols in SRD5A3-CDG leads to decreased availability of glycosylation precursors, resulting in protein hypoglycosylation. This impacts the glycosylation machinery and is linked to disruptions in energy metabolism and lysosomal functions (Garapati2024Nglycoproteomic).

In hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), SRD5A3 is overexpressed and plays a role in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), maintaining androgen receptor pathway activation. This interaction is critical for the growth and progression of HRPC cells, even under androgen-depleted conditions (Uemura2007Novel).
