# JAGN1

## Overview
JAGN1 is a gene that encodes the protein jagunal homolog 1, which is a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in protein trafficking, particularly at the ER-Golgi interface, and is essential for the glycosylation of proteins, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including immune responses. Jagunal homolog 1 is involved in the formation of granules in neutrophils, thereby contributing to their cytotoxic function against pathogens. Mutations in the JAGN1 gene are linked to severe congenital neutropenia, a condition that results in increased susceptibility to infections due to impaired neutrophil function (Wirnsberger2014Jagunal; VanWinkle2020JAGN1). The protein's involvement in glycosylation also affects the function of antibodies, influencing immune responses through mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Hagelkruys2020A).

## Function
The JAGN1 gene encodes the Jagunal homolog 1 protein, which is a critical component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in human cells. This protein is involved in protein trafficking, particularly at the ER-Golgi interface, and plays a significant role in the glycosylation of proteins. JAGN1 is essential for the proper formation of granules in neutrophils, which are crucial for their cytotoxic function against pathogens such as Candida albicans (Wirnsberger2014Jagunal; VanWinkle2020JAGN1).

In healthy human cells, JAGN1 is involved in maintaining normal neutrophil numbers and function. It regulates the glycosylation of proteins that are important for cell adhesion, migration, and neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity. This includes the glycosylation of proteins like CD177, CD11b, and CD18, which are vital for neutrophil migration and pathogen clearance (Wirnsberger2014Jagunal).

JAGN1 also plays a role in humoral immunity by influencing the glycosylation of antibodies, particularly affecting the fucosylation of IgG subtypes. This glycosylation is important for the interaction of antibodies with Fc receptors, impacting their half-life and effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Hagelkruys2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JAGN1 gene are associated with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), a condition characterized by a deficiency of neutrophils, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. Patients with JAGN1 mutations often present with recurrent infections, facial dysmorphism, and multisystem involvement, including ocular issues such as monocular convergent strabismus (Hojabri2023JAGN1). These mutations impair protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, crucial for neutrophil homeostasis, and can lead to calpain-dependent apoptosis of neutrophils and abnormalities in N-glycosylation of proteins like IgG (Hojabri2023JAGN1).

JAGN1 mutations also result in altered glycosylation of immunoglobulins, enhancing their binding to Fcγ receptors and complement components, which increases antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by neutrophils (Hagelkruys2020A). In humans, these mutations are linked to severe congenital neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, with patients exhibiting altered Ig glycoprofiles, particularly in the IgG1 subclass (Hagelkruys2020A).

The gene is also implicated in the formation and function of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are crucial for fungal killing. JAGN1 deficiency leads to reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in NETs, compromising their fungicidal capacity (Khandagale2018JAGN1).

## Interactions
JAGN1 (jagunal homolog 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It contains a C-terminal -KKHK sequence that fits the consensus di-lysine motif, recognized by the COPI recycling machinery, suggesting interactions with COPI subunits to facilitate retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus (VanWinkle2020JAGN1). JAGN1 also has di-hydrophobic and di-acidic motifs that may link it to the COPII coating machinery, indicating its involvement in anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi (VanWinkle2020JAGN1).

JAGN1 is homologous to the Drosophila Jagunal, an ER membrane protein involved in ER reorganization and vesicular trafficking, and it may interact with other proteins in the ER, impacting the processing or sorting of myeloperoxidase (MPO) (Khandagale2018JAGN1). The protein is also linked to the regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis in pancreatic β-cells and is speculated to modulate mRNA translation by interacting with ribosomal subunits (Khandagale2018JAGN1). While specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, JAGN1's role in protein sorting and trafficking suggests it may participate in multiprotein complexes (VanWinkle2020JAGN1).
