# MAPK10

## Overview
MAPK10, also known as JNK3, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 10, a member of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) family. This serine-threonine kinase is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a critical role in neuronal functions, including synaptic plasticity and integrity (Kunde2013Characterisation). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as stress response, axonogenesis, and metabolic regulation, by phosphorylating key synaptic and transcriptional proteins (Schellino2019JNK; Kyriakis2012Mammalian). MAPK10's interactions with scaffold and transcription factors are essential for its signaling pathways, impacting both neuronal and immune system functions (Li2021MAPK10). Alterations in MAPK10 have been linked to several clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, Hirschsprung disease, and cognitive disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wang2020MicroRNA4516mediated; Li2021MAPK10).

## Function
MAPK10, also known as JNK3, is a serine-threonine kinase that is part of the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) family, primarily expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (Kunde2013Characterisation). JNK3 plays a significant role in neuronal functions, including the phosphorylation of synaptic proteins such as PSD-95, SAP102, and SHANK3, which are crucial for synaptic function and plasticity (Kunde2013Characterisation). This kinase is involved in the regulation of post-synaptic proteins, maintaining synaptic integrity and function, which is essential for normal neuronal activity (Kunde2013Characterisation).

JNK3 is activated by various stressors and is involved in the phosphorylation of the c-Jun transcription factor, influencing gene expression and cellular responses (Kyriakis2012Mammalian). It is also implicated in axonogenesis, where its phosphorylated form is enriched in axons, necessary for neuronal polarity and axonal growth (Schellino2019JNK). JNK3's activity is crucial for maintaining energy balance and metabolic health, particularly under dietary stress conditions, by promoting leptin signaling in the hypothalamus (Vernia2016Excitatory). These functions underscore the importance of JNK3 in healthy brain function and its potential impact on cognitive processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPK10 gene, also known as JNK3, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAPK10 expression is significantly down-regulated, and low levels are associated with a reduced five-year overall survival rate. High MAPK10 expression correlates with better survival outcomes and is linked to increased immune cell infiltration and reduced cancer cell abundance in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a potential anti-tumor role (Li2021MAPK10).

In Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital disorder affecting the enteric nervous system, MAPK10 is identified as a modifier gene. Variants in the 3′ UTR of MAPK10 are associated with altered susceptibility to HSCR, and its expression is regulated by miR-4516. Knockdown of MAPK10 affects neural cell migration, indicating its role in HSCR pathogenesis (Wang2020MicroRNA4516mediated; Heanue2016A).

MAPK10 mutations are also linked to cognitive disorders. Truncation mutations in MAPK10 result in inactive JNK3 proteins, which are associated with intellectual disability and cognitive delays. These mutations disrupt the phosphorylation of synaptic proteins, potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disturbances (Kunde2013Characterisation).

## Interactions
MAPK10, also known as JNK3, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with scaffold proteins such as JIP1 and b-Arrestin 2, which are crucial for its signaling pathways. However, truncated forms of JNK3 show dramatically reduced interaction with these scaffold proteins, affecting its function (Kunde2013Characterisation). JNK3 also interacts with transcription factors like c-Jun, which it phosphorylates. This phosphorylation is essential for its role in stress signaling pathways, but truncated JNK3 proteins lack this ability, indicating the importance of an intact kinase domain for its function (Kunde2013Characterisation).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAPK10 is associated with the regulation of immune activity through its interaction with ICAM1, a transmembrane protein. This interaction is suggested to mediate the regulation of immune cell recruitment and signaling within the tumor microenvironment (Li2021MAPK10). Additionally, MAPK10 is involved in protein-protein interactions with several hub genes, including SYK, CBL, VAV1, LCK, and CD3G, which are linked to immunological costimulatory signaling (Li2021MAPK10). These interactions highlight MAPK10's role in both neuronal and immune system functions.
