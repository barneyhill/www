# H2BC10

## Overview
H2BC10 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 10, which is a member of the histone family. Histones are essential nuclear proteins that play a critical role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. The H2B clustered histone 10 protein is involved in the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, thereby influencing gene expression and DNA replication. This protein is categorized as a histone, which is integral to the regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene accessibility. Alterations in the expression of H2BC10 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Kanakoglou2020Effects; Zhang2023Regenerating; Vastrad2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
H2BC10 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of high-dose ionizing radiation, H2BC10 was identified as a differentially expressed gene (DEG), suggesting its involvement in the cellular response to radiation exposure (Kanakoglou2020Effects). This highlights its potential role in radiation-induced changes in gene expression, which could have implications for understanding radiation-related health effects.

In cancer research, H2BC10 has been identified as an upregulated gene in hepatoblastoma, a rare liver cancer in children. This upregulation suggests that H2BC10 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as a potential therapeutic target in hepatoblastoma (Vastrad2020Identification). The gene's expression is also downregulated in colorectal cancer, indicating a possible role in tumor suppression or progression in this context (Zhang2023Regenerating).

These findings suggest that H2BC10's expression alterations are associated with various cancer types, potentially affecting tumor behavior and patient outcomes. However, specific mutations in H2BC10 and their direct clinical significance remain less well-documented in the available literature.
