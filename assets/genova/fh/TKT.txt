# TKT

## Overview
The TKT gene encodes the enzyme transketolase, a thiamine diphosphate (TDP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This enzyme is classified as a transferase, facilitating the transfer of two-carbon units between sugar phosphates, which is crucial for the synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate and the generation of NADPH. These functions are essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and maintaining cellular redox balance. Transketolase is active in the cytoplasm and is particularly significant in tissues with high demands for NADPH, such as adipose tissue and mammary glands, where it supports anabolic reactions and oxidative stress defense. The enzyme's activity is also important in ocular tissues, contributing to corneal transparency and refractive properties. Beyond its metabolic roles, transketolase is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes, including cancer progression, where it has been implicated in enhancing cell viability and proliferation through pathways such as EGFR and AKT (Schenk1998Properties; Qin2019Transketolase; Li2022Transketolase; Salamon1998The).

## Structure
The human transketolase (TKT) enzyme is a thiamine diphosphate (TDP)-dependent enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain, with specific regions critical for its function. The secondary structure of TKT includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall fold (Schneider2012A). The tertiary structure is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds, with a pyrimidine-binding domain and a transketolase C-terminal domain (Deshpande2019The).

TKT forms a homodimer, representing its quaternary structure, with two active sites located at the monomer contact surfaces (Deshpande2019The). The enzyme's active site involves a surface cavity where the TDP diphosphate group is stabilized through hydrogen bonds and coordination with an Mg2+ cation. Specific residues such as G156, E157, K75, K244, N185, S40, and H77 are involved in these interactions (Deshpande2019The). The enzyme also features non-polar interactions with residues like T342, I364, L125, F389, and F392, which contribute to its structural stability (Deshpande2019The). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which may affect the enzyme's activity and stability.

## Function
Transketolase (TKT) is a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). It facilitates the transfer of two-carbon units between sugar phosphates, which is essential for the synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor for nucleotide biosynthesis, and for the generation of NADPH, a crucial cofactor in reductive biosynthesis and cellular redox balance (Schenk1998Properties; Kovářová2018Deletion). 

In healthy human cells, TKT is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining metabolic flexibility by linking the PPP with glycolysis. This connection is vital for the production of sugar-phosphate intermediates necessary for various biosynthetic processes, including the synthesis of nucleotides, steroids, and fatty acids (Salamon1998The). TKT's activity is particularly significant in tissues with high demands for NADPH, such as adipose tissue and mammary glands, where it supports anabolic reactions and oxidative stress defense (Schenk1998Properties). 

The enzyme's activity is also crucial in ocular tissues, where it may contribute to structural roles and the removal of light-generated radicals, thus playing a part in maintaining corneal transparency and refractive properties (Salamon1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and localization of the TKT gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high levels of nuclear TKT are associated with increased cell proliferation, viability, and migration, contributing to poor prognosis. This effect is observed even when TKT's enzymatic activity is inhibited, indicating a non-metabolic role in cancer progression. Nuclear TKT interacts with transcription factors and signaling molecules such as EGFR, which may regulate stress responses and cell activation, further promoting HCC development (Qin2019Transketolase).

In ovarian cancer, high TKT expression is linked to poor progression-free survival, although it does not significantly affect overall survival. TKT is upregulated in various ovarian cancer subtypes, and its depletion inhibits cancer cell proliferation. The enzyme's role in cancer involves interactions with proteins like SH2 domain-containing 5 and activation of STAT3 phosphorylation, which promotes cell proliferation (Zhao2019Prognostic).

Beyond cancer, TKT haploinsufficiency in mice leads to growth retardation, reduced adipose tissue, and fertility issues, suggesting that TKT deficiency could have clinical significance in humans, potentially affecting conditions related to growth and metabolism (Xu2002Transketolase).

## Interactions
Transketolase (TKT) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TKT exhibits strong nuclear localization and interacts with several proteins, including kinases and transcriptional coregulators. Notably, TKT interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), which are linked to cell activation and stress response processes (Qin2019Transketolase). These interactions suggest that TKT may enhance cell viability and proliferation through the EGFR pathway (Qin2019Transketolase).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TKT interacts with the protein GRP78, promoting aerobic glycolysis by enhancing AKT phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for CRC cell metastasis, as TKT's effect on AKT phosphorylation and glycolysis is dependent on GRP78 (Li2022Transketolase). 

Additionally, in Dictyostelium, TKT interacts with the Atg1 complex, suggesting a connection between autophagy and the pentose phosphate pathway. Although TKT does not directly modulate autophagy, alterations in Atg1 levels affect TKT activity, indicating a regulatory relationship (Mesquita2015Dissecting). These interactions highlight TKT's involvement in diverse cellular pathways and its potential regulatory roles.
