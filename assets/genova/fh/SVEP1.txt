# SVEP1

## Overview
SVEP1, or sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a large, multi-domain extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The protein, often referred to as Polydom, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as von Willebrand factor type A, EGF-like calcium-binding, and pentraxin, among others. These domains facilitate its role as a cell surface adhesion molecule, crucial for maintaining cellular communication and tissue integrity. SVEP1 interacts with integrin α9β1 and the orphan receptor PEAR1, influencing pathways related to cardiovascular health and platelet reactivity. It is expressed in various tissues, including bone and skin, and plays significant roles in skeletal homeostasis, hematopoiesis, and lymphatic development. Clinically, SVEP1 is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as certain cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target (Elenbaas2023SVEP1; SatoNishiuchi2012PolydomSVEP1; Shur2005Molecular).

## Structure
The SVEP1 protein, also known as sushi, von Willebrand factor type A, EGF, and pentraxin domain containing 1, is a large extracellular matrix protein with a complex structure. It has a predicted molecular weight of 370 kDa and consists of 3574 amino acids (Shur2005Molecular). The protein is characterized by multiple domains, including a von Willebrand factor type A domain, two Hyalin repeat domains, a TNF receptor cysteine-rich domain, a pentraxin domain, an RGD cell attachment site, two EGF domains, seven EGF-like calcium-binding domains, and 34 complement control protein (CCP) repeats (Shur2005Molecular). These domains suggest a role in cell adhesion processes, similar to the selectin family of adhesion proteins, although SVEP1 lacks a lectin domain (Shur2005Molecular).

SVEP1 is also known as Polydom and functions as a ligand for integrin α9β1, with the binding site located in the 21st CCP domain, specifically the EDDMMEVPY sequence (SatoNishiuchi2012PolydomSVEP1). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing into two fragments, a 115-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 270-kDa C-terminal fragment, which remain associated post-cleavage (SatoNishiuchi2012PolydomSVEP1). This processing likely occurs after secretion, indicating a complex quaternary structure. The presence of multiple domains and post-translational modifications like glycosylation may influence its function and stability.

## Function
The SVEP1 gene encodes a multi-domain protein involved in cell adhesion processes, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular communication and tissue integrity. It contains domains such as von Willebrand factor type A, EGF-like calcium binding domains, and pentraxin, which are characteristic of proteins involved in cell adhesion and matrix assembly (Shur2005Molecular). SVEP1 functions as a cell surface adhesion molecule, facilitating the initial attachment of cells, particularly in mesenchymal stem cells and osteogenic tissues, which is essential for skeletal homeostasis and bone marrow microenvironment interactions (Shur2005Molecular).

SVEP1 is expressed in various tissues, including bone, periosteum, and skin, where it is involved in epidermal differentiation and the expression of differentiation-associated genes (Samuelov2017SVEP1). It acts as a ligand for integrin α9β1, mediating cell adhesion in an integrin-dependent manner, which is important for processes like lymphatic valve morphogenesis and wound healing (SatoNishiuchi2012PolydomSVEP1). In the context of hematopoiesis, SVEP1 supports the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells by anchoring them to stromal niches, influencing myeloid cell development (Tran2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SVEP1 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. SVEP1 is implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis, where it promotes the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and influences integrin signaling, contributing to plaque development in arteries (Jung2021SVEP1). A specific missense polymorphism, D2072G, in SVEP1 is linked to increased plasma SVEP1 protein levels, correlating with a higher risk of CAD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes (Jung2021SVEP1).

SVEP1 also plays a role in cancer, with its expression being downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). In HCC, low SVEP1 expression is associated with increased tumor size, metastasis, and poor prognosis, likely through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Chen2020The). In ICC, decreased SVEP1 expression correlates with abnormal neovascularization and poor prognosis, affecting vascular stability through the Ang-1/Tie pathway (Chen2023The).

SVEP1 is also linked to platelet reactivity and cardiovascular diseases through its interaction with the orphan receptor PEAR1, influencing platelet activation and cardiovascular risk (Elenbaas2023SVEP1). These findings suggest that SVEP1 is a potential therapeutic target for various conditions.

## Interactions
SVEP1, a multi-domain protein, engages in several significant interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the orphan receptor PEAR1, where it acts as an endogenous ligand. This interaction promotes PEAR1 phosphorylation and activates AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, which are associated with cardiovascular disease and platelet reactivity (Elenbaas2023SVEP1). The interaction between SVEP1 and PEAR1 is characterized by a high affinity, as confirmed by molecular assays such as biolayer interferometry and co-immunoprecipitation (Elenbaas2023SVEP1).

SVEP1 also binds to integrin α9β1 with high affinity, surpassing other known ligands like tenascin-C and osteopontin. This interaction is crucial for processes such as lymphatic valve morphogenesis and wound healing, with the binding site located on the 21st complement control protein domain of SVEP1 (SatoNishiuchi2012PolydomSVEP1).

In addition, SVEP1 interacts with the TIE1 receptor, playing a role in lymphatic development. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved and specific, as demonstrated in both zebrafish and human studies (Hußmann2023Svep1). These interactions highlight SVEP1's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
