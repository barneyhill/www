# PUS1

## Overview
The PUS1 gene encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 1, which is a critical component in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This enzyme belongs to the class of pseudouridine synthases, which catalyze the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in various RNA molecules, including tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA. Pseudouridine synthase 1 is essential for the stability and function of these RNA molecules, playing a significant role in protein synthesis and cellular energy metabolism. The enzyme is predominantly localized in the mitochondria, where it is involved in the pseudouridylation of mitochondrial tRNAs, although it also acts on cytoplasmic tRNAs and U2 snRNA, indicating a broader role in RNA metabolism (Carlile2014Pseudouridine; Bykhovskaya2004Missense). Mutations in the PUS1 gene are linked to mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia, while alterations in its expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Jin2022Integrative; Fang2022PUS1).

## Structure
The PUS1 protein, encoded by the PUS1 gene, is a pseudouridine synthase involved in the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA molecules. The primary structure of PUS1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific motifs essential for its catalytic function. A notable motif is the RTDKGV sequence, which is highly conserved across pseudouridine synthases and crucial for the protein's catalytic activity (Bykhovskaya2004Missense).

The secondary structure of PUS1 consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the formation of its catalytic domain. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with RNA substrates. Structural studies have shown that PUS1 binds to RNA duplexes, with specific amino acid residues making extensive contacts with the RNA strands. These interactions are organized into clusters of residues that are largely conserved across eukaryotic PUS1 homologues (Grünberg2023The).

PUS1 functions as a monomer when binding to RNA, with no significant contacts between protein subunits, indicating a lack of quaternary structure in its active form (Grünberg2021The). The protein's structure is adapted to recognize and bind helical RNA duplexes, guiding the RNA into the enzyme's active site for modification (Grünberg2023The).

## Function
Pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, specifically through the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine. This modification is essential for the stability and function of RNA molecules, including tRNA and rRNA, which are crucial for protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, PUS1 is involved in the pseudouridylation of mitochondrial tRNAs, a process vital for their proper functioning and, consequently, for efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy metabolism (Suzuki2011Human; Bykhovskaya2004Missense).

PUS1 is widely expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in skeletal muscle and brain, indicating its importance in these energy-demanding tissues (Bykhovskaya2004Missense). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized in the mitochondria, although it lacks a clear mitochondrial targeting sequence (Bykhovskaya2004Missense). PUS1 also modifies multiple positions in cytoplasmic tRNAs and U2 snRNA, suggesting a broader role in RNA metabolism beyond mitochondrial function (Carlile2014Pseudouridine). The enzyme's function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial tRNA, which is essential for overall cellular energy metabolism and organismal health (Bykhovskaya2004Missense).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PUS1 gene are associated with mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and anemia, resulting from a disruption in mitochondrial function due to a missense mutation in PUS1. The mutation, specifically a C656T change leading to an R116W amino acid substitution, occurs in a highly conserved region of the gene, believed to be the catalytic center of the protein (Bykhovskaya2004Missense). 

In addition to genetic mutations, alterations in PUS1 expression levels have clinical significance in cancer. PUS1 is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and is linked to poor prognosis and triple-negative breast cancer status. High PUS1 expression correlates with shorter overall and relapse-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Fang2022PUS1). 

PUS1 is also significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it serves as a diagnostic marker and is associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis. Its involvement in cancer-related pathways suggests a role in tumor progression (Jin2022Integrative).

## Interactions
PUS1 interacts with various RNA substrates, including tRNA, mRNA, and snRNA, to catalyze the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine. This enzyme is known for its broad specificity, modifying uridines at multiple positions within these RNA molecules. PUS1's interaction with RNA is facilitated by its ability to bind to a helical RNA duplex, making extensive contacts with both strands. Specific amino acid residues, such as arginine 132 and arginine 362, are crucial for its activity, as they contact opposite strands in the RNA double helix, supporting the importance of RNA structure for substrate binding and positioning of the pseudouridylation site (Grünberg2021The; Grünberg2023The).

PUS1 also interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing. It plays a role in the nuclear export of specific tRNAs through interactions with the nuclear export receptor Los1 and nucleoporin Nsp1. This interaction is essential for the export of tRNAs from the nucleus, as evidenced by impaired nuclear export in PUS1 deletion strains (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic). Additionally, PUS1 binds to the retinoic acid receptor and modifies the steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), a non-coding RNA in humans, contributing to the activation of nuclear receptors (Rintala-Dempsey2017Eukaryotic).
