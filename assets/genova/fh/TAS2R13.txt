# TAS2R13

## Overview
TAS2R13 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 13, which is part of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known for their seven transmembrane helices, which facilitate the detection of bitter compounds. The TAS2R13 protein is primarily expressed on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue, where it plays a critical role in the perception of bitterness, a sensory mechanism that helps organisms avoid potentially toxic substances (Meyerhof2011Molecular; Duarte2020Bitter). Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R13 is also expressed in human choroid plexus tissue, suggesting additional functions that are yet to be fully understood (Duarte2020Bitter). Alterations in the expression of the TAS2R13 gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, indicating its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation; Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

## Structure
The TAS2R13 protein is a member of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by their seven transmembrane helices. These helices are connected by three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops, with a short extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus (Pallante2021On). The primary structure of TAS2R13 consists of amino acid sequences that form these helices, contributing to the receptor's ability to detect bitter compounds.

The secondary structure of TAS2R13 includes alpha helices typical of GPCRs, which are involved in forming the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these helices, creating a binding pocket that accommodates ligands through interactions with specific amino acids. The N-terminal cavity of TAS2R13 is hydrophobic, containing amino acids such as VAL248, PHE181, ILE167, and TYR263, which interact with ligands like theasinensin A through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Zhang2023Bitterness).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of TAS2R receptors, although specific modifications for TAS2R13 are not detailed in the provided context (Meyerhof2011Molecular). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, a common feature in GPCRs, but specific details for TAS2R13 are not available in the context.

## Function
TAS2R13 is a member of the TAS2R family of bitter taste receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of bitter compounds. These receptors are primarily located on the surface of taste receptor cells in the tongue, where they play a crucial role in the perception of bitterness, a sensory mechanism that helps organisms avoid ingesting potentially toxic substances (Meyerhof2011Molecular; Duarte2020Bitter).

The TAS2R receptors, including TAS2R13, are characterized by their ability to recognize multiple bitter compounds through a single binding pocket that interacts with different sets of amino acids. This allows them to detect a wide range of bitter substances, although the specific compounds recognized by TAS2R13 are not detailed in the provided context (Meyerhof2011Molecular).

Upon activation by bitter compounds, TAS2R receptors initiate a signaling cascade involving the release of ATP, which excites afferent nerves and transmits gustatory information to the brain. This process integrates with other sensory information to influence ingestive behavior and maintain energy homeostasis (Meyerhof2011Molecular). The expression of TAS2R13 in human choroid plexus tissue and cells suggests a potential role beyond taste perception, although its specific function in these tissues remains to be elucidated (Duarte2020Bitter).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TAS2R13 gene have been associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), TAS2R13 expression is upregulated in the entorhinal cortex during stages III-IV, but no changes are observed in the frontal cortex (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In contrast, in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), TAS2R13, along with other taste receptors, is significantly upregulated in the frontal cortex (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), TAS2R13 expression is upregulated in the VV2 subtype but not in the MM1 subtype, indicating a subtype-specific expression pattern (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

In chronic schizophrenia, TAS2R13 expression is significantly downregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a change that persists even after adjusting for RNA integrity and antipsychotic medication dosage (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). This downregulation may be linked to the effects of antipsychotic treatments and is not associated with the duration or severity of the disease (Ansoleaga2015Decrease).

These findings suggest that TAS2R13 expression alterations may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, potentially influenced by epigenetic mechanisms and medication effects.
