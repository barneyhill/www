# OR52N4

## Overview
OR52N4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily N member 4, which is part of the class I odorant receptors in mammals. These receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is integral to the detection and transduction of odorant signals, thereby contributing to the sense of smell. The protein encoded by OR52N4 is characterized by a conserved vestibular-binding pocket, which is crucial for ligand recognition and binding, similar to other non-olfactory GPCRs (Bushdid2019Mammalian). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR52N4 is also expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional roles beyond olfaction, although these roles remain to be fully elucidated (Malki2015Class).

## Function
OR52N4 is a member of the class I odorant receptors (ORs) in mammals, which are part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. OR52N4, like other class I ORs, features a conserved vestibular-binding pocket that is significant for ligand recognition and binding. This site is similar to those found in non-olfactory GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor, and is involved in the binding of more hydrophilic compounds compared to class II ORs (Bushdid2019Mammalian).

In terms of expression, OR52N4 is notably expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential regulatory roles beyond olfaction. However, specific functions of OR52N4 in these tissues have not been detailed (Bushdid2019Mammalian). Despite its expression in different tissues, OR52N4 was not detected in human blood leukocytes, indicating a selective expression pattern (Malki2015Class). The receptor's role in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored, but its presence in diverse tissues hints at broader physiological functions that warrant further investigation.
