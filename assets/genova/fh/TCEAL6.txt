# TCEAL6

## Overview
TCEAL6, or transcription elongation factor A-like 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription. The TCEAL6 protein is part of a family of transcription elongation factors that play a crucial role in modulating gene expression by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of cervical cancer, TCEAL6 expression is regulated by the circular RNA hsa_circ_0101119, which recruits the RNA-binding protein EIF4A3 to inhibit TCEAL6 translation. This regulatory mechanism is significant in cancer progression, as TCEAL6 is implicated in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, acting as a potential tumor suppressor (Sui2021hsacirc0101119).

## Clinical Significance
TCEAL6 is implicated in cervical cancer progression through its interaction with hsa_circ_0101119 and EIF4A3. In cervical cancer cells, hsa_circ_0101119 is highly expressed and recruits EIF4A3, which inhibits TCEAL6 expression. This suppression of TCEAL6 is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while reducing apoptosis. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0101119 or overexpression of TCEAL6 leads to increased apoptosis and decreased cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting that TCEAL6 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context. The regulatory axis of hsa_circ_0101119/EIF4A3/TCEAL6 is significant in cervical cancer, with TCEAL6 overexpression showing potential to counteract cancer progression (Sui2021hsacirc0101119).

The study highlights that alterations in TCEAL6 expression, mediated by hsa_circ_0101119 and EIF4A3, could be significant in cervical cancer progression. However, the direct clinical significance of TCEAL6 mutations or expression alterations is not explicitly discussed in the context provided (Sui2021hsacirc0101119).

## Interactions
TCEAL6, a transcription elongation factor A-like protein, is involved in transcription regulation and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. In cervical cancer cells, TCEAL6 expression is inhibited by the circular RNA hsa_circ_0101119 through its interaction with the RNA-binding protein EIF4A3. This interaction is crucial for cervical cancer progression, as hsa_circ_0101119 recruits EIF4A3 to bind to TCEAL6 mRNA, thereby inhibiting its translation. The suppression of TCEAL6 expression by EIF4A3 is evidenced by the negative correlation between their expression levels in cervical cancer cells (Sui2021hsacirc0101119).

Experimental assays, such as RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down, have confirmed the interaction between hsa_circ_0101119 and EIF4A3, as well as between EIF4A3 and TCEAL6 mRNA. These interactions suggest that TCEAL6 is part of a regulatory network involving circular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, which modulate its expression and function in cancer cells (Sui2021hsacirc0101119). The modulation of TCEAL6 expression by these interactions highlights its potential role in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in cervical cancer (Sui2021hsacirc0101119).
