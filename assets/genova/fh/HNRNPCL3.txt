# HNRNPCL3

## Overview
HNRNPCL3 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C like 3, which is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs and play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. HNRNPCL3, like other hnRNPs, is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is associated with nuclear speckles and paraspeckles, where it influences mRNA stability, transport, and folding (Tilliole2024hnRNPs:). The protein is also implicated in alternative splicing, allowing for the generation of diverse protein isoforms from a single gene (Piazzi2023Alternative). Furthermore, HNRNPCL3 is part of the nuclear exosome-adaptor complexes, specifically the NNS complex, indicating its involvement in RNA processing or degradation pathways (Ogami2018RNA). The dysregulation of HNRNPCL3 has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Singhto2024Extracellular; Czajkowska2024Exploring).

## Function
HNRNPCL3 is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, which are multifunctional RNA-binding proteins involved in the processing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs and the regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, HNRNPCL3 is part of the nuclear exosome-adaptor complexes, specifically the NNS complex, suggesting its involvement in RNA processing or degradation pathways (Ogami2018RNA). hnRNPs, including HNRNPCL3, play a crucial role in alternative splicing, a process that allows a single gene to produce multiple mRNA variants, leading to diverse protein isoforms with distinct functions (Piazzi2023Alternative).

These proteins are primarily localized in the nucleus due to a nuclear localization sequence and are abundant in nuclear speckles and paraspeckles, where they influence mRNA stability, transport, and folding (Tilliole2024hnRNPs:). hnRNPs, including HNRNPCL3, are involved in the formation of membraneless organelles and have roles in DNA interactions, particularly in telomere biogenesis and DNA damage response (Tilliole2024hnRNPs:). The expression and function of hnRNPs are finely tuned during development and vary across tissues, with their dysregulation linked to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Piazzi2023Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPCL3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. In the context of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D), downregulation of HNRNPCL3 has been observed, which may affect metabolic properties and systemic insulin sensitivity by inhibiting glycogen synthesis. This suggests that HNRNPCL3 plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and could impact insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism (Czajkowska2024Exploring).

In cancer research, HNRNPCL3 has been identified as a potential biomarker for aggressive medulloblastoma, a type of childhood brain cancer. Its expression, along with other proteins and microRNAs, could aid in diagnosis, patient stratification, and early detection of relapsed disease (Singhto2024Extracellular).

Additionally, HNRNPCL3 is involved in the antiproliferative effects of caerin peptides on TC-1 cervical cancer cells. The downregulation of HNRNPCL3, along with other proteins, suggests a negative impact on the membrane integrity of cancer cells, reducing cell migration and proliferation (Ni2018Comparative).

In the context of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss, HNRNPCL3 is mentioned as part of a heterozygous deletion in a specific chromosomal region, although its clinical significance in this condition is not explicitly detailed (YILDIZ2022Copy).
