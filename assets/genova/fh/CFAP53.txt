# CFAP53

## Overview
CFAP53 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 53, a coiled-coil protein integral to the function and motility of cilia and flagella in mammals. This protein is particularly important in the regulation of ciliary motility, playing a crucial role in the transport and stabilization of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary movement. CFAP53 is involved in various physiological processes, including the establishment of left-right asymmetry during embryonic development and the function of motile cilia in tissues such as the trachea, brain ventricles, oviducts, and testes (Ide2020CFAP53). Mutations in the CFAP53 gene are linked to clinical conditions such as male infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), laterality defects like situs inversus, and primary ciliary dyskinesia (Wu2021Essential; Noël2015A).

## Function
The CFAP53 gene encodes a coiled-coil protein that is crucial for the regulation of ciliary motility in mammals. It plays a significant role in the motility of different cilia types, particularly the 9+0 node cilia, which are essential for establishing left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. In node cilia, CFAP53 is localized at the base and is involved in the transport of TTC25 and outer dynein arms (ODAs), which are critical for ciliary movement (Ide2020CFAP53). 

In tracheal cilia, CFAP53 is associated with axonemal microtubules and interacts with dynein proteins and the dynein docking complex, particularly TTC25. This interaction suggests that CFAP53 stabilizes the attachment of ODAs to microtubules, influencing the motility patterns of these cilia (Ide2020CFAP53). The protein's absence leads to the loss of certain dynein proteins from node cilia axonemes, resulting in impaired motility (Ide2020CFAP53).

CFAP53 is also expressed in other tissues with motile cilia, such as the trachea, brain ventricles, oviducts, and testes, indicating its broader role in ciliary function across different physiological processes (Ide2020CFAP53).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP53 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary and flagellar function. In males, CFAP53 mutations can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), characterized by malformed spermatozoa with short, coiled, or absent flagella, resulting in male infertility (Wu2021Essential). The absence of CFAP53 disrupts the intramanchette and intraflagellar transport pathways, crucial for sperm flagellum biogenesis, leading to impaired sperm development (Wu2021Essential).

CFAP53 mutations are also linked to laterality defects, such as situs inversus and heterotaxy, where the normal left-right asymmetry of organs is disrupted. This is due to impaired ciliary motility in the embryonic node, which affects the expression of genes involved in establishing organ laterality (Ide2020CFAP53; Noël2015A). In zebrafish models, CFAP53 mutations result in randomized expression of laterality genes and disrupted organ positioning, mirroring human heterotaxy syndromes (Noël2015A).

Additionally, CFAP53 mutations have been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a condition characterized by respiratory issues and infertility, although specific motility defects in respiratory cilia have not been extensively described in humans (Wheway2021Whole).

## Interactions
CFAP53 is known to participate in various protein interactions essential for its role in cilia and flagella function. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly and stability of protein complexes. CFAP53 interacts with proteins involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) and intramanchette transport (IMT), such as IFT88 and CCDC42, which are crucial for sperm flagellum biogenesis. These interactions suggest that CFAP53 may regulate IFT and/or IMT processes, stabilizing proteins like CCDC42 for transport to the developing sperm tail (Wu2021Essential).

In cilia, CFAP53 interacts with axonemal dyneins and TTC25, a component of the dynein docking complex. It is involved in the transport and stable attachment of dynein components to the axoneme, which is essential for ciliary motility. CFAP53 specifically interacts with dynein intermediate chains DNAIC1, DNAIC2, and the heavy chain DNAH11, as well as with TTC25, facilitating their transport into the axoneme (Ide2020CFAP53).

In zebrafish embryos, CFAP53 is crucial for the formation of the first zygotic microtubule organizing center (MTOC), interacting with centriolar satellite proteins and centrosomal components to facilitate the recruitment of γ-tubulin to the MTOC (Willekers2020The).
