# GDPD2

## Overview
GDPD2 is a gene that encodes the protein glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 2, also known as GDE3. This protein is categorized as a lysophosphatidylinositol-specific ectophospholipase C, playing a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing glycerophosphodiesters into glycerol-3-phosphate and inositol-1-phosphate (BriandMésange2020Glycerophosphodiesterase). GDE3 is predominantly expressed in differentiated osteoblasts, where it contributes to bone development by enhancing alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content (Corda2014The). Additionally, it is involved in the endocannabinoid system, influencing neuroinflammation and cell proliferation, and is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen and smooth muscle (BriandMésange2020Glycerophosphodiesterase). The protein's activity is metal-dependent, particularly on calcium ions, and it is implicated in cellular differentiation processes, affecting cell morphology (Corda2014The).

## Function
GDPD2, also known as GDE3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, specifically functioning as a lysophosphatidylinositol-specific ectophospholipase C. This protein plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters, converting them into glycerol-3-phosphate and inositol-1-phosphate (Ins1P) (BriandMésange2020Glycerophosphodiesterase). GDPD2 is expressed at high levels in differentiated osteoblasts and is involved in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. It enhances alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content, which are essential for bone development (Corda2014The). The protein is localized extracellularly and exhibits phospholipase C-like activity, hydrolyzing GroPIns to glycerol and Ins1P, with its activity being metal-dependent, particularly on Ca2+ (Corda2014The).

GDPD2 is also implicated in the endocannabinoid system, acting as a signaling switch that may influence neuroinflammation and cell proliferation. It is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen and smooth muscle, and may play a role in immune system functions (BriandMésange2020Glycerophosphodiesterase). The protein's activity is linked to morphological changes in cells, such as cell rounding and actin filament disappearance, which are associated with its role in cellular differentiation processes (Corda2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The GDPD2 gene encodes the GDE2 protein, which plays a significant role in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In ALS, the function of GDE2 is disrupted, leading to abnormal intracellular accumulation and reduced membrane-bound levels in motor neurons. This disruption is associated with decreased release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are crucial for neuronal survival, contributing to motor neuron degeneration in ALS patients (Westerhaus2022The). 

Although total levels of GDE2 protein remain unchanged in ALS patients, its functional distribution is altered, with significant accumulation in intracellular compartments of neurons, glial cells, and vascular endothelia. This abnormal distribution suggests that GDE2's neuroprotective function is compromised, potentially exacerbating neurodegenerative changes (Westerhaus2022The). 

Research indicates that GDE2 dysfunction in ALS may be due to impaired trafficking and endocytic recycling, rather than direct mutations in the GDPD2 gene. This impaired trafficking is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a broader implication of GDE2 dysfunction in conditions like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases (SalgadoPolo2019Sequencedependent).
