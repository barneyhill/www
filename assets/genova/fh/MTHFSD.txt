# MTHFSD

## Overview
The MTHFSD gene encodes the methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase domain containing protein, which is involved in cellular stress response mechanisms. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a significant role in the formation and function of stress granules, which are critical for mRNA metabolism under stress conditions. MTHFSD has been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly through its interactions with TDP-43, a protein associated with ALS pathology. The gene's expression and localization are altered in ALS, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular mechanisms (MacNair2015MTHFSD). Additionally, genetic studies have identified rare variants of MTHFSD in specific populations, further indicating its potential role in ALS (Goldstein2019Rare).

## Clinical Significance
The MTHFSD gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. In ALS, MTHFSD is identified as a novel RNA-binding protein that is abnormally regulated. Studies have shown that in TDP-43 A315T transgenic mouse models, which mimic ALS pathology, MTHFSD expression is altered, with reduced nuclear presence and increased cytoplasmic granules in motor neurons. This mislocalization is particularly significant in non-c9-ALS cases and is associated with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, a hallmark of ALS pathology (MacNair2015MTHFSD).

MTHFSD is also a component of stress granules induced by oxidative stress, and its expression is downregulated in ALS motor neurons. The gene's interaction with TDP-43 suggests a role in ALS pathogenesis, as TDP-43 binds to MTHFSD mRNA, potentially contributing to the disease's molecular mechanisms (MacNair2015MTHFSD).

Additionally, a study on North-African Jewish ALS patients identified a rare homozygous variant in the MTHFSD gene, suggesting that recessive alleles may contribute to ALS genetics (Goldstein2019Rare). However, no other diseases or conditions have been directly linked to MTHFSD mutations or expression alterations beyond its implication in ALS.

## Interactions
MTHFSD is involved in interactions with RNA and proteins, particularly in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is identified as a component of stress granules, which are structures that form in response to cellular stress and are involved in mRNA metabolism. MTHFSD partially co-localizes with TDP-43 and the stress granule marker G3BP in HeLa cells treated with sodium arsenite, indicating its role in stress granule assembly (MacNair2015MTHFSD). TDP-43, a protein pathologically associated with ALS, directly targets MTHFSD. Both MTHFSD and DDX58 contain UG-rich repeats, which are known binding motifs for TDP-43. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that TDP-43 binds to MTHFSD mRNA (MacNair2015MTHFSD).

In ALS cases, MTHFSD is depleted from the nucleus, with some cytoplasmic staining observed, coinciding with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, a hallmark of ALS pathology (MacNair2015MTHFSD). This mislocalization suggests that MTHFSD may play a role in ALS pathogenesis through its interactions with TDP-43 and involvement in stress granule dynamics (MacNair2015MTHFSD).
