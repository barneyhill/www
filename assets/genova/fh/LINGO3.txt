# LINGO3

## Overview
LINGO3 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat and Ig domain containing 3, which is a member of the LINGO family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and facilitating tissue repair, particularly within the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It is predominantly expressed in mucosal epithelial cells and plays a critical role in epithelial proliferation and repair following injury. LINGO3 interacts with Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) and is involved in MAPK signal transduction, which is essential for epithelial cell proliferation and recovery during wound healing. The protein's structural homology to receptors involved in Wnt signaling suggests a potential regulatory role in stem cell niches, contributing to its function in epithelial repair mechanisms. LINGO3's interactions and signaling pathways underscore its importance in both neural and epithelial cellular environments, with significant implications for conditions such as colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases (Zullo2018LINGO3; Zullo2021LINGO3).

## Function
The LINGO3 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and facilitating tissue repair, particularly in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It is predominantly expressed in mucosal epithelial cells, where it interacts with Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) to enhance epithelial proliferation and repair following injury (Zullo2018LINGO3). LINGO3 is involved in MAPK signal transduction, which is essential for epithelial cell proliferation and recovery of trans-epithelial resistance during wound healing (Zullo2018LINGO3).

In healthy human cells, LINGO3 is expressed in the intestinal mucosa and nasal polyp tissues, localizing to the apical and basolateral surfaces of colonic enterocytes and within the crypt base, which is consistent with its role in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche (Zullo2021LINGO3). The protein is necessary for the activation of signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and STAT3, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival (Zullo2021LINGO3). LINGO3's structural homology to receptors involved in Wnt signaling suggests a potential role in regulating stem cell niches, contributing to its function in epithelial repair mechanisms independent of TFF2 (Zullo2021LINGO3).

## Clinical Significance
LINGO3 plays a significant role in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and is involved in tissue repair processes, particularly in the context of colitis. Alterations in LINGO3 expression or function are associated with increased intestinal permeability and heightened inflammatory responses, which can lead to conditions such as colitis. LINGO3 deficiency results in increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, characterized by enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration, ulceration, and reduced expression of intestinal stem cell genes like Lgr5 (Zullo2018LINGO3). The absence of LINGO3 also leads to impaired intestinal goblet cell repopulation and increased paracellular permeability, which further exacerbates inflammation (Zullo2018LINGO3).

The interaction between LINGO3 and Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) is crucial for epithelial proliferation and repair. LINGO3 is proposed to function as a receptor component for TFF2 signaling, and its deficiency mirrors the phenotype observed in Tff2-deficient mice, suggesting a coordinated role in maintaining mucosal barrier integrity (Zullo2018LINGO3). These findings indicate that LINGO3 is a novel regulator of TFF2 responsiveness, and alterations in its expression or function could contribute to gastrointestinal inflammation and impaired mucosal barrier integrity, highlighting its clinical significance in inflammatory bowel diseases (Zullo2018LINGO3).

## Interactions
LINGO3, a member of the LINGO family of proteins, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. LINGO3 can form heterodimers with other LINGO family members, such as LINGO-1, through direct protein-protein interactions. This interaction has been demonstrated using coimmunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) analysis in HEK-293 cells, as well as in mouse brain tissues, indicating the formation of heterocomplexes in both cellular models and in vivo (Guillemain2020LINGO).

In the context of mucosal barrier integrity and tissue repair, LINGO3 interacts with Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2). This interaction is essential for maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and promoting tissue repair during colitis. LINGO3 and TFF2 co-localize at the cell membrane, and TFF2 functionally interacts with LINGO3 to induce MAPK signal transduction, specifically ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The absence of LINGO3 results in reduced TFF2-mediated signaling and proliferation, highlighting its critical role in epithelial repair processes (Zullo2018LINGO3). These interactions suggest that LINGO3 is a key component in both neural and epithelial cellular environments, participating in complex signaling pathways.
