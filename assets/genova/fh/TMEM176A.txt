# TMEM176A

## Overview
TMEM176A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 176A, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein involved in ion transport and immune regulation. The protein is primarily localized near the trans-Golgi network and within vesicular structures, suggesting its role in intracellular trafficking and vesicular transport processes (Drujont2016RORγt+). TMEM176A is crucial for the optimal functioning of dendritic cells, particularly in antigen presentation and the regulation of intracellular ion flows, which are essential for immune cell homeostasis (Lancien2019Dendritic; Lancien2021Dendritic). Additionally, TMEM176A has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential role as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and as a prognostic marker in triple-negative breast cancer (Zhang2023Immune; Li2018Epigenetic). The gene's involvement in these diverse biological processes underscores its significance in both cellular function and disease pathology.

## Structure


## Function
TMEM176A is a transmembrane protein involved in ion transport and immune regulation. It functions as a cation channel, primarily localized near the trans-Golgi network and in vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm. This localization suggests a role in vesicular transport or recycling processes within the cell (Drujont2016RORγt+). TMEM176A, along with its homologue TMEM176B, is involved in intracellular ion flows, particularly in the Golgi apparatus, which may be crucial for processes like protein transport and glycosylation (Drujont2016RORγt+).

In dendritic cells, TMEM176A is essential for optimal MHC class II antigen presentation to naive CD4+ T cells. It participates in the intracellular trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and endolysosomal compartments, which is crucial for antigen processing and presentation (Lancien2019Dendritic; Lancien2021Dendritic). TMEM176A is also implicated in the regulated acidification of the MIIC compartment, potentially through cation efflux, which is important for stabilizing DM-MHC II interactions and efficient MHC II trafficking (Lancien2019Dendritic; Lancien2021Dendritic). These functions highlight TMEM176A's role in immune cell function and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM176A has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM176A is often silenced through hypermethylation of its promoter region, leading to decreased expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This silencing is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting that TMEM176A acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the ERK signaling pathway (Li2018Epigenetic). The methylation status of TMEM176A is also linked to poor prognosis in HCC, making it a potential biomarker for the disease (Li2018Epigenetic).

In schizophrenia, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TMEM176A, rs10378, has been associated with increased risk. This SNP is thought to have a deleterious effect, although replication studies have not consistently confirmed this association (Kos2017Exome).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TMEM176A is part of a gene cluster associated with better prognosis and immune response. Higher expression of TMEM176A correlates with a favorable immune status, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker in TNBC (Zhang2023Immune). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM176A in various diseases.

## Interactions
TMEM176A has been shown to interact with SAR1A, a GTP-binding protein, in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is significant as it is associated with the inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway, which plays a role in cell proliferation and survival. The interaction between TMEM176A and SAR1A was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays and validated by Western blot analysis. The re-expression of TMEM176A in HCC cells led to reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, indicating that TMEM176A, through its interaction with SAR1A, can suppress ERK signaling, thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion (Li2018Epigenetic).

In the context of immune function, TMEM176A, along with TMEM176B, is involved in the regulation of dendritic cell maturation and function. These proteins are implicated in maintaining the immature state of dendritic cells, potentially through forming multimers or complexes that influence dendritic cell maturation. However, the specific molecular mechanisms and protein interactions involving TMEM176A in this context remain unclear (Picotto2020TMEM176A). The role of TMEM176A in immune regulation suggests its potential involvement in broader cellular signaling pathways, although detailed interactions are still under investigation.
