# MLC1

## Overview
MLC1 is a gene that encodes the protein modulator of VRAC current 1, a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in astrocytes. This protein is integral to the regulation of ion and water homeostasis, as well as cellular morphology and motility, through its interactions with various ion channels and the actin cytoskeleton. MLC1 is characterized by its eight transmembrane domains and its ability to form multimeric structures, which are crucial for its function in maintaining astrocytic endfeet integrity and cell-cell communication. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as GlialCAM and components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, underscore its role in osmoregulation and pH control. Mutations in the MLC1 gene are linked to megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a rare neurological disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Brignone2015MLC1; Boor2007MLC1).

## Structure
The MLC1 protein is a 377-amino acid membrane protein characterized by its highly hydrophobic nature and the presence of eight predicted transmembrane domains (Ambrosini2008Biochemical; Brignone2015MLC1). The protein has short amino and carboxylic-cytoplasmic tails and contains an internal repeat structure, resulting in partial homology between the two halves of the protein, similar to several ion channels (Brignone2015MLC1). Despite these features, MLC1 shows very low homology with known proteins, except for minor similarity with the shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 α subunit (Brignone2015MLC1; Teijido2004Localization).

MLC1 can form stable dimeric and oligomeric structures, with monomers found in the cytosolic fraction and dimers associated with membrane compartments (Ambrosini2008Biochemical; Brignone2015MLC1). The protein is capable of forming multimeric aggregates, possibly tetramers, through disulfide bridges (Ambrosini2008Biochemical). MLC1 is not N-glycosylated, as its electrophoretic mobility remains unchanged after treatment with endoglycosidase F or mutation of the predicted glycosylation site (Teijido2004Localization). The protein is phosphorylated at its NH2 and COOH terminals by PKA and PKC, which can modify its plasma membrane expression and multimeric structure formation (Brignone2015MLC1).

## Function
The MLC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cellular morphology and motility through its involvement in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. In healthy human cells, MLC1 is primarily expressed in astrocytes and is crucial for maintaining stable cell-cell communication and homeostatic regulation. It localizes to the plasma membrane, where it acts as a negative regulator of actin branching by interacting with the ARP2/3 complex, which is involved in the formation of branched actin filaments. This interaction results in reduced stability of actin branches, influencing cellular morphology by promoting filopodia formation and inhibiting lamellipodia formation, thereby reducing cellular motility (Hwang2019Plasma).

MLC1 is also involved in the regulation of ion and water homeostasis, interacting with various ion channels and transporters, such as Kir4.1 and ClC-2, which are important for neuronal, glial, and vascular homeostasis (Brignone2015MLC1). The protein is part of a multiprotein complex that includes GlialCAM, which targets MLC1 to astrocyte cell-cell junctions, and is involved in osmoregulation and pH control (Brignone2015MLC1). MLC1's proper localization and function are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of astrocytic endfeet and the stability of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (Boor2007MLC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MLC1 gene are primarily associated with megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a rare leukodystrophy characterized by macrocephaly, motor function deterioration, ataxia, spasticity, and epileptic seizures. The disease progresses slowly and can be exacerbated by minor stressors such as head trauma or viral infections (Brignone2010The). MLC1 mutations lead to protein misfolding and degradation, resulting in reduced cell surface expression and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Duarri2008Molecular; Bosch2021Megalencephalic). 

The MLC1 protein is involved in ion homeostasis and is part of a macromolecular complex associated with the Na, K-ATPase pump, which includes other channels and proteins like TRPV4, AQP4, and Kir4.1. Mutations in MLC1 disrupt its function in modulating endosomal pH and protein trafficking, leading to the clinical manifestations of MLC (Brignone2014Megalencephalic). 

In addition to MLC1, mutations in the HEPACAM/GLIALCAM gene have been identified in some MLC patients, indicating genetic heterogeneity (Brignone2014Megalencephalic). The presence of modifier genes or environmental factors may also influence the disease phenotype, given the high intrafamilial variability observed (Duarri2008Molecular).

## Interactions
The MLC1 protein interacts with several other proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function. MLC1 is known to associate with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in astrocytes, where it colocalizes with components such as β-dystroglycan and syntrophin. This association suggests a role in ion channel or transporter functions, potentially influencing brain-fluid homeostasis (Ambrosini2008Biochemical).

MLC1 also interacts with the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit (NaK-b1) in brain astrocytes. This interaction involves the binding of the NaK-b1 C-terminal domain to the MLC1 N-terminal domain, indicating that MLC1 is part of a multiprotein complex involving the Na,K-ATPase pump (Brignone2010The).

Additionally, MLC1 forms a complex with GlialCAM, which acts as a chaperone, facilitating the proper localization and stability of MLC1 at cell-cell junctions. This interaction is essential for the regulation of volume-regulated anion currents (VRAC) in astrocytes, and GlialCAM mutations can affect MLC1 trafficking and function (Capdevila‐Nortes2015Structural; CapdevilaNortes2013Insights).

MLC1 also influences the trafficking and stability of Connexin 43 (Cx43) in astrocytes, promoting its partitioning in gap-junctional plaques and sustaining intercellular communication (Lanciotti2020Megalencephalic).
