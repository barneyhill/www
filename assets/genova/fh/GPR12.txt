# GPR12

## Overview
GPR12 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 12, a member of the rhodopsin-like class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is known for its constitutive activity, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways without the need for an external ligand. GPR12 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a significant role in cognitive processes, neuronal development, and synaptic formation. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and survival, through pathways such as ERK1/2 signaling. Despite its structural similarities to cannabinoid receptors, GPR12 is classified as an orphan receptor due to pharmacological inconsistencies. The receptor's interactions with ligands like sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) further highlight its involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate cellular functions, including those relevant to cancer dynamics and metabolic processes (Lu2012Involvement; Allende2020Advances; Morales2018Towards).

## Structure
GPR12 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the rhodopsin-like class of GPCRs. It is composed of 334 amino acids and features the characteristic seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs (Allende2020Advances). The primary structure of GPR12 includes conserved residues in the transmembrane helices, such as N1.50, D2.50, R3.50, W4.50, P6.50, and P7.50, and it preserves specific motifs in TMH3, TMH6, and TMH7, which are the DRY, CWXP, and NPXXY motifs, respectively (Morales2018Towards).

Structurally, GPR12 lacks helix kinking proline residues in the second and fifth transmembrane segments and contains only one internal disulfide bridge in the second extracellular loop (Morales2018Towards). It is considered a 'constitutively active receptor,' capable of stimulating adenylate cyclase without ligand interaction, indicating basal G protein-coupling activity (Allende2020Advances). GPR12 couples to both Gas and Gai proteins, influencing cAMP-dependent signaling and calcium release through a Gai signaling cascade (Allende2020Advances). Despite its structural similarities to cannabinoid receptors, GPR12 is still categorized as an orphan receptor due to pharmacological inconsistencies (Morales2018Towards). No detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structure is available.

## Function
GPR12 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and neuronal development. It is constitutively active, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways without the need for an external ligand. This activity leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is crucial for activating protein kinase A (PKA) and other downstream signaling pathways (Lu2012Involvement; Allende2020Advances).

In healthy human cells, GPR12 is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, where it plays a role in cognitive processes such as learning and memory (Allende2020Advances). It is also involved in neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation, contributing to brain development and synaptic contact formation (Allende2020Advances; Laun2018GPR3).

GPR12 influences cell proliferation and survival by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, which helps protect cells under stress conditions (Lu2012Involvement; Laun2018GPR3). Its activity is modulated by ligands such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), which enhances its role in cellular processes (Allende2020Advances).

## Clinical Significance
GPR12 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), GPR12 is significantly overexpressed, and this high expression is associated with poor prognosis. It inhibits apoptosis in EOC cells by activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy (Wang2022GPR12). In pancreatic cancer, GPR12 overexpression promotes cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer metastasis (Park2016Novel). Conversely, in esophageal and hypopharyngeal cancers, GPR12 acts as a tumor suppressor, indicating its role may vary across cancer types (Wang2022GPR12).

GPR12 is also involved in metabolic processes. Deficiency in GPR12 has been linked to dyslipidemia and obesity in mice, suggesting its role in energy balance and lipid metabolism (Bjursell2006G). Although GPR12 has been studied for its potential involvement in emotional and metabolic disorders, the specific clinical implications in humans remain under investigation (Frank2012Metabolic).

## Interactions
GPR12, a G protein-coupled receptor, is known to interact with sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) as a high-affinity ligand, which plays a significant role in the phosphorylation and reorganization of keratin 8 (K8) in PANC-1 cells. This interaction is crucial for SPC-induced cellular processes, including changes in cell migration and invasion. The receptor's activity is modulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), where GPR12 expression affects PP2A levels, suggesting a regulatory interaction between these proteins (Park2016Novel).

GPR12 also interacts with sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), albeit with lower affinity compared to SPC. This interaction is part of a broader signaling mechanism involving calcium mobilization and adenylate cyclase activity, as observed in studies using HEK293 cells (Uhlenbrock2002Sphingosine; Ignatov2003Role). The receptor's role in these pathways indicates its involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate various cellular functions.

The receptor's interactions with SPC and S1P highlight its potential involvement in modulating cellular processes such as keratin network reorganization and cell migration, which are critical in cancer cell dynamics and brain development (Ignatov2003Role; Park2016Novel).
