# MKNK2

## Overview
MKNK2 is a gene that encodes the protein MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (Mnk2), which is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. Mnk2 plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of protein synthesis. It achieves this by phosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a critical step in the initiation of mRNA translation. The protein is characterized by a unique structural configuration, including a zinc binding motif and an atypical activation segment, which contribute to its regulatory functions. Mnk2 is activated by phosphorylation through the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 pathways, although it maintains high basal activity independent of these pathways. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct roles in cellular processes. MKNK2's involvement in various signaling pathways and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and diabetes (Xie2020Reciprocal; Jauch2006Mitogenactivated; Scheper2001The).

## Structure
The MKNK2 gene encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase 2 (Mnk2), which is part of the Ser/Thr kinase subfamily. The protein features a kinase domain with a bilobal structure typical of protein kinases, consisting of an N-terminal lobe with a twisted sheet of five antiparallel β-strands and a regulatory helix αC, essential for ATP binding. The C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical and contains elements necessary for peptide substrate binding and phosphate transfer, including the catalytic loop and the activation segment (Jauch2006Mitogenactivated).

A notable structural feature of Mnk2 is the presence of a zinc binding motif and an atypical open conformation of the activation segment. The ATP binding pocket contains an Asp-Phe-Asp (DFD) motif instead of the canonical magnesium binding Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, which blocks ATP binding (Jauch2005Crystal). This DFD motif is involved in the autoinhibition mechanism, where the activation segment interacts with the N-terminal lobe, preventing substrate positioning (Jauch2006Mitogenactivated).

Mnk2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its activation. The protein is activated through phosphorylation by pathways like the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the p38 pathway (Jauch2006Mitogenactivated). Alternative splicing of MKNK2 results in different isoforms, which may vary in function and regulation.

## Function
MKNK2 encodes the protein kinase Mnk2, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis in healthy human cells. Mnk2 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at Ser209, a modification that is important for the initiation of translation (Ueda2004Mnk2; Scheper2001The). This phosphorylation event is thought to stabilize the interaction of eIF4E with the mRNA cap structure, facilitating the formation of the 48S preinitiation complex, which is essential for protein synthesis (Scheper2001The).

Mnk2 exhibits high basal activity and is less sensitive to changes in MAPK signaling compared to its homolog Mnk1, allowing it to maintain eIF4E phosphorylation under various conditions, such as serum starvation (Ueda2004Mnk2; Scheper2001The). This kinase is activated by ERK and p38MAPK pathways, but its activity is not significantly affected by inhibitors of these pathways, suggesting an alternative regulatory mechanism (Scheper2001The). Mnk2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with eIF4G and ERK, contributing to its role in cellular signaling pathways (Scheper2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and splicing of the MKNK2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In colon adenocarcinoma (CAC), the MKNK2 gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms, MKNK2a and MKNK2b. MKNK2b is upregulated in CAC and is associated with tumor proliferation and larger tumor sizes, while MKNK2a is downregulated. This splicing shift is closely correlated with KRAS mutations, which inhibit MKNK2a splicing and promote MKNK2b expression, contributing to tumor progression (Liu2021SRPK12). The splicing factor SRSF1, modulated by SRPK1/2 and PP1α, plays a crucial role in this process, with high nuclear SRSF1 levels promoting MKNK2b expression and correlating with poor prognosis in CAC patients (Liu2021SRPK12).

In gastric cancer, MKNK2 expression is significantly higher in paraneoplastic tissues compared to cancerous tissues. High MKNK2 expression is associated with a higher risk group and lower survival rates, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Qin2021Novel). Beyond cancer, MKNK2 is involved in β-cell regeneration, with its inhibition enhancing β-cell regeneration and protein synthesis, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for diabetes (Karampelias2022MNK2).

## Interactions
MKNK2, also known as MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. MKNK2 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key player in mRNA translation, and phosphorylates it at Ser209, which is important for translation initiation and oncogenesis (Xie2020Reciprocal; Scheper2001The). This interaction is facilitated by MKNK2's binding to the scaffolding protein eIF4G, which enhances its ability to phosphorylate eIF4E (Xie2020Reciprocal; Scheper2001The).

MKNK2 also interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, which phosphorylate MKNK2 and regulate its activity (Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated; Scheper2001The). These interactions are specific, as MKNK2 does not interact with JNK1 (Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated). The phosphorylation of MKNK2 by ERK and p38MAPK is crucial for its function as an eIF4E kinase, and these interactions are modulated by upstream signaling pathways (Scheper2001The).

Additionally, MKNK2's interaction with mTORC1 is significant in the context of cancer biology. mTORC1 phosphorylates MKNK2 at Ser74, which suppresses its activity and affects its binding to eIF4G, thereby modulating eIF4E phosphorylation and oncogenic processes (Xie2020Reciprocal). These interactions highlight MKNK2's role as a critical node in the integration of mitogen-activated and stress-activated signaling pathways.
