# NPIPA8

## Overview
NPIPA8 is a gene that encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member A8, a protein that is part of a family known for its interactions with the nuclear pore complex. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Although the specific functions of NPIPA8 are not fully elucidated, its expression and genetic variations have been associated with several medical conditions, including chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis and neurological disorders such as epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Ziff2022Metaanalysis; Furusawa2020Chronic; Ziff2022Genome; Allen2015Chromosomal). Further research is necessary to fully understand the role of NPIPA8 in these diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
NPIPA8 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genetic variations. In the context of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), NPIPA8 was identified as one of the genes with altered expression in subjects undergoing immunosuppressant treatment, where it was downregulated (Furusawa2020Chronic). This suggests a potential role in the disease's molecular pathology, although the specific clinical implications remain unclear.

In the realm of neurological disorders, a study on chromosomal microarray analysis in patients with unexplained severe early onset epilepsy identified a 16p13.11 deletion affecting NPIPA8 among other genes. This deletion is considered "likely pathogenic" and is associated with conditions such as infantile spasms and resolved hypsarrhythmia, although the specific contribution of NPIPA8 to these clinical features is not detailed (Allen2015Chromosomal).

Additionally, NPIPA8 has shown changes in expression in various genetic backgrounds of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly in subgroups like C9orf72, TARDBP, and FUS. However, the clinical significance of these expression changes in ALS is not well-defined, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in the disease (Ziff2022Metaanalysis; Ziff2022Genome).
