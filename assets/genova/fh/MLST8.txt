# MLST8

## Overview
The MLST8 gene encodes the mTOR-associated protein LST8 homolog, commonly referred to as mLST8 or GβL, which is a crucial component of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, facilitating its role in stabilizing and enhancing the activity of mTOR complexes, specifically mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Cuéllar2019Structural; Sapam2017Identifying). As a part of these complexes, mLST8 is integral to cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival, by influencing kinase activity and protein-protein interactions (Guertin2006Ablation). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions, including cancer, where it has been implicated in tumor progression and survival (Kakumoto2015mLST8).

## Structure
The MLST8 protein, also known as mLST8 or GβL, is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, which is a common fold in proteins involved in signal transduction (Sapam2017Identifying). Each blade of the β-propeller consists of 40-60 residues, forming a WD40 domain that is conserved across various eukaryotes (Sapam2017Identifying). This structure facilitates the protein's interaction with the mTOR complexes, contributing to their stability and activity (Cuéllar2019Structural).

In the context of mTORC2, mLST8 interacts with the SIN1 subunit, where its structure is altered by SIN1's integration, involving β-strand complementation and displacement of a loop compared to its structure in mTORC1 (Scaiola2020The). The interaction of mLST8 with the kinase domain of mTOR stabilizes its active site and enhances the interaction stability between raptor and mTOR, stimulating the kinase activity of mTOR towards its effector proteins (Sapam2017Identifying).

mLST8 is also involved in the assembly of mTOR complexes, where it is folded by the chaperonin CCT, achieving a near-native state while bound to CCT, indicating its role as a late folding intermediate ready to bind mTOR upon release (Cuéllar2019Structural). This folding process is crucial for the assembly and function of mTOR complexes (Cuéllar2019Structural).

## Function
MLST8, also known as mTOR-associated protein LST8 homolog, is a critical component of the mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is a part of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, but its role is particularly crucial in mTORC2 functions. In mTORC2, MLST8 is essential for maintaining the interaction between rictor and mTOR, which is necessary for the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at S473, a modification vital for Akt/PKB's catalytic activity and subsequent cellular processes such as growth and survival (Guertin2006Ablation).

In mTORC1, MLST8 is not required for the phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1, indicating that its role in mTORC1 is less critical compared to mTORC2 (Oh2011mTOR; Guertin2006Ablation). Structurally, MLST8 contains a WD40 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, stabilizing the mTOR complexes and influencing their kinase activity (Sapam2017Identifying). MLST8's involvement in these complexes underscores its importance in cellular signaling pathways that regulate key processes such as metabolism and cell cycle control, contributing to organismal outcomes like vascular development and cellular growth (Guertin2006Ablation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the MLST8 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the downregulation of MLST8 through bioactive peptide treatment has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. This effect is mediated by the suppression of the mTOR pathway, which is often overactivated in cancers, contributing to malignant cell proliferation and chemotherapy resistance (Zhang2022Bioactive). Targeting the mTOR pathway, specifically through MLST8 downregulation, is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for AML (Zhang2022Bioactive).

In glioblastoma, MLST8 is part of a critical pathway involving YB-1 and CCT4 that promotes tumor growth. The YB-1/CCT4/mLST8/mTOR pathway is upregulated in glioblastoma, and its components are associated with poor survival outcomes. Targeting this pathway, particularly YB-1, could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting mTOR signaling and reducing tumor growth (Wang2022Upregulated).

Additionally, MLST8 plays a role in mitochondrial integrity and calcium ion homeostasis. Disruption of MLST8 can lead to mitochondrial defects, oxidative stress, and cell death, indicating its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Anjum2023Wat1mLst8).

## Interactions
MLST8, also known as mLST8, is a critical component of the mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, where it plays a significant role in stabilizing these complexes and facilitating their interactions with other proteins. In mTORC2, MLST8 is essential for maintaining the interaction between RICTOR and mTOR, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at S473, a key step in mTORC2 signaling (Guertin2006Ablation). 

MLST8 also interacts with the chaperonin CCT complex, which assists in its folding and stabilization. This interaction is ATP-dependent, indicating that MLST8 is a substrate for CCT-mediated folding (Cuéllar2019Structural). The CCT complex is crucial for the proper incorporation of MLST8 into mTORC2, affecting the expression of other mTORC2 subunits (Cuéllar2019Structural).

In cancer cells, MLST8 is involved in mTOR-mediated tumor progression. Its knockdown leads to reduced tumor growth and invasiveness, highlighting its role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Kakumoto2015mLST8). MLST8's interactions with mTOR complexes and the CCT chaperonin underscore its importance in cellular growth and cancer progression.
