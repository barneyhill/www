# DAG1

## Overview
The DAG1 gene encodes the dystroglycan 1 protein, which is a critical component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle cells. Dystroglycan 1 is composed of two subunits: α-dystroglycan, an extracellular peripheral membrane glycoprotein, and β-dystroglycan, a transmembrane protein. These subunits work together to link the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and function of muscle tissues (Cook2024The; Brancaccio2017An). The α-dystroglycan subunit is heavily glycosylated, which is essential for its role as a receptor for ECM components such as laminin and agrin (Endo2014Glycobiology). Proper glycosylation is crucial for dystroglycan's function, and defects in this process can lead to muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies, characterized by muscle, brain, and eye abnormalities (Riemersma2015Absence). Additionally, dystroglycan is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways, and it may also play a role in pathogen adhesion (Cook2024The; Endo2014Glycobiology).

## Structure
The DAG1 gene encodes dystroglycan, which is cleaved into two subunits: α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan. α-Dystroglycan is an extracellular peripheral membrane glycoprotein, while β-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein. The primary structure of dystroglycan includes several domains, such as the N-terminal region of α-dystroglycan, which is an autonomous folding unit, and regions involved in the α/β dystroglycan complex formation. The secondary structure features immunoglobulin-like domains (IG1 & IG2) and a domain similar to ribosomal protein S6 (Brancaccio2019A).

The tertiary structure of α-dystroglycan involves an IG-like β-sandwich structure, which can be destabilized by certain mutations. The quaternary structure is characterized by the non-covalent interaction between α-dystroglycan and β-dystroglycan subunits (Brancaccio2019A). Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, are crucial for the function of dystroglycan. α-Dystroglycan is heavily glycosylated, with O-linked and N-linked glycosylation being essential for its role as an extracellular matrix receptor (Endo2014Glycobiology; Michele2003DystrophinGlycoprotein). The glycosylation pattern varies with development and tissue, affecting interactions with extracellular binding partners (Winder2001The).

## Function
The DAG1 gene encodes dystroglycan, a protein that plays a crucial role in linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton in muscle cells, thereby maintaining structural integrity and function. Dystroglycan is a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and is composed of two subunits: α-dystroglycan (α-DG) and β-dystroglycan (β-DG). α-DG is heavily glycosylated and binds with high affinity to ECM components such as laminin, agrin, and neurexin, facilitating the connection between the cytoskeleton and the ECM (Riemersma2015Absence; Endo2014Glycobiology). β-DG is a transmembrane protein that connects α-DG to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton through dystrophin, forming a molecular bridge that is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle tissues (Cook2024The; Brancaccio2017An).

Dystroglycan is also involved in signaling pathways and cellular processes such as cell adhesion and migration. It acts as a receptor for certain pathogens, indicating a role in pathogen adhesion (Endo2014Glycobiology). The proper glycosylation of α-DG is critical for its function, and defects in this process can lead to muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies, which are characterized by muscular dystrophy, brain malformations, and eye abnormalities (Riemersma2015Absence). Additionally, β-DG has been implicated in nuclear dynamics, suggesting potential roles beyond the plasma membrane (Cook2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DAG1 gene, which encodes dystroglycan, are associated with a range of neuromuscular and developmental disorders known as dystroglycanopathies. These conditions often involve muscle, eye, and brain abnormalities. Specific mutations, such as the homozygous missense mutation c.C575T (p.T192M), have been linked to mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and severe mental retardation, despite normal brain imaging (Geis2013Homozygous). Another mutation, p.Cys669Phe, affects the β-subunit of dystroglycan and is associated with a severe muscle-eye-brain disease-like phenotype and multicystic leucodystrophy, disrupting a critical disulfide bond and affecting protein interactions (Geis2013Homozygous).

In zebrafish models, mutations in DAG1, such as p.V567D, result in muscle defects and abnormal development, mirroring human conditions like Walker-Warburg syndrome and muscle-eye-brain disease (Gupta2011The). These models highlight the role of dystroglycan in maintaining muscle integrity and its involvement in muscular dystrophies (Gupta2011The).

Alterations in DAG1 expression or function can lead to defective glycosylation of dystroglycan, impairing its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins and contributing to muscle weakness and degeneration (Dai2018Whole). These disruptions are central to the pathology of various muscular dystrophies, including congenital muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Williamson1997Dystroglycan).

## Interactions
Dystroglycan 1 (DAG1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular stability and signaling. The β-dystroglycan subunit of DAG1 interacts with dystrophin, a key component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in skeletal muscle. This interaction is essential for linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, with the binding site on dystrophin located between amino acids 3054-3271, and the C-terminal 15 amino acids (880-895) of β-dystroglycan being crucial for binding (Jung1995Identification).

DAG1 also interacts with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, such as Kbr and Yki, in both Drosophila and mammalian muscles. These interactions help modulate the pathway's strength and are crucial for muscle function and signaling (Yatsenko2020Profiling).

In addition, the β-dystroglycan subunit interacts with various proteins through its cytoplasmic domain, including utrophin, caveolin-3, and Grb2, which compete for binding at the PPxY motif. This domain also interacts with ERM proteins, rapsyn, and ERK, facilitating signal transmission from the extracellular matrix to the cell interior (Sciandra2023From).
