# PACS2

## Overview
PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, apoptosis, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The PACS2 protein is a member of the phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein family and is characterized as an intrinsically unfolded protein (IUP), which allows it to adopt different conformations upon binding to other molecules (Youker2009At). It plays a crucial role in the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), facilitating lipid transfer and calcium exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and apoptotic signaling (Youker2009At). Additionally, PACS2 is involved in the regulation of protein localization and trafficking, as well as in the cellular response to DNA damage, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing apoptosis (BarrosoGonzález2016PACS2; Atkins2014The). Alterations in PACS2 expression or mutations in the gene have been associated with various diseases, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurological conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Chou2023LongTerm; Li2020PACS2:).

## Structure
The PACS-2 protein is composed of 889 amino acids and is a member of the phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein family. It shares 54% sequence identity with its homolog PACS-1, which has 963 amino acids (Li2020PACS2:). The structure of PACS-2 includes several key domains: cargo (furin)-binding regions (FBRs), a disordered middle region (MR), and a C-terminal region (CTR). The FBR domain is crucial for identifying and binding to cargo proteins and shares 81% sequence identity with that of PACS-1 (Li2020PACS2:). The MR domain contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and an Akt phosphorylation site, both essential for PACS-2 function (Li2020PACS2:).

PACS-2 is characterized as an intrinsically unfolded protein (IUP), lacking a definitive protein fold but capable of forming a tertiary structure upon binding to a client protein or ligand. It has a flexible structure with regions that can form α-helical and β-sheet elements (Youker2009At). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions (Li2020PACS2:). PACS-2 also has at least 11 alternatively spliced variants, contributing to its functional diversity (Li2020PACS2:).

## Function
PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are essential for lipid transfer and calcium exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. This function is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the coordination of apoptotic signals (Youker2009At).

PACS2 is also involved in the localization and trafficking of membrane proteins, such as polycystin-2, to the ER. This process is vital for regulating intracellular calcium concentrations and mechanosensing functions (Youker2009At). The protein interacts with calnexin to maintain its ER localization, influencing the distribution of calnexin within the ER and preventing its mislocalization to other cellular compartments (Myhill2008The).

In response to DNA damage, PACS2 regulates the SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53, ensuring proper cell-cycle arrest and maintaining genomic stability (Atkins2014The). It also mediates the ATM and NF-κB-dependent induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, promoting cell survival under stress conditions (BarrosoGonzález2016PACS2). PACS2's involvement in these processes highlights its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing apoptosis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PACS2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic diseases, PACS2 is upregulated in obesity, leading to enhanced formation of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and mitochondrial dysfunction, which contributes to insulin resistance (Li2020PACS2:). In cancer, PACS2 plays a role in Kaposi sarcoma and colorectal cancer. In Kaposi sarcoma, PACS2 interacts with the KSHV ubiquitin ligase K5, influencing tumor spread. In colorectal cancer, loss of PACS2 is common, although it also contributes to EGFR activation and cancer progression (Li2020PACS2:).

PACS2 mutations are also associated with early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (EIDEE), a severe form of epilepsy characterized by frequent seizures and developmental delays. The most common mutation is the heterozygous missense variant PACS2:c.625G>A (p.Glu209Lys), which disrupts cellular functions and affects ion channel regulation, leading to seizures (Chou2023LongTerm; Dentici2019Expanding). These mutations often result in structural brain abnormalities and developmental delays (Chou2023LongTerm). PACS2 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where its upregulation is observed in the human AD brain, potentially affecting mitochondrial dynamics and Ca2+ homeostasis (Li2020PACS2:).

## Interactions
PACS2 (phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in intracellular trafficking and apoptosis. PACS2 interacts with calnexin (CNX), a protein involved in protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is mediated by the acidic CK2 motif of CNX, which, when nonphosphorylated, retains CNX within the ER and promotes its localization to mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) (Myhill2008The).

PACS2 also interacts with ADAM17, a metalloproteinase involved in cell signaling. This interaction occurs in endocytic compartments and is crucial for the recycling and stability of ADAM17 on the cell surface, affecting EGFR signaling (Dombernowsky2015The). PACS2's role in ADAM17 regulation is selective, as it does not affect ADAM10-mediated shedding (Dombernowsky2015The).

Additionally, PACS2 interacts with the 14-3-3 protein, which binds to PACS2 when it is phosphorylated at serine 437. This interaction regulates a switch in PACS2's function from membrane trafficking to promoting apoptosis through Bid translocation to mitochondria (Aslan2009Akt). PACS2 also interacts with ATM kinase during genotoxic stress, facilitating NF-κB signaling and promoting anti-apoptotic responses (BarrosoGonzález2016PACS2).
