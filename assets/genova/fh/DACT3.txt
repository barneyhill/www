# DACT3

## Overview
DACT3, or Dapper Antagonist of Catenin-3, is a gene that encodes the protein dishevelled binding antagonist of beta catenin 3, which is a scaffold protein involved in key cellular signaling pathways. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt and TGFβ signaling pathways by interacting with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, thereby influencing β-catenin activity and contributing to cellular homeostasis and tissue development (Fisher2006Three; Kivimäe2011All). DACT3 is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its ability to form complexes with various proteins, including serine/threonine kinases, which suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular polarity and adhesion (Kivimäe2011All). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic but can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, indicating its dynamic role in cellular processes (Schubert2014Dactgenes). DACT3 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the central nervous system, and is implicated in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation, highlighting its significance in developmental biology (Fisher2006Three).

## Function
DACT3 is a scaffold protein involved in the regulation of intercellular signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt and TGFβ signaling pathways. It interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, which are key components of the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing β-catenin activity and thus playing a role in cellular homeostasis and tissue development (Fisher2006Three; Kivimäe2011All). DACT3 is capable of forming complexes with various proteins, including Vangl and serine/threonine kinases, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular polarity and adhesion (Kivimäe2011All).

In healthy cells, DACT3 is thought to modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting this pathway (Jiang2008DACT3). It is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, where it may influence brain function and development (Fisher2006Three). The protein's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it may shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, interacting with Tcf/Lef and Vangl molecules (Schubert2014Dactgenes). The expression of DACT3 in tissues such as somites and pharyngeal arches suggests a role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation (Fisher2006Three).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DACT3 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In colorectal cancer, DACT3 is frequently repressed through bivalent histone modifications, which include both repressive (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K4me3) marks. This repression is associated with enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a pathway often activated in cancer, leading to cancer progression, treatment resistance, and recurrence. The study suggests that targeting these epigenetic modifications could modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, offering a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment (Jiang2008DACT3).

In AML, DACT3 is significantly downregulated, and this downregulation is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor growth. The loss of DACT3 expression is associated with DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, contributing to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for leukemic stem cell maintenance and AML progression. The combination of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors has been shown to upregulate DACT3 expression, promoting apoptosis in AML cells and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (Jiang2023Epigenetically).

## Interactions
DACT3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It forms complexes with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins, particularly DVL2, through a conserved C-terminal motif. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, where DACT3 and DVL2 efficiently immunoprecipitate with each other, leading to a decrease in DVL2 protein expression and stability (Jiang2008DACT3). DACT3 also interacts with members of the Vangl family, showing moderate affinity for Vangl2 (Kivimäe2011All).

DACT3 forms complexes with serine/threonine kinases, including Casein Kinase 1δ/ε (CK1δ/ε) and Protein Kinase A (PKA), suggesting a role in kinase-regulated biochemistry (Kivimäe2011All). However, its interaction with Protein Kinase C (PKC) is less robust compared to other Dact paralogs (Kivimäe2011All). DACT3 does not form detectable complexes with δ-catenin and shows weak interactions with β-catenin, indicating limited involvement with catenin proteins (Kivimäe2011All).

These interactions suggest that DACT3 participates in complex formation with various proteins, influencing pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling, where it acts as a negative regulator (Jiang2008DACT3).
