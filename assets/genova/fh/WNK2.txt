# WNK2

## Overview
WNK2, or WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell regulation. The protein encoded by WNK2 is characterized by its unique kinase domain, which lacks a conserved lysine residue, a feature that distinguishes it from other kinases. Instead, the catalytic lysine is located in the b2 strand, which is crucial for ATP binding and kinase activity (Jonniya2019Investigating). WNK2 plays a significant role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and adhesion (Rodan2017WNK). It is predominantly expressed in the heart, brain, and colon, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Veríssimo2001WNK). Additionally, WNK2 has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, with its expression often silenced through epigenetic mechanisms (Jun2009Epigenetic). The protein's interactions with other signaling pathways, such as the ERK1/2 pathway, further underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Moniz2008WNK2).

## Structure
WNK2 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by its unique primary structure, which lacks a conserved lysine residue typically found in the kinase domain. Instead, this lysine is replaced by cysteine, with the catalytic lysine located in the b2 strand for ATP binding (Jonniya2019Investigating). The secondary structure of WNK2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a dual-domain architecture with a smaller N-lobe and a larger C-lobe, which is common among WNK kinases (Jonniya2019Investigating).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase domain, which is crucial for its activity. WNK2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which affects its structural stability and flexibility. Phosphorylation of WNK2 leads to increased flexibility in the A-loop region, contrasting with other WNK isoforms where phosphorylation typically stabilizes the structure (Jonniya2020A).

WNK2 has several splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization within the cell (Jonniya2019Investigating). These structural features and modifications play a significant role in WNK2's function in cellular processes and its interaction with inhibitors like WNK463 (Jonniya2020A).

## Function
WNK2 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for various developmental processes and diseases. In human cells, WNK2 acts as a positive regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This is evidenced by the fact that overexpression of WNK2 enhances Wnt signaling, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of WNK2 reduces Wnt3a-induced Wnt signaling, leading to decreased β-Catenin levels and reduced transcriptional activity in reporter assays (Rodan2017WNK).

WNK2 is predominantly expressed in the heart, brain, and colon, suggesting tissue-specific functions (Veríssimo2001WNK). The kinase is involved in cell signaling and may play roles in cell adhesion and transformation processes (Veríssimo2001WNK). Although the exact mechanisms by which WNK2 influences Wnt signaling in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its kinase activity is necessary for promoting Wnt pathway activation, indicating its importance in cellular signaling and development (Rodan2017WNK).

WNK2's expression and activity in specific tissues imply its involvement in maintaining cellular ion homeostasis and influencing cell volume, proliferation, and migration, impacting processes like blood pressure regulation and neuronal function (Veríssimo2001WNK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNK2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WNK2 is identified as a significantly mutated gene, with mutations more frequent in patients experiencing early recurrence. These mutations are associated with adverse clinical features such as increased tumor size and vascular invasion, and are considered independent prognostic factors for overall survival and time to recurrence in HCC patients (Zhou2019Genomic).

In brain cancers, such as gliomas and meningiomas, WNK2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often silenced through epigenetic mechanisms like promoter hypermethylation, leading to increased tumor proliferation and migration. This silencing is particularly noted in higher-grade meningiomas and is associated with enhanced EGFR signaling, a known oncogenic pathway (Jun2009Epigenetic; Tang2016(WNK)ing page 2 of 3).

WNK2 is also involved in colorectal cancer and serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS). Germline mutations in WNK2 have been linked to SPS, with these mutations potentially activating the MAPK/ERK pathway, contributing to cell cycle deregulation and increased cell proliferation (Soares2022Germline). These findings highlight WNK2's role in tumorigenesis across various cancer types.

## Interactions
WNK2 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in cellular signaling. It is involved in the regulation of the ERK1/2 protein kinase pathway through interactions with Rho GTPases. WNK2 does not directly phosphorylate MEK1 or PAK1 but acts upstream to regulate Rho GTPases, which in turn affect PAK1 activation. This regulation influences the phosphorylation of MEK1 at serine 298, enhancing MEK1's ability to activate ERK1/2 in response to growth factors (Moniz2008WNK2).

WNK2 also interacts with Rac1 and RhoA, small GTPases involved in cell migration and invasion. Loss of WNK2 expression leads to increased Rac1 activity, enhancing the invasiveness of glioblastoma cells. Conversely, WNK2 re-expression results in decreased Rac1 activity and reduced cell migration (Moniz2012Loss). WNK2 forms a complex with RhoA, particularly with a dominant negative RhoA mutant, suggesting that WNK2 influences RhoA activation through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (Moniz2008WNK2).

In gliomas, WNK2 negatively regulates the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, as well as IL-6, through the inhibition of the JNK pathway (Costa2014Silencing). These interactions highlight WNK2's role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target.
