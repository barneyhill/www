# LEMD1

## Overview
LEMD1, or LEM domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of a LEM domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell morphology, migration, and adhesion, primarily through its influence on the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion pathways. LEMD1 is notably implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as colorectal, oral squamous cell, gastric, and ovarian cancers, where its expression levels are often correlated with disease severity and patient prognosis. The protein functions as a key player in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, particularly through pathways like RhoA/ROCK and PI3K/AKT, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Sasahira2016LEM; Wang2022A; Li2019LEM; Zhang2022A).

## Clinical Significance
LEMD1 (LEM domain containing 1) is implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), LEMD1 expression correlates with tumor progression, nodal metastasis, and poor disease-free survival. High LEMD1 expression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis, and its knockdown reduces the invasive and transmigration abilities of OSCC cells (Sasahira2016LEM). 

In gastric cancer (GC), LEMD1 is overexpressed and linked to larger tumor sizes and poorer overall survival rates. It promotes GC cell proliferation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Li2019LEM). 

LEMD1 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), where it is associated with postoperative recurrence and poor survival. It promotes CRC cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway (Zhang2022A). 

In ovarian cancer, LEMD1 is part of a tumor mutational burden-based risk model, with higher expression levels correlating with poorer prognosis (Wang2022A). These findings suggest that LEMD1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
LEMD1 (LEM domain containing 1) is involved in several interactions that influence colorectal cancer (CRC) cell behavior. It is part of a three-gene signature, along with SERPINE1 and SIAE, that predicts CRC relapse. LEMD1 is significantly upregulated in CRC tumor tissues and is linked to worse overall survival and higher recurrence risk. Knockdown of LEMD1 in cell lines like HCT116 and SW480 reduces proliferation, colony formation, and migration, while overexpression in LOVO and DLD1 enhances these abilities. LEMD1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by influencing E-cadherin and vimentin expression. It is negatively correlated with E-cadherin and positively with vimentin, indicating its role in EMT. LEMD1 also promotes CRC metastasis via the RhoA/ROCK pathway. Knockdown of LEMD1 decreases RhoA activity while activating GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42, whereas overexpression activates GTP-RhoA and decreases GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 activity. These interactions suggest that LEMD1 influences cell morphology, migration, and adhesion through the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion pathways (Zhang2022A).
