# SLC51B

## Overview
The SLC51B gene encodes the SLC51 subunit beta (OSTβ), a critical component of the organic solute transporter alpha/beta (OSTα/β) complex. This complex is a heteromeric transporter involved in the facilitated diffusion of bile acids, conjugated steroids, and other steroid-derived molecules across the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. OSTβ, characterized by a single transmembrane domain, interacts with OSTα to form a functional transporter essential for maintaining bile acid homeostasis and lipid digestion (Beaudoin2020Novel; Ballatori2013The). The SLC51B gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, intestines, and kidneys, where it plays a pivotal role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the regulation of estrogen levels through the transport of estrone sulfate (Chan2023HNF1A). Alterations in SLC51B expression have been linked to diseases such as endometrial cancer and renal dysfunction, underscoring its clinical significance (Pavlič2021Altered).

## Structure
The SLC51B gene encodes the OSTβ subunit, which is a component of the heteromeric organic solute transporter complex OSTα/β. OSTβ is a smaller subunit consisting of 128 amino acids and features a single predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) (Beaudoin2020Novel). The TMD is crucial for its interaction with OSTα, which is necessary for the transport function of the complex (Beaudoin2020Novel). The N-terminal tail of OSTβ is critical for transport activity and membrane localization, with a di-leucine motif being essential for its association with OSTα (Beaudoin2020Novel). Deletion of 35 amino acids from the N-terminus prevents proper interaction with OSTα and membrane expression (Beaudoin2020Novel).

The quaternary structure of OSTβ involves dimerization with OSTα, forming a functional transporter complex. This interaction is vital for the stable expression and function of the transporter at the plasma membrane (Beaudoin2020Novel). Clinical evidence from OSTβ deficiency cases highlights the importance of the amino acid sequence from codon position 27 onward for OSTα/β protein expression and transport activity (Beaudoin2020Novel). The exact stoichiometry of the OSTα/β heteromer remains unknown (Beaudoin2020Novel).

## Function
The SLC51B gene encodes the OSTβ subunit, which is part of the heteromeric organic solute transporter OSTα-OSTβ. This transporter is crucial for the transport of bile acids, conjugated steroids, and other steroid-derived molecules across the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. It functions via facilitated diffusion, mediating either efflux or uptake depending on the electrochemical gradient of its substrates (Ballatori2013The). 

In healthy human cells, SLC51B, in conjunction with SLC51A, forms a heterodimer transporter complex that is expressed in the liver, intestines, and kidneys. This complex plays a critical role in the transport of conjugated steroids, such as estrone sulfate (E1S), across the basolateral membrane of renal epithelial cells. The proper function of SLC51B is important for maintaining the pool of estrogen in the body, as E1S serves as a primary source of estrogen storage (Chan2023HNF1A). 

The transporter is also involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, facilitating their efflux from enterocytes into the blood, where they return to the liver. This process is essential for maintaining bile acid homeostasis and lipid digestion (Ballatori2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC51B gene, which encodes the OSTβ protein, have been implicated in several diseases. In endometrial cancer (EC), SLC51B is significantly down-regulated, which may contribute to the disease's pathophysiology by affecting the intracellular levels of estrone sulfate (E1-S), a precursor for estrogen formation. This down-regulation is particularly noted in postmenopausal women with EC, where it is associated with lower protein levels and altered localization, potentially impacting estrogen conversion and contributing to cancer progression (Pavlič2021Altered).

In the context of renal health, mutations in the HNF1A gene, which regulates SLC51B expression, can lead to decreased SLC51B levels. This reduction impairs the uptake of E1-S in the kidneys, potentially contributing to renal dysfunction in patients with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3). The diminished expression of SLC51B in these patients may exacerbate conditions like diabetic nephropathy by reducing the nephroprotective effects of estradiol (Chan2023HNF1A).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC51B in both cancer and renal disease, suggesting that its altered expression or regulation can have substantial impacts on disease progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
SLC51B, also known as OSTβ, is a critical component of the organic solute transporter alpha/beta (OSTα/β) complex, which requires the co-expression and interaction of SLC51B with SLC51A (OSTα) for its function. This interaction is essential for the stability, expression, and transport activity of the complex at the plasma membrane. The OSTα/β complex facilitates the transport of bile acids, conjugated steroids, and other molecules across the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (Beaudoin2020Novel; Ballatori2013The).

The interaction between OSTα and OSTβ is crucial, as neither subunit can function independently. The N-terminal tail of OSTβ is particularly important for its interaction with OSTα, as deletion of 35 amino acids from this region or substitution of key leucines disrupts the interaction and prevents proper membrane localization (Beaudoin2020Novel). The transmembrane domain of OSTβ also plays a significant role in maintaining the interaction and transport function (Beaudoin2020Novel).

SLC51B is also regulated by the transcription factor HNF1A, which binds to the SLC51B promoter and influences its expression. This regulation is important for the uptake of estrone sulfate in renal proximal tubule cells, highlighting a functional interaction at the transcriptional level (Chan2023HNF1A).
