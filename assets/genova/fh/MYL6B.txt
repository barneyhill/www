# MYL6B

## Overview
MYL6B is a gene that encodes the myosin light chain 6B protein, which is a crucial component of the non-muscle myosin II (NMII) complex. This protein is primarily involved in cellular processes such as muscle contraction, cell adhesion, migration, and tissue architecture. MYL6B is predominantly expressed in type 1/slow muscle fibers, where it contributes to the structural integrity and contractile function of these fibers (Murgia2021Protein). As a myosin light chain, it plays a significant role in regulating the ATPase activity of myosin, facilitating interactions with filamentous actin in an ATP-dependent manner (Heissler2015Four). MYL6B's involvement in the MDM2-p53 pathway highlights its importance in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Xie2018MYL6B).

## Function
MYL6B encodes the myosin light chain 6B protein, which plays a significant role in muscle contraction and cellular movement. In healthy human cells, MYL6B is primarily expressed in type 1/slow muscle fibers, where it is involved in muscle contraction or structure specific to these fibers (Murgia2021Protein). It functions as an essential light chain in non-muscle myosin II (NMII), which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, tissue architecture, cargo transport, and endocytosis (Heissler2015Four; Xie2018MYL6B).

MYL6B is active in the cytoplasm, particularly within the contractile apparatus of cells, where it interacts with filamentous actin in an ATP-dependent manner (Heissler2015Four). This interaction is vital for cytoplasmic contractility and cellular dynamics. The protein is part of the NMII holoenzyme, composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, and is involved in regulating the ATPase activity necessary for myosin's function in cellular processes (Heissler2015Four). The presence of MYL6B in slow muscle fibers suggests its role in maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of these fibers (Murgia2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
The MYL6B gene, encoding a myosin light chain, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in the regulation of the MDM2-p53 pathway. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MYL6B enhances the interaction between MDM2 and p53, leading to increased ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This degradation process is significant as it contributes to cancer progression by inhibiting p53's ability to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of MYL6B in HCC is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival times in patients (Xie2018MYL6B).

MYL6B is also overexpressed in rectal adenocarcinoma, where it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis. This overexpression is linked to poor patient outcomes and is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Li2020MYL6B).

Beyond HCC and rectal adenocarcinoma, MYL6B overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in other cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, kidney chromophobe, adrenocortical cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, and mesothelioma (Xie2018MYL6B). These findings suggest that MYL6B acts as a carcinogenic factor and could serve as a potential therapeutic target in these malignancies.

## Interactions
MYL6B, a myosin light chain, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in cellular processes and cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, MYL6B interacts with the MDM2 and p53 proteins. It has been identified as a binding partner of MDM2, facilitating the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This interaction primarily occurs in the nucleus, where MYL6B colocalizes with MDM2 and p53, promoting MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, a crucial tumor suppressor protein (Xie2018MYL6B).

MYL6B also interacts with non-muscle myosin II heavy chains, MYH9 and MYH10, forming myosin holoenzymes. This interaction is linked to MYL6B's role in regulating p53 degradation, although MYL6B can promote p53 degradation independently of F-actin polymerization (Xie2018MYL6B). In the cytoplasm, MYL6B forms a grid-like filamentous network, consistent with its role in binding to the F-actin cytoskeleton (Xie2018MYL6B). These interactions highlight MYL6B's involvement in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction pathways, contributing to its role in cancer development and progression.
