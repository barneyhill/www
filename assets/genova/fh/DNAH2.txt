# DNAH2

## Overview
The DNAH2 gene encodes the dynein axonemal heavy chain 2 protein, a critical component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) in the axoneme, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. This motor protein is characterized by its microtubule binding and ATPase domains, which facilitate ATP hydrolysis necessary for ciliary and flagellar movement (Hwang2021Genetic). The DNAH2 protein plays a pivotal role in the structural stabilization and function of sperm flagella, contributing to male fertility by ensuring proper sperm motility and morphology (Hwang2021Genetic). Mutations in DNAH2 are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), leading to male infertility, and have been implicated in other conditions such as primary microcephaly and certain cancer treatment outcomes (Li2019DNAH2; Jacquemin2023Congenital; Zhu2019Somatic).

## Structure
The DNAH2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) in the axoneme, which is crucial for the movement of motile cilia and sperm flagella. The DNAH2 protein is composed of 4,427 amino acids and includes a microtubule binding domain and ATPase domains, known as AAA domains, which are responsible for hydrolyzing ATP to regulate ciliary and flagellar beating (Hwang2021Genetic). The protein's structure is evolutionarily conserved across ciliated eukaryotes, indicating its essential role in motility (Hwang2021Genetic).

The DNAH2 protein contains specific domains such as the motor domain, which is crucial for its ATPase activity and microtubule binding. Pathogenic mutations, particularly in the AAA1 and AAA6 domains, have been linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), leading to male infertility (Hwang2021Genetic). A novel variant affecting the C-terminal dynein heavy chain, which includes the AAA6 domain, has been identified. This variant retains the ATP binding site but lacks a p-loop motif, potentially altering ATP binding and hydrolysis (Hwang2021Genetic). The protein's structure and function are critical for the proper assembly and organization of axonemal components, including inner dynein arms and radial spokes (Hwang2021Genetic).

## Function
The DNAH2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) in the axoneme, a structure essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of flagellar and ciliary beating through ATP hydrolysis, which is crucial for the proper function of motile cilia and sperm flagella (Hwang2021Genetic). DNAH2 contains a microtubule binding domain and ATPase domains, which facilitate its function as a motor protein, enabling the movement necessary for cellular processes such as intracellular transport and mitosis (Hwang2021Genetic).

In healthy human cells, DNAH2 is involved in the structural stabilization and development of sperm flagella, contributing to their motility and function. It is essential for normal flagellar assembly and the organization of axonemal proteins, ensuring proper sperm motility and morphology (Hwang2021Genetic). DNAH2 is highly expressed in spermatocytes and early spermatids, indicating its pivotal role during spermiogenesis, the process of sperm cell development (Hwang2021Genetic). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the axoneme of cilia and flagella, where it contributes to the motility and function of these structures in the respiratory and reproductive systems (Hwang2021Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH2 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to male infertility. MMAF is characterized by various flagellar defects such as absent, short, curled, bent, or angulated flagella, which impair sperm motility and contribute to infertility (Li2019DNAH2; Hwang2021Genetic). Studies have identified several deleterious mutations in DNAH2, including novel variants that affect the dynein heavy domain, leading to structural destabilization of the sperm flagella (Li2019DNAH2; Hwang2021Genetic). These mutations result in the loss of inner dynein arms and disorganized axonemal structures, which are critical for proper sperm function (Li2019DNAH2).

In addition to its role in male infertility, DNAH2 mutations have been implicated in primary microcephaly, a condition characterized by a smaller than normal head size due to abnormal brain development (Jacquemin2023Congenital). DNAH2 mutations have also been linked to a higher chemotherapy response rate in gastric adenocarcinoma patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer treatment outcomes (Zhu2019Somatic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DNAH2 in various human diseases.

## Interactions
DNAH2, a component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) in the axoneme, is crucial for the motility of cilia and sperm flagella. It interacts with several axonemal proteins, including DNAH1 and RSPH3, which are essential for the proper localization and function of these proteins in sperm flagella. The absence of DNAH2 leads to the absence of DNAH1 and RSPH3, indicating its role in their assembly and organization (Hwang2021Genetic). DNAH2 also interacts with DNAL11, as evidenced by the absence of DNAL11 in sperm from individuals with DNAH2 mutations, suggesting a critical interaction for the proper assembly and function of the axonemal structure (Touré2020The).

DNAH2 contains microtubule binding and ATPase domains, which are essential for its function as a motor protein. Mutations in these domains can disrupt DNAH2's normal function, affecting its interactions with ATP molecules and potentially other proteins involved in flagellar function (Hwang2021Genetic). DNAH2 is also part of a group of genes encoding dynein arms, which are crucial for the rhythmic beating of cilia and flagella, suggesting potential interactions or co-regulation with other dynein genes (Wang2022Clinical).
