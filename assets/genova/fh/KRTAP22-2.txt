# KRTAP22-2

## Overview
KRTAP22-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 22-2, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of keratinized tissues. The expression of KRTAP22-2 is primarily localized to hair follicles, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to provide structural support and stability (Qiu2020aarFDC).
