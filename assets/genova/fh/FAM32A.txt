# FAM32A

## Overview
FAM32A is a gene that encodes a protein known as family with sequence similarity 32 member A, which functions as a metazoan-specific exon ligation factor within the spliceosome. This protein plays a critical role in the splicing process by stabilizing the interactions between key splice sites and the branch point adenosine, thereby facilitating exon ligation. FAM32A is involved in the structural integrity of the spliceosome and is known to interact with the Prp8 protein, contributing to efficient mRNA formation. It is expressed in multiple splice isoforms, suggesting functional diversity, and has been implicated in various biological processes, including tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation. The protein's involvement in diseases such as cancer, muscle atrophy, and cardiovascular conditions highlights its clinical significance (Fica2019A; Gim2023Relationship; Babak2015Target).

## Structure
FAM32A is a metazoan-specific exon ligation factor involved in the splicing process within the spliceosome. The protein is approximately 13 kDa in size and is known to bind between the endonuclease (EN) and N-terminal (N) domains of Prp8, projecting its C-terminus into the active site of the spliceosome. This positioning allows FAM32A to stabilize the pairing between the 5' splice site (5'SS), the 3' splice site (3'SS), and the branch point (BP) adenosine, working in conjunction with the alpha-finger and beta-finger of Prp8 (Fica2019A).

The C-terminus of FAM32A makes direct contacts with the phosphates of the 5'-exon, stabilizing its base-pairing to loop I of U5 snRNA. The positively charged side chain of its C-terminal lysine (K112) extends into the space where 5'SS, 3'SS, and BP converge, promoting the docking of the 3'SS (Fica2019A). FAM32A is expressed in three splice isoforms in mice, indicating potential functional diversity (Fica2019A).

The protein partly substitutes for Prp18 in yeast, binding the 5' exon in the C* complex to promote exon ligation, and is implicated in the splicing of a subset of pre-mRNAs (Fica2020CryoEM). FAM32A acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting mRNA formation for pro-apoptotic genes (Fica2019A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM32A has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of skeletal muscle mass, FAM32A is associated with muscle loss in middle-aged men, where it is up-regulated in individuals with insufficient muscle mass, suggesting a role in muscle atrophy (Gim2023Relationship). In non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-derived hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FAM32A is one of the down-regulated genes located in tumor-enriched open chromatin regions, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-specific transcriptome changes (Dechassa2018Identification).

FAM32A is also linked to recurrent stroke, where a methylation locus within its promoter region was identified as one of the most differentially methylated loci in stroke-related analyses, suggesting a role in cardiovascular phenotypes (Davis2018EpigenomeWide). In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), FAM32A acts as a splicing factor interacting with genes targeted by drugs like Dasatinib and Saracatinib, which are involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion, potentially contributing to drug resistance and disease progression (Zhuo2024Integrative). Additionally, FAM32A may induce G2 arrest and apoptosis, processes relevant to cancer treatment, as suggested in studies involving RAPTA complexes, which are antimetastatic agents (Babak2015Target).

## Interactions
FAM32A, also known as ovarian tumor associated gene-12 (OTAG-12), is a metazoan-specific exon ligation factor that plays a crucial role in the human postcatalytic spliceosome structure. It physically interacts with the Prp8 protein, binding between its endonuclease (EN) and N-terminal (N) domains, and projects its C-terminus into the active site. This interaction stabilizes the pairing between the 5' splice site (5'SS), the 3' splice site (3'SS), and the branch point (BP) adenosine, thereby promoting exon ligation (Fica2019A). FAM32A also makes direct contacts with the 5'-exon, stabilizing its base-pairing to loop I of U5 snRNA, which is essential for efficient mRNA formation (Fica2019A).

FAM32A further stabilizes the binding of Slu7 by interacting with the Prp8 EN domain, highlighting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the spliceosome during exon ligation (Fica2019A). Additionally, FAM32A has been identified as a potential target of the antimetastatic RAPTA complex, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, although the specific interactions in this context are not fully understood (Babak2015Target).
