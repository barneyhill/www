# CLDN19

## Overview
The CLDN19 gene encodes claudin-19, a tetra-span transmembrane protein that is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin-19 is part of the claudin family, which is essential for maintaining the barrier function and ion selectivity of tight junctions. This protein is particularly significant in the kidney and eye, where it plays a role in ion homeostasis and visual function, respectively. In the kidney, claudin-19 forms a cation-selective channel with claudin-16, facilitating the reabsorption of magnesium and calcium ions. In the eye, it is involved in retinal neurogenesis and the visual cycle. Mutations in CLDN19 can lead to familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a disorder characterized by renal and ocular abnormalities (ClaverieMartín2013Claudin19; Hou2008Claudin16; Wang2019Diseaseassociated).

## Structure
Claudin-19 (CLDN19) is a tetra-span transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the formation of tight junctions. The protein is composed of four transmembrane domains (TMDs), two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2), a cytoplasmic loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (PerdomoRamirez2019Characterization). The first extracellular loop (ECL1) is involved in paracellular tightening and permeation, while the second extracellular loop (ECL2) is crucial for intermolecular interactions (Krause2015Assembly).

The crystal structure of claudin-19 has been elucidated, revealing a left-handed four-helix bundle arrangement, which is a common structural motif among claudins (Krause2015Assembly). This structure has been used to model other claudins, indicating shared structural features (Krause2015Assembly). The interaction of claudin-19 with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) highlights the importance of ECL2 in binding, as demonstrated in the crystal structure of the Cldn19/cCPE complex (Krause2015Assembly).

Mutations in CLDN19 can lead to significant structural changes, such as the skipping of exon 2, which results in a claudin-19 protein missing parts of its structure, including portions of ECL1 and TMDs (PerdomoRamirez2019Characterization). These structural alterations can impact the protein's function and are associated with diseases like familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) (PerdomoRamirez2019Characterization).

## Function
Claudin-19, encoded by the CLDN19 gene, is a transmembrane protein integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. In healthy human cells, claudin-19 is crucial for maintaining the barrier function and ion selectivity of these junctions, particularly in the kidney and eye. In the kidney, claudin-19 interacts with claudin-16 to form a cation-selective tight junction complex in the thick ascending limb, which is essential for the reabsorption of magnesium and calcium ions. This interaction helps maintain ion homeostasis by blocking chloride ions and enhancing cation selectivity (Hou2008Claudin16).

In the eye, claudin-19 is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), where it plays a significant role in retinal neurogenesis and visual function. It regulates the expression of RPE-specific genes, including those involved in the visual cycle and retinal differentiation, such as RPE65, which is crucial for the reisomerization of all-trans-retinal to regenerate 11-cis-retinal (Wang2019Diseaseassociated). Claudin-19's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of tight junctions in these tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLDN19 gene, which encodes the tight-junction protein claudin-19, are associated with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by renal magnesium wasting, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure, often leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Konrad2006Mutations; ClaverieMartín2014Clinical). Patients with CLDN19 mutations frequently exhibit severe ocular abnormalities, including myopia, nystagmus, and macular colobomata, due to the expression of claudin-19 in the retinal pigment epithelium (Yuan2015First; Faguer2011Renal).

Specific mutations such as G20D, Q57E, and L90P have been identified as pathogenic, affecting protein function through mechanisms like trafficking defects and disruption of protein-protein interactions (Konrad2006Mutations). The G20D mutation, in particular, is noted for its founder effect in Spanish and French populations (ClaverieMartín2013Claudin19). These mutations can also lead to neuromuscular symptoms, including muscular-exercise intolerance and limb stiffness (Faguer2011Renal). Genetic testing for CLDN19 mutations is used to confirm clinical diagnoses and assess genetic risk in affected families (ClaverieMartín2014Clinical).

## Interactions
Claudin-19 (CLDN19) is a tight junction protein that interacts with claudin-16 (CLDN16) to form a cation-selective paracellular channel, crucial for magnesium reabsorption in the kidney. This interaction is essential for maintaining the cation selectivity of tight junctions in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where both proteins colocalize (ClaverieMartín2013Claudin19; Hou2008Claudin16). CLDN19 can form homomeric interactions and tight junction strands independently, while CLDN16 cannot. However, when coexpressed, CLDN19 recruits CLDN16 into tight junctions, indicating a heteromeric interaction (Hou2008Claudin16).

Mutations in CLDN19, such as G20D and Q57E, significantly impair its interaction with CLDN16, reducing the synergistic effect on ion selectivity (Hou2008Claudin16). The G20D mutation causes a trafficking defect, leading to perinuclear retention of the protein instead of proper membrane localization (Konrad2006Mutations). The interaction between CLDN19 and CLDN16 is confirmed through various methods, including coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which demonstrate their physical interaction in epithelial cells (Hou2008Claudin16). These interactions are crucial for the physiological function of tight junctions, and disruptions can lead to conditions like familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) (Hou2008Claudin16).
