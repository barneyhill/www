# SF3B6

## Overview
SF3B6 is a gene that encodes the protein splicing factor 3b subunit 6, also known as p14, which is a component of the SF3B complex within the spliceosome. The SF3B6 protein is a small globular subunit characterized by an unusual RNA recognition motif (RRM) that is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression regulation. Despite its role in the recognition and stabilization of the branch site during splicing, SF3B6 exhibits weak RNA-binding capabilities due to structural occlusions in its RRM. It interacts with other spliceosomal proteins, such as SF3B1, influencing spliceosome assembly and function. SF3B6's involvement in alternative splicing and its potential allosteric regulation of SF3B1 highlight its significance in cellular processes and its implications in diseases such as cancer, where alterations in splicing can contribute to tumorigenesis (Li2021The; Yazhini2021Rewards; Cretu2024Molecular).

## Structure
The SF3B6 protein, also known as p14, is a small globular subunit of the SF3B complex, with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa. It is characterized by an unusual RNA recognition motif (RRM), where the RNA recognition surface is occluded by a C-terminal helical region (Cretu2024Molecular). This structural feature impedes its RNA binding capability, as the RRM's RNA binding region is blocked by its own helix α3, C-terminal tail, and an interacting region from SF3B1 (Yazhini2021Rewards). 

SF3B6 is involved in the recognition of the branch helix and the invariant branch site adenosine (BS-A) during pre-spliceosome assembly. Despite its interactions, SF3B6 does not exhibit sequence specificity for the branch site or the U2/BS duplex and generally interacts weakly with RNA (Cretu2024Molecular). It is part of the extended U2/BS helix structure, which contains noncanonical base pairs and is contacted by other spliceosomal proteins, linking it to the 5' splice site (Kastner2019Structural). 

SF3B6 is absent in yeast, and its role in humans may involve allosteric regulation of SF3B1, potentially affecting alternative splicing (Yazhini2021Rewards).

## Function
SF3B6, also known as p14, is a subunit of the SF3B complex, which is a critical component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein plays a significant role in the recognition and stabilization of the branch site (BS) during the splicing process. SF3B6 interacts directly with the branch-site adenosine (BS-A) and is involved in the assembly of the pre-spliceosome, where it helps in recognizing the branch helix and the invariant BS-A (Cretu2024Molecular).

Despite its involvement in these interactions, SF3B6 does not exhibit sequence specificity for the branch site or the U2/BS duplex, and it interacts weakly with RNA. However, it can be crosslinked close to the branch site in the isolated 17S U2 snRNP, indicating its proximity and potential role in the splicing machinery (Cretu2024Molecular). SF3B6 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the removal of introns and the joining of exons to produce mature mRNA, impacting cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation (Cretu2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
SF3B6, a component of the spliceosome complex, plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing. Alterations in its expression or function have been implicated in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The long non-coding RNA DKFZp434J0226 has been shown to interact with SF3B6, leading to its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which are essential for the alternative splicing of downstream genes such as MDM4. This process is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PDAC, contributing to tumor growth and poor prognosis in patients (Li2021The).

The overexpression of DKFZp434J0226 in PDAC results in enhanced SF3B6 activity, which is linked to aggressive tumor behavior and decreased overall survival. This suggests that SF3B6, through its interaction with DKFZp434J0226, may serve as a prognostic factor in PDAC and a potential therapeutic target (Li2021The). While the study primarily focuses on PDAC, it highlights the broader implications of SF3B6 alterations in cancer, where abnormal splicing can lead to oncogenic isoforms or disrupt tumor suppressor genes, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis (Li2021The).

## Interactions
SF3B6, a component of the SF3b complex, plays a significant role in the spliceosome assembly by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with SF3B1, a major subunit of the SF3b complex, influencing its dynamics and function. The binding of SF3B6 to SF3B1 affects the 'open-to-close' and 'twist' movements of SF3B1, which are crucial for its interaction with pre-mRNA and U2 snRNA (Yazhini2021Rewards). SF3B6 also interacts with the branch site adenosine during pre-spliceosome assembly, although it does not exhibit sequence specificity for the branch site or U2/BS duplex (Cretu2024Molecular).

The interaction between SF3B6 and SF3B1 is mediated by a sequence motif in the N-terminal domain of SF3B1, known as the p14-interacting region (pir) (Cretu2024Molecular). SF3B6's role as an allosteric regulator of SF3B1 is suggested by its ability to modulate branch point sequence selection during alternative splicing (Yazhini2021Rewards). Despite its weak RNA-binding capability, SF3B6 is involved in the recognition of the branch helix and invariant BS-A, contributing to the spliceosome's catalytic activation and function (Cretu2024Molecular).
