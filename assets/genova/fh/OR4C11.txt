# OR4C11

## Overview
The OR4C11 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 11, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (Li2019Metabolites). As a transmembrane receptor, it is involved in chemosensory processes, contributing to the perception of smell and taste, and has been linked to behavioral traits such as smoking (Li2019Metabolites). Beyond its sensory functions, OR4C11 is also implicated in physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, highlighting its broader biological significance (Li2019Metabolites). Additionally, the gene has been associated with clinical conditions, including an increased risk of early-onset breast cancer, underscoring its potential role in disease susceptibility (Boujemaa2021Germline; Walker2017Increased).

## Function
The OR4C11 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Li2019Metabolites). The olfactory receptors, including OR4C11, are involved in chemosensory functions, contributing to taste and smell, and are known to regulate smoking behavior (Li2019Metabolites).

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR4C11 have been implicated in the regulation of blood pressure. They are expressed in the kidney, where they respond to gut-derived short-chain fatty acids and mediate a reduction in blood pressure via the renin pathway (Li2019Metabolites). This suggests that OR4C11 may have functions beyond olfaction, potentially influencing cardiovascular health. The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both sensory perception and physiological regulation.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4C11 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to breast cancer. Studies have identified that deletions in the OR4C11 gene are associated with an increased risk of early-onset breast cancer. Specifically, these deletions have been linked to a 2.6-fold increased risk of developing the disease, suggesting a significant role in breast cancer susceptibility (Walker2017Increased). The gene is located at 11q11, a region frequently deleted in high-grade breast tumors, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Walker2017Increased).

Despite these associations, the expression of OR4C11 does not appear to correlate directly with copy number loss, implying that the locus might contain regulatory elements affecting other genes rather than being directly involved in cancer progression (Walker2017Increased). Additionally, OR4C11 has been identified in studies exploring germline CNVs in BRCA1/2 negative families, further supporting its potential role in hereditary breast cancer risk (Boujemaa2021Germline). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in OR4C11 beyond its association with breast cancer risk are not well-documented.
