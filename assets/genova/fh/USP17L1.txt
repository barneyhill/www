# USP17L1

## Overview
USP17L1 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 1, which is part of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. This family of enzymes is crucial for the regulation of protein degradation and function through the removal of ubiquitin moieties from substrate proteins, a process known as deubiquitination. The USP17L1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune responses, by maintaining protein homeostasis. It is characterized by its polymorphic copy number variation, suggesting a role in cellular adaptability and function. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is implicated in tissue development and immune function. Dysregulation of USP17L1 activity is associated with disease progression, making it a target of interest for therapeutic interventions, particularly in oncology (Foster2024DoUBLing).

## Function
USP17L1 is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, which plays a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation, localization, and activity by removing ubiquitin from target proteins. This deubiquitinating activity is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and immune responses (Foster2024DoUBLing).

USP17L1 is known for its highly polymorphic copy number variation, which suggests a potential role in diverse cellular functions and adaptability (Foster2024DoUBLing). The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and survival. This dual localization allows USP17L1 to participate in multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes, impacting organismal outcomes such as tissue development and immune function (Foster2024DoUBLing).

Errors in USP17L1 activity can contribute to disease progression, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic stability. There is ongoing interest in developing small molecule inhibitors targeting USP17L1 and other DUBs for therapeutic applications, particularly in cancer treatment (Foster2024DoUBLing).
