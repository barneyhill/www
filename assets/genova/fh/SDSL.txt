# SDSL

## Overview
The SDSL gene encodes the serine dehydratase-like protein, which is involved in amino acid metabolism. This protein is categorized as a dehydratase, an enzyme that catalyzes the removal of water from a substrate, specifically acting on serine and threonine. The SDSL gene is expressed in various tissues, and its protein product plays a crucial role in the catabolism of serine, contributing to the regulation of serine levels within the body. Alterations in the expression or function of the SDSL gene may have implications for metabolic disorders, although the precise clinical significance is still under investigation. Understanding the interactions and regulatory mechanisms of the SDSL gene and its protein product is essential for elucidating its role in human health and disease.
