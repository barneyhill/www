# SH3BGRL

## Overview
The SH3BGRL gene encodes the SH3 domain binding glutamate-rich protein-like, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by a thioredoxin fold and a helix-loop-helix motif, distinguishing it as a novel class within the thioredoxin fold protein family (Yin2005Crystal). Although it contains motifs typically associated with protein-protein interactions, such as SH3 and Homer EVH1-binding motifs, these are not accessible for binding due to their burial within the protein's tertiary structure (Yin2005Crystal). Functionally, SH3BGRL acts as a tumor suppressor in normal human cells by regulating the activation of the oncogene c-Src, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2015Dualfaced). However, in pathological contexts such as breast cancer, SH3BGRL can contribute to drug resistance by stabilizing HER2 activation, highlighting its dual role in cancer biology (Li2020SH3BGRL).

## Structure
The SH3BGRL protein, encoded by the SH3BGRL gene located on chromosome Xq13.3, consists of 114 amino acids and is characterized by a thioredoxin fold at the N-terminal and a helix-loop-helix motif at the C-terminal (Yin2005Crystal). This structure is distinct from the five known classes of thioredoxin fold proteins, suggesting that SH3BGRL represents a novel class within this family (Yin2005Crystal). The protein contains SH3-binding and Homer EVH1-binding motifs, which are important for protein-protein interactions in signal transduction pathways (Yin2005Expression). However, the crystal structure reveals that the proline-rich sequence (PLPPQIF), initially thought to facilitate binding to SH3 and Homer EVH1 domains, is buried within the protein's tertiary structure, preventing such interactions (Yin2005Crystal).

The crystallization of SH3BGRL was achieved using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, and the structure was refined to a resolution of 1.9 Å, with an R-factor of 0.168 and R free of 0.212 (Yin2005Crystal). The final model includes 113 ordered residues, one citrate molecule, 192 water molecules, and a his tag (Yin2005Crystal). The protein was expressed in E. coli for structural analysis (Yin2005Expression; Yin2005Crystal).

## Function
The SH3BGRL protein, encoded by the SH3BGRL gene, plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is a member of the SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich protein family and contains a proline-rich sequence with SH3 and Homer EVH1-binding motifs, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Yin2005Crystal). However, the crystal structure of SH3BGRL reveals that these motifs are buried within the protein's tertiary structure, suggesting that it may not bind to SH3 or Homer EVH1 domains as previously thought (Yin2005Crystal).

In normal human cells, the wild-type SH3BGRL protein functions as a tumor suppressor. It is involved in regulating the activation of c-Src, a known oncogene, by acting as a scaffold or binding partner to control c-Src activation (Wang2015Dualfaced). This regulatory role is crucial because activating mutations in c-Src are rare in human cancers, and SH3BGRL's ability to modulate this pathway helps maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent tumorigenesis (Wang2015Dualfaced). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various molecular processes, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (Wang2015Dualfaced).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3BGRL gene is implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where it plays a role in drug resistance and tumor progression. In breast cancer, SH3BGRL is upregulated and interacts with the HER2 protein, stabilizing its activation on the cell membrane. This interaction contributes to innate drug resistance, particularly against HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin) and kinase inhibitors such as Lapatinib (Li2020SH3BGRL). The gene's overexpression enhances downstream signaling pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival (Li2020SH3BGRL).

Mutations in SH3BGRL, such as R76C, can transform its function from tumor-suppressive to oncogenic, promoting metastasis by activating signaling pathways like Src, ERK, and AKT (Wang2015Dualfaced). These mutations highlight the gene's dual role, being oncogenic in mice but tumor-suppressive in humans (Wang2015Dualfaced).

The expression level of SH3BGRL is also linked to poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapy stratification (Li2020SH3BGRL). Targeting SH3BGRL or its downstream pathways could offer therapeutic strategies for managing drug-resistant breast cancers (Li2020SH3BGRL).

## Interactions
SH3BGRL interacts with the HER2 protein in breast cancer, playing a significant role in stabilizing HER2 activation on the cell membrane. This interaction is facilitated by specific structural components of SH3BGRL, namely the α2 helix and β3 sheet, which are crucial for binding. The binding of SH3BGRL to HER2 prolongs HER2's presence on the cell membrane, delaying its endocytosis and enhancing its phosphorylation at specific tyrosine sites, such as Y1196 and Y877. This stabilization of HER2 contributes to drug resistance in breast cancer by promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival (Li2020SH3BGRL).

SH3BGRL3, a related protein, interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in urothelial carcinoma. This interaction is mediated through the adaptor protein Grb2, as SH3BGRL3 lacks the SH2 domain necessary for direct binding to phosphorylated residues of EGFR. The interaction affects the phosphorylation status of signaling molecules such as Akt and Erk1/2, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation signaling pathways. SH3BGRL3's interaction with EGFR is influenced by specific mutations at tyrosine residues Y1173, Y1068, and Y1086, which are involved in EGFR signaling pathways (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3).
