# PPRC1

## Overview
PPRC1 (PPARG related coactivator 1) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional coactivator protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. The protein, also referred to as PPARG related coactivator 1, is a member of the PGC-1 family of coactivators, which are known for their roles in modulating gene expression related to energy homeostasis and metabolic processes. PPRC1 functions primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with various nuclear receptors and transcription factors to influence processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenesis (De2019The). The protein is characterized by its activation domain containing LXXLL motifs for nuclear receptor binding and a conserved RNA-binding domain, suggesting additional roles in RNA splicing and mRNA processing (De2019The). PPRC1 is implicated in lipid metabolism regulation and has been associated with longevity and metabolic health, as well as playing a role in cancer pathogenesis, particularly in glioblastoma (Tsai2021Type; Shi2021An).

## Function
PPRC1 (PPARG related coactivator 1) is a transcriptional coactivator involved in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism. It interacts with nuclear receptors and transcription factors to modulate gene expression, playing a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis. PPRC1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenesis (De2019The).

PPRC1 is part of the PGC-1 family of coactivators, which includes PGC-1α and PGC-1β. These coactivators share extensive protein sequence similarity and are involved in regulating various physiological processes, including mitochondrial metabolism (De2019The). PPRC1, like other members of the PGC-1 family, contains an activation domain at the N-terminal region, which includes LXXLL nuclear receptor box motifs that bind with nuclear receptors, particularly the estrogen-related receptor family. The C-terminal region includes a conserved RNA-binding domain, suggesting a role in RNA splicing and mRNA processing (De2019The).

PPRC1 is implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism and may contribute to longevity through metabolic regulation. It is involved in the beneficial effects of dietary interventions on lifespan extension, as its expression is negatively correlated with palmitic acid levels, indicating its role in promoting longevity through metabolic regulation (Shi2021An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PPRC1 gene have been implicated in several metabolic and cancer-related conditions. In the context of metabolic disorders, PPRC1 is associated with resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Studies on heterozygous PPRC1 knockout mice (Pprc1+/-) have shown that these mice exhibit decreased body weight and fat mass, increased lean mass, and elevated energy expenditure when subjected to a high-fat diet. This suggests a protective role of PPRC1 against obesity, potentially through enhanced fat oxidation and changes in lipid metabolism (Zhai2015Resistance). There is also a marginal association between PPRC1 and type 2 diabetes in humans, indicating its potential involvement in metabolic diseases (Zhai2015Resistance).

In cancer, PPRC1 has been identified as a significant transcriptional regulator in the malignancy of glioblastoma (GBM). The COL5A1-PPRC1-ESM1 axis is a critical pathway in GBM, where PPRC1 activity is triggered by COL5A1, leading to the activation of downstream targets that promote cell migration and invasion. This axis is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and actin polymerization, suggesting that alterations in PPRC1 expression or function could influence GBM progression (Tsai2021Type).

## Interactions
PPRC1 interacts with several transcription factors and proteins, playing a significant role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. It is known to interact with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) through its DNA binding domain, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, such as cytochrome c (Zhang2021A). This interaction requires both NRF-1 and CREB recognition sites, highlighting the complexity of its regulatory mechanisms (Zhang2021A).

In the context of glioblastoma, PPRC1 is part of the COL5A1-PPRC1-ESM1 axis, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. This axis is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and actin filament regulation, contributing to the malignancy and metastatic potential of glioblastoma cells (Tsai2021Type). PPRC1's role in this axis suggests its involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration, further emphasizing its regulatory capacity in various cellular processes (Tsai2021Type).

These interactions underline PPRC1's importance in both normal cellular functions and disease states, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions like premature ovarian failure and glioblastoma.
