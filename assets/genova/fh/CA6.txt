# CA6

## Overview
The CA6 gene encodes the protein carbonic anhydrase VI (CA VI), a secreted enzyme that belongs to the carbonic anhydrase family, which is characterized by its role in catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide. CA VI is predominantly found in human saliva and milk, where it plays a critical role in maintaining pH balance and contributing to oral health by neutralizing acids produced by oral bacteria. This enzyme is also involved in taste perception and has been implicated in immune defense mechanisms, particularly in the oral cavity. Structurally, CA VI is notable for its oligomeric forms, primarily hexamers, which are stabilized by glycosylation patterns. The gene's variations have been linked to oral health conditions, such as dental caries, highlighting its clinical significance (Esberg2019Carbonic; Aspatwar2022Roles; Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA VI) is a secreted isoenzyme primarily found in human saliva and milk. The CA VI protein is encoded by the CA6 gene, which spans approximately 25 kb and consists of eight exons and seven introns. The primary structure of CA VI includes a signal peptide and a unique C-terminal extension encoded by exon 8, which is rich in hydrophilic amino acids (JIANG1999Structure).

The secondary and tertiary structures of CA VI feature a typical carbonic anhydrase fold, characterized by a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. The protein includes an internal disulfide bond and two N-linked oligosaccharides at Asn67 and Asn256, which are sites of glycosylation. These glycosylation sites contribute to the structural heterogeneity observed between milk and salivary CA VI (JIANG1999Structure; Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical).

In terms of quaternary structure, CA VI forms oligomers larger than dimers, with hexamers and larger oligomers being predominant in solution. The oligomerization is facilitated by the C-terminal extension, which forms an amphipathic helix allowing for hydrophobic interactions between dimers (Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical). The active sites of CA VI monomers face each other in the dimer, with a small opening at the dimer interface for substrate access (Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6) is a secreted enzyme primarily found in human saliva, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining pH balance by catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide (Murakami1987Purification; Esberg2019Carbonic). This enzymatic activity helps neutralize acids produced by oral bacteria, contributing to the protection against dental caries and erosion by maintaining the integrity of tooth tissues (Esberg2019Carbonic). CA6 is also involved in taste perception, particularly in the regulation of bitter taste sensitivity. Studies using CA6 knockout mice have shown altered taste preferences, indicating its role in gustatory function (Patrikainen2014The).

In addition to its role in the oral cavity, CA6 has been implicated in immune defense mechanisms. It is suggested to be part of the innate immune system, with high expression levels on surfaces facing external environments, such as the oral cavity, which may help in primary immune defense (Aspatwar2022Roles). The enzyme's presence in saliva and its involvement in maintaining oral health highlight its importance in both local pH regulation and broader physiological processes related to taste and immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the CA6 gene have been linked to several oral health conditions, particularly dental caries. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CA6 gene, such as rs10864376, rs3737665, and rs12138897, are associated with an increased presence of Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium linked to dental caries, suggesting a genetic influence on oral microbiota composition and caries risk (Esberg2019Carbonic). The CCC haplotype of haploblock 4 in the CA6 gene is associated with a lower prevalence of S. mutans and caries, while the TTG haplotype is linked to a higher prevalence (Esberg2019Carbonic).

In type 2 diabetic patients, the rs2274327 polymorphism in the CA6 gene is associated with lower salivary pH, flow rate, and buffer capacity, leading to higher risks of dental caries and xerostomia (Mrag2020Investigation). Additionally, CA6 gene variations may affect the enzyme's role in pH regulation and bacterial adhesion, influencing the balance of aciduric species and the de- and remineralization process in caries development (Esberg2019Carbonic). These genetic variations highlight the potential clinical significance of CA6 in oral health.

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6) is known to participate in various interactions that are significant for its function. CA6 is predominantly found in human saliva and milk, where it exists mainly as oligomers, particularly hexamers, at different pH levels (Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical). The enzyme's oligomeric state is influenced by its glycosylation patterns, with glycosylation at Asn256 playing a role in stabilizing dimers and affecting activity and inhibition (Yrjänäinen2022Biochemical). 

In terms of protein interactions, CA6 has been detected as a salivary protein that binds to Staphylococcus aureus, although its binding was not robustly confirmed under certain experimental conditions (Heo2013Host). This suggests a potential, albeit weak, interaction with bacterial surfaces, which may have implications for oral health and immune defense.

Additionally, CA6 is involved in stress-inducible gene expression regulated by the transcription factor CHOP. A novel intracellular form of CA6 is expressed in response to stress, requiring both CHOP and C/EBPβ for its expression. This form of CA6 is hypothesized to play a role in intracellular pH regulation during stress (Sok1999CHOP-Dependent). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of CA6 in physiological processes and stress responses.
