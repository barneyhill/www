# ITPR2

## Overview
The ITPR2 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2), a critical component of calcium signaling pathways in various cell types. IP3R2 is a tetrameric receptor that functions as a calcium channel located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. It plays a pivotal role in the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm upon binding with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), thereby influencing numerous physiological processes, including liver regeneration, synaptic pruning, and cellular senescence (Ziegler2021Calcium; Alzayady2016Defining). The receptor's structure comprises three main domains: an N-terminal IP3-binding domain, a regulatory domain, and a C-terminal channel domain, which together facilitate its function in calcium homeostasis (Chandrasekhar2015Using). Mutations in the ITPR2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, such as congenital anhidrosis and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its significance in human health (Klar2014Abolished; Staats2016Genetic).

## Structure
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2) is a tetrameric calcium channel protein encoded by the ITPR2 gene. Each IP3R2 subunit is approximately 2700 amino acids long and consists of three main functional domains: the N-terminal IP3-binding domain, an intermediary regulatory domain, and a C-terminal channel domain containing six transmembrane helices that form the Ca2+-permeable pore (Alzayady2016Defining). The N-terminal domain is crucial for ligand binding, while the C-terminal domain is involved in oligomerization and localization within the endoplasmic reticulum (Chandrasekhar2015Using).

The quaternary structure of IP3R2 involves the assembly of four subunits into a tetrameric channel, which can be composed of either homomeric or heteromeric subunits (Alzayady2016Defining). This tetrameric assembly is essential for the channel's function, as all four subunits must bind IP3 to initiate Ca2+ release (Alzayady2016Defining). The regulatory domain contains sites for modulation by various factors, including Ca2+, ATP, and protein kinase A (PKA), with phosphorylation by PKA enhancing channel activity (Chandrasekhar2015Using).

IP3R2 also exhibits splice variants, such as the R2 short variant, which lacks activity due to the absence of amino acids 176-208 in the suppressor domain, affecting IP3 binding affinity (Alzayady2016Defining).

## Function
The ITPR2 gene encodes the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2, a calcium channel located on the endoplasmic reticulum. This receptor plays a crucial role in calcium signaling by facilitating the release of calcium ions into the cytoplasm in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding. In hepatocytes, ITPR2 is predominantly expressed and is essential for calcium signaling processes that regulate bile secretion and liver regeneration by promoting cell proliferation (Ogino2022Neutrophils). ITPR2 is also involved in the formation of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs), which are critical for calcium exchange between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. This calcium transfer is vital for various cellular functions, including energy production and apoptosis (Ziegler2021Calcium).

In the context of cellular senescence, ITPR2 promotes the transfer of calcium to mitochondria, which is associated with increased cellular aging and senescence. Loss of ITPR2 has been shown to reduce senescence levels, suggesting its role in aging by influencing cellular senescence (Ziegler2021Calcium). Additionally, ITPR2 is involved in synapse elimination in astrocytes through ATP release, which is crucial for synaptic pruning (Yang2016Astrocytes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITPR2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A notable mutation, c.7492G>A, results in a glycine-to-serine substitution (p.G2498S) in the InsP3R2 protein, leading to congenital generalized and isolated anhidrosis. This condition is characterized by absent eccrine sweat production and severe heat intolerance. The mutation disrupts the protein's ability to mediate calcium release, which is crucial for sweat induction, resulting in anhidrosis in affected individuals (Klar2014Abolished).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ITPR2 expression is significantly upregulated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) models, suggesting a potential compensatory response to inflammation. Genetic ablation of ITPR2 in ALS mouse models resulted in decreased survival and increased inflammation, indicating that ITPR2 may play a protective role against inflammation in ALS (Staats2016Genetic). However, in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), genetic ablation of ITPR2 did not significantly impact disease progression, highlighting the complexity of its role in different neurodegenerative conditions (CunhaGarcia2023Genetic).

## Interactions
ITPR2, or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in calcium signaling. ITPR2 plays a significant role in promoting mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs), which are essential for calcium exchange between these organelles. It interacts with proteins such as ITPR1 and VDAC1 at MERCs, facilitating calcium transfer to the mitochondria and promoting cellular senescence (Ziegler2021Calcium). ITPR2 also interacts with GRP75, which links the ER and mitochondria by binding to ITPRs and VDACs, suggesting a role in tethering these organelles (Ziegler2021Calcium).

In addition to its structural role, ITPR2 is involved in calcium signaling through interactions with Jaw1, a protein that enhances calcium influx upon GPCR stimulation. Jaw1 interacts with ITPR2 via its coiled-coil domain, affecting the calcium release activity of ITPR2 (Okumura2022Jaw1LRMP). These interactions highlight the importance of ITPR2 in maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis and its involvement in processes such as cellular senescence and aging. The interactions of ITPR2 with other proteins are crucial for its function in calcium signaling and its role in cellular processes.
