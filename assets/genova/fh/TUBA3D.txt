# TUBA3D

## Overview
TUBA3D is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin alpha 3d, a member of the alpha tubulin family, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of microtubules. Microtubules are integral components of the cytoskeleton, essential for maintaining cellular structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division. The tubulin alpha 3d protein, through its interaction with beta-tubulin, forms heterodimers that assemble into microtubules, contributing to cellular architecture and dynamics (Nsamba2022Tubulin). TUBA3D is notably expressed in the human cornea, where it is crucial for maintaining corneal structure and integrity, and its mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of keratoconus, a degenerative corneal disease (Hao2017De). The protein's involvement in the 'tubulin code' underscores its significance in modulating microtubule function through specific isotype compositions and post-translational modifications (Nsamba2022Tubulin).

## Structure
The TUBA3D gene encodes a member of the alpha tubulin family, which is a crucial component of microtubules. These microtubules are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in intracellular transport (Hao2017De). The primary structure of TUBA3D consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of tubulin proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a compact, functional form, although specific details about the tertiary structure of TUBA3D are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure of tubulin involves dimerization with beta-tubulin to form microtubules, a process that is critical for microtubule assembly and stability (Nsamba2022Tubulin).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation are common in tubulin proteins, affecting their stability and function. These modifications can influence microtubule dynamics and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (Nsamba2022Tubulin). The TUBA3D protein's role in microtubule formation is vital for cellular processes, and mutations in this gene can lead to structural changes associated with diseases like keratoconus (Hao2017De).

## Function
The TUBA3D gene encodes a member of the alpha tubulin family, which is a critical component of microtubules. Microtubules are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in intracellular transport and cell division. In healthy human cells, TUBA3D is involved in forming microtubules by heterodimerizing with beta-tubulin, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating mitosis (Marchocki2022Impact; Nsamba2022Tubulin).

TUBA3D is highly expressed in the human cornea, indicating its significant role in maintaining corneal structure and function. It contributes to the stability of the corneal extracellular matrix, which is vital for corneal integrity (Hao2017De). The gene is also expressed in other tissues, including the sclera, peripheral blood, and corneal epithelial cells, suggesting a broader role in maintaining cellular and tissue structure (Hao2017De).

The protein's function in microtubule dynamics is further supported by its involvement in the 'tubulin code,' where specific isotype compositions and post-translational modifications contribute to microtubule function and cellular processes (Nsamba2022Tubulin). This highlights the importance of TUBA3D in cellular architecture and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBA3D gene have been associated with keratoconus (KC), a degenerative corneal disease characterized by thinning and distortion of the cornea. Studies have identified specific mutations, such as c.31 C > T (p.Gln11stop) and c.201insTT (p.Val68Leufs*2), which are absent in healthy controls and predicted to be disease-causing (Hao2017De). These mutations lead to protein degradation, increased oxidative stress, and overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), contributing to the pathogenesis of KC by affecting the stability of TUBA3D and altering extracellular matrix composition (Hao2017De; Veerappa2021Cascade).

The presence of TUBA3D mutations in KC patients suggests a potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms, with mutations leading to higher expressions of MMPs and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels compared to wild-type cells (Veerappa2021Cascade). These changes are thought to contribute to stromal thinning and breaks in Bowman's layer, which are characteristic of keratoconus corneas (Hao2017De). The identification of TUBA3D mutations in KC highlights the gene's significance in the disease and suggests that mutational screening could aid in its molecular diagnosis (Hao2017De).
