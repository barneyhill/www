# C10orf71

## Overview
C10orf71, also known as cardiac enriched FHL2 interacting protein (CEFIP), is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within muscle tissues. The protein encoded by C10orf71 is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it plays a significant role in the regulation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade, a pathway essential for muscle function and cardiac health (Chograni2023Autosomal). This protein is localized at the z-disk, a key structural component of muscle cells, contributing to their mechanical stability and contractility. While the precise molecular functions of the C10orf71 protein in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in muscle structure and signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Chograni2023Autosomal).

## Function
The C10orf71 gene, also known as cardiac enriched FHL2 interacting protein (CEFIP), is involved in the positive regulation of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade, a critical pathway for muscle function. This gene is specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue and is located at the z-disk, a structural component essential for the mechanical stability and contractility of these muscles (Chograni2023Autosomal). CEFIP plays a role in regulating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by modulating calcineurin signaling, which is crucial for cardiac health and muscle function (Chograni2023Autosomal).

In healthy human cells, C10orf71 is implicated in maintaining cellular structure and function, potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation. The protein encoded by this gene is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may impact overall organismal development and homeostasis (Chograni2023Autosomal). Although its specific molecular activities in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in the z-disk structure and calcineurin signaling suggests a significant role in muscle function and possibly cardiac health (Chograni2023Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C10orf71 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive congenital cataract, a condition characterized by lens opacity leading to blindness. A study identified a novel 4-bp deletion mutation at the 3'-splicing acceptor site of intron 3-exon 4 in the C10orf71 gene. This mutation disrupts normal splicing, resulting in a truncated protein and is associated with a complex phenotype that includes congenital cataract, facial dysmorphism, growth retardation, Dandy-Walker anomaly, axial hypotonia, and polymalformative syndrome (Chograni2023Autosomal).

Alterations in the expression of C10orf71 have also been implicated in pediatric Wilms tumor (WT). High expression levels of C10orf71 are associated with a lower risk of death, suggesting a favorable prognosis for WT patients. This gene is part of a five-mRNA signature used as a prognostic biomarker in WT, indicating its potential role in predicting survival outcomes (Liu2021A; Lin2019Identification).

The C10orf71 gene has not been previously associated with any autosomal recessive phenotype, making these findings significant for understanding its role in congenital cataracts and its potential involvement in other conditions (Chograni2023Autosomal).
