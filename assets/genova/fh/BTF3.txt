# BTF3

## Overview
BTF3, or Basal Transcription Factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription and translation processes in eukaryotic cells. The BTF3 protein is categorized as a basic transcription factor and plays a crucial role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, facilitating the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex. It is evolutionarily conserved and essential for early development, as evidenced by its critical role in embryogenesis (Deng1995An). The gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms, BTF3a and BTF3b, which differ in their functional roles and cellular localization (Kanno1992Genomic). BTF3a is transcriptionally active and a potential substrate for protein kinase CK2, while BTF3b is involved in translocation processes (Freire2005Translation; Grein1999BTF3isapotentialnewsubstrateofproteinkinaseCK2). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the estrogen receptor α and translation initiation factors, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular regulation (Freire2005Translation; Green2007Interaction). BTF3's expression levels have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019Upregulation; Zhou2021BTF3-mediated).

## Structure
The BTF3 protein is encoded by a gene that undergoes alternative splicing to produce two isoforms: BTF3a and BTF3b. BTF3a contains an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a protein similar in size to the purified BTF3, while BTF3b encodes a shorter protein lacking the first 44 amino acids present in BTF3a (Kanno1992Genomic). The BTF3 protein includes a conserved NAC domain, which is crucial for its function and mediates dimerization (Jamil2015Exploring). The NAC domain forms a compact β-barrel structure with β-strands (Jamil2015Exploring).

BTF3a is a potential substrate for protein kinase CK2, containing phosphorylation consensus sites at Ser101 and Thr182, which are common post-translational modifications (Grein1999BTF3isapotentialnewsubstrateofproteinkinaseCK2). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Jamil2015Exploring). The BTF3 gene consists of seven exons, and the protein coding sequence is contained within a 6.8-kb segment, split into six exons (Kanno1992Genomic). The BTF3a isoform is transcriptionally active, while BTF3b is inactive but involved in translocation processes (Freire2005Translation).

## Function
BTF3, or Basal Transcription Factor 3, is a protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation in human cells. It is involved in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, facilitating the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex and the binding of RNA polymerase to DNA (Hu1994Yeast). BTF3 is active in both the cytosol and nucleus, where it interacts with RNA polymerase II to regulate gene expression (Jamil2015Exploring).

In addition to its role in transcription, BTF3 is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It has been linked to apoptosis in various cancer contexts, such as Burkitt lymphoma and K562 cells, where its expression levels can influence cell death pathways (Jamil2015Exploring). BTF3 also interacts with the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer cells, modulating transcriptional activity in response to estradiol and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Green2007Interaction). This interaction suggests that BTF3 may enhance ERα function, contributing to estrogen-mediated gene transcription (Green2007Interaction).

BTF3 is evolutionarily conserved and essential for early development, as evidenced by the embryonic lethality observed in mice with a disrupted BTF3 gene (Deng1995An). This highlights its critical role in development and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BTF3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), BTF3 is upregulated, correlating with lymph node metastasis and reduced patient survival. Knockdown of BTF3 in HSCC cells impairs proliferation and induces apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene and potential therapeutic target (Zhang2019Upregulation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), BTF3 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High BTF3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced TNM staging, and lymph node metastasis. Silencing BTF3 in CRC cells increases apoptosis and inhibits cell migration and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Liu2019Positive; Zhou2021BTF3-mediated).

BTF3 is also overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it acts as a transcriptional regulator of tumor-associated genes. Its isoform, BTF3a, is particularly elevated in PDAC tissues (Kusumawidjaja2007Basic).

In prostate cancer, BTF3 overexpression is linked to aggressive disease and poor clinical outcomes. It is associated with higher Gleason scores and advanced clinical stages, and it enhances DNA replication and repair processes, contributing to cancer cell growth (Hu2019BTF3; Zhang2021BTF3).

## Interactions
BTF3, a basic transcription factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in transcription and translation processes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, BTF3 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4E, a cap-binding protein, suggesting a role in the translation initiation complex eIF(iso)4F. This interaction is facilitated by a sequence in BTF3 that resembles a consensus motif found in many 4E-binding proteins, allowing BTF3 to compete with eIF(iso)4G for binding to eIF(iso)4E (Freire2005Translation).

In humans, BTF3 interacts with the NH2-terminal domain of the estrogen receptor α (ERα), specifically binding to the AF-1 region. This interaction is enhanced by estradiol and is crucial for modulating the transcriptional response of ERα, indicating that BTF3 may play a role in the mechanism by which the AF-1 function of ERα stimulates gene transcription (Green2007Interaction).

BTF3 also interacts with protein kinase CK2, particularly with its β subunit. BTF3a, one of its isoforms, is phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme, suggesting that BTF3a is a potential substrate for CK2. This interaction is important for substrate recognition and phosphorylation (Grein1999BTF3isapotentialnewsubstrateofproteinkinaseCK2).
