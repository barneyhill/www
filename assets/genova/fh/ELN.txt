# ELN

## Overview
The ELN gene encodes elastin, a key structural protein in the extracellular matrix that plays a critical role in providing elasticity and resilience to various tissues, including arteries, lungs, and skin. Elastin is categorized as a structural protein and is synthesized as a soluble precursor known as tropoelastin. This precursor undergoes complex processes such as alternative splicing, coacervation, and cross-linking to form mature elastic fibers, which are essential for the elastic properties of tissues that undergo repeated stretching and relaxation (Muiznieks2010Structural; Kozel2010Elastin). The unique composition and structure of elastin, characterized by alternating hydrophobic and cross-linking domains, allow it to function as an entropic spring, facilitating elastic recoil driven by entropy (Muiznieks2010Structural). Mutations in the ELN gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining tissue integrity and function (Micale2009Identification).

## Structure
The ELN gene encodes elastin, a protein crucial for tissue elasticity. Elastin is synthesized as a soluble precursor called tropoelastin, which undergoes alternative splicing to produce various isoforms (Kozel2010Elastin). The primary structure of elastin consists of alternating hydrophobic and cross-linking domains, with a high content of glycine, valine, proline, and alanine residues (Muiznieks2010Structural). These hydrophobic domains contribute to the protein's elastic properties and structural disorder (Muiznieks2010Structural).

The secondary structure of elastin includes β-turns and polyproline II helices, with a significant portion of the structure remaining disordered (Muiznieks2010Structural; Tamburro2003Dissection). The tertiary structure is characterized by a flexible, amorphous network, with elastin monomers described as asymmetric rods rather than globular proteins (Muiznieks2010Structural). Elastin lacks a defined quaternary structure, but its elasticity is facilitated by extensive cross-linking, primarily through lysine-derived cross-links such as desmosine and isodesmosine (Kozel2010Elastin).

The protein's structural flexibility and disorder are crucial for its function as an entropic spring, allowing elastic recoil driven by entropy (Muiznieks2010Structural).

## Function
The ELN gene encodes elastin, a crucial protein in the extracellular matrix that provides elasticity and resilience to tissues such as arteries, lungs, and skin. In healthy human cells, elastin is primarily involved in the formation of elastic fibers, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of tissues that undergo repeated stretching (Kozel2010Elastin). Elastin is synthesized as a monomer called tropoelastin, which undergoes a process of coacervation and cross-linking to form mature elastic fibers. These fibers allow tissues to stretch and recoil, a property vital for functions like maintaining blood pressure during heartbeats and facilitating passive expiration in the respiratory system (Kozel2010Elastin).

In the arterial walls, elastin is organized into polymers that form concentric rings of elastic lamellae, alternating with rings of smooth muscle to form lamellar units. This structure allows arteries to withstand the pressure of blood flow, contributing to their elasticity and resilience (Li1998Elastin). Elastin's role in arterial mechanics is crucial for reducing the workload on the heart and dampening pulsatile blood flow, thereby maintaining efficient cardiovascular function (Cocciolone2018Elastin). The protein's interaction with other extracellular matrix components, such as collagen and proteoglycans, further supports its function in maintaining arterial elasticity and preventing excessive deformation (Cocciolone2018Elastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELN gene, which encodes the elastin protein, are associated with several cardiovascular and connective tissue disorders. Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a prominent condition linked to ELN mutations. These mutations often result in haploinsufficiency, where the reduced expression of elastin leads to the narrowing of the aorta and other large arteries (Micale2009Identification; RodriguezRevenga2005Elastin). Specific mutations, such as splice-site mutations, can cause aberrant splicing and premature termination codons, further contributing to the disease (Urbán1999Supravalvular; Micale2009Identification).

In addition to SVAS, ELN mutations are implicated in pulmonary artery stenosis and congenital heart disease (CHD). A novel heterozygous mutation in exon 27 of the ELN gene has been associated with these conditions, affecting elastin protein processing and leading to reduced functional components (Hou2021Identification). 

ELN mutations can also lead to autosomal dominant cutis laxa (ADCL), characterized by loose, sagging skin due to elastin insufficiency (Zhang2023Novel). The variability in clinical presentation among individuals with ELN mutations underscores the importance of genetic screening for accurate diagnosis and management of these conditions (Micale2009Identification).

## Interactions
Elastin (ELN) is a crucial component of elastic fibers, interacting with various proteins to ensure proper fiber assembly and function. Tropoelastin, the soluble precursor of elastin, undergoes self-assembly and cross-linking, facilitated by lysyl oxidase (LOX) and its family members, including LOXL1-4, which catalyze the oxidative deamination of lysine residues to form unique crosslinks like desmosine and isodesmosine (Shin2019Recent; Schmelzer2021Elastic). Fibulin-4 and fibulin-5 are essential for aligning tropoelastin molecules and facilitating their interaction with LOX, with fibulin-4 being crucial for LOX activation and fibulin-5 acting as an adaptor to enhance tropoelastin binding to fibrillin-1 (Schmelzer2021Elastic; Zhang2022Elastic).

Tropoelastin also interacts with fibrillin-1, which serves as a scaffold for elastic fiber assembly. This interaction is mediated by specific binding sites on fibrillin-1, and a novel transglutaminase cross-link has been identified between tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, stabilizing the tropoelastin on microfibrils (Rock2004Molecular). Microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) binds to both tropoelastin and fibrillin-1, contributing to the organization and integrity of elastic fibers (Rock2004Molecular; Jensen2001Protein). These interactions are vital for the structural integrity and function of elastic fibers, influencing tissue elasticity and resilience.
