# ZNF705A

## Overview
ZNF705A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 705A, a member of the KRAB-associated zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are essential for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Although ZNF705A lacks the KRAB domain typically associated with transcriptional repression, it retains functional zinc finger motifs, suggesting it may still play a role in gene expression regulation (Nowick2010Rapid). The gene is part of a cluster of recently duplicated KRAB-ZNF genes, indicating its potential involvement in primate-specific evolutionary functions (Nowick2010Rapid). ZNF705A has been implicated in various diseases, including dilated cardiomyopathy and gastric cancer, where its expression levels are altered, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment (Charles2021Integrated; Li2022A).

## Structure
ZNF705A is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are small protein motifs that stabilize their structure through zinc ion coordination. These domains typically facilitate DNA binding. The ZNF705A gene is part of the KRAB-ZNF subfamily, which generally includes a KRAB motif and a spacer region linked to Kruppel-type ZNF arrays. However, some duplicated KZNF genes, including ZNF705A, have lost the KRAB-encoding exons but retain the ZNF motifs, suggesting they may still encode functional proteins (Nowick2010Rapid).

The ZNF705A gene is part of a clade with other ZNF705 genes, indicating it shares structural similarities with them, although specific details about its molecular structure are not explicitly provided (Nowick2010Rapid). The gene is known to produce alternative spliced isoforms, which may exclude KRAB or ZNF domains, affecting their function as transcriptional repressors (Nowick2010Rapid). The presence of these isoforms suggests a potential for diverse functional roles, although specific structural details such as secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ZNF705A is a member of the KRAB-associated zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) gene family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression. These proteins typically contain a KRAB domain that recruits TRIM28, a scaffold protein that facilitates the assembly of repressive histone-modifying complexes, leading to heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing (Yang2017The). The zinc finger motifs in ZNF705A are crucial for DNA binding, allowing the protein to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing gene expression (Huntley2006A).

ZNF705A is part of a cluster of KRAB-ZNF genes that have undergone recent duplication events, suggesting a role in the evolution of primate-specific functions (Nowick2010Rapid). These duplications often result in new paralogs with similar exon structures to the parental genes, which may retain functional ZNF motifs even if they lose KRAB-encoding exons (Nowick2010Rapid). The gene is distributed across multiple chromosomes, indicating recent duplication events that are possibly human-specific (Huntley2006A). The specific regulatory functions of ZNF705A in healthy human cells remain largely unknown, but its involvement in transcriptional repression suggests a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF705A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), ZNF705A is significantly downregulated, with a p-value of 6.33E-17 and a log2 fold change of -11.6723, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Charles2021Integrated). In gastric cancer (GC), ZNF705A is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, indicating it could serve as a potential biomarker for GC prognosis and treatment (Li2022A). The gene is part of a ceRNA regulatory network and is correlated with overall survival in GC patients, with lower expression levels linked to better prognosis (Li2022A).

ZNF705A is also involved in chromosomal rearrangements, as indicated by its presence at a breakpoint on chromosome 12, with a likelihood of gene disruption ranging from 25-75% (Baptista2008Breakpoint). Additionally, prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with decreased DNA methylation near the ZNF705A gene, although the clinical significance of this finding is not fully understood (Gruzieva2019Prenatal). These findings suggest that ZNF705A may play a role in various pathological conditions, warranting further investigation.
