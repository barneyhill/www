# GTF2IRD2

## Overview
GTF2IRD2 is a gene that encodes the protein GTF2I repeat domain containing 2, which is a member of the TFII-I family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its involvement in transcription regulation, featuring structural motifs such as TFII-I-like helix-loop-helix repeats, leucine zippers, and a BED zinc-finger DNA binding motif, which facilitate DNA and protein interactions (Tipney2004Isolation; Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). GTF2IRD2 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the brain, suggesting its role in craniofacial and neurological development (Tipney2004Isolation; Porter2012A). Clinically, the gene is implicated in Williams-Beuren Syndrome, where its deletion is associated with cognitive impairments and behavioral issues (Porter2012A; CodinaSola2019Genetic). Understanding the function and interactions of GTF2IRD2 is crucial for elucidating its role in development and disease.

## Structure
The GTF2IRD2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several domains and motifs indicative of its role in transcription regulation. It is a slightly acidic protein with a molecular weight of approximately 107 kDa and consists of 949 amino acids in humans (Tipney2004Isolation; Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). The protein contains two TFII-I-like helix-loop-helix (HLH) repeats, which are involved in DNA binding and protein interactions (Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). 

GTF2IRD2 also features a BED zinc-finger DNA binding motif, which interacts with DNA grooves, and a leucine zipper motif that aids in dimer formation (Tipney2004Isolation). The C-terminal region includes a CHARLIE8 transposon-like element, unique among TFII-I family members, suggesting a potential role in transposase activity (Tipney2004Isolation; Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). 

The protein is predicted to have a predominantly helical secondary structure and is soluble, with a high probability of being located in the cytoplasm (Tipney2004Isolation). Post-translational modifications include multiple phosphorylation sites, which may influence its function (Tipney2004Isolation). The presence of splice variants may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Tipney2004Isolation).

## Function
GTF2IRD2 is a member of the TFII-I family of transcription factors, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein encoded by GTF2IRD2 contains two TFII-I-like helix-loop-helix (HLH) repeats, two leucine zippers, and a Cys-2/His-2 zinc finger, which are characteristic features of regulatory factors that facilitate DNA and protein interactions (Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). These structural motifs suggest that GTF2IRD2 plays a role in modulating gene expression by interacting with tissue-specific transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling complexes (Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2).

The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, placenta, and lung, with higher expression levels in fetal tissues compared to adult tissues (Tipney2004Isolation). This widespread expression pattern indicates its involvement in various cellular processes, particularly in craniofacial and neurological development (Porter2012A). GTF2IRD2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional machinery, potentially impacting cellular processes such as development and differentiation (Tipney2004Isolation). The gene's expression in the prefrontal cortex suggests a role in cognitive functions, particularly executive functions (Porter2012A).

## Clinical Significance
The GTF2IRD2 gene is implicated in Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by deletions on chromosome 7q11.23. This gene is part of the GTF2I family, which is crucial for craniofacial and neurological development. In WBS, a larger 1.8 Mb deletion that includes GTF2IRD2 is associated with more severe cognitive impairments, particularly affecting spatial functioning, social reasoning, and cognitive flexibility, which are components of executive functioning (Porter2012A). Patients with this deletion also exhibit increased obsessions and externalizing behaviors, likely due to poor cognitive flexibility and executive dysfunction (Porter2012A).

The gene's expression in the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, suggests its role in higher-level executive functions. Loss of GTF2IRD2 may lead to additional cognitive impairments and maladaptive behaviors in WBS patients, linked to neuropathology in brain regions like the parietal and frontal lobes (Porter2012A). The number of functional copies of GTF2IRD2 may influence the cognitive and behavioral phenotype in WBS, potentially contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in these individuals (CodinaSola2019Genetic). Understanding the role of GTF2IRD2 in WBS has implications for treatment and understanding the mechanisms of action in related conditions.

## Interactions
The GTF2IRD2 protein is characterized by several domains that suggest its potential for interactions with DNA and other proteins. It contains an N-terminal leucine zipper motif, which is thought to facilitate dimer formation, and a BED zinc-finger DNA binding motif, which is involved in DNA binding. The BED motif includes conserved cysteines and histidines, and a region of basic residues (KRK) near the BED motif is believed to interact with the minor groove of DNA, while the rest of the BED structure associates with the major groove (Tipney2004Isolation). 

GTF2IRD2 also features two TFII-I-like helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains, two leucine zippers, and a single Cys-2/His-2 zinc finger, which are indicative of complex protein-binding properties. The HLH domains are typically associated with DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, while leucine zippers are known to facilitate dimerization and protein-protein interactions (Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2). 

Despite these structural features, specific physical interactions of GTF2IRD2 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature. The protein's structural similarity to other GTF2I family members suggests potential roles in transcriptional regulation, possibly through interactions with tissue-specific transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling complexes (Makeyev2004GTF2IRD2).
