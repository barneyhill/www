# FXN

## Overview
The FXN gene encodes the mitochondrial protein frataxin, which is integral to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, essential cofactors for various enzymatic processes within the cell. Frataxin is characterized by its α-β sandwich motif and functions primarily as a kinetic activator in the Fe-S cluster assembly pathway, enhancing the efficiency of cluster production without altering their type or yield (Chiabrando2020Hereditary; Monfort2022Recent). The protein is synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, where it undergoes maturation to perform its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Monfort2022Recent). Mutations in the FXN gene are predominantly associated with Friedreich's ataxia, a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and other systemic manifestations (Delatycki2019Friedreich). The most common genetic defect is a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, leading to reduced frataxin expression and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction (Greene2007Repeatinduced).

## Structure
The human frataxin (FXN) protein is composed of 210 amino acids and is primarily located in the mitochondria. Its primary structure includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N-terminus, which is cleaved during maturation to produce the mature form, mFXN, spanning residues 81-210 (Da2024An; Doni2020Effects). The secondary structure of FXN consists of a mixed alpha-beta fold, with two helices packing against a contiguous anti-parallel beta sheet, arranged in an alpha-(beta)-alpha sequence (Doni2020Effects). 

The tertiary structure of FXN is highly stable and rigid, as determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR, and includes a conserved frataxin-like domain (FLD) spanning residues 90 to 198, which is crucial for its function in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis and iron metabolism (Da2024An; Doni2020Effects). 

In terms of quaternary structure, FXN forms part of a pentameric protein complex in the mitochondria, interacting with proteins such as NFS1, ISD11, ACP, and ISCU, which are involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly (Doni2020Effects). 

Post-translational modifications of FXN include phosphorylation at several sites, such as Y118, which leads to ubiquitination and degradation, and acetylation at K171 (Da2024An). These modifications play roles in regulating FXN's stability and function.

## Function
Frataxin (FXN) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are essential for various cellular processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and enzyme function (Chiabrando2020Hereditary). In healthy human cells, frataxin acts as a kinetic activator, accelerating the transfer of persulfide from NFS1 to ISCU, a critical step in Fe-S cluster assembly. This acceleration enhances the efficiency of Fe-S cluster production without altering the type or yield of clusters formed (Monfort2022Recent).

Frataxin is involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production by supporting the activity of Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes, which are vital for cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Chiabrando2020Hereditary). It also plays a role in regulating iron homeostasis within mitochondria, preventing excessive iron accumulation that can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage (Chiabrando2020Hereditary).

The protein is synthesized as a precursor in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, where it undergoes maturation. Although initially thought to function as an iron storage protein, recent studies suggest its primary role is in maintaining iron bioavailability for essential cellular processes (Monfort2022Recent). Frataxin's structure, featuring an α-β sandwich motif, facilitates its interactions with iron, although its role in iron storage is not significant under physiological conditions (Monfort2022Recent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FXN gene, which encodes the frataxin protein, are primarily associated with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common hereditary ataxia. FRDA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, most commonly a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene. This expansion leads to reduced frataxin expression, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and oxidative stress (Delatycki2019Friedreich; Al-Mahdawi2007The; Greene2007Repeatinduced).

Clinically, FRDA is characterized by progressive ataxia, dysarthria, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy, with symptoms typically appearing around puberty. The disease often leads to significant disability, with many patients becoming wheelchair-bound within 10-15 years of onset (Castaldo2008DNA; Evans‐Galea2012FXN). The GAA repeat expansion is also associated with epigenetic changes, such as increased DNA methylation, which further reduce FXN transcription (Al-Mahdawi2007The; Greene2007Repeatinduced).

Rarely, FRDA can result from compound heterozygosity involving a GAA expansion and a point mutation or deletion in the FXN gene, leading to atypical phenotypes (Ygland2014Atypical; HoffmanZacharska2016Friedreich). Missense mutations in FXN, such as p.Arg165Cys, have been associated with a Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like phenotype, indicating a spectrum of clinical manifestations linked to FXN mutations (Candayan2019The).

## Interactions
Frataxin (FXN) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis by interacting with several key proteins. FXN forms a stable quaternary complex with ISCU, NFS1, and ISD11, which is essential for cellular viability and the early steps of Fe-S cluster assembly (Schmucker2011Mammalian). This interaction is not dependent on iron concentrations, indicating that FXN's role in the complex is structural rather than regulatory in terms of iron availability (Schmucker2011Mammalian).

Mutations in FXN can significantly affect its interaction with the ISCU/NFS1/ISD11 complex. For instance, the D124K mutation decreases FXN's interaction with ISCU and NFS1, while the N146A mutation can restore this interaction, highlighting the importance of specific residues in FXN for binding (Schmucker2011Mammalian). FXN also interacts with the NFS1 protein through salt-bridges and van der Waals contacts, and it binds to specific regions on ISCU, such as the Ala-loop and the L131PPVKLHCSM140 motif, which are crucial for the function of the Fe-S cluster assembly complex (Fox2019Structure).

FXN's interaction with the ISCU/NFS1/ISD11 complex is proposed to stabilize the complex, facilitating efficient Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (Schmucker2011Mammalian). The presence of FXN alters the local environment of a zinc ion within the complex, which would otherwise inhibit NFS1 activity, thus acting as an allosteric regulator (Fox2019Structure).
