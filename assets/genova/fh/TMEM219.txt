# TMEM219

## Overview
TMEM219 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 219, a single-span membrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and immune response modulation. As a receptor, transmembrane protein 219 interacts with Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP3), playing a pivotal role in mediating cell death and regulating glucose metabolism, particularly in pancreatic beta cells (Joyce2019Blocking; D’Addio2022The). Additionally, it is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and tissue remodeling, notably through its interaction with IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Ra2), which influences immune signaling pathways (Lee2016IL13Rα2). The gene's involvement in these critical cellular functions underscores its potential impact on health and disease, including diabetes and cancer, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3; D’Addio2022The).

## Function
TMEM219, also known as transmembrane protein 219, is a single-span membrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and autophagy. In healthy human cells, TMEM219 functions as a receptor for Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP3), playing a crucial role in mediating cell death and regulating glucose metabolism (Joyce2019Blocking; D’Addio2022The). The interaction between TMEM219 and IGFBP3 induces caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, which is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating beta-cell function in the pancreas (D’Addio2022The).

TMEM219 is also implicated in autophagy, a cellular degradation process essential for cell survival and homeostasis. It interacts with calmodulin in the presence of IGFBP3 and calcium, suggesting a role in autophagy regulation through these interactions (Joyce2019Blocking). Additionally, TMEM219 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and tissue remodeling, particularly in the context of IL-13-induced signaling, where it enhances the binding of IL-13 to IL-13Ra2, modulating immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Lee2016IL13Rα2). These functions highlight TMEM219's role in critical cellular processes and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM219, a transmembrane protein, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in cellular processes. Alterations in TMEM219 expression or function are notably linked to diabetes. The IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway is crucial in regulating beta-cell homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with increased beta-cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion, contributing to both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (D’Addio2022The). Elevated levels of IGFBP3, which interacts with TMEM219, are observed in diabetic patients and are linked to a pro-inflammatory environment that exacerbates beta-cell loss (D’Addio2022The). Pharmacological blockade of this pathway has shown potential in preserving beta-cell function and delaying diabetes onset in preclinical models (D’Addio2022The).

In cancer, TMEM219 expression varies across different types, influencing patient survival outcomes. Lower TMEM219 expression is associated with poorer survival in certain cancers, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and glioma, while higher expression correlates with better survival in others, like mesothelioma and prostate adenocarcinoma (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3). These findings suggest that TMEM219 could serve as a therapeutic target in specific cancer types (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3).

## Interactions
TMEM219, also known as transmembrane protein 219, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of beta cell homeostasis and apoptosis, particularly in the context of diabetes. IGFBP3 binds to TMEM219, leading to beta cell loss and dysfunction, which is significant in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (D’Addio2022The). The binding affinity between IGFBP3 and TMEM219 has been validated, with studies showing that inhibiting this pathway can preserve beta cell mass and delay diabetes onset (D’Addio2022The).

TMEM219 also interacts with IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Ra2) in the presence of chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1). This interaction is essential for Chi3l1-induced signaling, which involves the activation of MAPK and Akt pathways, inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of melanoma metastasis (Lee2016IL13Rα2). The interaction between TMEM219 and IL-13Ra2 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies, indicating a direct physical interaction (Lee2016IL13Rα2). These interactions highlight TMEM219's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
