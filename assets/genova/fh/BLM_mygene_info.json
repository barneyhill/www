disorder characterized by growth deficiency, microcephaly and immunodeficiency among others. It is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding DNA helicase RecQ protein on chromosome 15q26. This Bloom-associated helicase unwinds a variety of DNA substrates including Holliday junction, and is involved in several pathways contributing to the maintenance of genome stability. Identification of pathogenic Bloom variants is required for heterozygote testing in at-risk families.
