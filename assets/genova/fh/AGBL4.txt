# AGBL4

## Overview
AGBL4 is a gene that encodes the protein AGBL carboxypeptidase 4, which is a member of the carboxypeptidase family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a structural protein critical for the formation and function of microtubules within the cytoskeleton. AGBL carboxypeptidase 4 specifically catalyzes the deglutamylation of tubulin, a process that is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal function. The gene is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the frontal cortex, and its activity is crucial for neuronal survival and cognitive health. Dysregulation of AGBL4 has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and other health conditions, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhang2024AGBL4; Starnawska2017EpigenomeWide).

## Function
AGBL4 (AGBL carboxypeptidase 4) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of tubulin, a key component of the cytoskeleton. The protein functions as a carboxypeptidase, specifically catalyzing the deglutamylation of tubulin. This process involves the removal of glutamate residues from polyglutamylated tubulin, which is essential for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics. These activities are vital for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and neuronal function (Starnawska2017EpigenomeWide).

AGBL4 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with the highest levels found in the frontal cortex. Its activity is particularly associated with microtubules in the cytoplasm, where it influences neuronal survival by regulating tubulin deglutamylation. This regulation is directly linked to neurodegeneration, as the accumulation of glutamate side chains on microtubules can lead to neuronal damage (Starnawska2017EpigenomeWide).

The gene's function in healthy human cells is critical for maintaining proper neuronal function and cognitive health. Dysregulation of AGBL4 expression or activity may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in brain health and function (Starnawska2017EpigenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
The AGBL4 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer, AGBL4 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Studies have shown that AGBL4 promotes GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through the modulation of MMP-1 and inflammatory pathways, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024AGBL4).

AGBL4 has also been studied in the context of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH). While a genome-wide association study in Ethiopian patients suggested a potential link, a validation study in a Chinese Han population did not find significant associations between AGBL4 polymorphisms and ATDH, indicating the need for further research in diverse populations (Pan2019Association).

In terms of cardiometabolic risk, mutations in AGBL4 have been associated with variations in lipid metabolism, including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, particularly in the Jing and Han populations. These genetic variations may contribute to differences in cardiometabolic risk factors, highlighting the gene's role in lipid metabolism and potential implications for cardiovascular health (Guo2016Integrative).
