# CEMP1

## Overview
CEMP1, or cementum protein 1, is a gene that encodes an intrinsically disordered protein involved in the mineralization and regeneration of dental tissues. The protein, also referred to as CEMP1, is primarily expressed in cementoblasts and certain periodontal ligament cells, where it plays a pivotal role in cementogenesis, the process of forming cementum, a mineralized tissue covering the roots of teeth (Maldonado2013Cementum; Choi2014Hypoxia). CEMP1 is characterized by its ability to activate intracellular signaling pathways, such as the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways, which are crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation (Maldonado2013Cementum). Additionally, CEMP1 influences the expression of key proteins involved in bone and tooth formation, including bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase (Maldonado2013Cementum). The protein's expression is modulated by hypoxic conditions, enhancing its role in cementoblastic differentiation (Choi2014Hypoxia). Beyond its physiological roles, CEMP1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression may contribute to oncogenic processes (Bermúdez2015CEMP1).

## Structure


## Function
Cementum protein 1 (CEMP1) is a protein primarily expressed in cementoblasts and certain periodontal ligament cell populations, playing a crucial role in the mineralization and regeneration of mineralized tissues. CEMP1 is involved in the differentiation of cementoblasts and osteoblasts, promoting the formation of cementum, a mineralized tissue covering the roots of teeth (Maldonado2013Cementum; Choi2014Hypoxia). It activates intracellular signaling pathways, specifically the p38 and JNK MAPK pathways, which are essential for cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Maldonado2013Cementum). CEMP1 also enhances the expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are important for cementogenesis (Maldonado2013Cementum).

CEMP1 is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein with a random-coiled secondary structure, facilitating its role in biomineralization by promoting hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation and organization (Arroyo2020CarboxyTerminal; Correa2018Synthetic). It is active in the extracellular matrix, influencing cell adhesion and signaling pathways essential for dental tissue development and maintenance (Bermúdez2015CEMP1). CEMP1's expression is regulated by hypoxic conditions, which enhance its role in cementoblastic differentiation through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (Choi2014Hypoxia).

## Clinical Significance
CEMP1 (cementum protein 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. Originally identified as a cementum-specific protein, CEMP1 is expressed in cementoblasts and some periodontal ligament cells. However, studies have found its expression in several cancer cell lines, including breast, prostate, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with the highest expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. CEMP1 expression has also been detected in oral, breast, cervical, prostate, and lung cancer samples, as well as leukemia samples (Bermúdez2015CEMP1).

The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) reported mutations in CEMP1 in 21 samples, with missense substitutions being the most common. Copy number variations (CNV) gain in the 16p13.3 region, where CEMP1 is located, was reported in 44 samples, with overexpression in 203 samples, particularly in breast, kidney, large intestine, ovary, endometrium, lung, hematopoietic and lymphoid, and central nervous system tissues (Bermúdez2015CEMP1). CEMP1 may function similarly to growth factors with oncogenic potential, as its expression in fibroblasts altered cellular functions associated with cancer development. Key molecules related to oncogenesis, such as HOXA5, CDH1, and HBEGF, were overexpressed due to CEMP1 expression, indicating a possible role in the metastatic process (Bermúdez2015CEMP1).

## Interactions
Cementum protein 1 (CEMP1) is involved in various interactions that play a crucial role in the mineralization process and tissue regeneration. CEMP1 activates the p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathways, which are essential for cementoblastic differentiation and matrix mineralization. This activation involves the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK kinases, leading to the translocation of p38 to the nucleus and the phosphorylation of the protein C-JUN (Maldonado2013Cementum). 

CEMP1 also regulates the expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteocalcin (OCN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, which are associated with mineralized tissue formation (Maldonado2013Cementum). The protein promotes hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation and organization, facilitating crystal formation and orientation, which is crucial for bone and tooth formation (Villegas‐Mercado2018Cementum; Serrano2013Bone).

The synthetic peptide CEMP1-p4, derived from CEMP1, interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, enhancing the expression of β-catenin and inactivating GSK-3β. This interaction promotes the proliferation and differentiation of human oral mucosa stem cells into an osteoprogenitor phenotype, highlighting its role in mineralization and osteogenesis (Arroyo2020CarboxyTerminal).
