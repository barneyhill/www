# GFRA4

## Overview
The GFRA4 gene encodes the GDNF family receptor alpha 4 (GFRα4), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor protein that plays a pivotal role in neurotrophic signaling. As a member of the GDNF receptor family, GFRα4 primarily functions as a co-receptor for the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, facilitating its activation by binding to persephin, a ligand of the GDNF family. This interaction is essential for the development and function of neural crest-derived lineages and the kidney (Vanhorne2004A; Wang2021MiR1955p). GFRα4 is predominantly expressed in thyroid C-cells and medullary thyroid carcinoma, indicating its involvement in endocrine system pathologies (Vanhorne2004A). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may influence its localization and function, thereby affecting RET signaling pathways (Masure2000Mammalian). The clinical significance of GFRA4 is underscored by its role in various diseases, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, medullary thyroid carcinoma, glioma, and Hirschsprung disease, where alterations in its expression or function can contribute to disease pathogenesis (Lee2013Proteomewide; Vanhorne2004A; Wang2017Downregulation).

## Structure
The GFRA4 gene encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that serves as a receptor for persephin, a member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. The protein is predicted to be 260 amino acids long, featuring a hydrophobic endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence and a C-terminal GPI-anchor sequence, which facilitates its attachment to the cell membrane (Yang2004PSPNGFRα4). The molecular weight of the mature, glycosylated form of GFRα4 is approximately 31 to 33 kDa, as determined by Western blot analysis (Yang2004PSPNGFRα4).

GFRα4 lacks the first cysteine-rich domain found in other GFRα family members, which may influence its structural and functional properties (Yang2004PSPNGFRα4). The protein includes a glycosylation site, which is a common post-translational modification that can affect protein folding and stability (Yang2004PSPNGFRα4). Splice variant isoforms of GFRα4 exist, with differences in the C-terminal region, potentially affecting the protein's localization and function. Variant A is likely membrane-bound via a GPI anchor, while variant B may represent a soluble form due to its hydrophilic C-terminal region (Masure2000Mammalian).

## Function
The GFRA4 gene encodes the GFRα4 protein, a co-receptor that plays a significant role in the signaling pathways involving the RET proto-oncogene and its ligand persephin. This interaction is crucial for the development of neural crest-derived lineages and the kidney. GFRα4 is primarily expressed on the cell surface, where it facilitates the formation of signaling complexes essential for neurodevelopment and function (Vanhorne2004A). 

In healthy human cells, GFRα4 is involved in modifying the phenotype of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), particularly in cases where RET mutations are absent or in modifying the effects of existing RET mutations. The protein is highly expressed in thyroid C-cells and medullary thyroid carcinoma, suggesting its involvement in the development of these tumors (Vanhorne2004A). 

The GFRA4 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different protein isoforms that may alter gene expression or the balance between membrane-bound and soluble forms of GFRα4, potentially affecting RET signaling (Vanhorne2004A). These molecular processes underscore the importance of GFRα4 in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, particularly in the nervous and endocrine systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GFRA4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), GFRA4 variants may contribute to the disease in the absence of RET mutations or modify the phenotype in patients with RET mutations. Some GFRA4 variants are overrepresented in patient populations, suggesting a potential role in disease expression and severity (Vanhorne2004A).

In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), GFRA4 is highly expressed and may act as a tumor suppressor. Variants in GFRA4 could modify the effects of RET mutations, influencing the aggressiveness of the disease (Vanhorne2004A; Bhoj2021Adoptive).

In glioma, a type of brain cancer, GFRA4 is mislocated from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum due to a point mutation. This mislocation disrupts its interaction with RET, contributing to tumor growth and progression (Lee2013Proteomewide).

In Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), GFRA4 expression is downregulated, and its interaction with miR-195-5p and miR-483-5p affects cell proliferation and invasion. These interactions suggest a role for GFRA4 in the pathogenesis of HSCR (Wang2017Downregulation; Wang2021MiR1955p).

## Interactions
GFRA4 (GDNF family receptor alpha 4) is known to interact with the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase. This interaction is crucial for mediating signaling pathways that influence cell survival, proliferation, and migration. GFRA4 acts as a co-receptor for RET, facilitating its activation by binding to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (Wang2021MiR1955p). In glioma, GFRA4 is mislocated from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, which disrupts its interaction with RET, although RET remains at the plasma membrane. This mislocation is associated with a point mutation in GFRA4, affecting its normal function and contributing to tumor progression (Lee2013Proteomewide).

In the context of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), GFRA4 is highly expressed and plays a role in RET-driven signaling, which is essential for tumor growth. However, GFRA4 knockdown does not significantly affect cell proliferation, suggesting that while it interacts with RET, it may not be essential for maintaining RET expression and signaling in MTC (Bhoj2021Adoptive). GFRA4's interaction with RET is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease, where its expression is downregulated, affecting nerve cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2021MiR1955p).
