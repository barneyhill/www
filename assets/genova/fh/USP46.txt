# USP46

## Overview
USP46 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 46, a deubiquitinating enzyme belonging to the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein degradation and recycling by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific substrates, thereby influencing their stability and function. USP46 is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it modulates synaptic function by deubiquitinating AMPA-type glutamate receptors, crucial for synaptic plasticity and transmission (Huo2015The; Hodul2017Function). The enzyme's activity is enhanced through interactions with WD40-repeat proteins, forming complexes that increase its deubiquitination efficiency (Zhu2019Structural). Beyond its neurological roles, USP46 is implicated in various cellular pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and cancer-related processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as major depressive disorder and certain cancers (Kiran2018The; Ng2023The).

## Structure
USP46 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a conserved USP domain, which includes three subdomains: fingers, palm, and thumb. The catalytic center of USP46 is located at the interface of the palm and thumb subdomains, while the fingers subdomain is involved in ubiquitin binding (Zhu2019Structural). The enzyme contains a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid, which is typical of the USP family (Hodul2017Function).

The tertiary structure of USP46 is stabilized by interactions with WD40-repeat proteins such as WDR48 and WDR20. WDR48 binds to the fingers subdomain, enhancing substrate binding, while WDR20 interacts with the base of the palm subdomain through hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, increasing the enzyme's deubiquitination activity (Zhu2019Structural). The quaternary structure of USP46 involves forming a ternary complex with WDR48 and WDR20, which shows higher activity than binary complexes (Zhu2019Structural).

USP46 shares high sequence similarity with USP12, and both can form complexes with UAF1, a WD40-repeat protein, which further modulates their activity (Dharadhar2016A). The structural stability of USP46 is maintained even when bound to UAF1, indicating a conserved structural framework (Dharadhar2016A).

## Function
USP46 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 46) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in the regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in healthy human cells. It specifically deubiquitinates the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPARs, which protects these receptors from degradation and promotes their recycling to the cell surface. This process is vital for maintaining synaptic function and plasticity, as AMPARs are essential for fast excitatory transmission in the brain (Huo2015The; Hodul2017Function).

USP46 is highly enriched in synaptic compartments, where it co-localizes with synaptic proteins such as GluA1 and PSD-95. Its activity results in alterations in AMPAR accumulation and surface expression at synapses, impacting synaptic strength and transmission (Huo2015The). The enzyme is expressed throughout the brain, including regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and is involved in maintaining AMPAR stability and recycling, which is crucial for proper synaptic function (Hodul2017Function).

USP46's specificity for deubiquitinating AMPARs with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains suggests that its activity is regulated by other factors in vivo, contributing to its role in synaptic efficacy and proteostasis (Hodul2017Function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USP46 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In major depressive disorders (MDD), specific haplotypes of the USP46 gene have shown significant associations with the disorder in a Japanese population. The A-A-C haplotype was less prevalent in controls than in MDD patients, suggesting a potential genetic link to the disorder (Fukuo2011Possible).

In cancer, USP46 acts as a tumor suppressor in various types. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lower expression of USP46 is associated with poorer overall survival, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis (Gui2019Ubiquitinspecific). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), USP46 suppresses tumor progression by stabilizing MST1, which in turn inhibits YAP1, a key factor in the Hippo signaling pathway. Low USP46 expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis (Qiu2021Deubiquitinating).

In HPV-transformed cancers, USP46 is essential for the proliferation and growth of these cancers by stabilizing the Cdt2 protein, which is crucial for cell cycle progression. This makes USP46 a potential therapeutic target for HPV-related cancers (Kiran2018The).

## Interactions
USP46 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that regulate its deubiquitinating activity. It binds with WD40-repeat proteins such as WDR48 and WDR20, which enhance its enzymatic function. WDR48 binds to the fingers subdomain of USP46, stabilizing substrate binding, while WDR20 interacts with the palm subdomain through crucial hydrophobic interactions (Zhu2019Structural). The USP46-WDR48-WDR20 complex exhibits higher deubiquitination activity compared to binary complexes, indicating a synergistic effect in activating USP46 (Zhu2019Structural).

USP46 also plays a role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by deubiquitylating LRP6, a co-receptor, thereby stabilizing it. This interaction is enhanced by Wnt stimulation, which facilitates the recruitment of the USP46 complex to LRP6 at the cell surface (Ng2023The).

In the context of HPV-transformed cancers, USP46 interacts with the E6 oncoprotein, which recruits USP46 to stabilize the protein Cdt2. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell cycle progression and tumor growth in HPV-infected cells (Kiran2018The). The E6 protein facilitates the interaction between USP46 and Cdt2, promoting the stabilization of Cdt2, which is important for cancer cell proliferation (Kiran2018The).
