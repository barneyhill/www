# VN1R1

## Overview
The VN1R1 gene encodes the vomeronasal 1 receptor 1, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in pheromone detection. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, lung, and kidney. The protein encoded by VN1R1 plays a role in sociosexual behaviors by binding specific ligands such as hedione and myrtenal, which activate neural pathways in the limbic system, particularly affecting areas like the amygdala and hippocampus. Although the human vomeronasal organ is often considered vestigial, VN1R1 may have non-olfactory roles, potentially influencing sociosexual behavior and hormonal regulation, especially in women (Corin2011Structure; precone2020pheromone). The gene's expression in certain cancers also suggests its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target, though its broader implications in human health and disease remain to be fully elucidated (Chen2019Utility; Shirokova2007The).

## Structure
The human vomeronasal type 1 receptor 1 (hVN1R1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain structure, typical of the GPCR family. The protein exhibits a predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure, consistent with its classification as a GPCR, which generally features seven transmembrane helices (Corin2011Structure). Circular dichroism analysis of the purified hVN1R1 confirmed this alpha-helical conformation, indicating proper folding when expressed in HEK293 cells (Corin2011Structure).

The tertiary structure of hVN1R1 is well-defined, as evidenced by the near UV spectrum analysis, which suggests a stable and correctly folded protein (Corin2011Structure). The receptor's ability to bind its ligand, myrtenal, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of approximately 1 mM, further supports the functional integrity of its tertiary structure (Corin2011Structure).

While the quaternary structure of hVN1R1 is not explicitly detailed, the study notes the presence of monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptor, with the monomeric form being predominant in the purified samples (Corin2011Structure). The research highlights the potential for further investigation into the effects of dimerization on the receptor's function (Corin2011Structure).

## Function
The VN1R1 gene encodes a vomeronasal receptor involved in pheromone detection, classified as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In humans, VN1R1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, kidney, and plasma, suggesting potential roles beyond olfactory signaling (Corin2011Structure; precone2020pheromone). The receptor is part of a signaling cascade that involves the synthesis of diacylglycerol, leading to the opening of transient receptor potential calcium channels, which are implicated in cellular signaling processes related to sociosexual behaviors (precone2020pheromone).

VN1R1 is known to bind specific ligands, such as hedione and myrtenal, which activate the receptor and elicit responses in the brain's limbic areas, including the amygdala and hippocampus. This activation is associated with sociosexual behavior and hormonal regulation, particularly in women (Corin2011Structure; precone2020pheromone). Despite its potential roles, the exact function of VN1R1 in healthy human cells remains somewhat controversial, as the human vomeronasal organ is often considered vestigial, and VN1R1 may have non-olfactory roles in other tissues (Corin2011Structure; Shirokova2007The).

## Clinical Significance
The VN1R1 gene, encoding a putative pheromone receptor, has been studied for its potential role in sociosexual behavior, particularly in women. Research indicates that a missense polymorphism in VN1R1, specifically the D-allele of the rs28649880 A229D polymorphism, is associated with higher sociosexual behavior scores in women. This association is more pronounced in women with relationships lasting less than four years, suggesting a potential influence on partner preference and sociosexual behavior (Henningsson2017A). 

VN1R1 expression has also been linked to certain cancers. It is up-regulated in multiple myeloma patients, as well as in prostate adenocarcinomas and glioblastoma cancer cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker for these conditions (Chen2019Utility). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of VN1R1 in terms of disease remains largely unexplored, and its role in human health and disease requires further investigation (Shirokova2007The). The gene's involvement in pheromone detection and sociosexual behavior suggests it may have broader implications for understanding human sensory and neurological functions.
