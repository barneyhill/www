# CYTH1

## Overview
CYTH1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytohesin 1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Cytohesin 1 is characterized by its structural domains, including a Sec7 domain essential for its GEF activity, a coiled-coil domain for homodimerization, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that mediates membrane association. The protein plays a pivotal role in activating the small GTPase Arf6, influencing processes such as endosomal recycling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and cell migration (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced; Ogasawara2000Similarities). CYTH1 is implicated in various cellular functions, including hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell migration and the regulation of β2 integrin interactions, which are crucial for immune cell adhesion and migration (Gamara2015Regulators; Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). Additionally, CYTH1 has clinical significance in inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease, where genetic variants can affect gut epithelial integrity (Acencio2023The).

## Structure
Cytohesin-1 (CYTH1) is a 47-kDa protein characterized by several key structural domains. It contains a central Sec7 domain, approximately 200 amino acids in length, which is crucial for its guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (GEP) activity. This domain facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP in ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) and is inhibited by brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite (Ogasawara2000Similarities). The protein also features a coiled-coil domain near the N-terminus, involved in homodimerization, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the C-terminal region, which mediates membrane association through interactions with phospholipids (Das2019Structural; Ogasawara2000Similarities).

Cytohesin-1 exists in two splice variant isoforms, diglycine and triglycine, which differ by the presence of a single glycine in the PH domain. This variation affects phosphoinositide binding specificity, with the diglycine variant showing a higher affinity for PI(3,4,5)P3, crucial for plasma membrane recruitment and cellular signaling (Cronin2004Structural; Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). The protein's quaternary structure is described as an elongated dimer, with the coiled-coil domain central to dimerization and the PH domains at opposite ends, allowing for dynamic membrane interactions (Das2019Structural).

## Function
Cytohesin 1 (CYTH1) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a critical role in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. It specifically facilitates the activation of the small GTPase Arf6 by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is essential for various cellular processes such as endosomal recycling, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and cell migration (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). 

CYTH1 is involved in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell migration, where it regulates the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane ruffling, processes crucial for cell movement and response to external signals (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly PI(3,4,5)P3, to localize to the leading edge of migrating cells (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). 

CYTH1's function is modulated by microexon splicing, which affects its phosphoinositide binding affinity and subcellular localization, thereby influencing cell signaling pathways and migration (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced). This regulation is vital for normal cellular functions such as development and wound healing, and its dysregulation may contribute to pathological conditions like cancer metastasis (Ratcliffe2018HGFinduced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYTH1 gene have been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Variants in CYTH1, such as rs17736589, are associated with IBD, affecting the stability of gut epithelial adherens junctions. This instability is linked to the internalization of E-cadherin (CDH1) mediated by ARF6, which is promoted by the stabilization of CYTH1 due to a mutated version of INAVA that is more prone to ubiquitination. These genetic variations can significantly impact gut epithelial integrity, contributing to the pathogenesis of IBD (Acencio2023The).

In the context of immune-related disorders, CYTH1 is involved in the regulation of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis. Dysregulation of CYTH1, along with other genes like INAVA and CDH1, can lead to compromised epithelial barrier function, further exacerbating conditions such as IBD (Acencio2023The).

While CYTH1 has been mentioned in the context of leukemia, specifically in promoting leukemogenesis, the primary focus in the literature is on its role in inflammatory diseases rather than direct associations with specific cancers (Wang2024Integrated).

## Interactions
CYTH1, also known as cytohesin-1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. It is part of the cytohesin family, which includes four BFA-insensitive Arf GEFs in vertebrates. CYTH1 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, a Sec7 domain, and a C-terminal PH domain. The PH domain's affinity for phosphoinositides like PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is essential for its localization and recruitment to the plasma membrane (Gamara2015Regulators).

CYTH1 interacts with the β2 integrin LFA-1, enhancing LFA-1-dependent adhesion to endothelial cells. Conversely, it restrains the activation of the β2 integrin Mac-1, negatively impacting PMN adhesion to fibrinogen, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. These interactions suggest that CYTH1 differentially regulates the activation of β2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (Gamara2015Regulators).

In the context of the Arf1-mTORC1 pathway, CYTH1, along with other cytohesins, interacts with Arf1. This interaction is significantly enhanced by glutamine treatment, which is crucial for the activation of the Arf1-mTORC1 pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells (Luo2021Glutamine).
