# SBSN

## Overview
The SBSN gene encodes the protein suprabasin, which is primarily expressed in stratified epithelial tissues such as the epidermis, thymus, uterus, and esophagus. Suprabasin is a secreted protein involved in various biological processes, including epidermal differentiation, keratinocyte differentiation, and the formation of the cornified envelope, which is crucial for maintaining skin integrity (Park2002Suprabasin; Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). It is characterized by its role in cell adhesion and proliferation, contributing to wound healing and skin structure maintenance (Aoshima2019Decreased). Beyond its structural functions, suprabasin is implicated in immune responses and stress adaptation, being upregulated in response to bacterial and viral stimuli (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). The protein is also involved in oncogenic pathways and cancer progression, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

## Structure
The molecular structure of the suprabasin (SBSN) protein is not fully elucidated, as its three-dimensional structure remains unknown. However, structure prediction using Phyre2 has been performed for all three human SBSN isoforms. For SBSN-1, the predicted model predominantly consists of disordered regions, with the crystal structure of a d337a mutant of Pseudomonas sp. mis38 lipase (PDB: 2ZJ6) serving as a template, showing 12% sequence identity and 99.9% prediction confidence (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). SBSN-2 was modeled using the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein of Escherichia coli (PDB: 1QU7) as a template, with 13% sequence identity and 98.5% confidence (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). The SBSN-3 isoform model was predicted based on the structure of human micelle-bound α-synuclein (PDB: 1XQ8), which showed 18% sequence identity (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

All SBSN isoforms possess a putative N-terminal signal peptide, indicating a secretory nature and extracellular localization (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). SBSN-1 is characterized by a compositional bias of alanine, glycine, and histidine due to short tandem Glycine-x-Histidine-Histidine repeats, which is unique and conserved across species (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). The physiological relevance of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation in SBSN is still under investigation (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

## Function
The SBSN (suprabasin) gene encodes a protein primarily expressed in stratified epithelial tissues, including the epidermis, thymus, uterus, and esophagus. In healthy human cells, SBSN plays a crucial role in epidermal differentiation and the formation of the cornified envelope, a key component of the skin barrier (Park2002Suprabasin; Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). The protein is involved in keratinocyte differentiation, a process essential for skin development, and is regulated by signaling pathways such as ERK and MAL/SRF (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

SBSN is a substrate for transglutaminase 2 and 3, enzymes that contribute to the assembly of the cornified envelope, indicating its role in maintaining skin integrity (Nakazawa2020Suprabasinnull; Park2002Suprabasin). The protein is secreted and active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it participates in cell adhesion and proliferation, processes vital for wound healing and maintaining skin structure (Aoshima2019Decreased).

In addition to its structural roles, SBSN is implicated in immune responses, being upregulated in response to bacterial and viral stimuli, suggesting a role in innate immune defense (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). Its expression is also influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature changes and hypoxic stress, highlighting its involvement in stress responses (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SBSN gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In cancer, SBSN is associated with stress adaptation, pro-survival signaling, and angiogenesis, which are key features of carcinogenesis. It is located in the 19q13 region, often amplified in cancers such as ovarian, cervical, pancreatic, and breast carcinomas (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). In non-small cell lung carcinoma, increased SBSN mRNA levels are linked to hypomethylation of its promoter (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). In salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, SBSN knockdown reduces growth and invasiveness, although no correlation with clinical parameters was found (Shao2012Suprabasin).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, SBSN overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth and poor patient survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). In glioblastoma multiforme, higher SBSN levels correlate with lower patient survival and a mesenchymal signature (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). SBSN is also linked to therapy resistance, with its expression mediated by ERK1/2 activity in various cancer cell lines (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

In myelodysplastic syndromes, elevated SBSN expression is associated with poor prognosis and is therapy-independent (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). In thyroid cancer, high SBSN expression is linked to increased polarization of M2 macrophages, promoting tumor progression (Tan2022Role). SBSN's role in these diseases highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The SBSN (suprabasin) protein is involved in various interactions that contribute to its role in cancer and immune responses. In thyroid cancer, SBSN physically interacts with a network of genes, including PINK1, TNKS, HAUS1, POLK, and GSK3B. These interactions are associated with processes such as protein hydrolysis, amino acid modification, cell adhesion, and regulation of apoptosis (Tan2022Role). SBSN is also implicated in activating oncogenic pathways like AKT, p38MAPK, and WNT/β-catenin, although the specific receptors and downstream signaling pathways remain unidentified (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A).

In glioma, SBSN activates the NF-κB pathway through ANXA1-dependent ubiquitination of NEMO, highlighting its role in promoting tumor aggressiveness (Chen2022Extracellular). The protein's expression is regulated by factors such as CTCFL/BORIS, which influences its transcription through demethylation and histone modification (Pribyl2021Suprabasin—A). These interactions and regulatory mechanisms underscore SBSN's involvement in cellular processes related to cancer progression and immune modulation.
