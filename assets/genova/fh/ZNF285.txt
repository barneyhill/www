# ZNF285

## Overview
ZNF285 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 285, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The ZNF285 protein is implicated in various biological functions and has been associated with several diseases, including ovarian carcinoma and autism spectrum disorder, due to its altered expression and genetic variations (Xie2021Comprehensive; Guo2020Molecular). The evolutionary history of ZNF285, including its duplication events in great apes, suggests a potential role in the diversification of gene regulatory networks (Nowick2010Rapid).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF285 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In ovarian carcinomas, ZNF285 is identified as a novel significantly mutated gene (SMG), suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type. The study highlights a significant association between DNA gain and increased gene expression of ZNF285, indicating that it may contribute to the development of ovarian carcinomas through mechanisms involving genomic instability and upregulated expression (Guo2020Molecular; Smebye2014Chromosome).

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ZNF285 has been found to be significantly upregulated in blood samples, suggesting its involvement in the disorder. Although specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNF285 did not show a significant association with ASD risk in genetic models, the dysregulation of ZNF285 in ASD cases supports its potential role in the disorder (Xie2021Comprehensive).

The evolutionary history of ZNF285, including its duplication in great apes, suggests that its functional divergence may have implications for gene regulation, although the clinical significance of these evolutionary changes is not fully understood (Jovanovic2021Positive; Nowick2010Rapid).
