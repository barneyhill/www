# CCDC107

## Overview
The CCDC107 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 107, which is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular processes that span across the cell membrane. The specific functions of CCDC107 remain to be fully elucidated, but its structural features imply a role in maintaining cellular architecture or signaling pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of CCDC107 may have implications in various clinical conditions, although further research is needed to clarify its precise biological and pathological roles (Qiu2020aarFDC).
