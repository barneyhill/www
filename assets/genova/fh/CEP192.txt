# CEP192

## Overview
CEP192 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 192, a critical component involved in the regulation of centrosome function and cell cycle progression. The protein is categorized as a scaffold protein, playing a pivotal role in centrosome maturation, centriole duplication, and spindle assembly during mitosis. It achieves these functions by recruiting and interacting with key mitotic kinases, such as Aurora A and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and other centrosomal proteins, including CEP152 and Plk4, to facilitate the organization and stability of the microtubule network (Joukov2014The; Nasa2017Recruitment). The structural integrity and functional interactions of centrosomal protein 192 are essential for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it serves as a prognostic marker (Liu2022CEP192; Jaiswal2021Centrosome).

## Structure
CEP192 is a centrosomal protein characterized by a modular structure, primarily composed of eight tandem domains similar to the PapD-like superfamily, located in its C-terminal region (van2022Structural). The Spd2 domain, a part of this region, is highly conserved among SPD2/CEP192 homologues and includes two motifs with the highest sequence conservation: Motif 1 (PLXGYGG) and Motif 2 (GDEXXR) (van2022Structural). The structure of the Spd2 domain has been experimentally determined using X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.1 Å, and AlphaFold2 (AF2) predictions for this domain show high accuracy, with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.83 Å for 273 structurally equivalent residues (van2022Structural).

The full-length CEP192 protein is predicted to have a 'beads-on-a-string' structure, with the PapD-like domains separated by flexible linkers (van2022Structural). However, challenges exist in predicting the structure of the entire protein, as AF2 models of the full-length CEP192 have shown problematic areas, such as a knot in the polypeptide chain, which is likely an erroneous prediction (van2022Structural). These issues highlight the need for caution when interpreting full-length protein predictions, despite the high quality of individual domain predictions (van2022Structural).

## Function
CEP192 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in centrosome maturation, centriole duplication, and bipolar spindle formation during cell division. It functions as a scaffold protein, recruiting key mitotic kinases such as Aurora A and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to the centrosome, which are essential for the phosphorylation and activation of centrosomal proteins (Joukov2014The; Nasa2017Recruitment). CEP192 is involved in the recruitment of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including the γ-tubulin ring complex, which is crucial for microtubule nucleation and organization (Joukov2014The; Meng2015Bimodal).

CEP192 interacts with CEP152 to recruit Plk4, a kinase necessary for centriole duplication. This interaction is mediated by electrostatic interactions between the polo-box domain of Plk4 and acidic regions within CEP192 and CEP152 (Sonnen2013Human; gabryjonczyk2015regulation). The cooperation between CEP192 and CEP152 is essential for proper centriole duplication, and their co-depletion results in a complete loss of Plk4 from centrosomes, impairing this process (Sonnen2013Human).

CEP192's role in centrosome function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring accurate cell division, as its depletion can lead to defects in centrosome separation and spindle assembly (Joukov2014The; Nasa2017Recruitment).

## Clinical Significance
CEP192 (centrosomal protein 192) is implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in centrosome function and cell cycle regulation. Altered expression of CEP192 is significantly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it serves as a novel prognostic marker. High levels of CEP192 expression correlate with advanced tumor stages, poor clinicopathological features, and worse survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) (Liu2022CEP192). The gene's overexpression is linked to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by decreased immune cell infiltration and increased presence of immunosuppressive cells, such as type 2 T helper cells and M2 macrophages (Liu2022CEP192). This immunosuppressive environment may contribute to immune evasion and tumor progression in HCC (Liu2022CEP192).

CEP192 is also involved in centrosome amplification, which is associated with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in cancer cells. This condition can lead to genomic instability, contributing to tumorigenesis (Jaiswal2021Centrosome). The gene's role in centrosome function and its interactions with proteins like Polo-Like Kinase4 (PLK4) are crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and disruptions in these interactions can result in cancerous phenotypes (Jaiswal2021Centrosome).

## Interactions
CEP192 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in centriole duplication and spindle assembly through its interactions with various proteins. It directly interacts with Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) via its N-terminal region, which is essential for recruiting Plk4 to centrosomes, a critical step for centriole duplication. This interaction is mediated by electrostatic interactions involving conserved acidic residues in CEP192 and the polo-box domain of Plk4 (Sonnen2013Human; gabryjonczyk2015regulation).

CEP192 also interacts with CEP152, another key player in centriole duplication. The cooperation between CEP192 and CEP152 is vital for the recruitment of Plk4 to the centrosome, and their co-depletion results in a complete loss of Plk4 from centrosomes, impairing centriole duplication (Sonnen2013Human).

In the context of spindle assembly, CEP192 forms a ternary complex with Aurora A kinase (AurA) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). This complex is crucial for centrosome maturation and bipolar spindle formation. CEP192 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the interaction and activation of AurA and Plk1, which is essential for proper mitotic progression (Joukov2014The; Meng2015Bimodal). The interactions between CEP192, AurA, and Plk1 are regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites on CEP192, which are critical for the recruitment of γ-tubulin and the formation of bipolar spindles (Joukov2014The; Meng2015Bimodal).
