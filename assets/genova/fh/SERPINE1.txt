# SERPINE1

## Overview
SERPINE1 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family E member 1, commonly known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). This protein is a member of the serpin superfamily, which is characterized by its role as a serine protease inhibitor. PAI-1 is primarily involved in the regulation of fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down blood clots, by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (Gettins2016Inhibitory). Beyond its role in hemostasis, PAI-1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling, cellular senescence, and tumor progression. The expression and activity of SERPINE1 are modulated by several signaling pathways, notably the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) pathway, which influences its involvement in inflammation and tissue repair (Dennler1998Direct). Dysregulation of SERPINE1 is associated with numerous clinical conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2019SERPINE1; Usmanova2024SERPINE1).

## Structure
SERPINE1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved serine protease inhibitor structure. The primary structure of SERPINE1 includes a reactive center loop (RCL), which is crucial for its inhibitory function (Gettins2016Inhibitory). The secondary structure of SERPINE1 features multiple alpha-helices and three beta-sheets, forming a typical serpin fold (Gettins2016Inhibitory). 

The tertiary structure involves a metastable conformation, which is necessary for its inhibitory activity. This conformation allows the RCL to be exposed, enabling interaction with target proteinases (Silverman2001The). Upon cleavage, the RCL inserts into the A beta-sheet, transitioning the protein to a more stable state (Irving2000Phylogeny). 

SERPINE1 is generally monomeric in its quaternary structure but can form complexes with other proteins, such as proteinases, through a unique mechanism involving significant conformational changes (Huntington2000Structure). Post-translational modifications of SERPINE1 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its function and stability (Gettins2016Inhibitory). Splice variants of SERPINE1 may result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its inhibitory properties and interactions (Gettins2016Inhibitory).

## Function
The SERPINE1 gene encodes the protein plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which plays a crucial role in regulating fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down blood clots. PAI-1 functions as the primary inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), thereby controlling the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme responsible for clot degradation (Marchand2012miR421). This regulation is essential for maintaining hemostatic balance and preventing excessive bleeding or thrombosis.

In healthy human cells, PAI-1 is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and tissue invasion, processes critical for wound healing and cell migration. It helps coordinate cycles of cell adhesion and detachment, maintaining a stromal scaffold necessary for effective cell migration and the transition from the G0 to G1 phase of the cell cycle (Qi2008SERPINE1). PAI-1 is also expressed in senescent cells, where it may interfere with growth factor activation, suggesting a role in cellular aging and tissue homeostasis (Qi2008SERPINE1).

The expression of SERPINE1 is influenced by various signaling pathways, including the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) pathway, where Smad3 and Smad4 proteins bind to CAGA boxes in the gene's promoter to mediate transcriptional responses (Dennler1998Direct). This regulation underscores the gene's involvement in complex cellular processes and its impact on organismal outcomes such as inflammation and tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SERPINE1 gene, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are implicated in various diseases. Elevated levels of PAI-1, often associated with the 4G/4G genotype of SERPINE1, contribute to a prothrombotic state by inhibiting fibrinolysis, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and thromboembolic complications (Usmanova2024SERPINE1). This genotype is also linked to poor outcomes in acute myocardial infarction due to ineffective thrombolytic therapy (Usmanova2024SERPINE1).

In cancer, SERPINE1 overexpression is associated with tumor progression and resistance to therapy. It is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as seen in gastric adenocarcinoma and head and neck cancers (Yang2019SERPINE1; Pavón2016uPAuPAR). High SERPINE1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer and diffuse lower-grade gliomas, where it influences immune cell infiltration and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Huang2021ImmuneRelated; Feng2023Cuproptosisrelated).

In Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, SERPINE1 is identified as a key driver of pathogenic signaling, with its downregulation potentially reversing disease features (Catarinella2022SerpinE1).

## Interactions
SERPINE1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is known to inhibit tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU), which are crucial for fibrinolysis, thereby affecting cell adhesion and migration (Guo2023SERPINE1). SERPINE1 interacts with vitronectin (VTN), forming a stable complex that modulates cell adhesion and spreading (Khosravi2022Analysing). This interaction is significant in the context of glioblastoma, where it contributes to tumor invasion and migration (Khosravi2022Analysing).

In glioblastoma, SERPINE1 also interacts with proteins such as PLG, TGFB1, VWF, FGF2, and CXCR1. These interactions are involved in processes like inflammation and angiogenesis, which are relevant to tumor development (Khosravi2022Analysing). The interaction with FGF2 and CXCR1 is particularly strong, playing a role in creating a microenvironment conducive to carcinogenesis (Khosravi2022Analysing).

SERPINE1 is also associated with the EGFR/MEK/Rho-ROCK signaling pathway and can activate Akt and ERK signaling pathways, influencing cell survival and apoptosis (Guo2023SERPINE1). These interactions highlight SERPINE1's role in tumor progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
