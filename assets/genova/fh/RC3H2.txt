# RC3H2

## Overview
RC3H2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as ring finger and CCCH-type domains 2, which is a member of the Roquin family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation. The RC3H2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA homeostasis, immune regulation, and iron metabolism. It achieves these functions through its ability to bind to specific RNA elements and facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular responses to oxidative stress and regulating iron uptake by modulating transferrin receptor-1 mRNA stability. Dysregulation of RC3H2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including osteoporosis and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Chen2023Construction; Zhang2015New; Corral2021Roquin).

## Structure


## Function
The RC3H2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA homeostasis and immunological self-tolerance. It is part of the Roquin family of RNA-binding proteins, characterized by a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase domain. This protein is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and degradation, particularly through its interaction with mRNAs containing constitutive decay elements (Zhang2015New). RC3H2 has a bipartite RNA-binding region composed of ROQ and HEPN domains, which allows it to bind to stem-loop and double-stranded RNAs. This binding is associated with its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, promoting the degradation of proteins such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, crucial for cellular responses to oxidative stress (Zhang2015New).

In healthy human cells, RC3H2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates the stability and translation of RNA molecules. It is involved in the regulation of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) mRNA stability in response to iron levels, playing a role in iron homeostasis and cellular iron uptake (Corral2021Roquin). The protein's function is not redundant with its paralog RC3H1, as evidenced by differences in their interactions with E2 enzymes and the effects of RNA binding on their ubiquitination activities (Zhang2015New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the RC3H2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of osteoporosis, alterations in RC3H2 expression are associated with the disease's progression. Specifically, RC3H2 protein levels are downregulated in osteoporosis, and its interaction with miR-183-5p and circ_0070304 is crucial for maintaining bone health. Overexpression of circ_0070304 in bone marrow stromal cells can increase RC3H2 protein expression, promoting osteoblastic differentiation, which is beneficial for bone formation (Chen2023Construction).

RC3H2, as part of the Roquin family, also plays a role in immune regulation. Dysregulation of Roquin proteins, including those encoded by RC3H2, can lead to inflammatory diseases due to the accumulation of specific T cell subsets and systemic inflammation. This dysregulation is linked to autoimmune conditions, as Roquin proteins are involved in controlling proinflammatory mRNA expression (Raj2022Roquindependent).

Additionally, RC3H2 is involved in the regulation of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) mRNA stability, which is crucial for iron homeostasis. Dysregulation in this pathway can lead to conditions such as iron overload, although specific diseases directly linked to RC3H2 mutations are not detailed (Corral2021Roquin).

## Interactions
RC3H2, a member of the Roquin family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA homeostasis and immune regulation. The protein contains a bipartite RNA-binding region composed of ROQ and HEPN domains, which facilitate its interaction with RNA. RC3H2 binds to stem-loop and double-stranded RNAs, with the ROQ domain primarily responsible for RNA binding, while the HEPN domain contributes to nucleotide interactions (Zhang2015New).

RC3H2 forms a complex with a 15-nucleotide constitutive decay element (CDE) of human intermediate early response 3 (Ier3) RNA, where it interacts with both single-stranded and double-stranded RNA components. This interaction involves specific residues in the ROQ and HEPN domains, highlighting the protein's ability to bind RNA in a conformation-dependent manner (Zhang2015New).

RC3H2 also exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, interacting with various E2 conjugating enzymes to drive polyubiquitination. It shows a preference for forming Lys63-specific polyubiquitin chains with UBE2N/UBE2V1 or UBE2N/UBE2V2 complexes. This activity suggests a potential cross-talk between RNA binding and ubiquitination, as the RING domain of RC3H2 contacts the HEPN domain, possibly influencing ubiquitination activity (Zhang2015New).
