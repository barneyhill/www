# ECE2

## Overview
The ECE2 gene encodes endothelin-converting enzyme 2, a type II transmembrane metalloprotease that plays a pivotal role in the conversion of big endothelins into active endothelins, which are potent vasoconstrictors. This enzyme is characterized by its zinc-binding motif and is primarily localized in intracellular compartments such as the trans-Golgi network and secretory vesicles, where it processes neuropeptides at an acidic pH. ECE2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions involved in neuropeptide processing, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including opioid receptor signaling and amyloid beta degradation. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiac defects, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, and lung adenocarcinoma (Yanagisawa2000Disruption; Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting; PachecoQuinto2016Major; Zhang2022ECE2).

## Structure
Endothelin-converting enzyme 2 (ECE2) is a type II transmembrane metalloprotease involved in the conversion of big endothelin to endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor. The primary structure of ECE2 includes a signal peptide and a zinc-binding motif, which is characteristic of its role as a metalloprotease (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). The secondary structure of ECE2 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a catalytic domain with a prominent metalloprotease fold, essential for its enzymatic activity (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting).

ECE2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may affect its stability and localization within the cell (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). The enzyme is localized in intracellular compartments, particularly in endocytic vesicles, where it processes neuropeptides at an acidic pH (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). ECE2 also exists in splice variant isoforms, which can result in different functional properties, potentially influencing its role in various cellular processes (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). These structural features enable ECE2 to play a crucial role in modulating receptor activity and peptide processing within cells.

## Function
Endothelin-converting enzyme 2 (ECE2) is a zinc metalloprotease that plays a crucial role in converting big endothelins into their active form, endothelins, which are potent vasoconstrictors. This enzyme is primarily located in intracellular compartments such as the trans-Golgi network and secretory vesicles, with a restricted neuroendocrine distribution (SmithAnttila2017Identification). ECE2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, where it is involved in neuropeptide processing and modulation of regulatory peptide levels (Rodriguiz2007Animals; SmithAnttila2017Identification).

In the context of opioid receptor activity, ECE2 modulates the recycling and signaling of μ opioid receptors by processing endocytosed opioid peptides. This activity is crucial for receptor recycling and resensitization, affecting intracellular signaling pathways (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). ECE2 also plays a significant role in the degradation of amyloid beta, a process relevant to Alzheimer's disease, as it is expressed by specific populations of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex (PachecoQuinto2016Major). The enzyme's activity in these regions suggests its involvement in maintaining cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity (PachecoQuinto2016Major).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ECE2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiac development, ECE2 plays a crucial role in the formation of cardiac outflow structures. Studies have shown that ECE2, along with ECE1, is involved in the production of mature endothelin-1 (ET-1), essential for proper cardiac morphogenesis. In mice lacking both ECE1 and ECE2, severe cardiac defects such as abnormal aorticopulmonary septum formation and atrioventricular valve displacement are observed, indicating the importance of ECE2 in cardiac development (Yanagisawa2000Disruption).

ECE2 is also identified as a major autoantigen in autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). Autoantibodies against ECE2 are present in a significant proportion of APS1 patients, suggesting its role in the disease's pathogenesis. These autoantibodies are associated with neurological manifestations and pituitary insufficiency in APS1 patients, highlighting ECE2's involvement in neuroendocrine functions (SmithAnttila2017Identification).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ECE2 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression is linked to pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and immune infiltration, suggesting a role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Zhang2022ECE2).

## Interactions
Endothelin-converting enzyme 2 (ECE2) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. ECE2 interacts with μ opioid receptors, playing a crucial role in their recycling and signaling. This interaction is particularly significant when μ receptors are internalized by agonists such as DAMGO or dynorphin B, which are substrates of ECE2. The presence of an ECE2 inhibitor can block the recycling of these receptors, leading to their retention in intracellular compartments and affecting their signaling capabilities (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting).

ECE2 is also involved in the processing of neuropeptides, including opioid peptides, within endocytic compartments. This processing affects the recycling and resensitization of μ opioid receptors, highlighting ECE2's role in modulating receptor function through its enzymatic activity (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting). The enzyme's activity is selective for certain opioid peptides, influencing receptor recycling and signaling pathways (Gupta2014Endothelin‐converting).

In the context of cardiac development, ECE2 can partially compensate for the generation of mature endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the absence of ECE-1, indicating a functional redundancy between these enzymes in the formation of cardiac structures (Yanagisawa2000Disruption).
