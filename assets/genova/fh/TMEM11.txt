# TMEM11

## Overview
TMEM11 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 11, a mitochondrial transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. TMEM11 acts as a negative regulator of BNIP3/BNIP3L-dependent receptor-mediated mitophagy, thereby contributing to mitochondrial quality control. It is also implicated in cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair, interacting with METTL1 to influence m7G methylation of ATF5 mRNA, which affects cardiac regeneration processes. The protein's interactions with components of the MICOS complex and its role in mitochondrial dynamics underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and potential therapeutic relevance in cardiac conditions (Chen2023TMEM11; Gok2022The; Guarani2015QIL1).

## Function
TMEM11 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function in healthy human cells. It is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and acts as a negative regulator of BNIP3/BNIP3L-dependent receptor-mediated mitophagy, a process essential for mitochondrial quality control. By forming a complex with BNIP3 and BNIP3L, TMEM11 helps regulate the turnover of mitochondria, preventing excessive degradation under normal and hypoxic conditions (Gok2022The).

TMEM11 is also involved in maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology. Depletion of TMEM11 leads to changes in mitochondrial structure, resulting in enlarged and bulbous mitochondria, which indicates its role in preserving the narrow tubular shape typical of healthy mitochondria (Gok2022The). Although TMEM11 interacts with the MICOS complex, which is involved in maintaining mitochondrial cristae morphology, it does not affect the stability or assembly of this complex, suggesting that its role in mitochondrial morphology is independent of MICOS (Gok2022The).

In addition to its role in mitophagy and mitochondrial morphology, TMEM11 is implicated in cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair. It interacts with METTL1 to enhance m7G methylation of ATF5 mRNA, which suppresses cardiomyocyte proliferation, indicating its involvement in cardiac regeneration processes (Chen2023TMEM11).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM11 plays a significant role in cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair, with its expression levels being crucial for these processes. Alterations in TMEM11 expression can significantly impact cardiac function and regeneration, particularly after ischemic injury such as myocardial infarction (MI) (Chen2023TMEM11). TMEM11 deficiency in knockout mice leads to increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and improved cardiac regeneration post-MI, while overexpression inhibits these processes, resulting in increased fibrotic area and reduced cardiac repair (Chen2023TMEM11).

TMEM11 interacts with METTL1, an RNA methyltransferase, to regulate m7G methylation of ATF5 mRNA, which is implicated in cardiomyocyte proliferation. This interaction enhances ATF5 expression, promoting the transcription of INCA1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, thereby suppressing cardiomyocyte proliferation (Chen2023TMEM11). The study suggests that targeting the TMEM11-METTL1-ATF5-INCA1 axis could be a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac repair and regeneration (Chen2023TMEM11).

While the study does not directly link TMEM11 to specific diseases, its role in cardiomyocyte proliferation suggests relevance to conditions like heart failure and myocardial infarction, where cardiac cell regeneration is crucial (Chen2023TMEM11).

## Interactions
TMEM11 is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein that participates in several interactions with other proteins, influencing mitochondrial dynamics and cellular processes. It is known to form a complex with BNIP3 and BNIP3L on the outer mitochondrial membrane, acting as a negative regulator of BNIP3/BNIP3L-dependent receptor-mediated mitophagy. This interaction has been validated through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, with BNIP3L identified as the top interactor, along with BNIP3 and VDAC family members (Gok2022The).

TMEM11 also interacts with the MICOS complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial cristae organization. Although TMEM11 is not required for the stability or assembly of the MICOS complex, it associates with several of its components, including MIC19, MIC27, MIC60, and MTX2 (Gok2022The; Guarani2015QIL1).

In cardiomyocytes, TMEM11 interacts with METTL1, an RNA methyltransferase, to promote m7G methylation of ATF5 mRNA. This interaction enhances ATF5 expression, which in turn regulates the expression of INCA1, a gene associated with cell cycle arrest, thereby suppressing cardiomyocyte proliferation (Chen2023TMEM11).
