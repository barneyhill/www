# LRRC42

## Overview
LRRC42 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 42, which is primarily localized in the nucleus and is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. The protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for their role in forming protein scaffolds that facilitate these interactions. Although the precise functions of LRRC42 in human cells are not fully understood, it is suggested to act as a transcriptional regulator, potentially influencing ciliogenesis through interactions with proteins such as Glis1/3 and Rfx3 (Yasuoka2019Evolutionary). The gene is part of a conserved cluster in bilaterians, hinting at its evolutionary significance in cilia-related functions (Yasuoka2019Evolutionary). Additionally, LRRC42 may play a role in stabilizing the methyl-CpG binding protein 1 (MeCP1) complex and regulating p21 transcription, indicating its involvement in gene expression regulation (Moody2020Considerations).

## Function
LRRC42 (leucine rich repeat containing 42) is a nuclear protein that plays a role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and protein-protein interactions. It is characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are typically involved in forming protein scaffolds that facilitate these interactions. Although specific functions of LRRC42 in healthy human cells are not detailed, it is suggested to act as a transcriptional regulator, potentially interacting with other proteins like Glis1/3 and Rfx3 to regulate ciliogenesis, a process crucial for the formation and function of cilia (Yasuoka2019Evolutionary).

LRRC42 is part of a conserved gene cluster in bilaterians, which includes genes involved in ciliogenesis, indicating its potential role in cilia-related functions (Yasuoka2019Evolutionary). The protein is hypothesized to stabilize the methyl-CpG binding protein 1 (MeCP1) complex and regulate p21 transcription, suggesting a role in gene expression regulation (Moody2020Considerations). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific molecular activities and cellular locations of LRRC42 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.
