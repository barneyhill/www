# SMC2

## Overview
SMC2 is a gene that encodes the structural maintenance of chromosomes 2 protein, a critical component of the condensin complex involved in chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division. The SMC2 protein belongs to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, characterized by its conserved molecular architecture, including nucleotide-binding and coiled-coil regions, as well as a central hinge domain. These structural features enable SMC2 to form a heterodimer with SMC4, facilitating its role in chromatin organization and compaction. The protein's activity is regulated by ATPase activity and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its function in maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing unwanted recombination events. SMC2's involvement in the DNA damage response and its interactions with other proteins within the condensin complex underscore its importance in cellular processes, including mitosis and meiosis (Hirano2002The; Strunnikov1995SMC2; Jeppsson2014The).

## Structure
The SMC2 protein is a member of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, characterized by a conserved molecular architecture essential for its function in chromosome dynamics. The primary structure of SMC2 includes a nucleotide-binding region, two coiled-coil regions, and a central hinge domain, which are typical features of SMC proteins (Hirano2002The; Strunnikov1995SMC2). The coiled-coil regions facilitate dimerization, allowing SMC2 to form a heterodimer with SMC4, a critical component of the condensin complex involved in chromosome condensation (Hassler2018Towards; Stray2003Biochemical).

The tertiary structure of SMC2 is characterized by its elongated rod-like shape, formed by the coiled-coil domains, which contribute to the protein's ability to undergo conformational changes necessary for its function (Matityahu2017A). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimer with SMC4, which can further associate into higher-order structures, such as heterotetramers, essential for its role in chromosomal architecture (Stray2003Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate SMC2 activity during mitosis, influencing its role in chromosome condensation and segregation (Hirano2002The).

## Function
The SMC2 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the condensin complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis and meiosis. In healthy human cells, SMC2 plays a critical role in organizing and compacting chromatin into the characteristic shape of mitotic chromosomes, ensuring proper chromosome architecture and segregation during cell division (Hirano2002The; Uhlmann2016SMC). The condensin complex, which includes SMC2, functions as an intramolecular DNA linker, facilitating the compaction of DNA by bringing two sites in the same DNA molecule together, a process that is crucial for chromosome condensation during mitosis (Jeppsson2014The).

SMC2 is active in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin organization and gene expression. It is involved in the DNA damage response, playing a role in maintaining chromosomal stability and preventing unwanted intrachromosomal homologous recombination, particularly at the rDNA locus (Wu2012The). The protein's activity is regulated by ATPase activity, which is necessary for its function as a DNA linker, highlighting its importance in the structural changes and compaction of DNA (Jeppsson2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SMC2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic cancer, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3818626 in SMC2 is associated with an increased risk of the disease. This SNP is linked to decreased SMC2 mRNA expression levels, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Feng2019Potential). SMC2 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its high expression levels correlate with poorer overall survival, recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. This overexpression suggests that SMC2 may serve as a prognostic marker in HCC (Nie2021Clinical).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), SMC2 is upregulated, although its expression does not significantly correlate with specific clinical features of the disease. The gene's expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation (Nie2022Comprehensive). These findings highlight the potential of SMC2 as a target for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment, given its involvement in key biological processes and pathways (Nie2021Clinical).

## Interactions
SMC2 is a core component of the condensin complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. It forms a heterodimer with SMC4, and together they interact with non-SMC subunits to form the condensin I and II complexes. Condensin I includes CAP-D2, CAP-H, and CAP-G, while condensin II comprises CAP-D3, CAP-H2, and CAP-G2. These complexes are involved in chromosome organization and DNA repair, with distinct roles in processes such as DNA single-strand break repair and homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks (Wu2012The).

SMC2 also participates in interactions with other proteins within the condensin complex. It has been shown to form homomers and heteromers with proteins like Smc1p in yeast, indicating its ability to assemble into multimeric structures (Strunnikov1995SMC2). The interaction of SMC2 with SMC4 is essential for the formation of a functional condensin complex, as demonstrated by the presence of these proteins in near equimolar amounts in purified complexes (Kim2010StreptavidinBinding).

In addition to its role in the condensin complex, SMC2 is involved in stabilizing the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) during mitosis, as evidenced by its interaction with CPC components such as Bir1p (Li2011Systematic).
