# LGALS3BP

## Overview
LGALS3BP is a gene that encodes the galectin-3-binding protein, a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, immune response modulation, and apoptosis. The protein is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily and is characterized by its highly glycosylated structure, which is crucial for its function and secretion (schade2017molecular). Galectin-3-binding protein interacts with several extracellular matrix components and integrins, facilitating cell adhesion and signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and survival (Capone2021Role). It is also involved in centrosome biology, where it regulates centriole duplication and microtubule organization (schade2017molecular). Clinically, LGALS3BP is significant in cancer progression, with its expression levels correlating with prognosis in various malignancies, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Capone2021Role).

## Structure
The LGALS3BP protein, also known as galectin-3-binding protein, is a highly glycosylated protein secreted into the extracellular matrix. It consists of 585 amino acids and is divided into six stretches with four structural or functional domains: a secretory signal peptide, a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, a BTB/POZ domain, an IVR domain, and an uncharacterized domain 4 (schade2017molecular). The BTB/POZ domain is crucial for dimerization and oligomerization, while the IVR domain is necessary for acquiring pericentriolar material at centrosomes (schade2017molecular). Domain 4 contains a cleavage site for the extracellular protease plasmin (schade2017molecular).

LGALS3BP forms large ring-like oligomers composed of 60-90 kDa subunits, indicating a quaternary structure (schade2017molecular). The protein is part of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily, which includes proteins involved in immune system development and regulation (schade2017molecular). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is significant for its function and secretion (schade2017molecular). The protein's ability to form homodimers suggests a complex quaternary structure that facilitates its role in cell adhesion and immune response (schade2017molecular).

## Function
LGALS3BP, also known as galectin-3 binding protein, is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes. It is secreted by most human cells and is present in body fluids, where it plays a role in cell adhesion, immune response modulation, and apoptosis. LGALS3BP interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, such as collagens IV, V, and VI, fibronectin, and nidogen, facilitating β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Capone2021Role). This protein is involved in the regulation of cell signaling pathways, impacting processes like proliferative signaling and resistance to cell death (Capone2021Role).

In healthy cells, LGALS3BP is involved in innate immune responses, where it can reduce the amount of HIV Gag at the plasma membrane and inhibit the proteolytic maturation of HIV gp160/Env (Capone2021Role). It also plays a role in preventing inflammatory diseases by suppressing TAK1-dependent NF-κB activation (Capone2021Role). LGALS3BP is expressed in all trophoblast subpopulations, with higher expression in syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast cells, suggesting a role in placental function and potentially in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (Kandel2022Placental).

## Clinical Significance
LGALS3BP, also known as galectin 3 binding protein, plays a significant role in cancer progression and is associated with various malignancies. Elevated levels of LGALS3BP are linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, where it is associated with metastasis, particularly to the liver, and correlates with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (Capone2021Role). In lung cancer, high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG through PI3K/Akt activation (Woo2017Lectin; Capone2021Role). LGALS3BP is also implicated in ovarian, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and gastric cancers, where its expression correlates with tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes (Capone2021Role).

In contrast, in Ewing's sarcoma, LGALS3BP expression is associated with favorable outcomes, reducing metastatic potential and enhancing cell aggregation (Zambelli2009Biological; Capone2021Role). The protein's role in colorectal carcinoma and pleural mesothelioma is complex, with some studies suggesting it acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt pathway (Capone2021Role). These findings highlight LGALS3BP's dual role in cancer, acting as both a promoter and suppressor depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
LGALS3BP, also known as galectin-3 binding protein, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are significant in both cancer progression and centrosome biology. It interacts with galectin-1 and galectin-3, promoting cell aggregation and influencing cell adhesion through integrins such as α5β1, αvβ1, and α6β1 (Capone2021Role). LGALS3BP also binds to extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin, nidogen, laminin, and collagen, facilitating integrin-mediated adhesion to endothelial cells (Capone2021Role).

In the context of centrosome biology, LGALS3BP interacts with several centrosomal proteins, including C-Nap1 (CEP250), GCP3 (TUBGCP3), and MAGED2. These interactions are crucial for its localization to the centrosomes and are involved in the regulation of centriole duplication and microtubule organization (schade2017molecular). The interaction with C-Nap1 is particularly important as it acts as an anchoring scaffold for LGALS3BP at the centrioles (schade2017molecular).

LGALS3BP is also associated with exosomes and exomeres, where it mediates specific interactions through adhesion molecules, contributing to its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Capone2021Role). These interactions highlight LGALS3BP's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
