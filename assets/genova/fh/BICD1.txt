# BICD1

## Overview
BICD1 is a gene that encodes the BICD cargo adaptor 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport processes. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil structure, which facilitates its function as a cargo adaptor, enabling the transport of various cellular components along microtubules. BICD cargo adaptor 1 interacts with dynein motor proteins, contributing to the minus-end-directed transport of organelles, vesicle trafficking, and cell division. It is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it modulates neurotrophin signaling, and in mesenchymal stem cells, where it aids in hypoxia adaptation. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as Rab6 and PTPN23, underscore its role in coordinating intracellular transport and trafficking. Alterations in BICD1 expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastomas, and peripheral neuropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Jiang2020BICD1; Hirsch2023Biallelic; Lee2018BICD1).

## Structure
The BICD1 protein is a human homologue of the Drosophila Bicaudal-D gene and is characterized by a coiled-coil structure that facilitates its role as a cargo adaptor in intracellular transport. The primary structure of BICD1 is encoded by an open reading frame of 2505 base pairs, resulting in a protein composed of 835 amino acids (Baens1997A). The secondary structure includes five amphipathic helices and a leucine zipper, which are regions of high similarity to the Drosophila Bic-D protein. These regions are predicted to form helical coiled coils, a common structural motif in proteins that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Baens1997A).

The tertiary structure of BICD1 is not explicitly detailed, but the presence of coiled coils suggests a stable, elongated structure. The quaternary structure is also not discussed, but the presence of coiled coils and leucine zippers often indicates potential for dimerization or interaction with other proteins (Baens1997A). BICD1 contains three functional coiled-coil regions, with the C-terminal region (CC3) directly binding to cargo-specific factors such as Rab6 and RanBP2 (Terawaki2014Crystallographic). BICD1 undergoes alternative splicing, but these variations do not affect the coiled-coil structure, suggesting that the functional domains are preserved across different splice variants (Baens1997A).

## Function
The BICD1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an adaptor in intracellular transport processes, primarily facilitating the movement of various cellular components along microtubules by interacting with dynein motor proteins. This protein is crucial for the minus-end-directed transport of intracellular organelles, playing a significant role in vesicle trafficking, organelle positioning, and cell division (Hirsch2023Biallelic; Lee2018BICD1). BICD1 is characterized by multiple coiled-coil domains that enable it to bind to a variety of cargos and interact with the dynein and dynactin motor complex (Hirsch2023Biallelic).

In neurons, BICD1 is involved in the intracellular trafficking of neurotrophin receptors, modulating the amplitude and duration of neurotrophin signaling, which is essential for neuron specification, differentiation, and survival (Hirsch2023Biallelic). The protein is also implicated in the nuclear translocation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in mesenchymal stem cells during hypoxia adaptation, a process crucial for metabolic adaptation under low oxygen conditions (Lee2018BICD1). BICD1's activity is particularly noted in the cytoplasm, near the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis and proper distribution of organelles (Hirsch2023Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the BICD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BICD1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with larger tumor size, venous infiltration, advanced tumor stages, and shorter overall survival. It acts as an oncogene, promoting cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC cells (Jiang2020BICD1).

In glioblastomas (GBMs), high BICD1 expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapies like Temozolomide and radiation. It is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which may contribute to therapeutic resistance (Huang2017BICD1expression). Conversely, in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs), BICD1 downregulation is associated with favorable prognosis, particularly in patients with IDH1 mutations. This downregulation correlates with decreased PD-L1 levels, suggesting a potential mechanism for improved outcomes (Huang2021BICD).

Biallelic loss-of-function variants in BICD1 are linked to peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss. These variants disrupt neurotrophin receptor trafficking, which is crucial for neuronal function, and are associated with conditions resembling Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (Hirsch2023Biallelic).

## Interactions
BICD1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport processes. It is phosphorylated by GSK-3β at specific serine and threonine residues, which is essential for its interaction with dynein, a motor protein involved in microtubule anchorage at the centrosome. Mutations at these phosphorylation sites disrupt BICD1's ability to form a complex with dynein, highlighting the importance of GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation for BICD1's function (Fumoto2006GSK3βregulated).

BICD1 also interacts with PTPN23, a protein involved in endocytic sorting of neurotrophin receptors. This interaction occurs via the N-terminal CC1 domain of BICD1, specifically within amino acids 95-265. The interaction is significant for cargo sorting and MVB biogenesis, and a BICD1 mutant lacking the PTPN23-binding domain shows reduced binding to PTPN23 and altered localization patterns (Budzinska2020PTPN23).

BICD1 forms a stable complex with Rab6, a small GTPase, which is involved in Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking. The interaction between BICD1 and Rab6 is facilitated by the C-terminal coiled-coil region of BICD1, although crystallization conditions can disrupt this interaction (Terawaki2014Crystallographic). These interactions underscore BICD1's role in coordinating intracellular transport and trafficking.
