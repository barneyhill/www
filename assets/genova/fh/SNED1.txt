# SNED1

## Overview
SNED1 is a gene that encodes the protein sushi, nidogen, and EGF-like domains 1, a multidomain extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as NIDO, follistatin, sushi, EGF-like, and fibronectin type III, facilitating diverse interactions within the ECM. SNED1 plays a significant role in cellular processes like cell adhesion, signaling, and ECM organization, contributing to tissue integrity and development. It is particularly involved in interactions with integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and communication. The protein's involvement in pathways related to signal transduction and developmental biology underscores its importance in maintaining ECM composition and function. Alterations in SNED1 expression have been linked to developmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as 2q37 deletion syndrome and breast cancer metastasis (Vallet2020Computational; Pally2024The; Lee2022Timelapsed).

## Structure
The SNED1 protein is a multidomain extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It contains a NIDO domain, follistatin domain, Sushi domain, 15 EGF-like domains, and 3 fibronectin III domains, contributing to its structural complexity and potential for diverse interactions (Vallet2020Computational). The primary structure of SNED1 includes 107 cysteine residues, forming 53 predicted disulfide bonds, which suggest a highly stable and intricate disulfide-bonded structure (Vallet2020Computational).

The secondary structure of SNED1 is predominantly composed of β-strands, with a significant amount of random coil, and lacks helices, as determined experimentally (Vallet2020Computational). The tertiary structure is suggested to be elongated, consistent with an intrinsically disordered protein, as indicated by its hydrodynamic radius (Vallet2020Computational). 

SNED1 is known to form higher molecular weight oligomers or aggregates stabilized by disulfide bonds, indicating potential dimerization in vitro (Vallet2020Computational). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation at specific sites and phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues, which may influence its interactions and functions (Vallet2020Computational). These structural features and modifications are crucial for SNED1's role in ECM organization and protein-protein interactions.

## Function
SNED1 is a gene that encodes an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and ECM interactions. The protein is characterized by multiple domains, such as the NIDO, follistatin, sushi, EGF-like, and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate these interactions (Vallet2020Computational; Pally2024The). SNED1 plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and development by modulating ECM composition and protein folding. It influences the coverage and accessibility of other ECM proteins, such as nidogen 2 and thrombospondin 1, suggesting its involvement in ECM assembly and organization (Lee2022Timelapsed).

SNED1 is also implicated in cell adhesion, primarily through its interaction with integrins. The presence of integrin-binding motifs, such as RGD, is critical for this process, as mutations in these motifs significantly reduce cell adhesion (Pally2024The). The protein's interaction network includes various ECM and intracellular proteins, indicating its role in pathways related to signal transduction, cell-cell communication, and developmental biology (Vallet2020Computational). Despite its significance, the specific functions of SNED1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SNED1 gene have been linked to several developmental disorders and cancer. In humans, the deletion of the 2q37.3 region, which includes the SNED1 locus, is associated with 2q37 deletion syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and skeletal abnormalities, suggesting that SNED1 may contribute to the craniofacial phenotype observed in this condition (Barqué2018Knockout).

SNED1 has also been implicated in cancer, particularly in promoting breast cancer metastasis. Its expression levels negatively correlate with survival in breast cancer patients, indicating that higher SNED1 expression may be associated with more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes (Vallet2020Computational; Barqué2018Knockout). SNED1 is involved in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, which can influence tumor progression and metastasis. It interacts with integrins, such as α5β1 integrin, to mediate cell adhesion, a process crucial for both craniofacial morphogenesis and cancer metastasis (Pally2024The; Lee2022Timelapsed). These interactions highlight SNED1's role in both developmental defects and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
SNED1 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its integrin-binding motifs, RGD and LDV. These motifs suggest potential interactions with integrins, which are major extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors. The RGD motif is particularly crucial for SNED1's interaction with integrin heterodimers, such as α5β1, facilitating cell adhesion processes. This interaction is significant in contexts like breast cancer metastasis and neural crest cell migration (Pally2024The).

Computational predictions have identified 114 unique interactions for SNED1, with a notable portion involving membrane proteins, especially integrins. These predictions also include interactions with proteins like Indian hedgehog (IHH), tissue factor (F3), and various extracellular proteins such as collagens and ECM glycoproteins. Notably, 10 interactions were predicted by multiple algorithms, involving proteins like collagen VII, tenascin N, fibronectin, and the integrin β4 subunit (Vallet2020Computational).

SNED1's presence in the ECM affects the accessibility of other ECM proteins, such as thrombospondins and nidogen 2, suggesting potential interactions that modulate ECM assembly and organization (Lee2022Timelapsed). Despite these findings, no interactions with nucleic acids have been reported.
