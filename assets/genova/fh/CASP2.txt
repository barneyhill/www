# CASP2

## Overview
Caspase-2 (CASP2) is a gene that encodes the protein caspase-2, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, which plays a pivotal role in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. As one of the most evolutionarily conserved caspases, caspase-2 is unique in its dual functionality, sharing characteristics with both initiator and effector caspases. It is involved in maintaining genomic stability, regulating the cell cycle, and acting as a tumor suppressor by facilitating the apoptotic removal of cells with mitotic errors (Dorstyn2012Caspase2; Kopeina2021Caspase2). The protein is activated in response to various stressors, including DNA damage and metabolic imbalance, and can initiate the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (Egorshina2018Caspase2; Kopeina2021Caspase2). Caspase-2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it can translocate due to a nuclear localization signal, and is involved in interactions with several proteins, such as the PIDDosome complex, to mediate its apoptotic functions (Tinel2004The; BrownSuedel2020Caspase2). The CASP2 gene's role in tumor suppression and its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders highlight its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Uctepe2023Biallelic; Dawar2016Caspase2mediated).

## Structure
Caspase-2 (CASP2) is a cysteine-aspartic acid protease involved in apoptosis, characterized by a specific molecular structure. The primary structure of caspase-2 includes a prodomain with a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a large subunit (p19), and a small subunit (p12) (Tang2011Structural). Upon activation, the prodomain and linker are removed, resulting in a stable dimer consisting of the large and small subunits (Tang2011Structural).

The secondary structure of caspase-2 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteases of this family. The tertiary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, which is essential for its activation and function (Tang2011Structural). This dimer can self-associate to form the active enzyme.

Caspase-2 contains a unique salt bridge between Glu-217 and Arg-378, which is crucial for its activation and is not conserved in other caspases (Tang2011Structural). The enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, which are necessary for its catalytic activity (Tang2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications of caspase-2 include phosphorylation and cleavage, which are important for its regulation and function. Splice variants of caspase-2 may alter its apoptotic functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Caspase-2 (CASP2) is a crucial protein involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle. It plays a significant role in tumor suppression by ensuring the apoptotic removal of cells with mitotic aberrations, thereby preventing aneuploidy, a condition associated with tumorigenesis (Dawar2016Caspase2mediated; Kopeina2021Caspase2). Caspase-2 is activated in response to various cellular stressors, such as DNA damage and metabolic imbalance, and can initiate the caspase cascade, leading to apoptosis (Egorshina2018Caspase2; Kopeina2021Caspase2).

In healthy cells, caspase-2 is involved in the DNA damage response, where it helps maintain chromosomal stability by activating p53, a key tumor suppressor protein, and regulating cell cycle checkpoints (Dorstyn2012Caspase2; Kopeina2021Caspase2). It is also implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress responses and can influence transcription factors that activate cellular defenses against oxidative damage (Egorshina2018Caspase2).

Caspase-2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it can translocate due to a nuclear localization signal. It shares features with both initiator and effector caspases, making it unique in its ability to trigger apoptosis and maintain genomic integrity (Kopeina2021Caspase2; BrownSuedel2020Caspase2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP2 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. CASP2 plays a significant role in tumor suppression, and its deficiency or inactivation can lead to increased susceptibility to cancer. Caspase-2 deficiency is linked to enhanced tumorigenesis in several models, including lymphomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mammary tumors, due to increased genomic instability and aneuploidy (Puccini2013Loss; Parsons2013Genetic; Dawar2016Caspase2mediated). In particular, the loss of caspase-2 enhances lymphomagenesis in ATM-deficient mice, indicating a synergistic role with ATM in maintaining genomic stability (Puccini2013Loss).

CASP2 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Bi-allelic truncating variants in CASP2 have been associated with lissencephaly, a condition characterized by smooth brain structure, intellectual disability, and developmental delay. These variants lead to premature stop codons and likely nonsense-mediated decay, affecting brain morphology and function (Uctepe2023Biallelic).

Alterations in CASP2 expression are observed in various cancers, including breast, gastric, and lung cancers, where reduced expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Parsons2013Genetic; Manzl2012PIDDosomeindependent). These findings underscore the critical role of CASP2 in maintaining genomic integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
Caspase-2 (CASP2) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in apoptosis. One significant interaction is with the PIDDosome, a multiprotein complex that includes PIDD, RAIDD, and caspase-2 itself. This complex is implicated in the activation of caspase-2 in response to genotoxic stress, with PIDD and RAIDD facilitating the recruitment and activation of caspase-2 (Tinel2004The).

CASP2 also interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), specifically TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3. TRAF2 is particularly important, as it binds to caspase-2 and promotes its activation through ubiquitylation, stabilizing the active dimer complex and enhancing its apoptotic activity (Robeson2018Dimer‐specific).

Another interaction involves PACAP, a proapoptotic protein that binds to caspase-2 and caspase-9. PACAP acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the activation of these caspases, although it lacks a CARD motif, which is typically involved in caspase interactions (Bonfoco2001Characterization). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of caspase-2 in apoptotic signaling pathways.
