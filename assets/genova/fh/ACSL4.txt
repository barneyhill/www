# ACSL4

## Overview
ACSL4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4, which is integral to lipid metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters, a critical step for the cellular uptake and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids. The protein is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes, where it influences various cellular processes, including signaling, apoptosis, and ferroptosis (Kuwata2019Role; Hou2022ACSL4). ACSL4 is expressed in multiple tissues, notably the brain, where it plays a role in dendritic spine generation and brain development. Its activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as protein kinase C beta II, which phosphorylates ACSL4, enhancing its function in lipid metabolism and ferroptosis (Lei2022PKCβII–ACSL4). Mutations and altered expression of ACSL4 are associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Yu2022Genetic; Jia2023ACSL4Mediated).

## Structure
ACSL4 is a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by converting long-chain fatty acids into acyl-CoA. The protein structure of ACSL4 includes several distinct regions: an NH2 terminus, luciferase-like regions 1 and 2, a linker, and a COOH terminus. The luciferin-like region 2 and COOH terminal are highly conserved across the ACS family, indicating their importance in the catalytic reaction (Hou2022ACSL4).

ACSL4 is known to have splice variant isoforms, specifically ACSL4V1 and ACSL4V2. ACSL4V1 is the more abundant transcript, while ACSL4V2 is brain-restricted and contains an additional 41 amino acids due to an earlier in-frame start codon (ShimbaraMatsubayashi2019Analysis). These variants show similar substrate specificity but differ in their reaction rates (ShimbaraMatsubayashi2019Analysis).

The protein is not considered an integral membrane protein, as it can be extracted from microsomal membranes (Soupene2008Mammalian). ACSL4 is also involved in forming homodimers, as evidenced by its migration as a 140 kDa protein in gel electrophoresis (Ansari2017Characterization). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its lipid environment, which is crucial for accurate kinetic measurements (Soupene2008Mammalian).

## Function
ACSL4 (acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. This conversion is essential for the cellular uptake and incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as arachidonic acid (AA), into various phospholipids, including phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylinositols (Kuwata2019Role). ACSL4 is involved in the activation of arachidonic acid to form AA-CoA, which is then incorporated into phospholipids and triglycerides, effectively trapping AA within cells and influencing lipid metabolism and inflammation (Killion2018A).

The enzyme is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes, where it influences cellular functions such as signaling, apoptosis, and ferroptosis (Hou2022ACSL4). ACSL4 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is involved in dendritic spine generation and brain development, and its deficiency can lead to altered lipid composition affecting processes like ferroptosis and obesity-associated adipocyte dysfunction (Kuwata2019Role). In adipocytes, ACSL4 is implicated in phospholipid remodeling and is associated with adipocyte dysfunction in obesity (Killion2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ACSL4 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, ACSL4 mutations are observed in multiple types, including endometrial carcinoma, melanoma, and sarcoma, with significant impacts on patient prognosis. For instance, ACSL4 mutations in skin cutaneous melanoma are associated with shorter overall survival, while in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, they correlate with longer progression-free survival (Yu2022Genetic). ACSL4 expression levels also vary across cancers, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in colorectal and brain cancers, and low expression associated with poor outcomes in lung and breast cancers (Yu2022Genetic).

In neurodegenerative diseases, ACSL4 is involved in ferroptosis, a form of cell death. In Parkinson's disease, ACSL4 contributes to α-synuclein aggregation, a key pathological feature, and its regulation may offer neuroprotective effects (Jia2023ACSL4Mediated). ACSL4 is also implicated in spinal cord injury, where its inhibition reduces oxidative stress and ferroptosis, suggesting potential therapeutic benefits (Jia2023ACSL4Mediated).

ACSL4 mutations are linked to X-linked intellectual disability, with decreased expression potentially leading to enhanced neuronal apoptosis and disrupted brain development (Kuwata2019Role). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both cancer and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
ACSL4 (acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in lipid metabolism and ferroptosis. A significant interaction is with protein kinase C beta II (PKCβII), which phosphorylates ACSL4 at threonine 328. This phosphorylation is crucial for ACSL4 activation and dimerization, facilitating the synthesis of polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-containing phospholipids necessary for ferroptosis (Lei2022PKCβII–ACSL4).

ACSL4 also interacts with mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT2) in steroidogenic cells, regulating arachidonic acid release and steroid hormone biosynthesis. This interaction is part of an alternative arachidonic acid-releasing pathway, highlighting ACSL4's role in eicosanoid biosynthesis and cancer cell proliferation (Kuwata2019Role).

In the context of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, ACSL4 is involved in thrombin-induced ferroptosis. Thrombin partners with cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α) to release arachidonic acid, which ACSL4 then esterifies into phosphatidylethanolamine, a substrate for iron-induced peroxidation in ferroptosis (Tuo2022Thrombin).

These interactions underscore ACSL4's involvement in critical cellular processes, particularly in lipid metabolism and ferroptosis, through its interactions with other proteins. However, there is no specific information on ACSL4's interactions with nucleic acids in the provided context.
