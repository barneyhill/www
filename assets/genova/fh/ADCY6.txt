# ADCY6

## Overview
ADCY6 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). AC6 is a member of the adenylate cyclase family, characterized by its 12-transmembrane domain structure and its function as a transmembrane enzyme. The protein is widely expressed in various tissues, including the heart, kidney, pancreas, and brain, where it is involved in regulating numerous physiological processes such as cardiac contractility, water homeostasis, and fluid secretion. The activity of AC6 is modulated by interactions with G-proteins, calcium-calmodulin, and other regulatory proteins, and it is subject to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. Mutations in the ADCY6 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cardiac and renal disorders, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Laquerriere2013Mutations; Hanoune2001Regulation; Dessauer2017International).

## Structure
ADCY6, or adenylate cyclase 6, is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The protein is characterized by two transmembrane domains, each comprising six alpha-helices, and two cytoplasmic domains, C1 and C2, which form the catalytic core essential for its enzymatic activity (Devasani2022Expression). The C1 and C2 domains are further divided into subdomains, with C1a/C2a serving as catalytic sites and C1b/C2b as regulatory sites (Devasani2022Expression).

The ADCY6 protein is part of the adenylate cyclase family, which includes 12-transmembrane domain proteins. The catalytic activity of ADCY6 is facilitated by the dimerization of its C1 and C2 domains (Agolini2020Expanding). Specific mutations, such as p.Glu1003Lys and p.Arg1116Cys, affect the C2 domain and are hypothesized to impair the stimulation of ADCY6 by G proteins and the dimerization of the AC domains, impacting its enzymatic function (Agolini2020Expanding).

ADCY6 can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and regulation. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the available context (Devasani2022Expression).

## Function
The ADCY6 gene encodes adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a crucial second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. AC6 is widely expressed in various tissues, including the heart, kidney, pancreas, bone, and brain, where it plays significant roles in regulating physiological processes (Hanoune2001Regulation; Dessauer2017International).

In the heart, AC6 is involved in cardiac function by enhancing beta-adrenergic receptor (bAR) signaling, which is essential for maintaining proper cardiac contractility and responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation (Hanoune2001Regulation; Dessauer2017International). In the kidney, AC6 contributes to water homeostasis and renin secretion, with its absence leading to increased urine output and decreased urine osmolality, resembling nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Dessauer2017International).

AC6 also plays a role in the pancreas, influencing cAMP-dependent amylase and fluid secretion (Dessauer2017International). In the intestine, AC6 forms a complex with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), crucial for CFTR-mediated chloride ion transport and fluid secretion, particularly in response to cholera toxin (Thomas2018AC6). The enzyme's activity is regulated by interactions with G-proteins and calcium-calmodulin, and it is subject to modulation by ion concentrations and covalent modifications such as phosphorylation (GROS2005Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADCY6 gene are associated with several severe conditions, including arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) and lethal congenital contracture syndrome 8 (LCCS8). These disorders are characterized by joint contractures and muscle weakness due to defects in myelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Agolini2020Expanding; Laquerriere2013Mutations). A homozygous missense mutation in ADCY6 has been linked to a lack of myelin in the PNS, despite the presence of Schwann cells, indicating a crucial role in the myelination process (Laquerriere2013Mutations). 

In addition to its role in neuromuscular disorders, ADCY6 is implicated in cardiac and renal conditions. It is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac failure, where its expression in the left ventricle can increase cardiac contractility (Devasani2022Expression). ADCY6-null mice exhibit symptoms resembling Bartter syndrome, such as increased urine output and decreased urine osmolarity, highlighting its importance in renal function (Devasani2022Expression).

Alterations in ADCY6 expression are also linked to cancer. In luminal-like breast cancer, ADCY6 expression is negatively correlated with immune process-related signaling pathways, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis (Li2019Gene). These findings suggest that ADCY6 plays a significant role in various pathophysiological processes.

## Interactions
Adenylyl cyclase 6 (ADCY6) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. ADCY6 interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in intestinal epithelial cells, forming a complex that is crucial for CFTR-dependent fluid secretion, particularly in the context of cholera-induced diarrhea. This interaction occurs at the apical membrane and involves the C2 cytosolic domain of ADCY6, which interacts with CFTR without requiring the canonical C-terminal PDZ motif in CFTR (Thomas2018AC6).

In the cardiovascular system, ADCY6 interacts with various proteins and molecules that regulate its activity. It is fully activated by Gαs and forskolin and can be conditionally activated by Gβγ. It is inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC), calcium ions, Gαi, nitric oxide, protein kinase A (PKA), and P-site inhibitors. The C1-C2 domain of ADCY6 accommodates binding sites for Gαs, Gαi, forskolin, ATP, Mg2+, and other regulatory proteins such as RGAS2, PAM, Snapin, Ric8a, AKAP79, and PHLPP2 (Maghsoudi2024Adenylyl). These interactions are essential for the regulation of ADCY6's activity and its role in cAMP signaling.
