# DAAM1

## Overview
The DAAM1 gene encodes the dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1, a formin protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell polarity, movement, and morphogenesis, primarily through its involvement in the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, also known as the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (Liu2008Mechanism; Schönichen2010Fifteen). DAAM1 is characterized by several conserved domains, including the Formin Homology 1 (FH1) and Formin Homology 2 (FH2) domains, which are crucial for its function in actin assembly and regulation (Lu2007Structure; Higashi2008Biochemical). The protein's activity is regulated through autoinhibition, which is relieved upon interaction with Dishevelled (Dvl) and Rho GTPases, facilitating cytoskeletal rearrangements essential for processes such as filopodia formation and cell shape changes (Liu2008Mechanism). DAAM1's expression and function are also implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Yanai2017Implication; Mei2019A).

## Structure
The DAAM1 protein is characterized by several domains that contribute to its function in actin assembly and regulation. The primary structure of DAAM1 includes conserved domains such as the Formin Homology 1 (FH1) and Formin Homology 2 (FH2) domains, a GTPase-binding domain (GBD), a diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), and a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) (Lu2007Structure; Higashi2008Biochemical). 

The secondary structure of the FH2 domain includes several subdomains: an N-terminal 'lasso' segment, a flexible linker, a globular 'knob' subdomain, a 'coiled-coil' region, and a 'post' subdomain with a C-terminal helical extension (Lu2007Structure). The tertiary structure of the FH2 domain reveals a 'tethered dimer' architecture, where the 'lasso' of each subunit encircles the 'post' subdomain of the other, forming a head-to-tail dimer (Lu2007Structure). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the FH2 domain forms a dimeric structure that occludes its actin-binding surfaces, suggesting an autoinhibited conformation stabilized by β-strand interactions (Lu2007Structure). This conformation is crucial for regulating actin filament nucleation and elongation. The interaction with Rho GTPases, particularly in its GTP-bound form, is essential for the activation of DAAM1, disrupting the autoinhibitory interactions and facilitating actin assembly (Higashi2008Biochemical).

## Function
The DAAM1 gene encodes a formin protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DAAM1 is involved in the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, also known as the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. This pathway is critical for regulating cell movements and establishing cell polarity through modifications of the actin cytoskeleton (Liu2008Mechanism; Schönichen2010Fifteen).

DAAM1 exists in an autoinhibited state due to interactions between its GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). Activation occurs when Dishevelled (Dvl) binds to DAAM1 in response to Wnt signaling, disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction and allowing DAAM1 to interact with Rho-GTP. This interaction leads to Rho activation and subsequent cytoskeletal changes, including stress fiber formation and cell shape changes, which are crucial for processes such as cell polarization and mediolateral orientation during convergent extension movements (Liu2008Mechanism).

DAAM1 is also involved in the formation of filopodia and phagocytic uptake in macrophages, highlighting its role in immune response and cellular morphology (Hoffmann2014Daam1). It is expressed during neuronal tissue development and plays a critical role in axonal morphogenesis (Schönichen2010Fifteen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DAAM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, DAAM1 expression is significantly higher in metastatic tissues compared to non-metastatic ones, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including worse progression-free survival and overall survival rates. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs79036859, in the 3′-UTR of DAAM1, is linked to an increased risk of metastasis. The G genotype of this SNP reduces the binding affinity of miR-208a-5p, a microRNA that normally suppresses DAAM1 expression, leading to enhanced cancer cell migration (Mei2019A).

In melanoma, a somatic eQTL upstream of DAAM1 is recurrently mutated in patients with metastatic disease, resulting in increased DAAM1 mRNA expression. This overexpression enhances cancer cell motility and invasiveness, contributing to tumor progression (Zhang2018A).

DAAM1 is also implicated in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), where its overexpression may contribute to the pathogenesis by affecting the Wnt/PCP pathway, leading to aberrant smooth muscle cell contraction and hypertrophy (Yanai2017Implication). In testicular disorders, DAAM1 expression is altered in conditions like classic seminoma and Sertoli cell-only syndrome, suggesting a role in cancer progression and cytoskeletal organization (Venditti2021Preliminary).

## Interactions
DAAM1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is autoinhibited through interactions between its GTPase-binding domain (GBD) and diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). This autoinhibition is relieved by the binding of Dishevelled (Dvl) to the DAD, which disrupts the GBD-DAD interaction and activates DAAM1, leading to Rho activation and cytoskeletal changes (Liu2008Mechanism). DAAM1 also interacts with components of the cadherin-catenin complex, including E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin, localizing to lateral cell contacts through its binding to E-cadherin (Nishimura2016DAAM1). 

In the context of actin filament bundling and filopodia formation, DAAM1 interacts with fascin, a critical actin-bundling protein. This interaction is essential for DAAM1's localization to filopodial shafts and enhances its binding and stabilization on actin bundles (Jaiswal2013The). In breast cancer cells, DAAM1 interacts with YWHAZ, a protein that colocalizes with DAAM1 and is crucial for microfilament remodeling and RhoA activation. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving microRNA-613, which targets both YWHAZ and DAAM1 to inhibit cancer cell migration (Mei2021YWHAZ).
