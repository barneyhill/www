# CA10

## Overview
The CA10 gene encodes the protein carbonic anhydrase 10, which is a member of the carbonic anhydrase-related proteins. Unlike typical carbonic anhydrases, carbonic anhydrase 10 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of key histidine residues necessary for zinc binding, which are crucial for enzymatic activity (Aspatwar2013An). Despite its lack of catalytic function, carbonic anhydrase 10 plays a significant role in neural development and function, primarily through its interaction with neurexins, which are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules involved in synaptic connections (Sterky2017Carbonic). This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex, suggesting its involvement in synaptic architecture and function (Sterky2017Carbonic). Additionally, CA10 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Aspatwar2013An; Ge2020Methylation).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 10 (CA10) is a protein encoded by the CA10 gene, characterized by a lack of catalytic activity due to the absence of two out of the three histidine residues required for zinc binding, which are essential for the enzymatic function of carbonic anhydrases (Aspatwar2013An). The full-length cDNA clone of CA10 is 2720 base pairs long and encodes a protein of 328 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37.6 kDa (Aspatwar2013An). The protein structure includes a hydrophobic N-terminal extension and polymorphic CCG repeats in its 5′-untranslated region (Aspatwar2013An).

CA10 is a secreted glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Sterky2017Carbonic). It contains four cysteine residues, with Cys60 and Cys244 predicted to form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, while Cys310 is crucial for forming a disulfide bond with neurexins, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions (Sterky2017Carbonic). The protein is evolutionarily conserved and shares high amino acid identity among vertebrates, indicating its ancient origin and potential functional significance (Aspatwar2013An). The CA10 protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant expression in the brain, suggesting a role in neural development and function (Aspatwar2013An).

## Function
The CA10 gene encodes a carbonic anhydrase-related protein that is predominantly expressed in the brain. Unlike typical carbonic anhydrases, CA10 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of key histidine residues necessary for zinc coordination in the catalytic core (Sterky2017Carbonic). CA10 functions as a ligand for neurexins, which are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules involved in synaptic connections. It binds in a cis configuration to neurexins, forming a stable complex that includes intermolecular disulfide bonds, promoting the surface expression of neurexins and facilitating their transport in the secretory pathway (Sterky2017Carbonic).

CA10 is involved in synaptic architecture and function, potentially acting as a neurexin chaperone, facilitating their folding and surface trafficking. It may also function as an adaptor, enabling indirect interactions of neurexins with unknown postsynaptic target molecules, potentially forming novel transsynaptic complexes (Sterky2017Carbonic). Overexpression of CA10 in neurons increases the levels and alters the posttranslational processing of neurexin proteins, suggesting that CA10 may influence synaptic function by modulating neurexin availability and processing (Sterky2017Carbonic). The protein is highly expressed in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral cortex, indicating its significant role in these brain regions (Sterky2017Carbonic).

## Clinical Significance
The CA10 gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to alterations in its expression and methylation. In neurological disorders, CA10 expression is lost in demyelinated regions in models of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, suggesting a role in myelin sheath organization and potential involvement in demyelination disorders (Aspatwar2013An). The presence of CCG repeats in the 5′-untranslated region of CA10 has been associated with neurological disorders, indicating that CA10 could be a candidate gene for neurodegenerative conditions (Aspatwar2010Phylogeny).

In cancer, CA10 mRNA is upregulated in several types, suggesting a role in cancer development (Aspatwar2013An). Specifically, CA10 hypermethylation is associated with an increased risk of the luminal B subtype of breast cancer, indicating its potential as a non-invasive blood marker for predicting breast cancer risk (Ge2020Methylation). In esophageal cancer, CA10 expression levels are correlated with patient prognosis, with low expression associated with a better prognosis (Zhong2020Screening). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CA10 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 10 (CA10) is known to interact specifically with neurexins, which are presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules. CA10 binds directly to a conserved juxtamembranous sequence in both α- and β-neurexins, forming a stable 1:1 complex. This interaction involves a disulfide bond between conserved cysteine residues in CA10 and neurexins, highlighting the specificity and stability of the binding (Sterky2017Carbonic). 

CA10 also interacts with a specific isoform of neurexin, Nrxn1γ, which contains only the CA10-binding region. This interaction is characterized by high affinity and involves specific sequence motifs, such as a threonine-rich region and a cysteine loop, which are essential for CA10 binding (Sterky2017Carbonic). 

The interaction of CA10 with neurexins is not only structural but also functional, as CA10 overexpression in neurons increases the surface trafficking of neurexin isoforms, suggesting a role as a neurexin chaperone or adaptor (Sterky2017Carbonic). These interactions are crucial for synaptic localization and function, as CA10 colocalizes with neurexins at synapses (Sterky2017Carbonic).
