# CIB1

## Overview
CIB1, or calcium and integrin binding 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein belonging to the EF-hand protein family, characterized by its calcium-binding capabilities. The CIB1 protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and cellular signaling pathways. It functions primarily through its interactions with integrins and other signaling molecules, acting as an endogenous inhibitor of integrin αIIbβ3 activation in platelets and modulating endothelial cell function. Structurally, CIB1 contains four EF-hand motifs, with two capable of binding calcium ions, which is crucial for its interaction with target proteins. The protein is involved in several physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac hypertrophy, cancer progression, and immune responses, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Zayed2007CIB1; Yuan2006CIB1; Blamey2005The).

## Structure
CIB1 is a 191-residue protein that belongs to the EF-hand protein family, characterized by helix-loop-helix motifs (Huang2011Solution). It contains four EF-hand motifs, but only EF-III and EF-IV are capable of binding calcium ions (Ca2+) (Yamniuk2004Metal). The protein is composed of distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain lacks functional calcium-binding sites due to missing key aspartic acid residues, while the C-terminal domain contains the functional EF-hand motifs (Blamey2005The).

CIB1 crystallizes as a dimer, although it is expected to interact with physiological partners as a monomer (Blamey2005The). The dimer interface includes an extensive hydrophobic patch, and the dimer is formed in a head-to-tail fashion with hydrophobic interactions from both the N and C termini (Blamey2005The). The C-terminal domain of CIB1 is structurally similar to other EF-hand proteins such as calmodulin and calcineurin B (Blamey2005The).

CIB1 also contains a myristoylated N-terminal extension, which may be involved in target-binding specificity and membrane association (Huang2011Solution; Yamniuk2004Metal). The protein's structure is stabilized upon calcium binding, forming distinct globular units in the N- and C-lobes (Yamniuk2007Domain). The presence of a glutathione (GSH) binding site in the N-terminal domain suggests a potential redox-regulated function (Blamey2005The).

## Function
CIB1 (calcium and integrin binding protein 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with integrins and other signaling molecules. In platelets and megakaryocytes, CIB1 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of integrin αIIbβ3 activation, a critical step in platelet aggregation and hemostasis. It binds to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail, competing with talin, a protein that promotes integrin activation, thereby modulating platelet function and preventing excessive aggregation (Yuan2006CIB1).

CIB1 is also crucial in endothelial cells, where it regulates angiogenesis. It is necessary for endothelial cell sprouting and invasion, influencing the activation of key signaling molecules such as PAK1 and ERK1/2. CIB1 deficiency leads to reduced expression of MMP-2 and diminished response to angiogenic growth factors, impacting microvessel growth (Zayed2007CIB1).

Structurally, CIB1 is an EF-hand-containing protein that binds calcium ions, which is essential for its interaction with target proteins. It is widely expressed and can modulate the function of various effector proteins, including serine/threonine kinases, through its hydrophobic binding pocket (Gentry2005Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CIB1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV), bi-allelic mutations in CIB1 lead to a complete deficiency of the CIB1 protein, which is crucial for keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-papillomaviruses. This deficiency results in increased susceptibility to β-HPV infections, causing cutaneous lesions and, in some cases, early cancer development (de2018The).

CIB1 is also implicated in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Studies have shown that CIB1 deficiency in mice leads to reduced pathological cardiac growth and better cardiac function under pressure overload conditions, suggesting its role in cardiac dysfunction during pressure overload (Heineke2010CIB1).

In cancer, CIB1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with tumor cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Its elevated expression correlates with advanced stages of HCC and lower survival rates, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker (Junrong2011Proteomic; Wang2017The).

CIB1 is also involved in myocardial infarction, where its upregulation is linked to myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Knockdown of CIB1 in a mouse model of myocardial infarction improved cardiac function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2022Calcium).

## Interactions
CIB1 (calcium and integrin binding 1) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts specifically with the integrin αIIb cytoplasmic domain, which is crucial for platelet function and integrin activation. This interaction is mediated through hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving the EF-hand motifs of CIB1, which are known for calcium binding (Naik1997Identification; Huang2011Solution).

CIB1 also binds to apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), where it acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting ASK1 activity. This interaction involves the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1 and is not affected by stress stimuli, indicating a constitutive binding that modulates stress-induced signaling pathways (Yoon2009CIB1).

Additionally, CIB1 can interact with other integrin cytoplasmic tails, such as those of α5 and αV, suggesting a broader role in integrin-mediated signaling. These interactions are driven by hydrophobic forces and are influenced by the presence of calcium and magnesium ions, which affect CIB1's conformation and binding affinity (Freeman2013Identification).
