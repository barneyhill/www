# ABCC6

## Overview
The ABCC6 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (ABCC6) protein, which is a transmembrane transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a crucial role in cellular detoxification and homeostasis by mediating the efflux of ATP, which is subsequently converted into inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in the extracellular space. PPi serves as a key inhibitor of ectopic mineralization, thereby preventing pathological calcification in tissues (Favre2017The; Bisaccia2021Structural). The ABCC6 protein is composed of multiple transmembrane and nucleotide-binding domains, which facilitate its function as an ATP-dependent efflux pump (Ran2018Structural). Mutations in the ABCC6 gene are associated with disorders such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining connective tissue integrity and vascular health (Nitschke2012Generalized; Pfendner2007Mutation).

## Structure
The ABCC6 protein, encoded by the ABCC6 gene, is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It is composed of five distinct domains: three transmembrane domains (TMD0, TMD1, and TMD2) and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) (Bisaccia2021Structural; Ran2018Structural). The transmembrane domains are crucial for the protein's localization and function, with TMD0 containing five transmembrane segments (Bisaccia2021Structural). The nucleotide-binding domains are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, which provide the energy necessary for solute transport (Ran2018Structural).

The NBD1 domain of ABCC6 is characterized by conserved sequences such as the Walker A and B motifs, which are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. It includes three sub-domains: a short antiparallel beta-sheet, an alpha/beta-core, and an alpha-helical subdomain (Ran2018Structural). The alpha-helical subdomain is crucial for interactions with transmembrane domains and contains the LSGGQ signature sequence (Ran2018Structural). The NBD1 domain can form a homodimer in the presence of ATP, although in the full transporter, NBD1 interacts with NBD2 to form a stable heterodimer (Bisaccia2021Structural).

ABCC6 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are important for its trafficking through the secretory pathway (Ran2018Structural). The protein is primarily expressed in the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes and, to a lesser extent, in the proximal tubules of the kidney (Bisaccia2021Structural). The structure and function of ABCC6 can be affected by various mutations, which are associated with diseases such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) (Ran2018Structural).

## Function
The ABCC6 gene encodes a transporter protein that is primarily expressed in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys. This protein is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and functions as an ATP-dependent efflux pump. It plays a crucial role in mediating the efflux of ATP from cells, which is then metabolized into AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) in the extracellular space. PPi acts as a potent inhibitor of ectopic mineralization, helping to prevent pathological calcification in tissues (Favre2017The; Bisaccia2021Structural).

In healthy human cells, ABCC6 is involved in maintaining proper cellular function by activating the purinergic pathway, which regulates the activity of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and prevents ectopic mineralization. The transporter also influences the expression of several genes and proteins involved in cell motility and the cell cycle, such as NT5E, TNAP, Lamin, and CDK1 (Bisaccia2021Structural).

ABCC6 is located in the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes, where it contributes to cellular detoxification and homeostasis by transporting various organic anions and glutathione conjugates (Bisaccia2021Structural; Matsuzaki2005TissueSpecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCC6 gene are primarily associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a genetic disorder characterized by the calcification and fragmentation of elastic fibers in connective tissues, affecting the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system (Pfendner2007Mutation; Bergen2000Mutations). PXE manifests with symptoms such as lax and inelastic skin, angioid streaks in the retina, and mineralization of the internal elastic lamina of midsized arteries, which can lead to complications like hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding (Pfendner2007Mutation).

ABCC6 mutations are also linked to generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), a condition characterized by widespread arterial calcifications and stenosis. Some patients with GACI have biallelic mutations in ABCC6, indicating a broader phenotypic spectrum for these mutations (Nitschke2012Generalized). The overlap in clinical manifestations between PXE and GACI suggests shared pathophysiological mechanisms (Nitschke2012Generalized).

The ABCC6 gene is located on chromosome 16p13.1 and is expressed primarily in the liver, with lower levels in the skin, retina, and blood vessels (Pfendner2007Mutation). Its product, MRP6, functions as a transmembrane transporter, although its substrate specificity remains unknown (Pfendner2007Mutation).

## Interactions
The ABCC6 protein interacts with various proteins and potentially modulates ion channels. The C-terminal end of ABCC6 contains a PDZ-like sequence that can interact with PDZ-domain containing proteins, which act as localized scaffolds essential for the steady-state expression of ABCC6 in membrane structures, although specific interaction partners have not been identified (Verschuere2020From). The L0 loop of ABCC6 is crucial for its localization and transport activity, containing a basolateral sorting signal and contributing to the protein's folding into a cellular sorting-competent state. This loop also interacts with ion channels, potentially modulating Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane (Bisaccia2021Structural). 

ABCC6 may also interact with ATP-sensitive potassium channels (Kir6) and TRPC channels, which are involved in calcium entry pathways. Experiments suggest that ABCC6 expression enhances ATP-induced calcium influx, indicating a potential physical interaction between ABCC6 and calcium channels (Miglionico2016New). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning and localization of the ABCC6 transporter, which is implicated in conditions like pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and drug resistance (Bisaccia2021Structural).
