# PDIK1L

## Overview
PDIK1L is a human gene that encodes the protein PDLIM1 interacting kinase 1 like, which is categorized as a serine/threonine protein kinase. This protein is characterized by its catalytic domain, which is essential for its kinase activity, suggesting a role in phosphorylation processes that regulate various cellular functions. PDIK1L shares significant sequence identity with the human kinase CLIK1, indicating potential involvement in cytoskeletal interactions and signal transduction pathways. The protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus and is expressed across a range of human tissues, including the liver, kidney, and pancreas, highlighting its potential importance in diverse physiological processes. Research into PDIK1L has also explored its interactions with PDZ and LIM domain proteins, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, and its possible implications in diseases such as endometriosis and various cancers (Guo2003Molecular; Greenbaum2021Endometriosis; Boyle2023Multiomic).

## Structure
The PDIK1L gene encodes a protein consisting of 341 amino acids with a molecular mass of 38.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.7 (Guo2003Molecular). The primary structure of PDIK1L includes the catalytic domain characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases, indicating its potential role in kinase activity (Guo2003Molecular). This domain is crucial for its function, as it suggests the protein's involvement in phosphorylation processes.

The PDIK1L protein shows 69% identity with the human kinase CLIK1, which interacts with PDZ and LIM domain proteins, suggesting a possible role in cytoskeletal interactions or signal transduction pathways (Guo2003Molecular). The protein is localized to the nucleus and is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and prostate (Guo2003Molecular).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PDIK1L are not provided, the presence of a serine/threonine kinase domain implies a typical kinase fold, which often includes a bilobed structure with an ATP-binding site. The protein's structural and functional characteristics are further supported by its homology to CLIK1, which associates with the PDZ-LIM protein CLP-36 (Guo2003Molecular).

## Function
The PDIK1L gene encodes a protein that is involved in various molecular processes within human cells. The PDIK1L protein is 341 amino acids long and shares 69% identity with the human kinase CLIK1, which is known to interact with the CLP-36 protein. This interaction suggests that PDIK1L may also be involved in similar pathways, potentially influencing signal transduction or cytoskeletal dynamics (Guo2003Molecular).

PDIK1L is predicted to interact with PDZ and LIM domain proteins, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and are found in proteins with diverse cellular functions. The protein contains the catalytic domain of serine/threonine protein kinases, indicating a role in phosphorylation processes, which are essential for regulating various cellular activities (Guo2003Molecular).

The PDIK1L protein is localized to the nucleus, where it may play a role in regulating gene expression and other nuclear processes. Its interaction with PDZ-LIM proteins suggests a potential involvement in cytoskeletal organization, similar to the role of CLIK1 in relocalizing to actin stress fibers (Guo2003Molecular). The gene is expressed widely in human tissues, including the liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and prostate, indicating its importance in various physiological functions (Guo2003Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The PDIK1L gene has been studied in the context of various cancers, though its clinical significance remains under investigation. In multiple myeloma (MM), PDIK1L was identified as having reduced dependency in cell lines with chromosome 1p deletion, suggesting it may not be an effective therapeutic target for patients with this genetic alteration (Boyle2023Multiomic). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PDIK1L is part of a 16-gene signature related to hypoxia and mitochondrial function, which has been used to develop a prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes. This model stratifies patients into risk groups, with PDIK1L expression levels differing significantly between normal and tumor samples (Zhao2024Identification).

In uveal melanoma, the PDIK1L gene is located in a region of chromosome 1p that is often deleted, but it does not show a strong correlation between deletion and expression, unlike other genes in the region (Anbunathan2019Integrative). In gastric cancer, PDIK1L is noted for its mutation co-occurrence with other genes, although its specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Dai2022Cellular). Overall, while PDIK1L is implicated in various cancers, its precise role and potential as a therapeutic target require further research.

## Interactions
PDIK1L, a human kinase gene, is known to interact with proteins containing PDZ and LIM domains, which are involved in cytoskeletal arrangements and protein-protein interactions (Guo2003Molecular). The protein encoded by PDIK1L shows a significant identity with the human kinase CLIK1, which interacts with the CLP-36 protein, suggesting that PDIK1L may similarly engage in interactions with PDZ-LIM proteins (Guo2003Molecular). These interactions are likely to influence cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction pathways, potentially affecting cellular processes such as cell structure maintenance.

In the context of endometriosis, PDIK1L is expressed in endometriotic cells and stromal fibroblasts, and the presence of antibodies against PDIK1L in the serum of patients suggests its involvement in disease-related interactions (Greenbaum2021Endometriosis). The study of these interactions is ongoing, with the potential for PDIK1L to serve as a biomarker for endometriosis due to its interaction with autoantibodies (Nabeta2010Serum). While the precise nature of PDIK1L's interactions remains under investigation, its role in multiprotein complexes and transient interactions is a significant area of research interest.
