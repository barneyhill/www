# RTN2

## Overview
RTN2 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulon 2, which is a member of the reticulon family of proteins. Reticulon 2 is primarily involved in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, playing a critical role in maintaining ER structure and dynamics. As a transmembrane protein, it is characterized by the presence of a reticulon homology domain (RHD), which facilitates the formation and stabilization of ER tubules and sheets through a mechanism known as 'hydrophobic wedging' (Yang2007The; Chiurchiù2013The). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including RTN2A, RTN2B, and RTN2C, each potentially having distinct cellular roles (Chiurchiù2013The). RTN2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, and autophagy, and is associated with clinical conditions such as hereditary spastic paraplegia type 12 and ovarian cancer (Zheng2022RTN2; Montenegro2012Mutations).

## Structure
The RTN2 protein is characterized by the presence of a reticulon homology domain (RHD), which is crucial for its function in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This domain consists of two long hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic loop, forming hairpin loops that induce membrane curvature through a mechanism known as 'hydrophobic wedging' (Yang2007The; Chiurchiù2013The; Montenegro2012Mutations). The RHD is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular functions (Yang2007The).

RTN2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including RTN2A, RTN2B, and RTN2C, which may have distinct cellular roles and expression patterns (Chiurchiù2013The). The RTN2B isoform is particularly noted for its expression in the brain and its interaction with spastin, a microtubule-severing ATPase, which is important for ER morphology and function (Montenegro2012Mutations).

The protein's structure allows it to oligomerize, contributing to its ability to remodel the ER membrane (Zhang2020Reticulon). RTN2 does not contain a canonical N-terminal ER-localization signal, suggesting that its retention in the ER is due to its structural conformation (Chiurchiù2013The).

## Function
RTN2 (reticulon 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining ER structure and dynamics. In healthy human cells, RTN2 is primarily localized to the ER, where it contributes to the formation and stabilization of ER tubules and sheets through a process known as 'hydrophobic wedging' (Montenegro2012Mutations). This process is essential for the high membrane curvature at tubules and ER sheet edges, which is critical for cellular processes such as protein synthesis and lipid metabolism (Montenegro2012Mutations).

RTN2 interacts with other ER morphogens, including spastin, atlastin-1, and REEP1, forming a network that is vital for maintaining ER morphology (Montenegro2012Mutations). The RTN2B isoform, in particular, is preferentially expressed in the brain and is involved in interactions that support the structural integrity of the ER (Montenegro2012Mutations). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the ER, influencing processes such as membrane trafficking and cellular stress responses (Chiurchiù2013The). RTN2's role in maintaining ER structure is essential for cellular homeostasis and the overall health of the organism (Montenegro2012Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RTN2 gene are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 12 (HSP12), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. Specific mutations identified include a frameshift mutation (c.178insC) and a missense mutation (S367F), both of which are likely pathogenic and found in families with autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. These mutations were absent in control subjects, indicating a strong link to the disease (Montenegro2012Mutations). The RTN2 gene is crucial for maintaining axonal integrity, and its mutations can lead to axonal degeneration, contributing to the clinical features of HSP12, such as lower limb spasticity, weakness, and hyperreflexia (Montenegro2012Mutations).

RTN2 is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where it is identified as a circadian clock gene with elevated expression levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting that RTN2 may play a role in cancer progression and could serve as a prognostic marker (Zheng2022RTN2). The gene's involvement in both neurological and oncological conditions highlights its clinical significance.

## Interactions
RTN2 (reticulon 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics and autophagy. RTN2 interacts with Atg8, a protein involved in autophagy, through multiple Atg8-interacting motifs (AIMs) located in different regions of the protein, including the C-terminal region, cytoplasmic loop, and transmembrane regions. These interactions are essential for RTN2's function as an ER-phagy receptor, facilitating the autophagic turnover of the ER during stress conditions (Zhang2020Reticulon).

RTN2 also interacts with ER-resident proteins such as calnexin, Bip, and protein disulfide isomerase (Pdi), with increased binding observed under ER stress conditions. This suggests a role for RTN2 in sensing and responding to ER stress by recruiting autophagic machinery (Zhang2020Reticulon).

In maize, RTN2 can oligomerize with itself and with Rtn1, another reticulon protein, to induce ER membrane curvature. This interaction was demonstrated using a split-ubiquitin yeast-two hybrid assay (Zhang2020Reticulon). These interactions highlight RTN2's role in maintaining ER morphology and function.
