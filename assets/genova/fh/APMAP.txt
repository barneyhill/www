# APMAP

## Overview
APMAP, or adipocyte plasma membrane associated protein, is a gene that encodes a glycosylated type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within adipose tissue. The protein, also referred to as APMAP, is integral to the plasma membrane and plays a crucial role in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism, influencing the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (Pessentheiner2017APMAP). It is characterized by a large extracellular domain with a six-bladed β-propeller fold, suggesting potential hydrolase activity and calcium binding (Pessentheiner2017APMAP). APMAP is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating metabolic pathways, which are essential for energy balance (Zhong2020Adipose). Additionally, it interacts with proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and amyloid precursor protein processing, highlighting its significance in both metabolic health and neurodegenerative diseases (Gerber2019The; Pessentheiner2017APMAP).

## Structure
The adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) is a glycosylated type II transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 46 kDa. It features a hydrophobic stretch that allows it to span the phospholipid bilayer, classifying it as an integral membrane protein (ALBREKTSEN2001Identification). APMAP has a large extracellular domain consisting of 355 amino acids and a smaller intracellular domain of 41 amino acids, suggesting a significant portion of the protein is extracellular (ALBREKTSEN2001Identification). The extracellular domain includes a six-bladed β-propeller fold, which may indicate potential hydrolase activity and calcium binding (Pessentheiner2017APMAP).

APMAP undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, which is crucial for its function in facilitating viral infections (Haley2020Adipocyte). The protein also contains potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase 2 and protein kinase C, although the functional implications of these sites are not fully understood (ALBREKTSEN2001Identification). The presence of splice variant isoforms has been suggested, with a 42 kDa truncated version identified in adipose tissues, indicating a unique transcriptional regulation in these tissues (Pessentheiner2017APMAP).

## Function
APMAP (adipocyte plasma membrane associated protein) is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, APMAP plays a significant role in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, a process essential for the development and function of adipose tissue (Pessentheiner2017APMAP). This protein is associated with the plasma membrane and is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing metabolic pathways, which are crucial for energy balance in the body (Zhong2020Adipose).

APMAP interacts with various proteins, including lysyl oxidase-like proteins, which are involved in collagen cross-linking and extracellular matrix remodeling. This interaction suggests a role for APMAP in regulating the extracellular matrix in adipose tissue, potentially impacting tissue expansion and metabolic health (Pessentheiner2017APMAP). Additionally, APMAP is part of protein complexes that modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, potentially through the lysosomal-autophagic system, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses and protein degradation pathways (Gerber2019The). These functions highlight APMAP's importance in both adipose tissue function and broader cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the APMAP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), APMAP is involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to AD pathology. APMAP knockout in mice leads to increased Aβ production and aggregation, worsening spatial learning and memory deficits in AD models (Gerber2019The). The gene interacts with proteins such as nicastrin and reticulon-4, which modulate APP processing, and its interactors like HSPA1A and CD-M6PR are noted to negatively regulate Aβ production (Gerber2019The).

APMAP also plays a role in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, where it is necessary for effective viral entry and replication in epithelial and fibroblast cells. Knockout of APMAP significantly reduces HCMV infection, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2019Identification).

In metabolic health, APMAP is linked to obesity and insulin resistance. Its disruption in mice leads to beneficial visceral adipose tissue expansion and improved metabolic phenotypes, such as enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced adipocyte size, indicating a role in 'healthy obesity' (Pessentheiner2017APMAP).

## Interactions
APMAP (adipocyte plasma membrane associated protein) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to interact with components of the γ-secretase complex, such as nicastrin and reticulon-4, which are involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and beta-amyloid (Aβ) production, processes relevant to Alzheimer's disease (Gerber2019The). APMAP also interacts with proteins like HSPA1A and CD-M6PR, which influence APP processing and Aβ levels (Gerber2019The).

In the context of viral infections, APMAP has been identified as a modulator of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. It interacts with the gH/gL glycoprotein complex of HCMV, facilitating viral entry, particularly under acidic conditions (Ye2019Identification). APMAP also plays a role in JC virus (JCPyV) infection in human glial cells, where its presence is crucial for viral entry and infection (Haley2020Adipocyte).

APMAP's interaction with lysyl oxidase-like proteins (LOXL1 and LOXL3) has been studied in the context of adipose tissue biology, where it influences extracellular matrix remodeling and metabolic processes (Pessentheiner2017APMAP). These interactions highlight APMAP's involvement in diverse biological functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
