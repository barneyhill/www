# HEXIM2

## Overview
HEXIM2 is a gene that encodes the protein HEXIM P-TEFb complex subunit 2, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription elongation. This protein is a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, where it functions as a regulatory subunit. HEXIM2 interacts with 7SK small nuclear RNA to form a complex that inhibits the kinase activity of P-TEFb, thereby controlling the transition of RNA polymerase II into productive elongation. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for the proper expression of RNA polymerase II genes. HEXIM2 shares functional similarities with HEXIM1, another member of the HEXIM family, and can compensate for HEXIM1 in P-TEFb complexes, underscoring its importance in transcription regulation (Byers2005HEXIM2). The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a PYNT domain and a leucine zipper, which facilitate its interactions and dimerization, essential for its function (Byers2005HEXIM2; Li2005Analysis).

## Structure
HEXIM2 is a protein that plays a role in regulating transcription elongation by interacting with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) through association with 7SK RNA. The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a positively charged RNA-binding domain and a nuclear localization signal. It also contains a PYNT domain, which is crucial for binding P-TEFb, and a potential leucine zipper that facilitates dimerization (Byers2005HEXIM2).

HEXIM2 forms dimers, a structural feature that is essential for its function. The dimerization is facilitated by a leucine zipper coiled-coil domain located in the carboxyl-terminal region, similar to HEXIM1 (Li2005Analysis). The protein's dimeric nature is important for its ability to form complexes with 7SK RNA and P-TEFb, which are necessary for inhibiting P-TEFb kinase activity (Li2005Analysis).

In terms of post-translational modifications, HEXIM2 may undergo phosphorylation, which could influence its interaction with P-TEFb and its regulatory functions (Byers2005HEXIM2). The protein's molecular mass is predicted to be 32 kDa, but it appears as 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE, suggesting possible post-translational modifications or conformational changes (Byers2005HEXIM2).

## Function
HEXIM2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating transcription elongation by modulating the activity of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in human cells. P-TEFb is essential for the transition of RNA polymerase II into productive elongation, a key step in the expression of RNA polymerase II genes. HEXIM2, similar to its related protein HEXIM1, associates with P-TEFb and the small nuclear RNA 7SK to inhibit P-TEFb's kinase activity. This inhibition is vital for controlling the phosphorylation of serine 2 residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is necessary for transcription elongation (Byers2005HEXIM2).

HEXIM2 is expressed in various human cell lines, including HeLa, Jurkat, and HEK 293 cells, and can compensate for HEXIM1 in P-TEFb complexes when HEXIM1 is knocked down. This suggests that HEXIM2 can substitute for HEXIM1 in maintaining the large P-TEFb complex, highlighting its role in transcription regulation (Byers2005HEXIM2). The presence of two HEXIM proteins in mammals, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2, may allow for more diverse control of P-TEFb, reflecting the need for intricate regulation during development and in differentiated tissues (Byers2005HEXIM2).

## Interactions
HEXIM2 interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex, which is essential for regulating transcription elongation. HEXIM2 can bind to 7SK small nuclear RNA, forming a complex that inhibits the kinase activity of P-TEFb. This interaction is crucial for controlling gene expression by modulating RNA polymerase II activity (Byers2005HEXIM2).

HEXIM2, similar to HEXIM1, can replace HEXIM1 in the large P-TEFb complex in vivo, maintaining the complex and controlling P-TEFb activity. This suggests that HEXIM2 plays a significant role in regulating transcription elongation (Byers2005HEXIM2). The PYNT domain of HEXIM2 is involved in the interaction with P-TEFb but not in RNA binding, indicating its role in protein-protein interactions (Byers2005HEXIM2).

HEXIM2 forms complexes with 7SK RNA and P-TEFb, inhibiting P-TEFb's kinase activity in a 7SK-dependent manner. It binds to P-TEFb, which contains either cyclin T2a or T1, with similar affinity as HEXIM1 (Byers2005HEXIM2). HEXIM2 is also a better substrate for phosphorylation by P-TEFb compared to HEXIM1, which may contribute to its regulatory function (Byers2005HEXIM2).
