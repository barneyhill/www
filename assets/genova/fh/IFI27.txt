# IFI27

## Overview
Interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, immune response, and apoptosis. The protein, also referred to as ISG12, is highly inducible by interferon-alpha and plays a crucial role in the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase of the cell cycle, particularly in human epidermal keratinocytes (Hsieh2015IFI27). IFI27 is implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms, where it can inhibit viral replication, such as in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, by targeting viral promoters (Ullah2021Antiviral). Additionally, IFI27 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in breast cancer cells, influencing its nuclear export and degradation, thereby affecting the expression of ERα target genes (CervantesBadillo2020IFI27ISG12). The protein's ability to destabilize the mitochondrial membrane suggests a role in sensitizing cells to apoptotic stimuli, contrasting with other family members that stabilize mitochondrial function (Cheriyath2011Emerging).

## Function
IFI27, also known as interferon alpha inducible protein 27, plays a significant role in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in human epidermal keratinocytes. It is highly inducible by interferon-alpha and is involved in the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Knockdown of IFI27 in keratinocytes results in S-phase arrest, which is associated with increased phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and elevated expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This leads to reduced formation of the cyclin A/CDK1 complex, impairing the transition to the G2 phase (Hsieh2015IFI27).

IFI27 is also implicated in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense. It is a mitochondrial protein that may sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli by destabilizing the mitochondrial membrane, promoting apoptosis in response to certain stimuli (Cheriyath2011Emerging). In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, IFI27 has been shown to inhibit HBV replication and gene expression by targeting specific viral promoters, highlighting its potential as an antiviral agent (Ullah2021Antiviral).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFI27 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, IFI27 plays a significant inhibitory role in viral replication and gene expression. Overexpression of IFI27 leads to a reduction in HBV mRNA, DNA levels, and viral protein secretion, suggesting its potential as an antiviral agent for HBV treatment. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of IFI27 enhances HBV replication, indicating its critical role in controlling the virus (Ullah2021Antiviral).

IFI27 is also implicated in immune responses to viral infections and immunological disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. It is highly inducible by type I interferons, and its expression can continue to accumulate even after the removal of interferons. This gene is involved in mitochondrial function, potentially affecting membrane integrity and enhancing apoptosis, which may support the antiviral activities of interferons by promoting cell death in infected cells (Cheriyath2011Emerging).

In cancer, IFI27 has been identified as an estrogen-induced transcript and is associated with poor prognosis in some cases. Its role in immune regulation can influence disease progression and treatment responses (Cheriyath2011Emerging).

## Interactions
IFI27, also known as ISG12, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, IFI27 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), primarily in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. This interaction reduces ERα's nuclear protein levels and transcriptional activity by facilitating its interaction with CRM1/XPO1, a major receptor for nuclear export. This leads to the export and degradation of ERα, thereby reducing the expression of ERα target genes (CervantesBadillo2020IFI27ISG12).

IFI27 is also implicated in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, where its knockdown affects cell cycle progression by altering the expression of cyclins and the formation of the cyclin A/CDK1 complex. This interaction is crucial for the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Hsieh2015IFI27).

In the context of innate immunity, IFI27 is a mitochondrial protein that may sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli by destabilizing the mitochondrial membrane. This function contrasts with another FAM14 family member, G1P3, which stabilizes mitochondrial function and opposes apoptosis (Cheriyath2011Emerging).
