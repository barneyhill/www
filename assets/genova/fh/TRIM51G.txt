# TRIM51G

## Overview
The TRIM51G gene encodes the protein tripartite motif-containing 51G, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are involved in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and innate immunity. TRIM51G, like other TRIM proteins, is implicated in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, a process critical for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The specific biological roles and mechanisms of TRIM51G remain under investigation, but its involvement in cellular pathways suggests potential implications in disease states and therapeutic applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
