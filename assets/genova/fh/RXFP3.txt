# RXFP3

## Overview
The RXFP3 gene encodes the relaxin family peptide receptor 3, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily expressed in the brain. This receptor is part of the class A neuropeptide receptor family and is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, which facilitate its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane. RXFP3 is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of stress responses, feeding behavior, and energy balance, particularly through its actions in the hypothalamus. The receptor's interaction with its ligand, relaxin-3, involves specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that are crucial for its activation and function. RXFP3's signaling pathways influence neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release, impacting behaviors related to stress and appetite. Additionally, RXFP3 has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders and aging-related conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Leysen2022The; Zhang2014The; Ganella2013Relaxin3RXFP3).

## Structure
RXFP3, or relaxin family peptide receptor 3, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of class A neuropeptide receptors (Shabanpoor2012Minimization). The receptor's primary structure includes a short N-terminal domain and a conserved WxxExxxD motif, which is critical for ligand interaction (Wei2017Development). The extracellular loops of RXFP3 form the primary ligand-binding site, interacting with specific residues in the relaxin-3 B-chain (Bathgate2013Elucidation).

The secondary and tertiary structures of RXFP3 have been modeled using molecular modeling techniques, utilizing the NMR solution structure of H3 relaxin and the crystal structure of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. This modeling suggests that the H3 relaxin B-chain helix interacts with the extracellular loops EL1 and EL2 of RXFP3, forming electrostatic interactions crucial for binding and activation (Bathgate2013Elucidation).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are typical for GPCRs like RXFP3, although specific modifications for RXFP3 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor is primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a role in modulating stress and feeding behaviors (Wei2017Development).

## Function
The relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in modulating various physiological processes. RXFP3 is involved in the regulation of stress responses, feeding behavior, and energy balance, particularly through its actions in the hypothalamus. It influences appetite and body weight by modulating neurotransmitter release and neuronal activity in key hypothalamic regions such as the paraventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus (Ganella2013Relaxin3RXFP3).

At the molecular level, RXFP3 activation inhibits intracellular cAMP accumulation and activates the ERK1/2 pathway, which affects ion channels and neuronal excitability. This signaling is crucial for synchronizing hippocampal neuron networks and regulating spatial memory and exploratory activity (Ma2016Distribution). RXFP3 also interacts with proteins involved in oxidative stress responsiveness, such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress (Leysen2022The).

RXFP3 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against aging-related damage by modulating DNA damage response and repair processes. It is involved in the regulation of the nitric oxide generation system, which can attenuate oxidative damage (Leysen2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RXFP3 gene have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and aging-related conditions. Polymorphisms in RXFP3 have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. A specific mutation in the chromosome 5p locus, where the RXFP3 gene is located, has been linked to familial schizophrenia, suggesting a role in cognitive impairment and negative symptoms of the disorder (Kumar2016Relaxin’; Smith2014Relaxin3RXFP3).

In Alzheimer's disease, alterations in RXFP3 receptor levels have been associated with depressive symptoms, and RXFP3 receptor-like immunoreactivity is up-regulated in the parietal cortex of depressed patients (Kumar2016Relaxin’). The RXFP3 gene is also involved in aging-related diseases through its role in epigenetic regulation and metabolic processes. Alterations in its methylation status have been linked to aging-related changes in cancers, such as endometrial and cervical malignancies (Leysen2022The).

RXFP3 is implicated in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, which is crucial for preventing aging-associated proteinopathies like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease (Leysen2022The). Additionally, RXFP3 hypermethylation is associated with endometrial carcinoma, correlating with tumor recurrence and disease-free survival (Huang2010Promoter).

## Interactions
RXFP3, a G-protein-coupled receptor, primarily interacts with its ligand relaxin-3 through specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The receptor contains a critical negatively charged EXXXD motif, with Glu141 and Asp145 residues playing a significant role in binding. These residues interact with the positively charged arginine residues B12Arg, B16Arg, and B26Arg of relaxin-3, forming essential pairwise interactions crucial for receptor activation (Zhang2014The).

Hydrophobic interactions also contribute to RXFP3's function. The extracellular leucine residues Leu246 and Leu248 of RXFP3 interact with the isoleucine residues B15Ile and B19Ile of relaxin-3 and its chimeric ligands. These interactions are vital for ligand binding and receptor activation, as demonstrated by mutagenesis studies (Li2020Hydrophobic).

RXFP3's interactions with relaxin-3 are crucial for modulating signaling pathways involved in physiological processes such as stress response and food intake regulation. These interactions highlight the receptor's potential as a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders (Li2020Hydrophobic; Zhang2014The).
