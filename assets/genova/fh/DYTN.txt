# DYTN

## Overview
The DYTN gene encodes the protein dystrotelin, which is a member of the dystrophin family of proteins. Dystrotelin is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells and is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein. It plays a crucial role in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, thereby contributing to cellular stability and function. Mutations in the DYTN gene have been associated with various muscular disorders, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology. The protein's interactions and pathways are still under investigation, but it is believed to be part of a complex network that includes other dystrophin-related proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC).
