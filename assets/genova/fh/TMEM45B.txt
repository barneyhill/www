# TMEM45B

## Overview
TMEM45B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 45B, which is part of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular processes that involve membrane-spanning domains, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including signaling and transport. The expression of TMEM45B has been studied in the context of several cancers, where it has been found to have differential expression patterns that correlate with disease progression and prognosis. For instance, in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, TMEM45B expression levels are associated with distinct clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis (Gu2021Differential; Metri2017Identification; MolinaPinelo2014MicroRNADependent).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM45B has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), TMEM45B is downregulated compared to adenocarcinoma. This downregulation is associated with the differential expression of microRNAs, such as miR-378 and miR-422a, which bind to the 3' UTR of TMEM45B, suggesting a role in the molecular signature distinguishing SCC from adenocarcinoma (MolinaPinelo2014MicroRNADependent).

In melanoma, TMEM45B is part of a gene signature that differentiates metastatic from primary melanoma. It is generally downregulated in metastatic melanoma, and its expression is associated with a reduced hazard of dying from melanoma, indicating a potential protective role (Metri2017Identification).

In prostate cancer, TMEM45B is upregulated and associated with a higher risk of relapse. It is part of a multigene panel that predicts prostate cancer relapse risk, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Gu2021Differential).

These findings suggest that TMEM45B plays a significant role in cancer biology, with its expression levels potentially serving as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in various cancers.
