# GTF3C4

## Overview
GTF3C4 is a gene that encodes the protein known as general transcription factor IIIC subunit 4, which is a critical component of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of tRNA and other small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III, contributing to essential cellular processes such as protein synthesis and cell growth. The GTF3C4 protein is characterized by its DNA-binding domains, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and its involvement in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex. Additionally, GTF3C4 interacts with the condensin II complex, influencing chromosomal processes and genome architecture. The gene is located on chromosome 9q34 and is expressed as a single mRNA species, highlighting its significance as a single-copy sequence in the human genome (Yuen2017Condensin; Purrello2001Genes).

## Structure
GTF3C4 is a component of the general transcription factor IIIC complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of RNA polymerase III. The protein structure of GTF3C4 includes specific domains that are essential for its function, such as DNA-binding domains. These domains facilitate the interaction of the protein with DNA, which is critical for its role in transcription regulation. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of GTF3C4 can exist, potentially altering its functional properties and affecting its role in transcription. These variations in the protein structure and modifications can have significant implications for its function within the transcription factor IIIC complex.

## Function
GTF3C4 is a component of the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of tRNA and other small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. In healthy human cells, GTF3C4 is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the transcriptional regulation necessary for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Purrello2001Genes). The GTF3C4 gene is localized to chromosome 9q34 and is expressed as a single mRNA species of 4600 bp, indicating its role as a single-copy sequence in the human genome (Purrello2001Genes).

The TFIIIC complex, which includes GTF3C4, is essential for the expression of growth-related small cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs, and it is involved in critical signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Purrello2001Genes). The activity of these transcription factors is regulated by specific transcription factors like p53 and pRb, which can repress their function to prevent the proliferation of cells with potentially dangerous mutations (Purrello2001Genes). GTF3C4's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenesis.

## Interactions
GTF3C4 is a component of the TFIIIC complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of RNA polymerase III genes. It is involved in the physical interaction with the condensin II complex, a key player in chromosomal processes during interphase. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments and the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) method. GTF3C4, as part of TFIIIC, is necessary for the localization of condensin II at tRNA genes and other sites termed condensin TFIIIC sites (CTS) (Yuen2017Condensin).

The TFIIIC complex, including GTF3C4, is also involved in the recruitment of condensin II to the genome, contributing to gene expression and genome architecture. This interaction is independent of CTCF, a protein that does not associate with condensin II or TFIIIC (Yuen2017Condensin). The TFIIIC complex serves as a sequence-specific anchoring protein for condensin II, facilitating its localization alongside the epigenetic mark H3K4me3 (Yuen2017Condensin). These interactions highlight the role of GTF3C4 in maintaining high levels of expression in dense gene clusters, such as the histone gene cluster, and suggest its involvement in genome architecture and gene expression regulation (Yuen2017Condensin).
