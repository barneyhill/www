# RGPD3

## Overview
RGPD3, or RANBP2-like and GRIP domain containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The RGPD3 gene is located on chromosome 2 and is part of a family of genes that share structural similarities with the RANBP2 protein, which is known for its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The protein encoded by RGPD3 contains a GRIP domain, which is typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting its potential role in cellular signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of the RGPD3-encoded protein are not fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to participate in intracellular transport and signaling due to its structural domains (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of RGPD3 in health and disease.
