# ITGA10

## Overview
The ITGA10 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 10, a member of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that play a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling. Integrin subunit alpha 10, when paired with the beta 1 subunit, forms the integrin α10β1 receptor, which is primarily involved in binding collagen type II, a key component of cartilage. This receptor is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage, highlighting its importance in chondrocyte activity and cartilage development (Lehnert1999The; Nurzat2021Identification). The ITGA10 gene is located on chromosome 1q21 and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including osteosarcoma and chondrodysplasia, underscoring its clinical significance (Li2021ZIP10; Kyöstilä2013Canine).

## Structure
The ITGA10 gene encodes the integrin α10 subunit, which is part of the integrin family of proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The α10 subunit is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. It shares significant sequence similarity with other integrin subunits, particularly α11, α1, and α2, with the I-domain and transmembrane domain showing high similarity to α11 (Lehnert1999The). The α10 subunit has a unique GFFAH sequence in its cytoplasmic domain, differing from the typical GFF(R/K)R motif found in other integrins (Lehnert1999The). 

The α10 subunit contains an RGD sequence at its N-terminus, which is a common integrin-binding domain, facilitating interactions with extracellular matrix components (Lehnert1999The). The protein forms a receptor complex by pairing with the β1 subunit, known as integrin α10β1, which is involved in binding collagen type II (Lehnert1999The). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may affect its function and stability, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. Splice variants may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, but specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided information.

## Function
ITGA10 encodes the integrin subunit alpha 10, which is a component of integrin receptors involved in cell adhesion and integrin-mediated signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, ITGA10 primarily functions in cartilage, where it plays a crucial role in chondrocyte function, contributing to cartilage development and maintenance. These integrin receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins that facilitate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular interactions and tissue integrity (Nurzat2021Identification).

The molecular activities of ITGA10 include its involvement in cell adhesion processes, which are critical for the structural organization of tissues. ITGA10's role in integrin-mediated signaling pathways suggests its participation in transmitting signals from the extracellular environment to the cell interior, influencing cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Gong2019Diagnostic). Although specific details about ITGA10's molecular function in healthy cells are limited, its expression and activity in cartilage highlight its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of this tissue type (Nurzat2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGA10 gene have been linked to chondrodysplasia, a condition characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as shorter limbs and disproportionate dwarfism. In Norwegian Elkhounds and Karelian Bear Dogs, a specific truncating mutation in ITGA10 results in the absence of the integrin alpha 10 protein, leading to significant skeletal defects, including shorter long bones and delayed ossification. This mutation is associated with a recessive inheritance pattern and is specific to these breeds, with a notable carrier frequency (Kyöstilä2013Canine).

In humans, alterations in ITGA10 expression have been implicated in osteosarcoma, where increased ITGA10 levels contribute to tumor proliferation and chemoresistance. This is mediated through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting ITGA10's role in cancer progression (Li2021ZIP10).

The ITGA10 gene is located on chromosome 1q21, a region associated with various diseases, including open-angle glaucoma and familial partial lipodystrophy. While the specific role of ITGA10 mutations in these conditions is not detailed, its chromosomal location suggests potential clinical significance (Lehnert1999The).

## Interactions
ITGA10, or integrin subunit alpha 10, is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. ITGA10 is a part of the integrin family, which are transmembrane receptors that typically interact with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. This interaction is significant in the context of osteosarcoma, where ITGA10 is implicated in the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, contributing to cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Li2021ZIP10).

In osteoblast differentiation, ITGA10 is regulated by the transcription factor Kaiso, which binds directly to the ITGA10 promoter. This interaction influences the PI3K/AKT pathway, affecting osteoblast differentiation and mineralization (Tong2021Kaiso). The binding of Kaiso to the ITGA10 promoter has been confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a direct regulatory role (Tong2021Kaiso).

ITGA10 is also involved in the tumor microenvironment of skin cutaneous melanoma, where its expression is upregulated. This upregulation is associated with cancer progression and metastasis, suggesting that ITGA10 may interact with other proteins involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways (Nurzat2021Identification).
