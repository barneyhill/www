# IL17A

## Overview
IL17A is a gene that encodes the cytokine interleukin 17A, a member of the interleukin-17 family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The IL17A gene is responsible for the production of the interleukin 17A protein, which is primarily involved in mediating inflammatory responses and maintaining the integrity of barrier tissues such as skin and mucosal surfaces. Interleukin 17A is a cytokine that functions by interacting with the IL-17 receptor complex, initiating signaling pathways that lead to the recruitment of immune cells and the production of antimicrobial peptides. This cytokine is produced by various immune cells, including Th17 cells, and is crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity. Dysregulation of IL17A expression is associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Cua2010Innate; Huangfu2023The; McGeachy2019The).

## Structure
The IL-17A protein is a member of the interleukin-17 cytokine family, characterized by a cysteine-knot fold, a structural motif shared with IL-17F. This fold is formed by two pairs of antiparallel β-strands bundled through disulfide bridges, although IL-17A lacks the third disulfide bridge found in other proteins with this fold, replaced by conserved serine residues (Zhang2011Structure). The primary structure of IL-17A consists of 177 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide and an N-linked glycosylation site at Asn45, which does not significantly alter the protein's structure (Liu2019Structural; Zhang2011Structure).

The tertiary structure of IL-17A involves the formation of homodimers, stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds, and features a unique interaction with the IL-17RA receptor, where a loop of IL-17RA slots into the groove of the IL-17F homodimer interface (Liu2019Structural; Zhang2011Structure). The quaternary structure includes both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms with IL-17F, with the heterodimer being less active (Zhang2011Structure). IL-17A's structure has been studied in complex with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, which block the ligand-receptor interaction by targeting an epitope near the receptor binding groove (Zhang2011Structure).

## Function
IL17A, or interleukin 17A, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune responses, particularly in maintaining the integrity of barrier surfaces such as skin and mucosal tissues. In healthy human cells, IL17A is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, primarily by inducing the production of chemokines like CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8 (IL-8), which recruit myeloid cells, including neutrophils, to sites of infection or injury (McGeachy2019The). It also stimulates the production of antimicrobial peptides such as β-defensins, S100A8, and lipocalin 2, which are crucial for defending against extracellular fungal and bacterial pathogens (McGeachy2019The).

IL17A is produced by various immune cells, including Th17 cells, γδ T cells, and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, and acts on non-hematopoietic cells to induce acute immune defenses (Cua2010Innate). It is essential for maintaining mucosal barrier integrity by enhancing the synthesis of tight junction proteins and promoting the release of antimicrobial peptides, thereby preventing the entry of pathogens and maintaining homeostasis (Cua2010Innate). IL17A's role in tissue repair is also evident in its ability to promote wound closure and keratinocyte proliferation in skin models (McGeachy2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL17A gene are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has been linked to specific polymorphisms in the IL17A gene. Variants such as rs3819025, rs8193036, rs2275913, and IVS1+18G>A are associated with increased susceptibility to these conditions. These genetic variations may influence IL-17A expression levels, contributing to disease predisposition (Kim2011Genetic).

In psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, IL-17A plays a significant role in the inflammatory processes. IL-17A inhibitors, such as secukinumab and ixekizumab, have been used to treat these conditions, although they can have side effects, including infections (Taams2018IL17; Huangfu2023The). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), IL-17A levels correlate with disease severity, and therapies targeting IL-17 pathways show promise (Huangfu2023The).

IL-17A is also implicated in cancer progression, where high levels are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. It promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by remodeling the tumor microenvironment and inducing immune tolerance (Huangfu2023The).

## Interactions
IL17A, or interleukin 17A, is a cytokine that primarily interacts with the IL-17 receptor complex, which includes the subunits IL-17RA and IL-17RC. This interaction is crucial for initiating downstream signaling pathways that lead to inflammatory responses. IL17A binds to IL-17RA with high affinity, and this binding is essential for the recruitment of adaptor proteins like ACT1, which subsequently activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Rex2022A; Ely2009Structural).

IL17A can form homodimers or heterodimers with IL-17F, and these dimers interact with the IL-17RA receptor. The IL-17A/F heterodimer presents two distinct binding surfaces to IL-17RA, mimicking both IL-17A and IL-17F, which complicates the receptor's ability to differentiate between the two (Goepfert2017The).

Inhibitory interactions have been explored using peptide inhibitors such as the high affinity peptide (HAP), which binds to IL17A and blocks its interaction with IL-17RA. HAP achieves this by forming a β-strand that inserts between IL-17A monomers and an α helix that directly obstructs IL-17RA binding (Liu2016Inhibiting). These interactions highlight the potential for developing therapeutic agents targeting IL17A-mediated pathways.
