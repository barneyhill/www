# LGI2

## Overview
The LGI2 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat LGI family member 2, which is part of the LGI family that includes LGI1, LGI3, and LGI4. This family of proteins is characterized by leucine-rich repeats and is known to interact with the ADAM22 receptor, which plays a role in synaptic transmission. LGI2, like its family members, is implicated in neurological functions, although its specific role is less well-defined compared to LGI1. The protein's structural features suggest potential involvement in neuronal signaling pathways, and it may share functional similarities with LGI1 due to conserved residues that interact with ADAM22 (Yamagata2018Structural). Despite its potential significance in neurological contexts, the clinical implications of LGI2, particularly in human epilepsy, remain to be fully elucidated (AyerdiIzquierdo2006Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LGI2 gene have been associated with neurological conditions, particularly epilepsy. In the Lagotto Romagnolo canine breed, a truncation mutation in LGI2 that affects its secretion is linked to focal-onset epilepsy, suggesting a potential role for LGI2 in similar human conditions (Yamagata2018Structural). However, studies in human populations have not found a significant association between LGI2 polymorphisms and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTE). A genetic analysis conducted by Ayerdi-Izquierdo et al. identified several variants in the LGI2 gene, but none showed cosegregation with the disease in the studied pedigrees, nor were they associated with the epileptic phenotype in a case-control study involving Italian sporadic LTE patients and healthy controls (AyerdiIzquierdo2006Genetic).

The LGI2 gene is part of a family that includes LGI1, LGI3, and LGI4, which are known to interact with ADAM22, a receptor involved in synaptic transmission. Many of the ADAM22-interacting residues in LGI1 are conserved in LGI2, indicating a potential role for LGI2 in neuronal contexts through similar interactions (Yamagata2018Structural). Despite these findings, the specific clinical significance of LGI2 mutations in humans remains less clear compared to other LGI family members.
