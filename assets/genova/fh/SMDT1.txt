# SMDT1

## Overview
SMDT1 is a gene that encodes the single-pass membrane protein with aspartate-rich tail 1, also known as EMRE (Essential MCU REgulator). This protein is a critical regulatory component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, which is responsible for the transport of calcium ions across the mitochondrial membrane. The SMDT1 protein is characterized by a single transmembrane domain and an aspartate-rich C-terminal tail, which are essential for its function in stabilizing interactions within the MCU complex and preventing calcium ion leakage. By facilitating the interaction between the calcium-conducting subunit MCU and the regulatory subunits MICU1 and MICU2, SMDT1 plays a vital role in maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for cellular energy production and metabolic regulation (Sancak2013EMRE; Marchi2014The).

## Structure
SMDT1, also known as EMRE (Essential MCU REgulator), is a single-pass membrane protein that is a crucial component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. The protein features a single transmembrane domain and an aspartate-rich C-terminal tail, which is highly conserved and essential for its function (Vishnyakova2019Gestation; Marchi2014The). This structure allows SMDT1 to interact with other components of the MCU complex, such as MICU1 and MICU2, facilitating the regulation of calcium ion transport into the mitochondria (Duan2019Computational).

SMDT1 plays a significant role in stabilizing the interaction between MCU and MICU1, preventing calcium ion leakage through the MCU channel (Vishnyakova2019Gestation). The protein's structure is integral to its function in maintaining the proper operation of the MCU complex, which is vital for mitochondrial calcium uptake and cellular calcium homeostasis. While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of SMDT1 are not provided, its role as a regulatory subunit highlights its importance in the overall architecture and function of the MCU complex (Xie2019SMDT1driven).

## Function
The SMDT1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, which is essential for calcium ion transport across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein, also known as EMRE (essential MCU regulator), plays a pivotal role in regulating calcium uptake into mitochondria, a process vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing cell death (Vishnyakova2019Gestation; Duan2019Computational). SMDT1 functions as a regulatory subunit that bridges the calcium-sensing proteins MICU1 and MICU2 with the calcium-conducting subunit MCU, facilitating the proper functioning of the uniporter complex (Duan2019Computational).

In healthy human cells, SMDT1 is primarily active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake. This regulation is crucial for mitochondrial functions, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which are essential for ATP production and overall cellular metabolism (Vishnyakova2019Gestation). The protein's activity is also linked to maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, which are important for normal cellular processes and energy production (Xie2019SMDT1driven).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SMDT1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), low expression of SMDT1 is associated with poor patient outcomes. The gene's downregulation may contribute to cancer progression by affecting mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis in PDAC cells with reduced SMDT1 expression (Xie2019SMDT1driven).

In the context of neuropsychiatric disorders, increased expression of SMDT1 in the prenatal brain has been linked to a higher risk of schizophrenia. This association appears to be specific to fetal development, as it has not been observed in studies using adult brain tissue (Hall2020Ciseffects).

SMDT1 is also involved in mitochondrial calcium regulation, which is crucial during pregnancy. Altered expression of SMDT1 and other mitochondrial calcium uniporter subunits in the placenta and myometrium has been associated with preterm birth, suggesting a role in placental dysfunction and gestational complications (Vishnyakova2019Gestation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SMDT1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SMDT1, also known as EMRE, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. It plays a significant role in facilitating the interaction between the calcium-conducting subunit MCU and the calcium-sensing regulatory subunits MICU1 and MICU2. This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of the uniporter complex, enabling calcium uptake into mitochondria (Sancak2013EMRE).

SMDT1 is involved in stabilizing the interaction between MCU and MICU1, preventing calcium ion leakage through the MCU channel under baseline conditions (Vishnyakova2019Gestation). The absence of SMDT1 disrupts the uniporter channel activity, even if MCU expression and oligomerization remain intact, highlighting its indispensable role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the uniporter complex (Sancak2013EMRE).

In the context of cancer, SMDT1 has been shown to interact with proteins involved in apoptosis. Overexpression of SMDT1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells leads to increased apoptosis, characterized by changes in pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic protein levels, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathways (Xie2019SMDT1driven).
