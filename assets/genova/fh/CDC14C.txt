# CDC14C

## Overview
CDC14C is a gene that encodes the protein cell division cycle 14C, a member of the CDC14 family of dual-specificity phosphatases. These phosphatases are integral to cell cycle regulation, particularly in the processes of mitotic exit and cytokinesis. The CDC14C protein functions by dephosphorylating specific substrates, thereby facilitating the transition from mitosis to the G1 phase and maintaining genomic stability. It is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, underscoring its role in ensuring proper cell division and preventing genomic instability. Disruptions in CDC14C function, due to mutations or altered expression, have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, highlighting its importance in cellular proliferation and genomic integrity (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
CDC14C is a member of the CDC14 family of dual-specificity phosphatases, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation. This protein is involved in the processes of mitotic exit and cytokinesis by dephosphorylating specific substrates. CDC14C is active in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of cell division and the maintenance of genomic stability. By dephosphorylating its targets, CDC14C helps ensure the proper progression and completion of the cell cycle, which is essential for healthy cell proliferation and function. Its activity is vital for the orderly transition from mitosis to the G1 phase of the cell cycle, preventing genomic instability that could lead to cellular dysfunction or disease.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CDC14C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. CDC14C encodes a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Disruptions in its normal function can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and genomic instability, which are key factors in tumorigenesis. Alterations in CDC14C expression or mutations can interfere with its interactions, potentially contributing to the development and progression of cancer by allowing cells to bypass critical cell cycle checkpoints. This can result in unchecked cell division and the accumulation of genetic mutations, further promoting cancerous growth. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which CDC14C mutations or expression changes contribute to disease could provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.
