# SLC25A31

## Overview
SLC25A31 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 31, which is a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the transport of adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is a member of the adenine nucleotide translocases (ANTs) family and plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the exchange of cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP, a process essential for ATP synthesis and energy homeostasis (Palmieri2013The). SLC25A31 is characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a funnel-shaped cavity that is crucial for its function (Palmieri2013The). The protein is selectively expressed in testicular germ cells and is vital for spermatogenesis, as its deficiency can lead to infertility and early meiotic arrest in male germ cells (Palmieri2013The).

## Structure
SLC25A31, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, is characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices are arranged in a counter-clockwise order, forming a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol, which is closed on the matrix side by a salt-bridge network formed by charged residues of the signature motifs PX[D/E]XX[K/R]X[K/R] (Palmieri2013The). The protein shares a lower degree of identical amino acids (66-68%) with human AAC1-3, indicating some structural divergence within the ADP/ATP carrier subfamily (Palmieri2013The).

The SLC25A31 protein is involved in the electrogenic exchange of cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP, with high specificity and sensitivity to inhibitors like carboxyatractyloside and bongkrekic acid. It is selectively expressed in testicular germ cells, and its deficiency in mice leads to infertility and early meiotic arrest of male germ cells, highlighting its essential role in spermatogenesis (Palmieri2013The). The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in cellular metabolism and homeostasis, particularly in the context of mitochondrial energy exchange processes. The specific molecular structure of SLC25A31, including potential post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
SLC25A31, also known as AAC4, is a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the exchange of adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial inner membrane. It is involved in the electrogenic exchange of cytosolic ADP for matrix ATP, a process essential for ATP synthesis and energy homeostasis within cells (Palmieri2013The). This protein is part of the adenine nucleotide translocases (ANTs) family, which is crucial for supplying ADP to mitochondria and releasing ATP into the cytoplasm, thereby maintaining cellular energy balance (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

SLC25A31 is selectively expressed in testicular germ cells, where it is essential for spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. Its deficiency in mice leads to infertility and early meiotic arrest of male germ cells, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Palmieri2013The). The protein's unique intron-exon structure and distinct kinetic properties, such as higher K m values for ADP and ATP compared to other members of its subfamily, suggest specialized functions in energy metabolism and cellular processes (Palmieri2013The).
