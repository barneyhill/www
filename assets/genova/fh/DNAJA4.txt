# DNAJA4

## Overview
DNAJA4 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member A4, which is a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the Hsp40 family, DNAJA4 plays a critical role in protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding and preventing aggregation, particularly under stress conditions such as hyperthermia (Zhang2023DNAJA4). The protein is involved in regulating the expression of F-actin and related pathway proteins, influencing cellular structure and function. Additionally, DNAJA4 is implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis and the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, impacting NF-κB signaling pathways and cellular stress responses (Zhang2023DNAJA4). Clinically, DNAJA4 has been associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other cancers, where its expression is often altered due to promoter hypermethylation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhang2023DNAJA4).

## Function
DNAJA4, a member of the HSP40/DNAJ family, functions as a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DNAJA4 plays a role in regulating the expression of F-actin and related pathway proteins in response to hyperthermia, particularly in keratinocyte HaCaT cells. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cell structure and function under stress conditions (Zhang2023DNAJA4). DNAJA4 also influences the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1B, activating NF-κB signaling pathways. This activation affects keratinocyte cell proliferation and viability during hyperthermic stimulation, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Zhang2023DNAJA4).

Additionally, DNAJA4 is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, acting as a molecular chaperone regulated by SREBP, a key transcription factor in lipid metabolism (Zhang2023DNAJA4). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding and preventing aggregation. Through these activities, DNAJA4 helps maintain cellular protection mechanisms and homeostasis, ensuring proper cellular function and response to environmental changes (Zhang2023DNAJA4).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJA4 has been implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), where it is often hypermethylated, leading to its downregulation. This hypermethylation is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis in NPC patients (Zhang2023DNAJA4). The downregulation of DNAJA4 due to promoter hypermethylation is a common event in NPC and other cancers, contributing to the progression of the disease by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis (Zhang2023DNAJA4). Overexpression of DNAJA4 has been shown to suppress NPC cell migration, invasion, and EMT, and reduce metastasis in vivo, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Zhang2023DNAJA4).

DNAJA4 also interacts with MYH9, a protein involved in cancer cell EMT and metastasis, by promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting NPC metastasis (Zhang2023DNAJA4). The clinical significance of DNAJA4 extends beyond NPC, as promoter hypermethylation of DNAJA4 has been reported in other diseases, such as pediatric embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing sarcoma, and oral leukoplakia, suggesting a broader role in cancer pathology (Zhang2023DNAJA4).

## Interactions
DNAJA4, a member of the Hsp40 family, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a co-chaperone with Hsp70 proteins. DNAJA4 interacts with Hsp70 by stimulating its ATPase activity, which is crucial for protein folding and stress response. This interaction is facilitated by the J-domain of DNAJA4, which contains a conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif that contacts key residues of the Hsp70 ATP catalytic site, optimizing it for ATP hydrolysis (Solana2022The; Kampinga2009Guidelines).

DNAJA4 is also known to participate in multiprotein complexes, influencing cellular processes such as protein degradation and signal transduction. It can bind to substrate polypeptides independently and interact with the ATP-bound conformation of Hsp70, promoting efficient substrate trapping (Solana2022The). In the context of heat stress, DNAJA4 has been shown to co-express with HSPA6, suggesting potential interactions that enhance functional diversity in response to proteotoxic stress in human neurons (Alharbi2023Profiling).

Additionally, DNAJA4 has been identified as interacting with the non-structural protein 2 (NS2) of the classical swine fever virus, although it is not a central node in the interaction network (Kang2012Interactive).
