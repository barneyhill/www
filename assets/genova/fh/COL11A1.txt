# COL11A1

## Overview
The COL11A1 gene encodes the collagen type XI alpha 1 chain, a minor fibrillar collagen protein that plays a critical role in the extracellular matrix of cartilage and other connective tissues. This protein is integral to the formation and regulation of collagen fibrils, contributing to the structural integrity and biomechanical properties of tissues. The collagen type XI alpha 1 chain is characterized by a triple-helical structure, typical of collagen proteins, and is involved in interactions with various extracellular matrix components, including other collagens and proteoglycans. Mutations in the COL11A1 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders, such as Stickler syndrome and Marshall syndrome, which affect vision, hearing, and skeletal development. Additionally, altered expression of COL11A1 has been linked to certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations; Richards2010Stickler; Hafez2015Col11a1).

## Structure
The COL11A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type XI collagen, which is a minor fibrillar collagen involved in the formation of cartilage and other connective tissues. The primary structure of the COL11A1 protein consists of a long triple-helical domain flanked by non-helical N-terminal and C-terminal regions. The secondary structure is characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats, which are typical of collagen proteins and essential for the formation of the triple helix (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations).

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of collagen α1(XI) is a globular domain rich in beta sheets, adopting a thirteen anti-parallel beta sheet configuration. This domain is located on the surface of collagen fibrils and contains a glycosaminoglycan binding motif within beta strand 11, allowing it to interact with other extracellular matrix components (Brown2011Proteomic). The NTD shares structural similarities with domains from other proteins, such as the collagen type IX NC4 domain and the LNS domain of neurexin 1 alpha (Brown2011Proteomic).

Post-translational modifications of the COL11A1 protein include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are crucial for collagen stability, and glycosylation (Kuivaniemi1997Mutations). The protein can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may alter its interactions with other extracellular matrix components (Sun2020Collagen).

## Function
The COL11A1 gene encodes the alpha 1 chain of type XI collagen, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix in cartilage and other connective tissues. This protein is involved in the nucleation and regulation of the diameter of heterotypic fibrils during collagen fibrillar assembly, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and biomechanical function of cartilage (Blaschke2000Collagen; Hafez2015Col11a1). Type XI collagen forms a heterotrimeric structure with α1(XI), α2(XI), and α3(XI) chains, which copolymerize with type II and IX collagens to regulate fibril diameter and ensure proper cartilage function (Li1995A; Mio2007A).

The amino terminal domain of the α1(XI) chain is located on the fibril surface, where it interacts with other extracellular matrix molecules, potentially limiting fibril diameter by hindering further collagen addition (Brown2011Proteomic; Keene1995Ultrastructural). This regulation is essential for normal tissue function, as evidenced by the severe chondrodystrophy observed in models with mutations affecting type XI collagen (Keene1995Ultrastructural). In healthy human cells, type XI collagen is present in the intervertebral disc and is crucial for the interaction between proteoglycan aggregates and collagens, anchoring these molecules to the collagen network (Mio2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL11A1 gene are associated with a range of connective tissue disorders, primarily affecting vision, hearing, and skeletal development. The most common conditions linked to COL11A1 mutations are Stickler syndrome and Marshall syndrome, both of which are characterized by ocular, auditory, and skeletal abnormalities. Stickler syndrome is often associated with a beaded vitreous phenotype and can include symptoms such as myopia, retinal detachment, and hearing loss (Richards2010Stickler; Majava2007A). Marshall syndrome shares some phenotypic overlap with Stickler syndrome but is distinguished by more pronounced facial dysmorphia and shorter stature (Čopíková2020Expanding).

Severe skeletal dysplasias, such as fibrochondrogenesis, can also result from COL11A1 mutations, although these are less common. These conditions are often characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities and may be lethal (Richards2013Alternative; Hufnagel2014A). Altered expression of COL11A1 has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and ovarian cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis. The phenotypic spectrum of COL11A1 mutations is broad, ranging from mild conditions like Stickler syndrome to severe dysplasias, and can include unique phenotypes not fitting into these categories (Hufnagel2014A).

## Interactions
The COL11A1 gene encodes the collagen α1(XI) chain, which is involved in various interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of collagen α1(XI) interacts with several ECM components, including fibrillar collagens type II and type XI, and FACIT collagens types XIV, XII, and IX. It also associates with small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans such as biglycan, epiphycan, fibromodulin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2/perlecan (Brown2011Proteomic).

Non-collagenous proteins like chondroadherin, thrombospondin-5 (COMP), thrombospondin-1, matrilin-1, and matrilin-3 also interact with the NTD. These interactions are crucial for ECM assembly and fibrillogenesis regulation (Brown2011Proteomic). The study confirmed the physical interaction of thrombospondin 1 with the NTD using surface plasmon resonance, with a dissociation constant of 100 nM (Brown2011Proteomic).

The NTD also interacts with enzymes involved in collagen biosynthesis, such as PLOD1, PLOD2, and P4HB, reflecting its role in collagen biosynthesis (Brown2011Proteomic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of collagen α1(XI) in maintaining cartilage structure and function.
