# ZSCAN22

## Overview
ZSCAN22 is a human gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 22. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, proteins, or other small molecules, suggesting that ZSCAN22 may play a role in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a leucine-rich region that facilitates protein-protein interactions, indicating that ZSCAN22 may be involved in forming protein complexes that regulate gene expression. While the specific biological functions and pathways involving ZSCAN22 are not fully elucidated, its structural features suggest it may be involved in critical cellular processes such as gene expression regulation and signal transduction (Qiu2020aarFDC).
