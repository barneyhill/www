# HBZ

## Overview
The HBZ gene encodes the hemoglobin subunit zeta, a component of the embryonic form of hemoglobin known as hemoglobin zeta (Hb Î¶). This protein is part of the globin family, which plays a crucial role in oxygen transport and storage in the blood. Hemoglobin subunit zeta is primarily expressed during the early stages of embryonic development, where it forms part of the embryonic hemoglobin complexes, such as Gower I and Gower II, which are eventually replaced by fetal and adult hemoglobin forms as development progresses. The expression of HBZ is tightly regulated, reflecting its specific role during early erythropoiesis. Dysregulation or mutations in the HBZ gene can have implications for embryonic development and are of interest in the study of hematological disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
