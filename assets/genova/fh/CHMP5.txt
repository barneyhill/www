# CHMP5

## Overview
CHMP5, or charged multivesicular body protein 5, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III). This protein is involved in critical cellular processes such as membrane fission and remodeling, particularly in the maturation of late endosomes into lysosomes, which is essential for the degradation of internalized proteins and receptors (Shim2006CHMP5). The CHMP5 protein is characterized by a unique structural configuration, including a tandem β-hairpin structure, which distinguishes it from other CHMP proteins (Mu2012Two). Functionally, CHMP5 plays a significant role in regulating receptor signaling pathways and is implicated in various cellular interactions, including those with Brox and LIP5, which are crucial for its role in endosomal trafficking and multivesicular body formation (Mu2012Two; Ward2005The). Additionally, CHMP5 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, impacting bone turnover and immune responses (Greenblatt2015CHMP5). Its dysregulation has been linked to several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and osteoarthritis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shahmoradgoli2010Antiapoptotic; Gao2024CHMP5).

## Structure
The CHMP5 protein is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, involved in membrane fission and remodeling events. Its primary structure consists of a bipartite sequence with basic N-terminal and acidic C-terminal fragments (Mu2012Two). The C-terminal tail of CHMP5 adopts a tandem β-hairpin structure, which is distinct from the α-helical structures seen in other CHMP proteins like CHMP4B (Mu2012Two). This β-hairpin structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, such as those between the carbonyl oxygen of L207 and the amide nitrogen of Q215, and between the amide nitrogen of V208 and the carbonyl oxygen of T200 (Mu2012Two).

CHMP5 interacts with the Brox protein through a unique hydrophobic pocket, engaging Brox residue Y348, which is specific to Brox among Bro1 domain-containing proteins (Mu2012Two). The interaction involves a rigid-body fit, with the Brox:CHMP5 interface burying 1,100 Å² of solvent-accessible surface area (Mu2012Two). CHMP5 also forms complexes with LIP5, where its helices 5 and 6, along with adjacent linkers, form an amphipathic 'leucine collar' that wraps around the second LIP5 MIT module, representing a unique MIM5-MIT interaction (Skalicky2012Interactions).

## Function
CHMP5 (charged multivesicular body protein 5) is a crucial component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is involved in the endosomal sorting and formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In healthy human cells, CHMP5 plays a significant role in the maturation of late endosomes into lysosomes, a process essential for the degradation of internalized proteins and receptors. This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating receptor signaling pathways (Shim2006CHMP5).

CHMP5 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the down-regulation of receptor signaling by facilitating the lysosomal degradation of internalized receptors, such as TGFβ receptors. This process prevents the recycling of receptors back to the plasma membrane, thereby modulating signal transduction pathways (Shim2006CHMP5). 

In addition to its role in endosomal trafficking, CHMP5 is implicated in the regulation of NF-κB signaling in osteoclasts, where it acts as a negative regulator by stabilizing IκBα and preventing its degradation. This activity is important for controlling bone turnover rates and maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption (Greenblatt2015CHMP5).

## Clinical Significance
CHMP5 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in apoptosis regulation and transcriptional control. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CHMP5 overexpression is associated with reduced apoptosis, contributing to leukemia cell survival and pathogenesis. This is achieved through the inhibition of apoptosis-inducing genes and the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival (Shahmoradgoli2010Antiapoptotic).

In T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), CHMP5 is essential for the transcription of key oncogenes like MYC by facilitating BRD4-p300-dependent transcription. High CHMP5 expression correlates with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in T-ALL, suggesting its role in disease progression and resistance to treatment (UmphredWilson2024The).

CHMP5 also plays a role in osteoarthritis (OA), where its reduced expression in cartilage is linked to increased chondrocyte apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation. Overexpression of CHMP5 in OA models has shown protective effects against these processes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2024CHMP5).

In bone remodeling, CHMP5 deficiency leads to increased osteoclast activity and a Paget's disease-like phenotype, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal bone turnover rates (Greenblatt2015CHMP5).

## Interactions
CHMP5, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, engages in several protein-protein interactions critical for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with Brox, a Bro1 domain-containing protein, through its C-terminal tail, which adopts a tandem beta-hairpin structure. This interaction is crucial for recruiting Brox to detergent-resistant membrane fractions, suggesting a role in membrane remodeling events. Specific residues in both Brox and CHMP5 are essential for this binding, highlighting a unique hydrophobic interaction interface (Mu2012Two).

CHMP5 also interacts with LIP5, a protein involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation and HIV-1 budding. This interaction is significant for the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and affects the release of infectious HIV-1 particles. CHMP5's interaction with LIP5 suggests a role in MVB sorting and endocytic pathways (Ward2005The).

In the context of the ESCRT-III complex, CHMP5 shows interactions with other CHMP proteins, including CHMP1B, CHMP2A, and CHMP6, demonstrating strict fidelity for the original bait in yeast two-hybrid screens. These interactions are important for understanding the connectivity and potential functions of CHMP proteins in both nuclear and cytoplasmic/endosomal contexts (Tsang2006A).
