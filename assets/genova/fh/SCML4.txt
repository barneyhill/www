# SCML4

## Overview
SCML4 (Scm polycomb group protein like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein, also named SCML4, is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with chromatin. It is particularly important in the context of immune cell function, where it enhances the effector and memory capabilities of CD8+ T cells, including tissue-resident memory T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. SCML4 achieves this by recruiting the HBO1-BRPF2-ING4 complex, which acetylates histone H3 at lysine 14, thereby increasing chromatin accessibility and promoting gene transcription. The gene's expression is regulated by fatty acid metabolism through the mTOR-IRF4-PRDM1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining T-cell functionality. SCML4 has been associated with improved prognosis in various cancers due to its role in enhancing antitumor immunity (Yang2021Functions; Feng2023Fatty).

## Function
SCML4 (Scm polycomb group protein like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression. In healthy human cells, SCML4 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it binds directly to chromatin. This binding is facilitated by a nuclear localization sequence within its N-terminal domain, specifically between base pairs 30 and 60 (Feng2023Fatty). SCML4 plays a critical role in the activation and function of CD8+ T cells, particularly tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), by recruiting the HBO1-BRPF2-ING4 complex. This complex acetylates histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14), enhancing chromatin accessibility and promoting the transcription of genes associated with T-cell effector functions and memory progression (Feng2023Fatty).

SCML4 is also involved in metabolic regulation, with its expression being sustained by fatty acid metabolism through the mTOR-IRF4-PRDM1 signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for maintaining the effector function and survival of T cells by promoting histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility, which enhances cytokine production and T-cell activation (Feng2023Fatty). The gene's activity is linked to better prognosis in cancer patients, as it supports the maintenance and function of Trm cells, which are associated with improved immune responses within tumors (Feng2023Fatty).

## Clinical Significance
SCML4 (Scm polycomb group protein like 4) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor immunity and T-cell functionality. Alterations in SCML4 expression are associated with better prognosis in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Feng2023Fatty). In lung adenocarcinoma, SCML4 expression is significantly downregulated compared to normal tissues, and its low expression is linked to unfavorable overall survival and poor responses to immunotherapy (Yang2021Functions). 

SCML4 is also involved in the regulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, enhancing their survival and effector functions, which are crucial for antitumor immunity (Feng2023Fatty). The gene's expression is maintained by fatty acid metabolism through the mTOR-IRF4-PRDM1 signaling pathway, which is essential for the functionality of CD8+ T cells in tumor environments (Feng2023Fatty). SCML4's role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation further underscores its significance in cancer progression and immune response modulation (Feng2023Fatty).

## Interactions
SCML4 interacts with the HBO1-BRPF2-ING4 complex, which is involved in histone acetylation, specifically acetylating H3K14. This interaction is crucial for increasing gene transcriptional activity and is dependent on the C-terminal domain of SCML4 (Feng2023Fatty). SCML4 also plays a role in chromatin remodeling by recruiting the HBO1-BRPF2-ING4 complex to reprogram the expression of T cell-specific genes, enhancing the survival and effector functions of tissue-resident memory T cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (Feng2023Fatty). 

The interaction between SCML4 and the BRPF2-HBO1-ING4 complex was identified through mass spectrometry and confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Feng2023Fatty). This interaction increases global H3K14 acetylation, which is crucial for the activation of CD8+ T cells (Feng2023Fatty). SCML4's role in these interactions suggests it acts as an epigenetic regulatory node, enhancing the effector and memory functions of CD8+ T cells by increasing chromatin accessibility (Feng2023Fatty). 

In addition to its role in histone acetylation, SCML4 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the breast cancer stem cell phenotype, where it is part of a module with other transcription factors such as IKZF3, SP140, and ZNF831 (da2017Transcription).
