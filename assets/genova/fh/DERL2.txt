# DERL2

## Overview
DERL2 is a gene that encodes the protein derlin 2, a six-pass transmembrane protein integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by facilitating the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal; Kandel2020The). Derlin 2 is characterized by conserved motifs, such as the WR and GxxxG motifs, which are essential for its function in retrotranslocation processes (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal). Beyond its role in protein quality control, derlin 2 is involved in the ER stress-induced pre-emptive quality control pathway and is critical for postnatal brain development and motor function through its regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis (Sugiyama2021ERAD). Alterations in DERL2 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both cellular and clinical contexts (Sugiyama2021ERAD; Liu2023DERL2).

## Structure
Derlin-2 (DERL2) is a six-pass transmembrane protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It is characterized by several conserved motifs, including the WR and GxxxG motifs, which are crucial for its function in retrotranslocation processes (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal; Kandel2020The). The WR motif is typically involved in rearranging the lipid environment, while the GxxxG motif facilitates dimerization (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal).

DERL2 contains three predicted loops in the ER lumen, with the second luminal loop playing a significant role in sensitivity to cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal). The N-terminal region includes the first two transmembrane domains and the first luminal loop, which contains a WR motif conserved among rhomboid proteases, although this motif is not essential for CDT intoxication (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal).

Post-translational modifications of DERL2 may include glycosylation and ubiquitination, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein may also have splice variant isoforms, which could further diversify its functions. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DERL2 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Derlin-2 (DERL2) is a protein that plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. This pathway is responsible for the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, where they are subsequently degraded by the proteasome (Eshraghi2014Cytolethal; Kandel2020The). Derlin-2 is involved in the retrotranslocation process, facilitating the movement of substrates across the ER membrane, a function supported by its conserved rhomboid motifs (Kandel2020The).

In addition to its role in protein quality control, Derlin-2 is implicated in the ER stress-induced pre-emptive quality control pathway, where it helps reroute ER-targeted substrates to an E3 ligase for ubiquitination and degradation (Kandel2020The). Derlin-2 is also essential for postnatal brain development and motor function, as it regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in the brain by modulating the activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) pathway. This regulation is crucial for neurite outgrowth and the development of functional neural circuits (Sugiyama2021ERAD).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DERL2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cholangiocarcinoma, a type of liver cancer, DERL2 is highly expressed and serves as an independent prognostic indicator for poor survival outcomes. The overexpression of DERL2 promotes tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapy, specifically gemcitabine, by stabilizing BAG6, a protein that supports cancer progression. Knockout of DERL2 enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, suggesting that targeting DERL2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for cholangiocarcinoma (Liu2023DERL2).

In the context of neurological disorders, DERL2, along with Derlin-1, is essential for postnatal brain development and motor function. Deficiencies in DERL2 lead to brain atrophy and impaired motor performance, likely due to disrupted cholesterol biosynthesis in the brain. This disruption affects neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, which are critical for normal brain development and function. The regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by DERL2 is mediated through the SREBP-2 pathway, and its deficiency can result in significant neurological deficits (Sugiyama2021ERAD).

## Interactions
DERL2 (derlin 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It interacts with BAG6 (BAG cochaperone 6), stabilizing it and enhancing its oncogenic role in cholangiocarcinoma progression. This interaction is significant in the context of chemotherapy resistance, as DERL2 stabilizes BAG6, which is implicated in the resistance mechanisms of cholangiocarcinoma cells (Liu2023DERL2).

DERL2 is also part of a complex network of interactions within the ERAD pathway, where it associates with other proteins such as VCP/p97, SEL1L, and HRD1. These interactions facilitate the retrotranslocation and degradation of misfolded proteins, highlighting DERL2's role in protein quality control (Kandel2020The). In the context of brain development, DERL2, along with Derlin-1, is essential for the activation of SREBP-2, a transcription factor involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal brain function and development, particularly in the cerebellum and striatum (Sugiyama2021ERAD).
