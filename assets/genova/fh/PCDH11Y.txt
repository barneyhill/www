# PCDH11Y

## Overview
PCDH11Y is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the protein protocadherin 11 Y-linked, a member of the δ1-protocadherin family. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes that are crucial for neural development, particularly in the formation of synaptic connections in the brain. Protocadherin 11 Y-linked is characterized by its structure, which includes an ectodomain with seven cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with β-catenin, thereby influencing the Wnt signaling pathway (Priddle2012Protocadherin). The protein is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and cerebellum, suggesting its significant role in cognitive functions such as language and synaptogenesis (Durand2005Expression; Priddle2012Protocadherin). While PCDH11Y has been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, its direct association with psychiatric disorders remains inconclusive (Durand2005Expression).

## Function
PCDH11Y is a gene located on the Y chromosome, encoding a protein that is part of the δ1-protocadherin family, which is involved in cell adhesion processes crucial for neural development. The protein encoded by PCDH11Y is primarily expressed in the brain, including regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, and cerebellum, both in fetal and adult stages (Priddle2012Protocadherin). The protein structure includes an ectodomain with seven cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain interacts with β-catenin and can induce the Wnt signaling pathway, which is significant in various cellular processes (Priddle2012Protocadherin).

PCDH11Y is involved in synaptogenesis, a critical process for the development of the central nervous system, by forming intercellular junctions through homophilic binding (Durand2005Expression). The protein's expression is mainly detected in the cortex and hippocampus, suggesting its role in establishing neuronal networks and contributing to cognitive functions such as language (Durand2005Expression; Priddle2012Protocadherin). Despite its involvement in these processes, PCDH11Y has not been significantly linked to susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (Durand2005Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCDH11Y gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene is part of the protocadherin family, which plays a crucial role in brain development and function. Studies have linked deletions in PCDH11Y to severe language delays and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in patients with specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as mosaicism involving the Y chromosome (Nardello2021A). The loss of PCDH11Y, along with NLGN4Y, has been associated with a severe autistic phenotype, characterized by language impairment and developmental delays (Nardello2021A).

Research has also explored the genetic variability of PCDH11Y in relation to psychiatric disorders. Although specific polymorphisms, such as F885V and K980N, have been identified, no significant association has been found between these variants and conditions like autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia (Durand2005Expression). Despite these findings, the potential role of PCDH11Y in psychiatric disorders remains a subject of interest due to its expression in brain regions critical for cognitive and emotional functions (Durand2005Expression).

## Interactions
PCDH11Y, a member of the protocadherin family, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in the nervous system. It interacts with β-catenin, a proto-oncogene product, which suggests a role in the Wnt signaling pathways crucial for cell growth and differentiation (Redies2005δProtocadherins:). This interaction is important as it may contribute to the regulation of neural development and possibly tumorigenesis (Redies2005δProtocadherins:).

PCDH11Y is also involved in the activation of Wnt signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells, promoting cell survival under androgen deprivation conditions (Redies2005δProtocadherins:). This interaction highlights its role in apoptosis resistance and androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer (Redies2005δProtocadherins:).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, PCDH11Y is suggested to play a role in early language network development and synaptic function, potentially affecting language development and contributing to conditions such as autism (Nardello2021A). These interactions underscore the gene's involvement in brain development and function, although the detailed molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Nardello2021A).
