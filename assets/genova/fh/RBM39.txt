# RBM39

## Overview
RBM39 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 39, a multifunctional protein primarily involved in RNA processing, including alternative splicing and transcriptional coactivation. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate its interaction with RNA and other proteins, playing a crucial role in the assembly of splicing complexes and transcriptional regulation. As a splicing factor, RBM39 modulates exon inclusion and exclusion in pre-mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA diversity and gene expression. Additionally, it acts as a transcriptional coactivator, interacting with various transcription factors to regulate cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. RBM39's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, particularly in cancer, where it is implicated in tumor progression and drug resistance (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM; Campagne2023Molecular; Xu2021RNA‐binding).

## Structure
RBM39 (RNA binding motif protein 39) is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its function in RNA processing. The protein contains multiple RRMs, including RRM1 and RRM2, each with distinct RNA-binding properties. RRM1 primarily interacts with RNA stem-loop structures, such as those found in U1 snRNA, through shape recognition rather than specific sequences. This interaction is mediated by stacking and polar interactions involving residues like F156, Y198, and Q159 (Campagne2023Molecular). In contrast, RRM2 binds single-stranded RNA with high specificity, recognizing the motif UUUG, with key residues such as K322, R329, F259, R289, and H258 contributing to binding affinity and specificity (Campagne2023Molecular).

The tertiary structure of RBM39 includes a canonical RRM fold, consisting of a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet and two alpha-helices, which are essential for its interaction with other proteins, such as DCAF15 (Faust2019Structural). The RBM39-UHM domain, part of the U2AF homology motif family, adopts a characteristic RRM-family fold with unique features that suggest non-canonical RNA interactions (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM). RBM39 is also involved in protein-protein interactions necessary for splicing factor assembly, as demonstrated by its interaction with U2AF65 (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM).

## Function
RBM39 (RNA binding motif protein 39) is a multifunctional protein involved in RNA processing, particularly in the regulation of alternative splicing and transcriptional coactivation. In healthy human cells, RBM39 functions as a splicing factor, interacting with components of the spliceosome to modulate the inclusion and exclusion of exons in pre-mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA diversity and gene expression (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM; Campagne2023Molecular). It is primarily localized in the nucleus and nuclear speckles, where it participates in the assembly of splicing complexes through interactions with proteins such as U2AF65 (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM).

RBM39 also acts as a transcriptional coactivator, enhancing the activity of several transcription factors, including estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), progesterone receptor (PR), and c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 complex. These interactions are crucial for cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (Xu2021RNA‐binding). The protein's role in transcriptional regulation is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can alter its activity and interactions (Xu2021RNA‐binding).

In addition to its role in splicing and transcription, RBM39 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating energy metabolism and redox balance, particularly in non-transformed hepatocytes (Xu2021RNA‐binding).

## Clinical Significance
RBM39 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA splicing and gene expression regulation. Mutations in RBM39, particularly in the RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) domain, can confer resistance to anticancer drugs like indisulam. These mutations prevent the drug from exerting its antitumor effects, as seen in colorectal carcinoma cells, where tumors with RBM39 mutations do not regress upon treatment (Han2017Anticancer).

Alterations in RBM39 expression levels are associated with several cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RBM39 is crucial for cell survival, and its degradation leads to abnormal splicing of transcriptional regulators, slowing leukemia progression (Xu2021RNAbinding). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RBM39 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Xu2021RNAbinding). High RBM39 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in multiple myeloma and is associated with tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer (Xu2021RNAbinding).

RBM39's interactions are significant in cancer progression. It interacts with MORC2 in colorectal cancer, promoting alternative splicing events that contribute to metastasis (He2024MORC2). These findings highlight RBM39's clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RBM39 (RNA binding motif protein 39) is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions, playing a significant role in RNA splicing and transcription regulation. It interacts with components of the spliceosome, particularly the U2 snRNP component SF3B1 and the U1 snRNP associated factor U1-70K. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed RBM39's association with the spliceosome, specifically with the U1 snRNP-specific protein U1-C, although this interaction is weak and RNA-dependent, suggesting an indirect association (Campagne2023Molecular).

RBM39's RRM2 domain is crucial for binding single-stranded RNA motifs, using an extended RNA-binding interface to interact with specific RNA sequences with high affinity (Campagne2023Molecular). It also interacts with U2AF65 through UHM-ULM interactions, which are RNA-independent and occur in the nucleus. This interaction is enhanced by the RS domain of RBM39, suggesting additional contacts beyond subcellular localization (Stepanyuk2016UHM–ULM).

RBM39 also interacts with transcription factors and coactivators, including c-Jun, ERα, ERβ, PR, and NCOA6, influencing transcriptional regulation and splicing. Its interaction with DCAF15, induced by aryl sulphonamides, forms a ternary complex with RBM39's RRM2 domain, highlighting its role in cancer therapy (Xu2021RNA‐binding).
