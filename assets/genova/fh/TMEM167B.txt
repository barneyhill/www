# TMEM167B

## Overview
TMEM167B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 167B, which is involved in critical cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and protein transport. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily active within the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper protein localization. TMEM167B has been associated with various biological pathways, including those related to blood vessel development, angiogenesis, and epithelial cell proliferation, highlighting its potential involvement in vascular and cell proliferation mechanisms (Faro2021Genomewide). Additionally, TMEM167B has been implicated in disease contexts, such as primary open-angle glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its relevance in both genetic and proteomic studies (Bavykina2023Tracking; Faro2021Genomewide).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM167B is involved in cellular processes related to membrane trafficking and protein transport. It is a part of the endosomal system, contributing to the sorting and distribution of proteins within the cell. TMEM167B is typically active in the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, playing a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein localization. The gene is highlighted in the context of a novel variant, rs111739240_TMEM167B-C1orf194, which is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a missense variant in African ancestry populations. This variant is associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in African ancestry males, indicating a role in gene expression regulation in specific tissues (Faro2021Genomewide). The study suggests that TMEM167B may be involved in vascular and cell proliferation mechanisms, with significant pathways related to blood vessel development, angiogenesis, and epithelial cell proliferation (Faro2021Genomewide). Additionally, TMEM167B was identified as one of the upregulated genes during the progression of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its involvement in disease-specific transcriptomic and proteomic signatures in monocytes (Bavykina2023Tracking). However, specific functions of TMEM167B in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM167B has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and its association with ancestry-specific genetic variants. A genome-wide association meta-analysis identified a novel variant, rs111739240_TMEM167B-C1orf194, which is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a missense variant in African ancestry populations. This variant is associated with POAG in African ancestry males, suggesting an African-specific association. The variant is also a GTEx eQTL for TMEM167B and AMIGO1 in multiple tissues, indicating its role in gene expression regulation (Faro2021Genomewide).

Despite its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), TMEM167B was not included as a candidate gene in a study focused on the 1p13.3 region due to the lack of reported genetic variants in NDD subjects and its low expression levels in the human brain (BenMahmoud2022A). Additionally, a case report identified a 0.463 Mb gain at 1p13.3, including TMEM167B, as a variant of uncertain significance in a patient with severe childhood obesity and tall stature, but no direct link to TMEM167B-related conditions was established (Abdullah2016Melanocortin4).
