# CLEC1A

## Overview
CLEC1A is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 1 member A, a type II transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor involved in immune regulation. This protein is predominantly expressed in myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes, where it acts as an inhibitory receptor, modulating immune responses by influencing T-helper cell proliferation and antigen presentation. The C-type lectin-like receptor is characterized by its extracellular ligand-binding domain, which is crucial for its role in immune homeostasis. CLEC1A is implicated in various immune processes, including the suppression of Th17 responses and the modulation of cytokine production, particularly in the context of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Its expression is regulated by factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and inflammatory stimuli, underscoring its significance in maintaining immune balance (Lopez2017Cellsurface; Makusheva2022The).

## Structure
CLEC1A is a C-type lectin-like receptor that is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, lung, bone marrow, thymus, and heart. It is also detected in dendritic cells and endothelial cells but not in peripheral blood monocytes, granulocytes, B, T, or NK cells (Huysamen2008The). The protein is a type II transmembrane protein, featuring a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane region, a stalk domain, and a C-terminal extracellular ligand-binding C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) (Sattler2012Evolution). The CTLD is encoded by three exons and contains six highly conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, crucial for the protein's characteristic fold and function (Sattler2012Evolution).

CLEC1A may exist in at least two isoforms, which could affect its structure and function (Huysamen2008The). The cytoplasmic tail of CLEC1A contains a YSST and a tri-acidic DDD motif, which may mediate intracellular signaling (Tone2019C‐type). The protein's expression is modulated by inflammatory stimuli and TGF-beta, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Lopez2017Cellsurface). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CLEC1A encodes a C-type lectin-like receptor that plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. It is primarily expressed on myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, where it functions as an inhibitory receptor to dampen dendritic cell activation and downstream Th17 responses (Lopez2017Cellsurface). CLEC1A is involved in antigen presentation and T-helper (Th) cell responses, particularly influencing Th1 and Th17 cell proliferation (Lopez2017Cellsurface). 

In healthy human cells, CLEC1A is expressed at the cell surface in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and monocytes, while its expression is mostly intracellular in endothelial cells (Lopez2017Cellsurface). The receptor is upregulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and downregulated by inflammatory stimuli, indicating its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (Lopez2017Cellsurface). 

CLEC1A does not activate the canonical NF-kB pathway but may engage alternative pathways to modulate immune responses, such as suppressing Il12p40 expression (Lopez2017Cellsurface). Its expression is particularly strong in the placenta and lung, suggesting a role in these tissues' immune environments (Colonna2000Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC1A plays a significant role in the development of autoimmune conditions, particularly in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis. Alterations in CLEC1A expression or function can lead to changes in immune responses, contributing to disease progression. In CLEC1A-deficient mice, the development of EAE is suppressed, which is linked to impaired antigen-presenting ability of dendritic cells and reduced T cell priming against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). This results in decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-1β, which are crucial for EAE development (Makusheva2022The).

The absence of CLEC1A leads to altered cytokine and chemokine expression, affecting the inflammatory response associated with EAE. This suggests that CLEC1A influences cytokine production and T cell responses, contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (Makusheva2022The). The findings indicate that reduced cytokine production is a cause, not a result, of impaired EAE development in CLEC1A-deficient mice, highlighting its potential role in autoimmune conditions where altered immune responses are involved (Makusheva2022The).

## Interactions
CLEC1A, a C-type lectin domain family member, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses. It has been identified as a receptor for histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), with high-affinity binding demonstrated through surface plasmon resonance experiments. This interaction is significant in inhibiting high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)-mediated pathways in vascular endothelial cells, which are implicated in inflammatory responses and sepsis (Gao2020HistidineRich).

CLEC1A is also expressed on dendritic cells and monocytes, where it modulates immune responses. It does not affect the expression of activation markers or cytokine production in monocyte-derived dendritic cells but reduces Th17 activation, skewing the response toward Th1 polarization. This suggests CLEC1A's role in modulating immune responses through alternative NF-kB activation pathways (Lopez2017Cellsurface).

In the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CLEC1A enhances the antigen-presenting ability of dendritic cells and induces inflammatory cytokine production, contributing to disease development. CLEC1A-deficient mice show reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A, IL-6, and IL-1β, indicating its role in promoting inflammatory pathways (Makusheva2022The).
