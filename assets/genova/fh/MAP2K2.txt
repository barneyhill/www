# MAP2K2

## Overview
MAP2K2, also known as MEK2, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2, a dual-specificity kinase integral to the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This pathway is pivotal for regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The MAP2K2 protein functions by phosphorylating and activating ERK1/2, thereby facilitating signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus, which influences gene expression and cellular responses (Ren2021Mycassociated; Lavoie2020ERK). MAP2K2 is involved in critical cellular functions such as neuronal autophagy, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases, where it enhances autophagic flux and the clearance of pathological proteins (Chen2017Phosphoproteomebased). Mutations in the MAP2K2 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, including RASopathies like Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome and Noonan syndrome with multiple café au lait spots, highlighting its clinical significance (Takenouchi2013Multiple; Rauen2010Molecular).

## Structure
MAP2K2, also known as MEK2, is a dual-specificity kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The primary structure of MAP2K2 consists of a polypeptide chain of amino acids. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of MAP2K2 is characterized by a kinase domain with a prominent ATP-binding site, essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in phosphorylating downstream targets in the signaling pathway.

MAP2K2 can form dimers, representing its quaternary structure, which may be important for its regulatory functions. The protein contains specific domains, such as the kinase domain and an activation loop, which are critical for its catalytic activity. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating MAP2K2's activity and function. These modifications can alter the protein's conformation and interaction with other molecules, impacting its role in cellular signaling.

Splice variant isoforms of MAP2K2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties and interactions within the cell. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's activity and regulation, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes.

## Function
MAP2K2, also known as MEK2, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a critical role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In healthy human cells, MAP2K2 phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2, facilitating the transmission of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular responses (Ren2021Mycassociated). This kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it regulates processes crucial for normal development and homeostasis (Lavoie2020ERK).

MAP2K2 is involved in neuronal autophagy, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. It is activated by compounds like corynoxine, which increase its phosphorylation levels, leading to enhanced autophagic flux and the clearance of pathological proteins associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Chen2017Phosphoproteomebased). The kinase's activity is modulated by various stimuli, contributing to its role in cellular fate determination and growth arrest at the G1/S boundary (Nadeau2009Map2k1andMap2k2genes). MAP2K2's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAP2K2 gene, also known as MEK2, are implicated in several genetic disorders, primarily within the group of conditions known as RASopathies. Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome is one such disorder, characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, cardiac defects, ectodermal anomalies, and developmental delays. Mutations in MAP2K2, such as the p.P128Q missense mutation, have been identified in individuals with CFC syndrome, leading to increased kinase activity and altered protein function (Rauen2010Molecular).

In addition to CFC syndrome, MAP2K2 mutations have been associated with a condition referred to as Noonan syndrome with multiple café au lait spots (NFNS). This condition presents with features overlapping those of neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome, including learning disabilities and café au lait spots (Takenouchi2013Multiple).

Deletions of the MAP2K2 gene have also been studied, revealing a distinct phenotype that includes craniofacial features, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and intellectual disabilities. These deletions suggest a novel mechanism for RASopathies, potentially due to dysregulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway (Nowaczyk2013Deletion).

## Interactions
MAP2K2, also known as MEK2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It interacts with COPS5, a protein involved in various cellular processes, with a high confidence interaction score of 16.6, indicating a strong physical interaction (Wang2008Protein). MAP2K2 also interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, which functions as a scaffold for assembling signaling complexes, including MAPK family proteins (Bandyopadhyay2010A). This interaction suggests a role for MAP2K2 in regulating cell stimuli processing in conjunction with other MAPK pathway components.

In the context of neuronal autophagy, MAP2K2 is activated by the compound corynoxine (Cory), leading to increased phosphorylation of substrates such as RB1 at S804, which is associated with inhibiting apoptosis and promoting autophagic flux (Chen2017Phosphoproteomebased). The kinase activity of MAP2K2 is specifically upregulated in response to Cory, highlighting its role in autophagy regulation (Chen2017Phosphoproteomebased). These interactions and modifications underscore the importance of MAP2K2 in various cellular processes, including its potential involvement in neurodegenerative disease therapy.
