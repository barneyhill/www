# TMEM176B

## Overview
TMEM176B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 176B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis. This protein is primarily expressed in immune cells, such as dendritic cells, where it plays a crucial role in antigen processing and presentation. TMEM176B functions as an intracellular cation channel, contributing to the regulation of phagosomal pH and facilitating antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. Additionally, it is involved in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby modulating inflammatory responses. The protein's interactions with other channels and its involvement in signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune response modulation (Li2024Transmembrane; Hill2022The; Segovia2014Autologous).

## Function
TMEM176B is an intracellular cation channel that plays a significant role in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis. It is primarily expressed in immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), where it is involved in antigen processing and presentation. TMEM176B is localized to the phagosomal membrane and functions as a nonselective cation channel, regulating phagosomal pH by providing a Na+ efflux conductance. This activity supports vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) function, facilitating phagosomal acidification necessary for antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells (Hill2022The; Segovia2014Autologous).

TMEM176B also plays a role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that senses cellular stress and activates inflammatory responses. It is suggested that TMEM176B controls cytosolic calcium levels, which may be a mechanism through which it inhibits inflammasome activation (Hill2022The). The protein is involved in maintaining a neutral pH in the endophagosomal lumen, crucial for antigen processing through the cross-presentation pathway in DCs (Hill2022The). TMEM176B's dual role in promoting antigen cross-presentation and inhibiting inflammasome activation highlights its complex function in immune regulation (Hill2022The).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM176B is implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). In gastric cancer, TMEM176B overexpression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced clinical staging. It interacts with the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth (Li2024Transmembrane). In colorectal cancer, the Ala134Thr variant of TMEM176B is linked to increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is associated with improved prognosis and higher overall survival (Cambui2022The).

In triple-negative breast cancer, TMEM176B promotes tumor growth by regulating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its overexpression leads to increased cell proliferation and migration, while silencing it results in reduced tumor growth (Kang2021TMEM176B). In skin cutaneous melanoma, TMEM176B is overexpressed and associated with immune cell infiltration, affecting overall and disease-free survival (Jiang2022A).

TMEM176B also plays a role in immune regulation, affecting antigen cross-presentation and inflammasome activation. Its expression is linked to immune responses in various conditions, including resistance to immune checkpoint blockers in melanoma and clinical responses in rheumatoid arthritis (Hill2022The).

## Interactions
TMEM176B is known to interact with several proteins, forming complexes and participating in various cellular processes. It interacts with TMEM176A, and their co-expression results in greater conductance than when expressed separately, although the exact stoichiometry and functional differences between homo- and hetero-channels remain unclear (Hill2022The). TMEM176B also interacts with other channels such as TRPML2, playing a role in ion transport across endophagosomal membranes, which impacts antigen cross-presentation and inflammasome activation (Hill2022The).

In the context of immune regulation, TMEM176B is involved in the modulation of dendritic cell biology. It promotes antigen cross-presentation while inhibiting inflammasome activation, affecting the secretion of cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Hill2022The). TMEM176B's role in dendritic cells includes facilitating Na+ efflux, which promotes proton pumping by the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) for phagosomal acidification, a process essential for antigen cross-presentation (Segovia2014Autologous).

TMEM176B's interactions extend to its involvement in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, particularly in cancer contexts such as gastric cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, where it influences cell proliferation and survival (Kang2021TMEM176B; Li2024Transmembrane). These interactions highlight TMEM176B's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune response modulation.
