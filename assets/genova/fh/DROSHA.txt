# DROSHA

## Overview
DROSHA is a gene that encodes the drosha ribonuclease III protein, a critical component of the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway. The drosha ribonuclease III is a nuclear RNase III enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the initial processing of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) within the nucleus. This enzyme is a part of the Microprocessor complex, which also includes the cofactor DGCR8, and is essential for the maturation of miRNAs, which are key regulators of gene expression involved in various biological processes such as development, differentiation, and cellular homeostasis (Ha2014Regulation; Han2004The). Beyond its canonical role in miRNA processing, drosha ribonuclease III is also involved in noncanonical RNA processing pathways and DNA repair processes, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular regulation (Michlewski2018Posttranscriptional; Lu2018Drosha). Mutations in the DROSHA gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and vascular disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Hata2019Deregulation; Rakheja2014Somatic).

## Structure
The DROSHA protein is a ribonuclease III enzyme involved in the processing of primary microRNA transcripts. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains and features. The primary structure of DROSHA consists of a sequence of amino acids, with the N-terminal region being poorly conserved across species but characterized by a high proportion of proline residues, forming a proline-rich disordered domain (PRD) (Son2023Role). This PRD is crucial for the processing of intronic microRNAs and is functionally conserved across chordate homologs (Son2023Role).

The secondary structure of DROSHA includes two RNase III catalytic domains and a C-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). The dsRBD has an αβββα fold, consisting of an α helix, three β strands forming an antiparallel β sheet, and a second α helix (Mueller2010Solution). This domain is important for RNA binding, interacting with specific regions of the RNA's minor and major grooves (Mueller2010Solution).

DROSHA often forms a complex with DGCR8, representing its quaternary structure, which is essential for recognizing pri-miRNA substrates (Mueller2010Solution). The protein also exists in different isoforms, such as DROSHA-p140, which lacks the PRD due to proteolytic cleavage and is impaired in processing intronic miRNAs (Son2023Role).

## Function
DROSHA is a nuclear RNase III enzyme that plays a critical role in the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cells. It is a core component of the Microprocessor complex, which also includes the cofactor DGCR8. This complex is responsible for the initial processing of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) within the nucleus. DROSHA cleaves the stem-loop structure of pri-miRNAs, releasing pre-miRNAs that are approximately 65-70 nucleotides long. This processing step is crucial for the maturation of miRNAs, which are key regulators of gene expression involved in development, differentiation, and cellular homeostasis (Ha2014Regulation; Han2004The).

DROSHA's activity is regulated by various mechanisms, including protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. It interacts with RNA-binding proteins such as p68 and p72, which modulate its processing activity. The enzyme's nuclear localization and stability are influenced by phosphorylation and acetylation, respectively (Ha2014Regulation). Beyond its canonical role in miRNA processing, DROSHA also participates in noncanonical RNA processing pathways, affecting the turnover and regulation of other cellular RNAs, including mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (Michlewski2018Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DROSHA gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and vascular disorders. In Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer, mutations in DROSHA lead to impaired microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, resulting in the downregulation of tumor-suppressing miRNAs, such as the let-7 family. This impairment is due to mutations in the RNase IIIB domain of DROSHA, which globally inhibit miRNA processing through a dominant-negative mechanism (Rakheja2014Somatic; Torrezan2014Recurrent).

In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a vascular disorder, DROSHA mutations, such as P100L and R279L, disrupt BMP-regulated pri-miRNA processing, affecting miRNAs like miR-21. These mutations are located in the amino-terminus of DROSHA, which interacts with R-Smads, crucial for miRNA processing modulation by BMP signals. This disruption leads to vascular abnormalities, including dilated and leaky blood vessels (Hata2019Deregulation; Jiang2018Inactivating).

DROSHA mutations are also associated with hematological malignancies. Specific missense mutations, such as I625K, L1047S, and H1170D, have been linked to adult T cell lymphoma-leukemia, B cell pro-lymphocytic leukemia, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, respectively. These mutations can destabilize the DROSHA protein structure and alter its interaction with miRNA, affecting its RNAase activity and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Bug2021Towards).

## Interactions
DROSHA, a ribonuclease III enzyme, is a key component of the Microprocessor complex, which is essential for the processing of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs). DROSHA interacts with DGCR8, a protein containing double-stranded RNA-binding domains, forming a complex that is crucial for pri-miRNA processing. This interaction is specific and necessary for the efficient cleavage of pri-miRNAs, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses (Han2004The).

DROSHA also interacts with itself, forming a complex that includes multiple copies of the protein. This self-interaction was shown through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that DROSHA molecules can associate with one another within the complex (Han2004The). The interaction between DROSHA and DGCR8 is not mediated by single-stranded RNA, as RNase A treatment does not affect the coprecipitation efficiency, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction (Han2004The).

In addition to its role in miRNA processing, DROSHA is involved in DNA repair processes. It participates in the formation of DNA:RNA hybrids at DNA double-strand break sites, facilitating repair through both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining pathways. This function is independent of its role in miRNA biogenesis (Lu2018Drosha).
