# H4C13

## Overview
H4C13 is a gene that encodes the protein H4 clustered histone 13, a variant of histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome in eukaryotic cells. Histone H4 is integral to the structure and function of chromatin, playing a pivotal role in DNA packaging, replication, repair, and transcription regulation. The protein encoded by H4C13 is essential for maintaining chromatin stability and facilitating the proper organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for gene expression regulation and the protection of genetic material (Wang2021The). Alterations in the expression of H4C13 have been associated with various diseases, including Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, as well as differences in male sexual orientation, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Wang2021The; Stacey2024A; Li2022Integrative; Lähteenvuo2024Neurobiological).

## Function
H4C13 encodes a histone protein, specifically histone H4, which is a core component of the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells. Histone H4 plays a critical role in the compaction of chromatin into higher-order structures, which is essential for DNA packaging within the nucleus and the regulation of gene expression (Wang2021The). This protein is involved in various molecular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation, impacting cellular function and organismal development.

In healthy human cells, histone H4, including H4C13, is crucial for maintaining chromatin stability and facilitating the proper organization of chromosomes. The nucleosome structure, formed by histone H4 and other histone proteins, allows for the efficient packaging of DNA, which is necessary for the regulation of gene expression and the protection of genetic material from damage (Wang2021The). The expression of H4C13 is essential for chromatin and chromosome structure stabilization, and its altered expression can lead to variations in chromatin states and chromosome structure, potentially affecting gene regulation and cellular function (Wang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H4C13 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Down's syndrome (DS), H4C13 is significantly down-regulated in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from DS patients. This down-regulation may affect chromatin compaction and higher-order chromosome structures, potentially leading to chromosomal instability and aberrant gene expression regulation in DS hiPSCs (Wang2021The). 

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the gene HIST1H4L, also known as H4C13, is part of a methylation-driven gene risk signature. Hypomethylation of HIST1H4L is associated with PD, suggesting that epigenetic modifications of this gene may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Li2022Integrative).

H4C13 has also been linked to schizophrenia (SCZ). It is one of the genes within the extended HLA region associated with SCZ risk, indicating a potential causal role in the disorder (Stacey2024A).

In the context of male sexual orientation, H4C13 is down-regulated in homosexual men compared to heterosexual men, suggesting a potential role in sexual orientation (Lähteenvuo2024Neurobiological). 

These findings highlight the diverse roles of H4C13 in various conditions, emphasizing the importance of its regulation in maintaining normal cellular functions.
