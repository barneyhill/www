# GAS7

## Overview
GAS7 (growth arrest specific 7) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. The GAS7 protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, primarily due to its role in actin dynamics and membrane remodeling. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it contributes to neuronal development, differentiation, and the maintenance of neural networks. The protein is characterized by its F-BAR domain, which facilitates membrane binding and deformation, and its interactions with other proteins such as N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex, which are crucial for actin polymerization and neurite outgrowth. GAS7 also plays a significant role in clinical contexts, particularly in cancer biology, where its expression levels are linked to tumor metastasis and patient prognosis (You2010Gas7; Chang2018Wildtype; Zhang2016Growth).

## Structure
The GAS7 protein is characterized by its F-BAR domain, which forms a helical-bundle dimer with a shallow concave curvature, noted as one of the flattest among known F-BAR domains (HanawaSuetsugu2019Phagocytosis). This domain is crucial for oligomer formation and interactions with the submembrane region, facilitating the formation of two-dimensional assemblies on membranes, which are essential for its role in phagocytosis (HanawaSuetsugu2019Phagocytosis). The F-BAR domain is involved in membrane binding through electrostatic interactions, with specific residues such as Lys370 and Arg374 playing critical roles (HanawaSuetsugu2019Phagocytosis).

GAS7 also contains WW and SH3 domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The WW domain interacts with N-WASP, a key regulator of actin polymerization, to facilitate neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons (You2010Gas7). The GAS7b isoform, which includes both WW and F-BAR domains, is the main neuronal isoform and is involved in dendritic spine initiation (Khanal2023Gas7).

GAS7 has multiple splice variant isoforms, such as GAS7b, GAS7cb, and GAS7c, which include additional domains like WW and SH3, while GAS7d contains only the F-BAR domain (HanawaSuetsugu2019Phagocytosis). These isoforms contribute to the protein's diverse functional roles in neuronal development and membrane dynamics.

## Function
GAS7 (growth arrest specific 7) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical processes of neuronal development and differentiation. The GAS7 protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation (You2010Gas7; Zhang2016Growth). 

GAS7 interacts with F-actin to enhance actin polymerization, a process essential for the dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton that underpin neurite initiation, outgrowth, and branching (Zhang2016Growth). It also interacts with N-WASP, a key regulator of actin polymerization, in the cortical region of cells and growth cones of hippocampal neurons, facilitating regular neurite outgrowth (You2010Gas7). This interaction is crucial for the formation of membrane protrusions, which are associated with cytoskeleton rearrangement and neuronal differentiation (You2010Gas7).

GAS7 is also involved in maintaining microtubule stability and polymerization, which are critical for neurodevelopment and shaping neural networks (Zhang2016Growth). The protein's domain structure includes an N-terminal Fes/CIP4 homology (FCH) domain and a coiled-coil region, which are important for its function in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal organization (You2010Gas7). These molecular activities contribute to the proper function of neural circuits and are vital for healthy neuronal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GAS7 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in breast cancer. GAS7 expression is regulated by the p53 gene, and mutations in p53, such as R175H, G244D, and R248Q, can lead to decreased GAS7 expression. This reduction is associated with increased tumor metastasis and poorer survival outcomes in breast cancer patients (Chang2018Wildtype). Specifically, the GAS7b isoform acts as a metastasis suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and motility through interactions with CYFIP1, which prevents Rac1-GTP recruitment and actin polymerization (Chang2018Wildtype). Lower expression of GAS7b is linked to early onset breast cancer, particularly in patients diagnosed before the age of 40, and is associated with higher rates of axillary lymph node metastasis and poorer five-year survival rates (Chang2018Wildtype).

The study also highlights that promoter methylation may contribute to reduced GAS7 expression, although no correlation with the age of breast cancer diagnosis was found (Chang2018Wildtype). These findings suggest that GAS7, particularly the GAS7b isoform, could serve as a biomarker for early onset breast cancer, metastasis, and patient prognosis (Chang2018Wildtype).

## Interactions
GAS7 (growth arrest specific 7) is known to interact with N-WASP (Neural-Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This interaction is mediated by the WW domain of GAS7 and the proline-rich region of N-WASP, facilitating actin reorganization and neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons (You2010Gas7). GAS7 and N-WASP co-localize in growth cones of neurons and membrane protrusions, where they recruit the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin polymerization in a Cdc42-independent manner (You2010Gas7). 

GAS7 also interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin clustering and polymerization. This interaction is crucial for the formation of membrane protrusions and dendritic spine initiation (Khanal2023Gas7). The F-BAR domain of GAS7 is involved in membrane deformation and interacts with membrane phospholipids, contributing to its role in actin dynamics and membrane remodeling (HanawaSuetsugu2019Phagocytosis; Zhang2016Growth). These interactions highlight the role of GAS7 in neuronal development and its potential implications in neurological disorders.
