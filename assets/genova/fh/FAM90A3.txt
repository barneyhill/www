# FAM90A3

## Overview
FAM90A3 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A3. This protein family is characterized by its conserved sequence motifs, although the precise biological function of FAM90A3 remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM90A3 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially through its interactions with other proteins and involvement in signaling pathways. While the gene's role in human health and disease is still under investigation, it is hypothesized to contribute to certain regulatory mechanisms within the cell. Further research is needed to clarify its function and potential clinical significance.
