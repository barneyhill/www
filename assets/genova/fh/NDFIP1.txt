# NDFIP1

## Overview
NDFIP1 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a critical adaptor protein involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination. The protein, Nedd4 family interacting protein 1, is primarily associated with the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, playing a pivotal role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This function is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and modulating various signaling pathways. NDFIP1 is particularly significant in immune regulation, where it influences T cell activation and differentiation by modulating the activity of ubiquitin ligases such as Itch. Additionally, it is involved in neuronal metal ion homeostasis, preventing metal toxicity by regulating the degradation of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). The gene's involvement in immune and neuronal functions highlights its importance in both health and disease, with implications for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis (Mund2010Regulation; Oliver2006Ndfip1; Howitt2009Divalent).

## Function
NDFIP1 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 1) is a crucial regulator of protein ubiquitination in healthy human cells. It functions as an adaptor protein that recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Nedd4 and Itch, to their substrates, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular signaling pathways (Mund2010Regulation; Oliver2006Ndfip1).

In the context of immune response, NDFIP1 plays a significant role in modulating T cell activation. It promotes the function of the Itch ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in the degradation of JunB, a protein that influences T cell differentiation. The absence of NDFIP1 leads to increased levels of JunB and a Th2-biased immune response, highlighting its role in preventing excessive T cell activation and inflammation (Oliver2006Ndfip1).

NDFIP1 also regulates metal ion homeostasis in neurons by facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). This action prevents metal toxicity by reducing excessive metal entry into cells, which is crucial for neuronal survival and function (Howitt2009Divalent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NDFIP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in immune-related disorders. NDFIP1 is crucial for regulating T cell activation and preventing excessive immune responses. Mice lacking NDFIP1 develop severe skin and lung inflammation due to defects in T cells, which become overly activated and adopt a T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype, leading to Th2-mediated inflammatory diseases (Oliver2006Ndfip1). In humans, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the NDFIP1 locus are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis, suggesting a role in gastrointestinal inflammation (Ramon2011The).

NDFIP1 also plays a role in multiple sclerosis (MS), where genetic variations affect immune cell metabolism and T cell function. These variations can lead to altered metabolic patterns and immune activation, contributing to disease pathogenesis (LópezCotarelo2021Genetic). Additionally, NDFIP1 is involved in maintaining the stability of regulatory T cells, and its deficiency can lead to autoinflammatory diseases by promoting the conversion of these cells into pro-inflammatory types (Layman2017Ndfip1a). These findings underscore the importance of NDFIP1 in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
NDFIP1 (Nedd4 family interacting protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions, primarily with members of the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. It interacts with the Itch protein, promoting its function as a ubiquitin ligase, which is crucial for the degradation of JunB, a protein involved in T cell activation and differentiation. This interaction helps control T cell activation and prevent Th2 cell-mediated inflammation (Oliver2006Ndfip1).

NDFIP1 also interacts with BRAT1, a protein involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction enhances BRAT1 ubiquitination by Nedd4 family E3 ligases, particularly Itch, and is essential for BRAT1's nuclear trafficking (Low2015Nedd4).

In the immune signaling context, NDFIP1 facilitates the degradation of MAVS by acting as an adaptor for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MAVS, thereby modulating the RLR pathway (Wang2012Ndfip1).

NDFIP1 is also known to interact with LRP10, influencing α-synuclein levels and secretion. This interaction is observed in vesicular structures, suggesting a role in the secretory pathway and α-synuclein processing (Mascaro2023Interactome).
