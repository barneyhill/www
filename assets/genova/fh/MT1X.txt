# MT1X

## Overview
MT1X is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 1X, a member of the metallothionein family known for its role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification. The MT1X gene is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the binding of heavy metals such as zinc, copper, and cadmium, thereby protecting cells from metal toxicity. The protein metallothionein 1X is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it regulates metal ion concentrations and responds to oxidative stress. It plays a significant role in modulating the activity of transcription factors and enzyme activities, influencing processes such as apoptosis and immune responses. MT1X expression is inducible by various stimuli, including heavy metals and oxidative stress, underscoring its importance in cellular defense mechanisms (Dziegiel2016Metallothioneins; Laukens2009Human; Li2008Human; Babula2012Mammalian).

## Structure
MT1X is a member of the metallothionein family, characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the binding of heavy metals such as zinc, copper, and cadmium. The primary structure of MT1X includes a sequence of 61 amino acids, with a notable distribution of 20 cysteine residues that are crucial for metal ion binding (Stennard1994Characterisation). The protein does not contain aromatic acids or stop codons, aligning with the typical structure of functional metallothioneins (Stennard1994Characterisation).

The secondary structure of MT1X is likely composed of beta turns and loops, common in metallothioneins, allowing for the formation of metal-thiolate clusters. The tertiary structure involves a compact arrangement that supports these clusters, although specific details on the tertiary structure of MT1X are not provided in the context.

MT1X lacks a quaternary structure due to its monomeric nature. The gene's promoter region includes regulatory elements such as a conventional TATA box and metal regulatory elements (MREs), which are important for its expression in response to metal exposure (Stennard1994Characterisation). Post-translational modifications may include metal ion binding and potential oxidation of cysteine residues, which are typical for metallothioneins.

## Function
MT1X, a member of the metallothionein family, plays a crucial role in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification in human cells. The protein encoded by the MT1X gene is involved in binding heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium, which helps protect cells from metal toxicity (Laukens2009Human; Li2008Human). MT1X is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in regulating metal ion concentrations and responding to oxidative stress (Li2008Human).

The protein's ability to bind zinc ions is particularly significant, as it influences various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors and enzyme activities. MT1X can modulate the activity of transcription factors like NF-κB and p53, which are involved in apoptosis and immune responses (Dziegiel2016Metallothioneins). By sequestering zinc, MT1X helps maintain zinc homeostasis, which is essential for proper cellular function and protection against oxidative damage (Babula2012Mammalian).

MT1X expression is inducible by various stimuli, including heavy metals and oxidative stress, highlighting its role in cellular defense mechanisms. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health and preventing damage from environmental and physiological stressors (Dziegiel2016Metallothioneins:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MT1X gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MT1X acts as a tumor suppressor and is frequently downregulated. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor progression, and metastasis. Restoring MT1X expression in HCC cells has been shown to hinder tumor growth and improve survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2018Metallothionein).

In prostate cancer, MT1X expression is notably reduced in advanced stages of the disease. This downregulation contrasts with the maintained expression of other metallothionein isoforms, indicating a specific role for MT1X in the progression of prostate cancer (Garrett2000Metallothionein).

MT1X is also involved in drug resistance mechanisms in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Its interaction with TCRP1 contributes to resistance against the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. Alterations in MT1X expression can lead to reduced apoptosis and enhanced DNA repair, complicating treatment efforts. Targeting MT1X and its interactions may offer new therapeutic strategies for overcoming drug resistance in OSCC (Peng2012MicroarrayAssisted).
