# BMPER

## Overview
BMPER (BMP binding endothelial regulator) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for vascular development and endothelial cell differentiation. The BMPER protein is characterized by its structure, which includes multiple cysteine-rich von Willebrand C-like domains and a von Willebrand D domain, facilitating its role as a BMP-binding protein. Functionally, BMPER acts as a context-dependent modulator of BMP activity, capable of both antagonizing and enhancing BMP signaling based on the cellular environment. It plays a significant role in endothelial cell processes such as sprouting, migration, and proliferation, and is involved in the regulation of endothelial inflammation and vascular homeostasis. BMPER's interactions with various proteins, including BMPs and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), underscore its multifaceted role in vascular biology. Clinically, mutations in the BMPER gene are linked to skeletal dysplasias and other conditions, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Moser2003BMPER; Pankratz2023BMPER; Helbing2010BMPER).

## Structure
The BMPER protein is encoded by a cDNA of 3,314 base pairs, translating into a protein of 685 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 76.1 kDa (Moser2003BMPER). The primary structure includes a 39-amino-acid signal peptide at the amino terminus, which is characteristic of secreted proteins (Moser2003BMPER). The protein contains five tandem cysteine-rich von Willebrand C-like domains and a single von Willebrand D domain, which are involved in binding bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and are typical of BMP-binding proteins like Chordin (Moser2003BMPER; Zong2015BMPER). The von Willebrand C domains, particularly the first one, bind BMP2 with high affinity, competing with BMP receptors (Zong2015BMPER).

The tertiary structure is suggested to be rod-like, with disulfide bonds contributing to its rigidity, particularly between residues C84 and C102 in the von Willebrand C domain (Zong2015BMPER). The protein also contains a trypsin inhibitor domain at the carboxyl terminus, which may confer additional functional properties (Moser2003BMPER). Splice variants of BMPER can lead to the loss of certain domains, such as the von Willebrand D domain, affecting its function and interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Zong2015BMPER).

## Function
The BMPER gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is essential for vascular development and endothelial cell differentiation. BMPER acts as a context-dependent modulator of BMP activity, capable of both antagonizing and enhancing BMP signaling depending on the cellular environment (Helbing2010BMPER). In endothelial cells, BMPER is involved in regulating processes such as sprouting, migration, and proliferation by influencing signaling pathways like Akt, Erk, and Smad (Heinke2013Antagonism). 

BMPER is also implicated in the regulation of endothelial inflammation by modulating the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects (Helbing2010BMPER). It is upregulated by statins, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting a role in reducing vascular inflammation (Helbing2010BMPER). 

Additionally, BMPER enhances Notch signaling in endothelial cells, which is crucial for arterial-venous specification and maintaining vascular homeostasis (Esser2018Extracellular). Through these molecular activities, BMPER contributes to the proper development and function of the vascular system in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BMPER gene are associated with several skeletal dysplasias, including diaphanospondylodysostosis (DSD) and ischiospinal dysostosis (ISD). These conditions are characterized by vertebral anomalies, abnormal ossification, and in severe cases, respiratory insufficiency due to thoracic hypoplasia. DSD is often more severe than ISD, frequently resulting in neonatal death due to respiratory failure (Braun2021Expansion; Park2022Successfully). BMPER mutations can also lead to kidney abnormalities, such as nephroblastomatosis and Wilms' tumor, necessitating regular nephrological monitoring in affected individuals (Braun2021Expansion).

Alterations in BMPER expression levels are implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive lung disease. BMPER is highly expressed in IPF lung fibroblasts, contributing to fibroblast activation and lung fibrosis through the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. Demethylation treatments that reduce BMPER expression have been shown to decrease fibroblast invasion and migration, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for IPF (Huan2015Methylationmediated).

The variability in phenotypic expression of BMPER mutations highlights the complexity of its role in disease, with some mutations leading to attenuated forms of skeletal dysplasia, allowing for longer-term survival (Zong2015BMPER; Batey2022Further).

## Interactions
BMPER (BMP binding endothelial regulator) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating various signaling pathways. It binds to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) such as BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP7, and BMP9, influencing their signaling activities. BMPER acts as an antagonist to BMP4, inhibiting BMP-dependent activation of Smad5, which is crucial for endothelial cell differentiation and other developmental processes (Moser2003BMPER).

BMPER also interacts with insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IGFBP4), as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and surface plasmon resonance studies. This interaction does not interfere with BMPER's binding to BMP4 but protects IGFBP4 from proteolytic cleavage by pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), potentially preserving the contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) (Pankratz2023BMPER).

Additionally, BMPER interacts with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), suggesting its involvement in regulating multiple signaling pathways to maintain vSMCs in a contractile state (Pankratz2023BMPER). These interactions highlight BMPER's multifaceted role in vascular biology and its potential therapeutic implications.
