# FBXO11

## Overview
FBXO11 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 11, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, facilitating the targeted degradation of proteins to regulate various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, transcription regulation, and signal transduction (Uddin2016Involvement). F-box protein 11 is characterized by its amino-terminal F-box motif, which is essential for its interaction with SKP1, and a cysteine-rich domain that interacts with Snai1/2 transcription factors (Jin2015FBXO11). The protein is involved in critical cellular functions such as reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acting as a tumor suppressor by targeting oncogenic proteins for degradation (Uddin2016Involvement). Mutations in the FBXO11 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including intellectual disabilities and otitis media, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Rye2011FBXO11; Jansen2019De).

## Structure
FBXO11 is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The protein contains an amino-terminal F-box motif, which is crucial for its interaction with SKP1, a component of the SCF complex (Jin2004Systematic; Jin2015FBXO11). This motif is approximately 40 amino acids long and is a defining feature of the F-box protein family (Jin2004Systematic).

FBXO11 also includes a small cysteine-rich domain, which is primarily responsible for its interaction with the Snai1/2 transcription factors (Jin2015FBXO11). The central region of FBXO11 contains 19 tandem repeats that may form a β-helix fold, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Jin2015FBXO11). At the carboxyl-terminal, FBXO11 features a UBR motif involved in substrate recognition, which is essential for its role in ubiquitination (Jin2015FBXO11).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of F-box proteins, although the interaction between FBXO11 and Snai1 is independent of Snai1 phosphorylation (Jin2015FBXO11; Zhuang2024The). Multiple splice variants of FBXO11 exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions (Jansen2019De).

## Function
FBXO11 (F-box protein 11) is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is essential for the targeted degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, transcription regulation, and signal transduction (Uddin2016Involvement). FBXO11 specifically targets proteins for ubiquitination, a process that tags them for degradation by the proteasome, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis (Uddin2016Involvement).

In healthy human cells, FBXO11 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis by targeting oncogenic proteins like BCL6 for degradation. This activity is crucial for inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptotic cell death, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor (Uddin2016Involvement). FBXO11 also participates in reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the phosphorylation of SNAIL by protein kinase D1, which is significant in preventing cancer metastasis (Uddin2016Involvement). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell differentiation and development (Wen2020miR‑181a‑5p).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBXO11 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. De novo variants in FBXO11 have been linked to a syndromic form of intellectual disability characterized by behavioral problems such as autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and aggression, along with physical dysmorphisms like a thin upper lip and joint hyperlaxity (Jansen2019De). 

FBXO11 is also implicated in otitis media (OM), a common middle ear disease. Genetic studies have identified FBXO11 as a susceptibility gene for severe OM, with specific polymorphisms associated with recurrent acute OM and chronic OM with effusion (Rye2011FBXO11; Segade2006Association). The Jeff mouse model, which carries a mutation in Fbxo11, exhibits conductive deafness due to OM, highlighting the gene's role in immune regulation related to OM (Vikhe2020Mutation).

In hematologic malignancies, FBXO11 is considered a candidate tumor suppressor. Its loss is associated with leukemic transformation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), where it affects pathways related to cell proliferation and differentiation (Schieber2020FBXO11). Reduced expression of FBXO11 is observed in sAML, suggesting its broader role in tumor suppression (Schieber2020FBXO11).

## Interactions
FBXO11 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with the Snail family of transcription factors, specifically Snai1 and Snai2, promoting their ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is independent of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation, distinguishing FBXO11 from other F-box proteins like FBXW1 (Jin2015FBXO11). The C-rich domain of FBXO11 is primarily responsible for binding Snai1, and mutations in this domain can impair its ability to degrade Snail proteins (Jin2015FBXO11).

FBXO11 also interacts with β-catenin, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. It is phosphorylated by NDR1 at Ser187, enhancing its ability to ubiquitinate β-catenin. This phosphorylation-mediated interaction is crucial for regulating β-catenin's stability and nuclear translocation, affecting transcriptional activity and cancer metastasis (Xuan2024NDR1FBXO11). FBXO11's interaction with β-catenin is facilitated by the phosphorylation of β-catenin at specific sites, which promotes binding and subsequent ubiquitination (Xuan2024NDR1FBXO11).

FBXO11 also interacts with JNK2, a protein involved in β-catenin nuclear translocation. FBXO11 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of JNK2, thereby inhibiting β-catenin's nuclear translocation and its downstream effects (Xuan2024NDR1FBXO11).
