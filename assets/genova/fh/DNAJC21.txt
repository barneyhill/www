# DNAJC21

## Overview
DNAJC21 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C21, which is a member of the Hsp40 family of molecular chaperones. This protein is primarily involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a critical process in ribosome biogenesis essential for protein synthesis within cells (D’Amours2018Refining; Ketharnathan2024Loss). DNAJC21 is characterized by a conserved N-terminal J domain and two zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its structural stability and function (Warren2018Molecular). The protein is localized in the nucleus and plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly, as well as in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells and nucleotide metabolism (Ketharnathan2024Loss). Mutations in DNAJC21 are linked to bone marrow failure syndrome type 3 (BMFS3), highlighting its importance in cellular processes fundamental to organismal development and homeostasis (D’Amours2018Refining; ChiritaEmandi2022Case).

## Structure
DNAJC21 is a ubiquitously expressed protein consisting of 531 amino acids. It features a highly conserved N-terminal J domain, approximately 70 amino acids long, which includes four alpha-helices and a conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) tripeptide. This HPD motif is crucial for stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70 chaperones, facilitating the release and recycling of the nuclear export factor Arx1, which is involved in ribosomal subunit maturation (Warren2018Molecular). DNAJC21 also contains two zinc finger domains of the C2H2 type, which contribute to the protein's structural stability and function (Warren2018Molecular).

The secondary structure of DNAJC21 includes 53.83% alpha helices, 4.67% beta sheets, 3.18% beta turns, and 38.32% random coils, with the protein being localized in the nucleus (Yan2021The). Mutations in DNAJC21, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, can lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in reduced protein expression. Missense mutations like p.P32A and p.K34E can alter the J domain's structure, affecting its interaction with Hsp70 and its ATPase activity (Warren2018Molecular). The yeast homologue of DNAJC21, Jjj1, functions similarly in conjunction with the zinc-finger protein Rei1 to stimulate the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 chaperone protein Ssa, facilitating the release of Arx1 (Warren2018Molecular).

## Function
DNAJC21 is a crucial component in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a key step in ribosome biogenesis. This process is essential for protein synthesis within cells, as ribosomes are responsible for translating mRNA into proteins. DNAJC21's role in ribosome assembly is vital for maintaining cellular health and supporting growth (D’Amours2018Refining; Ketharnathan2024Loss). The gene is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it assists in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly, ensuring the proper function and stability of ribosomes (Ketharnathan2024Loss).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, DNAJC21 is implicated in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells, which are essential for the production of blood cells. This function is critical for normal hematopoietic differentiation and cell proliferation (Ketharnathan2024Loss). DNAJC21 is also involved in nucleotide metabolism, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair, as well as for maintaining nucleotide balance within cells (Ketharnathan2024Loss). These activities highlight DNAJC21's importance in cellular processes that are fundamental to organismal development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC21 gene are associated with bone marrow failure syndrome type 3 (BMFS3), a condition characterized by a range of hematological and developmental abnormalities. Individuals with biallelic mutations in DNAJC21 often present with cytopenias, postnatal growth retardation, developmental delays, and various physical abnormalities, including skeletal irregularities, joint hypermobility, and skin or adnexa abnormalities (D’Amours2018Refining; ChiritaEmandi2022Case). These mutations can also lead to recurrent infections, sensorineural hearing impairment, and retinal abnormalities (D’Amours2018Refining).

The condition shares overlapping features with other syndromes such as Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), and Diamond-Blackfan anemia, but is considered distinct due to its unique clinical presentation (D’Amours2018Refining; ChiritaEmandi2022Case). Short telomeres have been observed in most affected individuals, which contrasts with previous reports of normal telomere length in similar conditions (D’Amours2018Refining).

Research using zebrafish models has shown that loss of DNAJC21 leads to cytopenia and impaired ribosomal function, contributing to hematopoietic defects and increased DNA damage (Ketharnathan2024Loss). These findings suggest that DNAJC21 plays a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism and hematopoietic differentiation, with its deficiency potentially leading to conditions like myelodysplastic syndromes (Ketharnathan2024Loss).
