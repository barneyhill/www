# CHST4

## Overview
The CHST4 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 4, a sulfotransferase that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands, which are crucial for lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase due to its function in transferring sulfate groups to specific carbohydrate residues. The protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues within mucin-associated glycans, a modification essential for the proper functioning of selectins and the facilitation of leukocyte trafficking and adhesion (Zhang2020Carbohydrate; Liu2015O). CHST4's expression is notably specific to high endothelial venules (HEVs), where it contributes to the generation of the MECA-79 epitope, significant in chronic inflammatory tissues and certain malignancies (Okado2024CHST4). The gene's expression and activity have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancers and inflammatory diseases, underscoring its importance in immune regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021Multiomics; Zhang2022CHST4).

## Function
The CHST4 gene encodes a sulfotransferase enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of L-selectin ligands, which are essential for lymphocyte homing to secondary lymphoid organs. This process is crucial for immune surveillance and response, as it directs lymphocytes to interact with sulfated glycoprotein ligands on high endothelial venules (HEVs) in lymph nodes (Okado2024CHST4; Yu2018Distinct). CHST4 is specifically expressed in HEVs and is involved in generating the MECA-79 epitope, which is important in chronic inflammatory tissues and malignant tumors (Okado2024CHST4).

At the molecular level, CHST4 catalyzes the transfer of a sulfate group to the carbon 6 hydroxyl group of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues within mucin-associated glycans. This sulfation is a key modification that enables the proper functioning of selectins, facilitating leukocyte trafficking and adhesion (Zhang2020Carbohydrate; Liu2015O). The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the structure and heterogeneity of O-glycans, affecting their elongation and sialylation (Liu2015O). CHST4's activity is crucial for maintaining immune function and preventing tissue injury by regulating lymphocyte movement and adhesion (Okado2024CHST4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHST4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), CHST4 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role in promoting malignancy (Zhang2022CHST4). In hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC), CHST4 expression is downregulated, and its overexpression is associated with better overall and disease-free survival, indicating a potential tumor-suppressing role (Zhang2020Carbohydrate). 

CHST4 is also linked to immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment, recruiting immune cells such as B cells and T cells, which may influence cancer progression (Zhang2020Carbohydrate). In malignant pleural mesothelioma, CHST4 expression is associated with improved overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Okado2024CHST4).

In addition to cancer, CHST4's role in lymphocyte homing is implicated in inflammatory diseases like ulcerative colitis, where its altered expression may affect immune cell migration to inflamed tissues (Wang2021Multiomics). These findings highlight CHST4's significance in both oncological and inflammatory conditions.
