# SQLE

## Overview
The SQLE gene encodes the enzyme squalene epoxidase, a key component in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Squalene epoxidase is a flavoprotein monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-monooxidosqualene, a critical step in the production of lanosterol, which is a precursor to cholesterol (Stevenson2014Squalene; Gill2011Cholesterol-Dependent). This enzyme is categorized as a monooxygenase and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Coates2021The). The regulation of SQLE is tightly controlled at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels, primarily through cholesterol-mediated mechanisms that involve the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Tan2019Differential; Coates2021The). Alterations in SQLE expression have been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Du2023Squalene; Helms2008Squalene).

## Structure
The human squalene epoxidase (SQLE) protein is a 574-amino acid enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 64 kDa, encoded by the SQLE gene located on chromosome 8q24.1 (Zhang2024Squalene). The primary structure of SQLE includes a sequence organized into 11 exons and 10 introns (Zhang2024Squalene). The secondary structure features a combination of alpha helices and beta sheets, with the FAD-binding domain adopting a three-layer ββα sandwich architecture known as the GR2 Rossman fold, and the substrate-binding domain forming a two-layer βα sandwich domain with a seven-stranded β-sheet structure (Padyana2019Structure).

The tertiary structure of SQLE is characterized by a split domain architecture, with FAD and substrate-binding domains interspersed within the primary structure, followed by a helical membrane-binding domain at the C-terminus (Padyana2019Structure). The enzyme is a monomer in solution, although a dimeric form was observed in crystallography, likely as a technical artifact (Padyana2019Structure).

SQLE contains specific domains, including the FAD-binding domain, substrate-binding domain, and a C-terminal helical membrane-binding domain (Brown2019The). The enzyme is regulated by cholesterol levels, which influence its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 (Cirmena2018Squalene). The N-terminal region, particularly the first 100 amino acids, forms a regulatory domain involved in cholesterol-mediated degradation (Zhang2024Squalene).

## Function
Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a crucial enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the conversion of squalene to 2,3(S)-monooxidosqualene, a precursor for lanosterol. This reaction is a key step in the mevalonate pathway, which is dedicated to cholesterol synthesis (Stevenson2014Squalene; Gill2011Cholesterol-Dependent). SQLE is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Coates2021The).

The regulation of SQLE is critical due to the energy and oxygen demands of cholesterol synthesis. It is controlled both transcriptionally and posttranslationally. Transcriptionally, its expression is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are master regulators of cholesterogenic genes (Stevenson2014Squalene; Coates2021The). Posttranslationally, SQLE undergoes cholesterol-dependent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process modulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 (Tan2019Differential; Coates2021The). This degradation is crucial for controlling cholesterol synthesis, as it prevents squalene accumulation and ensures cholesterol homeostasis (Gill2011Cholesterol-Dependent).

The N-terminal domain of SQLE is essential for its regulation, as it is involved in cholesterol-dependent polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Gill2011Cholesterol-Dependent). This regulatory mechanism allows for rapid adaptation to changes in cholesterol levels, ensuring that cholesterol synthesis can be modulated independently from isoprenoid synthesis (Gill2011Cholesterol-Dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SQLE gene, which encodes squalene epoxidase, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, high SQLE expression is associated with poor prognosis and decreased 5-year distant metastasis-free survival, making it an independent predictor of poor outcomes, particularly in early-stage disease (Helms2008Squalene). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, SQLE alterations such as amplifications and mutations correlate with worse overall survival and disease progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (You2022SQLE).

In colorectal cancer, SQLE expression is linked to tumor stage and genetic background, particularly in tumors with p53 mutations and elevated c-MYC expression. High SQLE levels are associated with poor survival in patients with mutant p53, while its inhibition reduces cancer cell viability, suggesting a therapeutic target (Du2023Squalene). In prostate cancer, SQLE is overexpressed in advanced stages and is regulated by miR-205, with its inhibition showing potential as a therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (Kalogirou2021MiR205driven).

SQLE also plays a role in bladder cancer progression through its interactions with the P53 and PTEN/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathways, where its downregulation suppresses tumor growth and promotes apoptosis (Zou2023SQLE). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SQLE in cancer prognosis and therapy.

## Interactions
Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is involved in several interactions that regulate its activity and stability. It interacts with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, which serves as an electron transfer partner necessary for its catalytic function (Brown2019The). SQLE also requires anionic phospholipids and a lipid transfer protein, supernatant protein factor (SPF), for substrate delivery to its active site (Brown2019The).

The enzyme's stability is influenced by its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6, which mediates its degradation. This process is regulated by cholesterol levels, which induce conformational changes in the SQLE N100 regulatory domain, leading to its degradation (Zhang2024Squalene). Squalene, the substrate of SQLE, binds to the N100 region, reducing its interaction with MARCH6 and stabilizing SQLE at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Zhang2024Squalene).

SQLE also plays a role in the NF-κB signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα) through enhanced interaction with beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC), leading to NF-κB activation (Liu2024Squalene). This interaction is significant in the context of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer (Liu2024Squalene).
