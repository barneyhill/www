# GPBP1L1

## Overview
The GPBP1L1 gene encodes the GC-rich promoter binding protein 1 like 1, a protein that is involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in binding to GC-rich promoter regions, thereby influencing the expression of various genes. GPBP1L1 has been implicated in several biological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer progression and cardiac function. Its expression and genetic interactions have been studied in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and stress cardiomyopathy, among others. The protein's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in both normal cellular functions and disease mechanisms (Lacey2018Copy; Yadav2024Exosomal; Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent; Liu2020Associations).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The GPBP1L1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genetic interactions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high expression of GPBP1L1 in HPV-positive exosomes is associated with poorer patient outcomes, as low expression correlates with better survival rates (Yadav2024Exosomal). In breast cancer, GPBP1L1 is involved in gene fusions with MAST2, which are found in a small percentage of cases. These fusions retain functional domains that may contribute to cancer progression (Rumpf2023MicrotubuleAssociated; Veeraraghavan2016Recurrent).

In the context of cardiac function, GPBP1L1 is part of a 455 kb duplication associated with earthquake-induced stress cardiomyopathy (EqSCM), although its direct role in this condition remains unclear (Lacey2018Copy). Additionally, genetic studies have identified intronic SNPs in GPBP1L1 that interact with gut microbiota, potentially influencing hand grip strength, which is a marker of muscle fitness (Liu2020Associations). These findings suggest that GPBP1L1 may play a role in various pathological conditions through its involvement in transcriptional regulation and genetic interactions.
