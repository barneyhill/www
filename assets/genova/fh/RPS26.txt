# RPS26

## Overview
RPS26 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S26, a crucial component of the 40S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. This protein is integral to the process of protein synthesis, facilitating the maturation of 18S rRNA and ensuring the proper assembly and function of ribosomes (Piantanida2022Deficiency). Ribosomal protein S26 is categorized as a structural protein within the ribosome, playing a pivotal role in cellular growth and proliferation by enabling efficient translation of mRNA into proteins. Beyond its primary function in ribosome assembly, RPS26 is involved in the regulation of its own pre-mRNA splicing, indicating a self-regulatory mechanism that may influence mRNA stability and processing (Ivanov2003InteractionofhumanribosomalproteinS26withfragmentsofitsownmRNAandpremRNAinnuclearextractofHeLacells). Mutations in the RPS26 gene are associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, underscoring its significance in erythroid differentiation and highlighting its clinical relevance (Piantanida2022Deficiency).

## Function
RPS26 encodes a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This protein plays a critical role in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key process for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, which are necessary for translating mRNA into proteins (Piantanida2022Deficiency). RPS26 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular growth and proliferation by ensuring efficient protein production.

In addition to its role in ribosome function, RPS26 is involved in the regulation of its own pre-mRNA splicing. It binds specifically to the first intron of its pre-mRNA, potentially influencing splicing or stability, although the exact function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Ivanov2003InteractionofhumanribosomalproteinS26withfragmentsofitsownmRNAandpremRNAinnuclearextractofHeLacells). This binding may involve structural changes that facilitate interactions with nuclear proteins, possibly storing excessive pre-mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein complexes (Ivanov2003InteractionofhumanribosomalproteinS26withfragmentsofitsownmRNAandpremRNAinnuclearextractofHeLacells).

RPS26 also plays a role in erythroid differentiation, as its deficiency can impair this process, leading to conditions such as Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) (Piantanida2022Deficiency). This highlights its importance in maintaining normal ribosomal function and cell viability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPS26 gene are associated with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by anemia due to the failure to produce red blood cells. RPS26 mutations are found in approximately 5.3-11.6% of DBA cases and are linked to defects in ribosome biogenesis, specifically affecting the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Doherty2010Ribosomal; Piantanida2022Deficiency). These mutations can lead to impaired erythroid differentiation, as demonstrated in studies using human erythroid progenitor cell lines, where RPS26 deficiency resulted in decreased levels of erythroid markers and increased apoptosis (Piantanida2022Deficiency).

In DBA patients, RPS26 mutations have been associated with physical malformations, such as cleft lip and palate, although these are rare (Doherty2010Ribosomal). The clinical presentation of RPS26 mutations is heterogeneous, with varying symptoms and malformations among patients (Shi2019Identification). Some patients with RPS26 mutations respond well to steroid treatment, while others do not, indicating variability in treatment response (Doherty2010Ribosomal).

RPS26 mutations have not been linked to cancer or myelodysplastic syndrome, unlike mutations in other ribosomal protein genes, suggesting a unique role for RPS26 in selectively translating mRNAs that may protect against cancer (Piantanida2022Deficiency).

## Interactions
RPS26, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, engages in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In yeast, the Upf1 protein interacts with Rps26, a homolog of human RPS26, through its N-terminal CH domain. This interaction is crucial for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and is independent of other NMD factors (Min2013Yeast). The interaction between Upf1 and Rps26 is direct and does not require other proteins, highlighting the specificity of this binding (Min2013Yeast).

In humans, RPS26 binds to its own pre-mRNA and mRNA, with a higher affinity for the pre-mRNA's first intron. This binding is specific and is enhanced by the presence of recombinant RPS26, suggesting a role in regulating its own splicing (Ivanov2005Human; Ivanov2003InteractionofhumanribosomalproteinS26withfragmentsofitsownmRNAandpremRNAinnuclearextractofHeLacells). RPS26 also interacts with the chaperone Tsr2, which assists in its nuclear import and incorporation into pre-ribosomal particles, a process conserved across species (Pillet2016Hold). These interactions underscore the multifunctional nature of RPS26 in ribosome assembly and mRNA processing.
