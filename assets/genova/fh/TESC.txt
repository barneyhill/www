# TESC

## Overview
The TESC gene encodes tescalcin, a calcium-binding protein that belongs to the EF-hand protein family, characterized by its single EF-hand motif essential for calcium coordination. Tescalcin plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, growth, and gene expression, particularly within the hematopoietic system. It is involved in the regulation of megakaryocytic differentiation and interacts with several proteins, such as the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 and the calcineurin complex, influencing intracellular pH and phosphatase activity, respectively. Tescalcin's interactions extend to cancer biology, where it participates in signaling pathways that enhance cancer cell stemness and resistance to therapy. The expression of the TESC gene is implicated in several cancers and neurological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kolobynina2016Emerging; Levay2007Tescalcin; Hsieh2020TESC).

## Structure
Tescalcin (TESC) is a 24-kDa EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein characterized by a single EF-hand motif in its C-terminal half, which is essential for calcium binding (Kolobynina2016Emerging). The EF-hand motif consists of a helix-loop-helix structure, with the loop containing 12 highly conserved residues crucial for calcium coordination (Kolobynina2016Emerging). The key residue for calcium binding is Asp123, and its mutation to alanine disrupts this function without significantly altering the protein's secondary structure (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

Tescalcin also features unique amino acid inserts that inactivate potential EF-hand motifs, contributing to its distinct structure compared to other calcineurin homologous proteins (Kolobynina2016Emerging). The protein has an N-myristoylation motif, which allows for a Ca2+-induced myristoyl switch, facilitating interactions with cellular membranes (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

In terms of quaternary structure, tescalcin may dimerize, forming pairs of EF-hands to enhance calcium affinity, as suggested by gel filtration experiments (Kolobynina2016Emerging). The protein's ability to bind both Ca2+ and Mg2+ suggests a potential Mg2+-associated form in resting cells (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

## Function
Tescalcin, encoded by the TESC gene, is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell differentiation, growth, and gene expression. It is involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells, particularly in the megakaryocytic lineage, by acting upstream of Ets family transcription factors, such as Fli-1, Ets-1, and Ets-2, which are crucial for megakaryocytic differentiation (Kolobynina2016Emerging; Levay2007Tescalcin). Tescalcin influences the transcription of these genes, and its expression is regulated by the ERK signaling cascade, which promotes megakaryocytic differentiation (Levay2007Tescalcin).

Tescalcin also interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1, stabilizing its mature form on the cell surface and increasing its activity, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular pH and cell volume (Kolobynina2016Emerging). This interaction is modulated by calcium and N-myristoylation of tescalcin. Additionally, tescalcin is involved in pathways that include activation of PKC and ERK1/2, which are essential for the expression of megakaryocyte-specific genes (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

Tescalcin is distributed in soluble, membrane, and nuclear fractions within cells, with a notable concentration in the perinuclear region, suggesting its involvement in nuclear activities (Kolobynina2016Emerging). Its expression levels vary significantly across tissues and developmental stages, indicating its role in various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TESC gene, which encodes the calcium-binding protein tescalcin, have been implicated in various cancers and neurological conditions. In cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive cancer, TESC is highly expressed and associated with larger tumor sizes and poor survival outcomes. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing TESC expression suppresses tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hsieh2020TESC).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TESC expression is upregulated by long non-coding RNA ROR, which inhibits the recruitment of the G9a protein to the TESC promoter. This upregulation is linked to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, highlighting TESC's role in PTC progression (Fan2022Long).

TESC is also involved in pituitary adenoma, where it is regulated by the TUG1/miR-187-3p axis. TESC expression promotes the NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis (Zhang2021Long).

Beyond cancer, TESC mutations and expression alterations have been associated with central nervous system abnormalities, including reduced hippocampal volume and intellectual disabilities, suggesting a role in brain development and psychiatric conditions (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

## Interactions
Tescalcin (TESC) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It associates with the Na+/H+ exchanger type-1 (NHE1), a relationship that enhances the stability and surface presence of NHE1, thereby influencing its activity. This interaction involves the C-terminal domain of NHE1 and is regulated by calcium and N-myristoylation of tescalcin, although calcium is not essential for the interaction itself (Kolobynina2016Emerging; Mailänder2001Human).

Tescalcin also interacts with the calcineurin complex, where it can inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin A, acting similarly to calcineurin B-like proteins (GutierrezFord2003Characterization). It binds to subunit 4 of the COP9 signalosome (CSN4) in a calcium-dependent manner, affecting CSN activity and influencing cell differentiation (Kolobynina2016Emerging).

In cancer biology, tescalcin is involved in the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway by mediating interactions between c-Src and IGF1Rβ. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation of c-Src, FAK, and JAK2, leading to STAT3 activation, which is crucial for enhancing cancer stemness and radioresistant properties (Lee2018TescalcincSrcIGF1Rβmediated). Tescalcin's interaction with c-Fos through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway has been implicated in the progression of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (Zou2022Tescalcin).
