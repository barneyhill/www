# RARS1

## Overview
RARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme arginyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (ArgRS), a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, which plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis. This enzyme is responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA with arginine, a critical step in translating genetic information into functional proteins. ArgRS exists in two isoforms within human cells: a long form that participates in the multi-synthetase complex (MSC) and a short form involved in protein arginylation. The long form is integral to protein biosynthesis, while the short form is associated with protein degradation pathways. Mutations in the RARS1 gene have been linked to Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD), a neurological disorder characterized by hypomyelination. These mutations can affect the structure and function of ArgRS, leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations (Mendes2019RARS1‐related; Li2021Distinct).

## Structure
The RARS1 gene encodes the human cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase (hArgRS), which plays a crucial role in protein biosynthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs with arginine. The protein structure of hArgRS is complex, featuring several functional domains. It includes an N-terminal addition domain (Add1) that interacts with the D-loop of tRNA, a catalytic domain, and two insertion domains (Ins1 and Ins2) that close and connect the Rossmann fold. The C-terminal domain is conserved for binding and recognizing the anticodon loop (Li2021Distinct).

The hArgRS protein exists in two forms in mammalian cells, a long-form and a short-form, produced from alternative translation initiation sites. The long-form is involved in protein biosynthesis, while the short-form is linked to protein arginylation (Li2021Distinct). The presence of an additional N-terminal domain (NTD) in the form within the multi-synthetase complex (MSC) further complicates its structure (Li2021Distinct).

Mutations in the RARS1 gene, such as c.[5A>G] and p.[D2G], affect the structure and function of hArgRS, leading to diseases like Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) (Li2021Distinct). The R512Q mutation, for instance, alters the secondary structure and increases the thermal stability of the enzyme, suggesting a more rigid structure (Li2021Distinct).

## Function
The RARS1 gene encodes the cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS), a crucial enzyme in protein synthesis. ArgRS is responsible for attaching arginine to its corresponding tRNA, a process known as aminoacylation, which is essential for translating genetic information into proteins (Mendes2019RARS1‐related). In healthy human cells, ArgRS exists in two isoforms: a long form and a short form. The long form is part of the multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which includes other tRNA synthetases and accessory proteins, and is involved in protein biosynthesis by supplying Arg-tRNA for translation (Li2021Distinct). The short form, found free in the cytosol, provides Arg-tRNA for protein arginyltransferase, which is involved in protein degradation (Li2021Distinct).

The MSC, including RARS1, plays a critical role in enhancing aminoacylation by forming stable associations of ARSs and tRNAs, which is essential for efficient protein synthesis and cell growth (Kong2020Cell‐based). RARS1 is also involved in the delivery of Arg-tRNA to the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), preventing its dissemination into the cytoplasm, which is crucial for normal protein synthesis (Kong2020Cell‐based).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RARS1 gene, which encodes the human cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthetase (hArgRS), are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD), a hypomyelination disorder of the central nervous system. These mutations can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including delayed motor development, nystagmus, spasticity, ataxia, and intellectual disability (Mendes2019RARS1‐related; Li2021Distinct). The severity of the disease can vary depending on the specific mutation. For instance, mutations in the C-terminal Add2 domain impair protein structure and catalytic activities, leading to severe symptoms, while mutations in the eukaryote-specific N-terminal domain affect protein production, often resulting in milder symptoms (Li2021Distinct).

The most common mutation, c.[5A>G], affects the translation initiation of the long-form hArgRS, although it does not alter the enzyme's structure or aminoacylation activity (Li2021Distinct). Other mutations, such as c.[1367C>T] and c.[1535G>A], affect the Add2 domain, which is crucial for the enzyme's function (Li2021Distinct). These mutations disrupt the normal function of hArgRS, leading to a loss of function and subsequent disease pathology (Li2021Distinct).

## Interactions
RARS1, or arginyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in mammals, which includes interactions with other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and auxiliary proteins. Within the MSC, RARS1 interacts specifically with AIMP1 (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1) and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) (Mendes2019RARS1‐related). The interaction between the N-terminus of AIMP1 and the N-terminus of RARS1 has been observed, suggesting a spatial arrangement that facilitates these interactions (Kong2020Cell‐based).

RARS1 is crucial for the delivery of Arg-tRNA Arg to the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), preventing its dissemination into the cytoplasm, which is essential for normal protein synthesis and cell growth (Kong2020Cell‐based). The MSC serves as a reservoir for components with noncanonical functions and supports subcellular translocations, indicating that RARS1 may have roles beyond its enzymatic activity (Kong2020Cell‐based).

Mutations in RARS1 can disrupt its incorporation into the MSC, as seen with the p.(Asp2Gly) variant, which leads to a significant reduction in MSC expression and affects RARS1's interaction with the complex (Nafisinia2017Mutations). These interactions are critical for maintaining the stability and function of the MSC and its components.
