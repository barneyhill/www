# IFIT5

## Overview
The IFIT5 gene encodes the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5, a cytoplasmic protein that plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and enable the binding of 5′-triphosphate-bearing RNAs, a common viral signature (Abbas2013Structural; Feng2013Crystal). IFIT5 acts as a scaffolding protein, enhancing the recruitment and activation of IκB kinase (IKK) by interacting with transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), thereby promoting NF-κB activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zheng2015IFIT5). The expression of IFIT5 is inducible by interferons and viral infections, underscoring its role in antiviral responses and inflammation regulation (Zheng2015IFIT5). Additionally, alterations in IFIT5 expression have been implicated in various cancers, where it may act as an oncogene, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (Huang2019The; Zhao2023The).

## Structure
The human IFIT5 protein, encoded by the IFIT5 gene, is characterized by its structural motifs known as tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The crystal structure of full-length human IFIT5, consisting of 482 amino acids, has been determined at a resolution of 2.1 Å. The protein is composed of 24 α-helices organized into 11 tandem TPR motifs, forming a 'V'-like structure (Feng2013Crystal). These helices are arranged into three distinct subdomains, creating a closed clamp-shaped structure (Abbas2013Structural).

Subdomain I is capped by helices a1 and a2 and contains a conserved Cys-His-Phe-Thr-Trp motif. Subdomain II forms a canonical four-TPR-repeat domain, while Subdomain III includes two typical TPRs followed by an interrupting helix, forming an S-shaped appendage (Abbas2013Structural). The inner surface of the structure is enriched with positively charged residues, facilitating nucleotide binding (Feng2013Crystal).

IFIT5 specifically binds 5′-triphosphate-bearing RNAs (PPP-RNAs) in a non-sequence-specific manner, with a deep pocket lined with positively charged residues suitable for nucleic acid accommodation (Abbas2013Structural). The protein undergoes a conformational change upon RNA binding, resulting in a more compact structure (Abbas2013Structural). The study does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of IFIT5 (Feng2013Crystal).

## Function
IFIT5 is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune responses. IFIT5 enhances the phosphorylation and activation of IκB kinase (IKK) by interacting with transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and IKK, facilitating the recruitment of IKK to TAK1. This interaction leads to increased NF-κB activation, which is important for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8 and ICAM-1 (Zheng2015IFIT5). 

In healthy human cells, IFIT5 acts as a positive regulator of NF-κB signaling by promoting the phosphorylation of IKK subunits IKKα and IKKβ, which are essential for the degradation of IκBα. This process allows NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes (Zheng2015IFIT5). IFIT5 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with TAK1 and IKKβ, enhancing the immune response during viral infections by facilitating key signaling interactions in the NF-κB pathway (Zheng2015IFIT5). 

The expression of IFIT5 is inducible by interferons and viral infections, suggesting its role in both basal and induced activation of IKK, contributing to the regulation of inflammation and antiviral responses (Zheng2015IFIT5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFIT5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, IFIT5 acts as an oncogene by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and invasion. It achieves this by downregulating miR-99a, which targets ICAM1, a gene involved in cell adhesion, thereby increasing ICAM1 expression and contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Huang2019The). In renal cell carcinoma, IFIT5 enhances cancer invasion by regulating tumor suppressor microRNAs such as miR-363 and miR-128, which are linked to EMT (Pidugu2019Emerging). In prostate cancer, IFIT5 expression is inversely correlated with miR-363 expression, promoting cancer progression by inducing EMT (Pidugu2019Emerging).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression levels of IFIT5 are associated with poor prognosis. IFIT5 is involved in pathways related to apoptosis and cancer, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in immune regulation and potential immune escape mechanisms (Zhao2023The). These findings indicate that IFIT5 could serve as a diagnostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
IFIT5 interacts with viral and cellular RNA, specifically recognizing and binding to uncapped 5′-triphosphate RNA, a common viral signature. The protein forms a complex with RNA, where the 5′-triphosphate group is nestled within a positively charged pocket of IFIT5, allowing it to accommodate any 5′-PPP-RNA sequence. This interaction is non-sequence specific, with the first two nucleotides of the RNA stably bound within the pocket, while the third and fourth nucleotides protrude (Abbas2013Structural).

IFIT5 also participates in protein-protein interactions, particularly within the NF-κB signaling pathway. It interacts with IκB kinases (IKKs) and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), enhancing the recruitment of IKK to TAK1, which is crucial for NF-κB activation. This interaction promotes the phosphorylation of IKK, leading to the activation of NF-κB and the expression of target genes involved in immune responses (Zheng2015IFIT5). IFIT5 acts as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the formation of the TAK1-IKK complex, which is essential for the full activation of NF-κB signaling in response to stimuli such as TNF-α and viral infections (Zheng2015IFIT5).
