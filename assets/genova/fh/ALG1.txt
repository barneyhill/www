# ALG1

## Overview
The ALG1 gene encodes the enzyme ALG1 chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase, a crucial component in the N-glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is classified as a β-1,4 mannosyltransferase and is integral to the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, which are essential for proper protein folding and stability in eukaryotic cells. The ALG1 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and its ability to form oligomeric complexes with other mannosyltransferases, such as Alg2 and Alg11. These interactions facilitate the sequential addition of mannose residues, a critical step in the formation of mature lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Mutations in the ALG1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG1-CDG, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal health (Gao2004Physical; Grubenmann2004Deficiency; Xu2018Structural).

## Structure
The ALG1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model for understanding the human ALG1 gene, is a β-1,4 mannosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. The primary structure of ALG1 consists of 449 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 51.9 kDa (Albright1990The). The protein features a hydrophobic N-terminal region, predicted to function as a transmembrane domain (TMD), which is crucial for its orientation on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Albright1990The; Xu2018Structural).

The secondary structure includes two distinct Rossmann-fold domains, typical of GT-B glycosyltransferases, spanning from R40 to H449 (Xu2018Structural). The tertiary structure of ALG1 shows high similarity to the E. coli UDP-GlcNAc transferase MurG, a member of the GT-B superfamily, with a conserved catalytic domain at the C-terminus (Xu2018Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, ALG1 forms oligomeric complexes and interacts with other mannosyltransferases, such as Alg2 and Alg11, indicating a higher-order structure essential for its function in glycosylation processes (Gao2004Physical). The protein's ability to homo-oligomerize is facilitated by a C-terminal domain crucial for its homodimerization (Gao2004Physical).

## Function
The ALG1 gene encodes a β-1,4 mannosyltransferase enzyme that plays a critical role in the N-glycosylation pathway, a process essential for proper protein folding and stability in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the addition of the first mannose residue to the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide (DLO) precursor, GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, forming Man1GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. This step occurs on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is crucial for the synthesis of mature lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) (Li2017Quantitative; Grubenmann2004Deficiency).

ALG1 functions as part of a multi-enzyme complex with Alg2 and Alg11, facilitating the sequential addition of mannose residues to form the Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol intermediate. This intermediate is then translocated into the ER lumen for further elongation and processing (Xu2018Structural). The enzyme's activity is highly dependent on its membrane topology, which ensures the correct orientation and interaction with substrates, maintaining the fidelity of the glycosylation process (Xu2018Structural).

Mutations in the ALG1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal health (Grubenmann2004Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG1 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically ALG1-CDG, also known as CDG-Ik. This rare multisystem disease is characterized by impaired synthesis, transfer, and processing of sugars, leading to hypoglycosylation of proteins. Clinical manifestations of ALG1-CDG include developmental delays, neurological symptoms such as seizures and intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia, and multiorgan involvement (GonzálezDomínguez2021ALG1CDG; Harshman2016Congenital). 

Patients with ALG1-CDG may also present with cortical-subcortical frontotemporal atrophy, hypoplasia of the frontal lobes, ventriculomegaly, and other neurological abnormalities (GonzálezDomínguez2021ALG1CDG). Additional symptoms can include abnormal fat distribution, strabismus, coagulation abnormalities, and in some cases, congenital nephrotic syndrome and renal failure (Harshman2016Congenital). 

The disorder is caused by various mutations in the ALG1 gene, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations, which can lead to non-functional alternative splicing and reduced enzyme activity (GonzálezDomínguez2021ALG1CDG; Morava2012Defining). The presence of a pathognomonic N-linked mannose-deprived tetrasaccharide in serum glycoproteins is a biochemical marker for ALG1-CDG (GonzálezDomínguez2021ALG1CDG).

## Interactions
ALG1, a β-1,4 mannosyltransferase, is involved in the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum. It physically interacts with other mannosyltransferases, specifically ALG2 and ALG11, forming oligomeric complexes that are crucial for the biosynthetic pathway. These interactions facilitate the sequential addition of mannose residues, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the process by limiting substrate diffusion distance (Gao2004Physical).

ALG1 can form homodimers, a property not shared by ALG2 and ALG11, which do not self-assemble. The C-terminal domain of ALG1 is essential for its homodimerization, as demonstrated by the alg1-1 mutation, which truncates the C-terminal 16 amino acids and abolishes this ability (Gao2004Physical). Despite this, ALG1 can still interact with ALG2 and ALG11, suggesting that different domains mediate these interactions (Gao2004Physical).

The stoichiometry of the ALG1, ALG2, and ALG11 complex is 2:1:1, respectively, indicating that ALG1 is a central component in these complexes (Xu2018Structural). These interactions are specific, as shown by the lack of co-precipitation with other endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins (Gao2004Physical).
