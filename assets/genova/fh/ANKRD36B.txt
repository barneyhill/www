# ANKRD36B

## Overview
ANKRD36B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 36B protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The ANKRD36B protein is involved in several biological pathways and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and diabetic kidney disease. It is also associated with certain cancers, including ovarian granulosa cell tumors and medullary breast carcinoma, although its precise role in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated. The protein's structure, including its potential post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, suggests a complex regulatory mechanism that may influence its function and interactions within the cell (Pan2022A; Kostianets2012Serological; Kim2022Wholeexome; Cao2023Plasma).

## Structure
ANKRD36B encodes a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. The primary structure of the ANKRD36B protein is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form these ankyrin repeat domains. These domains typically contribute to the protein's secondary structure, which may include alpha helices and beta sheets, common features of ankyrin repeats. The tertiary structure of ANKRD36B involves the overall three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its functional conformation and interaction capabilities. While the quaternary structure would refer to the assembly of multiple protein subunits, if applicable, specific details on this aspect are not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms can influence the function and interactions of the ANKRD36B protein. These modifications may alter the protein's stability, localization, or interaction with other cellular components, although specific types of modifications are not detailed in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms suggests that the ANKRD36B gene may produce multiple protein variants, potentially with distinct functional roles or regulatory mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD36B has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased expression of ANKRD36B is significantly correlated with greater hippocampal atrophy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for AD progression, particularly in relation to brain atrophy (Cao2023Plasma). The gene is also centrally located in a gene module associated with ankyrin-binding pathways in AD, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Cao2023Plasma).

In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), ANKRD36B is listed among pivotal genes related to the condition, although specific clinical significance in DKD is not detailed (Pan2022A). The gene has also been identified in ovarian granulosa cell tumors, with tumor-specific nonsynonymous variants found in association with ovarian cancer, though its precise role remains unclear (Kim2022Wholeexome).

ANKRD36B has been mentioned in the context of medullary breast carcinoma as a tumor-associated antigen, but its function and clinical significance in this cancer type are not well-defined (Kostianets2012Serological). Overall, while ANKRD36B is associated with various conditions, further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.
