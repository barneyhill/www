# PGAP2

## Overview
The PGAP2 gene encodes the protein post-GPI attachment to proteins 2, which is a Golgi/ER-resident membrane protein involved in the lipid remodeling of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. This protein plays a critical role in the maturation and stable expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface, which are essential for various cellular processes, including communication and signaling. PGAP2 is particularly important for the addition of stearic acid to the GPI anchor, a modification necessary for the proper anchoring and function of GPI-APs. Deficiencies in PGAP2 function can lead to a range of cellular and clinical abnormalities, including the secretion of GPI-APs and the development of hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3) (Tashima2006PGAP2; Lukacs2019Glycosylphosphatidylinositol; Naseer2016A).

## Function
The PGAP2 gene encodes a Golgi/ER-resident membrane protein that is crucial for the correct processing and stable expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface. PGAP2 is involved in the lipid remodeling steps of GPI-anchor maturation, specifically catalyzing the addition of stearic acid to the GPI anchor. This process is essential for the proper anchoring of GPI-APs to the cell surface, ensuring their stable expression and function in cellular communication and signaling (Tashima2006PGAP2; Lukacs2019Glycosylphosphatidylinositol).

In the absence of functional PGAP2, cells exhibit a deficiency in GPI-APs on the cell surface, leading to a functional GPI deficiency. This deficiency results in the secretion of GPI-APs into the culture medium due to the conversion of the GPI anchor to lyso-GPI before exiting the trans-Golgi network, followed by cleavage by a phospholipase D after transport to the plasma membrane (Tashima2006PGAP2).

PGAP2 is also involved in the transport and integration of GPI-APs into membrane microdomains, or rafts, which are involved in signaling, sorting, and trafficking processes. This role is crucial for the function of over 150 different proteins in mammalian cells (Tashima2006PGAP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PGAP2 gene are associated with hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome-3 (HPMRS3), also known as Mabry syndrome. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, poor motor development, poor speech, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, sensorineural hearing loss, and microcephaly (Naseer2016A). Specific mutations, such as c.191C>T (p.Ala64Val) and c.881C>T (p.Thr294Met), have been identified in affected individuals, leading to defects in the molecular function of the PGAP2 protein (Thompson2020A; Naseer2016A).

The PGAP2 gene is crucial for the lipid remodeling steps of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor maturation, which is essential for the proper expression of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface. Mutations in PGAP2 disrupt this process, resulting in the clinical manifestations of HPMRS3 (Naseer2016A). Studies have shown that these mutations can lead to decreased expression of GPI-anchored proteins, contributing to the phenotypic spectrum associated with the disorder (Thompson2020A).

In some cases, PGAP2 mutations have been identified alongside variants in other genes, such as PGAP3, suggesting potential digenic inheritance patterns that complicate the diagnosis and understanding of the condition (Thompson2023Excluding).

## Interactions
PGAP2 is involved in the processing and expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) and plays a crucial role in their fatty acid remodeling. While specific protein-protein interactions involving PGAP2 are not extensively detailed in the available literature, it is known to interact functionally with other proteins in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway. PGAP2, along with PGAP3, is involved in the remodeling of GPI-APs, which is essential for their integration into lipid rafts, a process that enhances the affinity of GPI-APs for these microdomains important for signal transduction and trafficking (Maeda2011Structural).

PGAP2 is also suggested to be part of a complex that includes PGAP1 and PGAP3, where it may function as a transporter for the donor substrate of the acyl chain, although it lacks known catalytic domains (Maeda2011Structural). The interaction between PGAP2 and these proteins is crucial for the proper surface expression and stability of GPI-APs, as PGAP2 deficiency leads to improper processing and secretion of these proteins (Tashima2006PGAP2). Despite the lack of detailed interaction studies, PGAP2's role in the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway suggests it may participate in multiprotein complexes essential for the cellular localization and function of GPI-anchored proteins.
