# HSPG2

## Overview
The HSPG2 gene encodes the protein heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, commonly known as perlecan, which is a large, multidomain proteoglycan integral to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Perlecan is categorized as a heparan sulfate proteoglycan and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by acting as a molecular scaffold. It facilitates interactions with various growth factors and morphogens, contributing to processes such as angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and growth factor signaling (KirnSafran2009Multifunctionality; Whitelock2011Heparan). The protein's modular structure allows it to bind and cross-link different ECM components, influencing the formation and maintenance of basement membranes, which are essential for proper tissue and organ development (Martinez2018Modular). Mutations in the HSPG2 gene are associated with several skeletal disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Basit2017Exome; ArikawaHirasawa2002Structural).

## Structure
The HSPG2 gene encodes perlecan, a large multidomain heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a core protein of approximately 467 kDa. The primary structure of perlecan includes five distinct domains, each with specific structural motifs and functions. Domain I is unique to HSPG2 and contains three heparan sulfate chains and potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites (Murdoch1992Primary). Domain II is homologous to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, featuring cysteine-rich repeats (Murdoch1992Primary). Domain III shares homology with the laminin A chain and includes laminin epidermal growth factor-like domains (Martinez2018Modular). Domain IV is the largest, with 21 immunoglobulin-type repeats, and is involved in interactions with extracellular matrix components (Martinez2018Modular; Murdoch1992Primary). Domain V contains laminin G and epidermal growth factor motifs (Murdoch1992Primary).

The secondary structure of perlecan features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its complex folding in the tertiary structure. Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and sulfation, which can increase the molecular weight to over 850 kDa (Murdoch1992Primary). Perlecan can be substituted with heparan, chondroitin, or keratan sulfate, and its function varies based on cellular context and post-translational modifications (Martinez2018Modular).

## Function
The HSPG2 gene encodes perlecan, a large heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of healthy human cells. Perlecan is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by acting as a molecular scaffold that localizes heparan sulfate chains within tissues, facilitating interactions with growth factors and morphogens (Whitelock2011Heparan). It is essential for the formation and maintenance of basement membranes, which are critical for proper tissue and organ development (KirnSafran2009Multifunctionality).

Perlecan's modular structure allows it to bind and cross-link various ECM components and cell surface molecules, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and growth factor signaling (Martinez2018Modular). It plays a significant role in cardiovascular, neural, and cartilaginous tissue formation, preserving the integrity of the ECM and controlling signaling pathways that affect cellular phenotype (Martinez2018Modular). Perlecan is also involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration, with its activity being context-dependent and influenced by post-translational modifications and proteolytic processing (Martinez2018Modular). Its interactions with proteins like laminin and collagen IV highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue structure and function (KirnSafran2009Multifunctionality).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes the proteoglycan perlecan, are associated with several skeletal disorders. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is characterized by myotonia, chondrodysplasia, and distinct facial features. Patients with SJS experience skeletal abnormalities such as reduced stature, facial dimorphism, and shortened long bones. This condition is linked to reduced levels of perlecan secretion into the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Martinez2018Modular; ArikawaHirasawa2002Structural). Dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH), is a severe neonatal lethal disorder caused by functional null mutations in HSPG2, leading to a complete lack of perlecan secretion. Clinical features include dwarfism, short and bowed limbs, and encephalocele (Martinez2018Modular; ArikawaHirasawa2002Structural).

HSPG2 mutations are also implicated in other conditions. A missense mutation in HSPG2 has been linked to idiopathic scoliosis, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance (Basit2017Exome). Additionally, HSPG2 mutations have been associated with improved outcomes in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, potentially due to increased immune cell infiltration and higher tumor mutational burden (Zhang2022HSPG2).

## Interactions
The HSPG2 gene encodes perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that participates in various physical interactions with proteins within the extracellular matrix (ECM). Perlecan interacts with basement membrane proteins such as laminin 1, fibronectin, nidogen, PRELP, and collagen IV through its core protein or heparan sulfate chains, contributing to the structural integrity of the basement membrane (FarachCarson2011HSPG2). The endorepellin domain of perlecan interacts with cell surface integrins, specifically alpha2beta1, forming complexes that link the ECM with cells, which is crucial for maintaining basement membrane structure and cell signaling (FarachCarson2011HSPG2).

Perlecan also binds to heparin-binding growth factors such as VEGF, HB-EGF, and FGF-2, as well as hedgehog proteins, defining a complex 'interactome' that influences growth factor delivery and receptor signaling (FarachCarson2007Perlecan). The degradation of perlecan can generate bioactive fragments like endorepellin, which has anti-angiogenic properties and interacts with VEGFR2 and alpha2beta1 integrin, inhibiting pro-angiogenic pathways (Neill2021A). These interactions highlight perlecan's role as a multifunctional scaffold in the ECM, influencing processes such as angiogenesis, cell differentiation, and tissue remodeling (FarachCarson2011HSPG2; Neill2021A).
