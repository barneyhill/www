# SESN3

## Overview
SESN3 is a gene that encodes the protein sestrin 3, which is a member of the sestrin family of stress-inducible proteins. Sestrin 3 is primarily involved in cellular stress response and metabolic regulation, functioning as an antioxidant and playing a critical role in the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. This protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein that contributes to cellular protection against oxidative stress and regulates metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. SESN3's interactions with various cellular pathways, such as the GATOR2 complex and Smad3, underscore its involvement in amino acid sensing, adipogenesis, and cancer signaling pathways. Alterations in SESN3 expression have been linked to several diseases, including epilepsy, liver cancer, and drug resistance in colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2017Recent; Lin2021SESN3; Dalina2018Sestrins).

## Function
SESN3 (sestrin 3) is a protein involved in cellular stress response and metabolic regulation. It plays a crucial role in the inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway, which is important for regulating cell growth, proliferation, and autophagy. SESN3 achieves this by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn inhibits mTORC1, thereby preventing its activation and promoting autophagy (Wang2017Recent; Dalina2018Sestrins).

SESN3 is also involved in antioxidant defense by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. It acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells against oxidative stress and promoting the recycling of peroxiredoxin, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Choi2015Identification; Wang2017Recent). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular protection against oxidative damage and stress-induced damage (Dalina2018Sestrins).

In addition to its role in stress response, SESN3 is involved in metabolic regulation, particularly in glucose metabolism. It has been shown to protect against insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, suggesting a protective role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Wang2017Recent). SESN3's regulation by forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors further underscores its role in cellular stress responses and metabolic processes (Chen2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in SESN3 expression or function have been implicated in several diseases. In epilepsy, SESN3 is identified as a key regulator of a proconvulsant gene network in the human epileptic hippocampus. It influences the expression of proinflammatory molecules like IL-1b and TNF-a, which are involved in neuronal excitability and seizure propagation. Knockdown of SESN3 in animal models has shown a reduction in seizure activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for epilepsy (Johnson2015Systems; Lovisari2020Implication).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SESN3 expression levels have been associated with tumor progression. SESN3 deficiency in knockout mice led to more severe tumor phenotypes and increased metastasis, indicating its protective role against liver cancer progression (Liu2019Sesn3).

SESN3 also plays a role in drug resistance in colorectal cancer. It is upregulated in irinotecan-resistant cancer cells, and its knockdown enhances the cytotoxicity of the drug, suggesting that SESN3 contributes to chemotherapy resistance (Choi2015Identification).

In neuroblastoma, SESN3 is involved in FOXO3-mediated chemoprotection, where its expression is crucial for cell survival during drug treatment (Rupp2017FOXO3mediated).

## Interactions
Sestrin 3 (SESN3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. SESN3 interacts with the GATOR2 complex, acting upstream of the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for proteasome translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol in response to amino acid starvation (Livneh2024Inhibition). This interaction positions SESN3 as a mediator in the sensing of aromatic amino acids, such as tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine, which are involved in mTOR signaling (Livneh2024Inhibition).

SESN3 also interacts with Smad3, inhibiting its activity and thereby relieving the suppression of microRNA-124 (miR-124), which regulates pre-adipocyte adipogenesis (Lin2021SESN3). This interaction is significant in the context of adipogenesis, as Smad3 is an inhibitor of miR-124 by binding to its promoter (Lin2021SESN3).

In the context of liver cancer, SESN3 interacts with Gli2, a component of the hedgehog signaling pathway. This interaction is suggested to inhibit Gli2's nuclear localization, indicating a regulatory role of SESN3 in hedgehog signaling and cancer stem cell regulation (Liu2019Sesn3). These interactions highlight SESN3's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
