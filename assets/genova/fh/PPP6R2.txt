# PPP6R2

## Overview
PPP6R2 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunit 2, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, playing a significant role in modulating the activity of the catalytic subunit PPP6C within the PP6 holoenzyme. The PP6 complex is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. PPP6R2 is particularly noted for its involvement in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and its expression in diverse tissues such as the testis, liver, heart, brain, and kidney, indicating its broad functional significance (Ziembik2017Functions; Dembic2021PPP6R2).

## Structure


## Function
PPP6R2 encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, PPP6R2 functions as a regulatory subunit that associates with the catalytic subunit of PP6, known as PPP6C, to form a multimeric holoenzyme complex. This complex is crucial for modulating mitotic entry and progression by dephosphorylating specific substrates, thereby influencing cell cycle regulation (Dembic2021PPP6R2).

PPP6R2 is highly expressed in immune cells, such as T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, suggesting a significant role in immune signaling pathways. It is also involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it helps to dephosphorylate components like IκBε, thus opposing NF-κB activation and potentially influencing immune responses (Ziembik2017Functions).

The protein is active in various tissues, with the highest mRNA expression levels found in the testis, liver, heart, brain, and kidney. This widespread expression pattern indicates that PPP6R2 may have diverse roles in different cellular contexts, contributing to the regulation of cellular homeostasis and signaling (Ziembik2017Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP6R2 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In the context of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), PPP6R2 has been identified as a novel candidate gene. Whole exome sequencing of families with DDH revealed two rare missense mutations in PPP6R2, which co-segregated with the disease in multiple families, suggesting a potential genetic link to DDH (Dembic2021PPP6R2). The study suggests that these mutations may disrupt normal mechanotransduction processes, contributing to the development of DDH (Dembic2021PPP6R2).

In neurological disorders, PPP6R2 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with seizures in Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS). This syndrome is characterized by a range of neurological features, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. The gene's involvement in seizures highlights its potential role in the pathogenesis of PMS (Shah2023Brain).

Additionally, PPP6R2 is located in a chromosome 22 interval that includes genes involved in the MAP kinase pathway, which is significant in various cellular processes. Alterations in this region have been noted in studies of uterine serous carcinoma, although specific implications for PPP6R2 in this context are not detailed (Zhao2013Landscape).

## Interactions
PPP6R2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms part of the PP6 holoenzyme complex by associating with the catalytic subunit PPP6C and other regulatory subunits such as PPP6R1 and PPP6R3. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including mitotic entry and progression (Rusin2015Quantitative; Stefansson2008Protein).

PPP6R2 interacts with ARS-A, a protein that aids in the formation of PP6 holoenzymes, and this interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the PP6 complex (Stefansson2008Protein). In the context of viral infections, PPP6R2 has been shown to interact with the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), suggesting a role in viral replication. This interaction is facilitated by the regulatory subunits, which enhance the binding of the catalytic subunit to the viral polymerase complex (York2014Interactome).

PPP6R2 also plays a role in the NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with IκBε, thereby reducing its phosphorylation and limiting NF-κB activation (Ziembik2017Functions). Additionally, PPP6R2 is involved in TNFα-mediated cell death pathways, where it is recruited to complex I and influences the activation of RIPK1 and c-FLIP L (Wu2022PP6).
