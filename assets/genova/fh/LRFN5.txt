# LRFN5

## Overview
LRFN5 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 5, commonly referred to as SALM5. This protein is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in synaptic function and neural development. SALM5 is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an immunoglobulin domain, and a fibronectin type III domain, which are essential for its function in cell-cell interactions and synapse formation (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Liu2019Synaptic). As a synaptic adhesion molecule, SALM5 interacts with LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), facilitating synaptic differentiation and maintenance (Choi2016SALM5). The gene is predominantly expressed in the brain and is implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Lybæk2021LRFN5; Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Structure
The LRFN5 gene encodes the protein SALM5, which is characterized by a complex molecular structure. SALM5 is a type I transmembrane protein featuring an extracellular region composed of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Liu2019Synaptic). The LRR domain of SALM5 forms a solenoid structure with a concave side lined with ten long parallel β-strands and a convex side comprising variable loops, short β-strands, and 3 10 helical segments (Lin2018Structural). This domain is stabilized by disulfide bonds and is crucial for dimerization, which is essential for its synaptogenic activity (Lin2018Structural; Liu2019Synaptic).

SALM5 primarily exists as a dimer, with its LRR domains packed in an antiparallel fashion, allowing it to form a 2:2 heterotetrameric complex with LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) (GotoIto2018Structural; Lin2018Structural). This dimerization is critical for its role in synaptic differentiation and is mediated by specific molecular interfaces involving hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Lin2018Structural). The absence of a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif in SALM5 distinguishes it from other SALM family members, suggesting diverse functional roles (Choi2016SALM5).

## Function
The LRFN5 gene encodes a protein that is integral to synaptic function and neural development in healthy human cells. This protein, also known as synaptic adhesion-like molecule 5 (SALM5), is part of a family of transmembrane proteins that play a crucial role in the development, organization, and plasticity of synapses. LRFN5 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it contributes to neurite outgrowth and synapse formation (Xu2023LRFN5; Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN5 contains an extracellular region with leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and a fibronectin type III domain, which are involved in cell-cell interactions necessary for neuronal development and synapse formation. It can induce both inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic differentiation in nearby neuronal cells, a process essential for brain development and function (Xu2023LRFN5; Johnston2019Identification).

The protein interacts with LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), which are involved in synaptic differentiation and maintenance. These interactions are crucial for LRFN5's role in synaptic adhesion and synaptogenic activity, influencing synaptic strength and transmission (Choi2016SALM5; Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRFN5 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. LRFN5 is frequently associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Single nucleotide polymorphism analyses have identified a chromosomal locus on 14q21.1 between FBXO33 and LRFN5 as a risk factor for ASD. A balanced de novo translocation resulting in reduced LRFN5 expression was found in a girl with autism and intellectual disability (Lie2018SALMLrfn). Structural changes in the LRFN5 locus, such as a 172 kb deletion upstream, have been associated with autism in males, suggesting a potential genetic susceptibility linked to this haplotype (Lybæk2021LRFN5).

LRFN5 has also been implicated in other conditions, including developmental delay, learning disability, seizures, microcephaly, and schizophrenia-related copy number variations (Lie2018SALMLrfn). In a case study, a balanced translocation led to heterochromatinization of the LRFN5 locus, significantly reducing its expression and potentially contributing to severe autism (de2010Severe). The gene's dysregulation may also be linked to severe progressive autism due to long-range epigenetic silencing (de2010Severe). These findings highlight the complex role of LRFN5 in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
LRFN5, also known as SALM5, is a synaptic adhesion molecule that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in synaptic development and function. It interacts trans-synaptically with the LAR family receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), including LAR, PTPδ, and PTPσ, in a splicing-dependent manner. These interactions are mediated by the immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of LAR-RPTPs, and specific splice inserts such as meA and meB can modulate these interactions (Choi2016SALM5; Lie2018SALMLrfn). 

SALM5 forms a dimer through its N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which interacts with PTPδ, forming a 2:2 stoichiometry complex. This interaction is crucial for its synaptogenic activity, promoting presynaptic differentiation (Lie2018SALMLrfn). SALM5 can also engage in homophilic interactions, potentially affecting its trans-synaptic interactions with LAR-RPTPs (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN5 is involved in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, influencing AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission through its interaction with LAR-RPTPs (Choi2016SALM5). These interactions are significant in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Choi2016SALM5).
