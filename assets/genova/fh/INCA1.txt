# INCA1

## Overview
INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK, cyclin A1 interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. The protein functions primarily as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, specifically targeting CDK2, and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and controlling cell proliferation (Zhang2018Overexpression; Bäumer2014Maintenance). INCA1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it regulates the transition between different phases of the cell cycle by inhibiting CDK activity, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Freitas2014TCTEX1D4). It is particularly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and is significant in stress conditions, contributing to the maintenance of hematopoiesis and prevention of leukemia development (Bäumer2014Maintenance). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the cyclin A1/CDK2 complex and the inhibitor of growth protein 5 (ING5), underscore its role in tumor suppression and cell cycle regulation (Zhang2011The).

## Function
INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK, cyclin A1 interacting protein 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin A1. It functions primarily as a CDK2 inhibitor, similar to other CDK inhibitors like p21 and p27, and is involved in controlling cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability (Zhang2018Overexpression; Bäumer2014Maintenance). INCA1 is active in the nucleus, where it helps regulate the transition between different phases of the cell cycle, particularly by inhibiting CDK activity, which is crucial for proper cell division and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Freitas2014TCTEX1D4).

In healthy cells, INCA1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and plays a role in regulating their proliferation, preventing stem cell exhaustion, and maintaining the balance of stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Bäumer2014Maintenance). Although largely dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, INCA1 becomes more significant under stress conditions, where it helps maintain hematopoiesis and prevent leukemia development (Bäumer2014Maintenance). The absence of INCA1 can lead to increased cell cycling upon cytotoxic stress and accelerated bone marrow exhaustion, highlighting its role in stress response and cellular homeostasis (Bäumer2014Maintenance).

## Clinical Significance
The INCA1 gene plays a significant role in the regulation of leukemia-initiating cells and has potential clinical implications in leukemia treatment. Alterations in INCA1 expression are associated with the maintenance and proliferation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Studies have shown that INCA1 is crucial for the self-renewal and maintenance of LSCs, and its absence leads to impaired leukemia induction and maintenance, as evidenced by decreased cloning efficiency and colony growth in models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Bäumer2014Maintenance). INCA1 expression levels are lower in AML blasts compared to normal bone marrow cells, suggesting that reduced INCA1 expression may facilitate the expansion of malignant clones (Bäumer2014Maintenance).

INCA1 also interacts with the inhibitor of growth protein 5 (ING5), and this interaction is essential for ING5's antiproliferative effects. In the absence of INCA1, ING5 cannot effectively inhibit cell proliferation, indicating that alterations in INCA1 expression or its interaction with ING5 could impact cell growth regulation and cancer treatment strategies (Zhang2011The). The downregulation of INCA1 has been observed in various contexts, including Tia1 knockout mouse models, where it is associated with changes in cell cycle regulation (Heck2014Dysregulated).

## Interactions
INCA1 (inhibitor of CDK, cyclin A1 interacting protein 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. It was identified as a novel interaction partner of the cyclin A1/CDK2 complex, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Zhang2011The). INCA1 interacts with the inhibitor of growth protein 5 (ING5), a member of the Inhibitor of Growth family. This interaction is essential for ING5's antiproliferative effects, as ING5's ability to inhibit colony formation and enhance apoptosis is dependent on the presence of INCA1 (Zhang2011The). The interaction between INCA1 and ING5 also enhances p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Zhang2011The).

INCA1 also interacts with the novel testis protein RSB-66, which is expressed in round spermatids. This interaction occurs mainly in the cytoplasm and is crucial for the potential regulatory role of RSB-66 in the cell cycle during spermatogenesis (Chen2008A). The interaction between INCA1 and RSB-66 was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays (Chen2008A).
