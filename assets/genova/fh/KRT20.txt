# KRT20

## Overview
KRT20 is a gene that encodes keratin 20, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and skin's Merkel cells. As a structural protein, keratin 20 plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and stability of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments, which are crucial for cellular architecture and function (Zhou2003Keratin). The expression of KRT20 is regulated by the homeobox gene CDX1, which influences its role in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (Chan2009Gastrointestinal). Clinically, KRT20 serves as a significant diagnostic marker in various cancers, such as colorectal carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma, due to its distinct expression patterns in these malignancies (Omary2009Toward; Leech2001Merkel). Additionally, KRT20's interactions with other keratins, such as K18 and K19, underscore its importance in the cytoskeletal network of epithelial cells (Zhou2003Keratin).

## Structure
Keratin 20 (KRT20) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in epithelial tissues. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains, which are characteristic of keratin proteins (Omary2009Toward). The rod domain is subdivided into three subdomains and two linkers, and it includes a conserved caspase-digestion site typical of type I keratins (Omary2009Toward). 

The secondary structure of KRT20 is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of heterodimers with type II keratins, a common feature among keratins (Omary2009Toward). These heterodimers further assemble into higher-order structures, contributing to the protein's tertiary and quaternary structures, which form a cytoskeletal network within epithelial cells (Omary2009Toward).

KRT20 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Omary2009Toward). The protein is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells, particularly in the intestinal and urothelial tissues, where it forms part of a complex network with other cytoskeletal elements (Zhou2003Keratin; Ruiz2024The).

## Function
Keratin 20 (KRT20) is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and Merkel cells of the skin. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells by forming intermediate filaments, which are essential for cellular stability and function (Zhou2003Keratin). KRT20 is involved in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, acting as a marker of differentiated intestinal epithelium. Its expression is regulated by the homeobox gene CDX1, which directly influences KRT20 expression through specific binding sites within its promoter (Chan2009Gastrointestinal).

In the intestinal epithelium, KRT20 is predominantly found in the more differentiated cells, particularly in the upper parts of the crypts in the colon and the villus cells of the small intestine (Zhou2003Keratin). It is coexpressed with other keratins, such as K18 and K19, suggesting potential complementary functions in maintaining epithelial cell structure (Zhou2003Keratin). KRT20 also plays a role in maintaining intermediate filament organization, which is critical for the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Zhou2003Keratin). Its expression is associated with mucin secretion and filament organization, highlighting its involvement in cellular processes that contribute to tissue stability (Chan2009Gastrointestinal).

## Clinical Significance
KRT20, encoding keratin 20, is clinically significant due to its role as a diagnostic marker in various cancers, particularly colorectal carcinoma. Altered expression of KRT20 is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. In colorectal carcinoma, KRT20 expression is used to identify metastases, as these tumors typically express K20 but not K7 (Omary2009Toward). Additionally, low K20 expression in colorectal carcinoma is linked to high microsatellite instability, which is associated with improved survival outcomes (Omary2009Toward).

KRT20 is also used to distinguish Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) from metastatic small cell carcinoma (SCC). MCCs typically stain positively for K20, while SCCs do not, making K20 a reliable marker for identifying MCCs (Leech2001Merkel).

Mutations in KRT20, such as the R80H mutation, can disrupt keratin filament organization, although no specific diseases have been directly linked to these mutations. The R80H mutation causes filament collapse in transfected cells, indicating its potential impact on cellular integrity (Zhou2003Keratin). Despite these disruptions, no histological or disease-like phenotypes have been observed in transgenic mice models, suggesting that the physiological impact may vary depending on the tissue type (Zhou2003Keratin).

## Interactions
Keratin 20 (KRT20) is known to interact with other cytoskeletal proteins, particularly within the context of maintaining intermediate filament organization in intestinal epithelial cells. KRT20 is coexpressed with other type I keratins such as keratin 18 (K18) and keratin 19 (K19), suggesting potential redundant or complementary functions in filament organization (Zhou2003Keratin). The interaction between KRT20 and K18 is particularly significant, as studies have shown that these keratins can compensate for each other in maintaining filament integrity. For instance, overexpression of wild-type K18 can rescue the filament network in the small intestine of mice with mutant K20, indicating a level of functional redundancy (Zhou2003Keratin).

KRT20 also interacts with keratin 8 (K8), although the association between K20 and K8 is weaker compared to the K18-K8 interaction (Zhou2006Keratin). These interactions are crucial for the structural organization of keratin filaments, which are essential for the mechanical stability and integrity of epithelial cells. The phosphorylation of KRT20 at serine 13 is another aspect of its interaction profile, as it plays a role in keratin filament disassembly under stress conditions, indicating a regulatory mechanism involving protein modification (Zhou2006Keratin).
