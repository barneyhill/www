# CDS2

## Overview
CDS2, or CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme integral to lipid biosynthesis, specifically involved in the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin, essential components of cell membranes and signaling pathways (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). The CDS2 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is subject to various post-translational modifications, which are conserved across species (Mercadé2007Characterization). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are intricately regulated through interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, highlighting its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and normal cellular function (Mak2021AGPAT2; Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

## Structure
The human CDS2 protein is an integral membrane protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 20p13. It consists of 445 amino acids and is slightly shorter than its homolog CDS1 due to a shorter N-terminal region (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). The protein can form homodimers, similar to the bacterial CDS enzyme TmCdsA from Thermotoga maritima (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). CDS2 is predicted to have seven transmembrane domains, which are conserved across species such as humans, mice, and rats (Mercadé2007Characterization).

The primary structure of CDS2 includes phosphorylation sites at Ser21 and Ser33, and ubiquitylation occurs at Lys253 and Lys328. These post-translational modifications are conserved in mice and rats (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). The protein sequence of CDS2 shows 72% identity and 92% similarity to CDS1, with the major differences in the N-terminal region where these phosphorylation sites are located (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

CDS2 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, including the nuclear envelope and peripheral ER tubules, and shows selectivity for specific acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). The protein's structure and function are crucial for lipid biosynthesis, particularly in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin.

## Function
CDS2 (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid biosynthesis by catalyzing the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). This reaction is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and cardiolipin (CL), which are key components of cell membranes and are involved in various cellular signaling pathways (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol). CDS2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, where it influences membrane composition and lipid homeostasis (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

In healthy human cells, CDS2 is crucial for maintaining normal levels of PI, which is important for cellular structures such as the Golgi and mitochondria. Knockdown studies have shown that reduced CDS2 expression leads to decreased PI levels and increased PA levels, which are rerouted to triacylglycerol (TG) production, resulting in the formation of supersized lipid droplets (Blunsom2020Phosphatidylinositol). This indicates that CDS2 is vital for lipid homeostasis and normal cell morphology (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol). Additionally, CDS2 is involved in the regulation of lipid droplet size and distribution, impacting lipid metabolism and adipocyte development (Qi2016CDPdiacylglycerol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CDS2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and vascular biology. In mesenchymal cancers, which account for about 40% of all cancers, CDS2 has been identified as a synthetic lethal target. These cancers often exhibit low or absent expression of the CDS1 gene, making them vulnerable to the loss of CDS2. This vulnerability is due to disruptions in lipid metabolism and cholesterol pathways, leading to the accumulation of cholesterol esters and triglycerides, and depletion of phosphatidylinositol (PI), a critical signaling molecule. Targeting CDS2 in these cancers could be a promising therapeutic strategy, although specific inhibitors are not yet available (Arnoldus2023Cytidine).

In vascular biology, CDS2 plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and vascular morphogenesis. Deficiency in CDS2 disrupts phosphoinositide recycling, leading to impaired VEGFA signaling and vessel regression instead of angiogenesis. This effect is observed in zebrafish and mouse models, where CDS2 deficiency results in reduced endothelial cell proliferation and tumor growth suppression. The altered VEGFA signaling due to CDS2 deficiency can lead to vascular defects and influence tumor progression, suggesting its potential role in conditions involving abnormal vascular growth and regression (Zhao2019Endothelial; Pan2012CDPdiacylglycerol).

## Interactions
CDS2 (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. One of the key interactions of CDS2 is with AGPAT2, an enzyme involved in phospholipid synthesis. AGPAT2 and CDS2 form stable complexes, which are crucial for the stability and activity of CDS2. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays that demonstrate a direct physical interaction between human CDS2 and AGPAT2, suggesting that AGPAT2 is necessary for maintaining CDS2 stability (Mak2021AGPAT2).

CDS2 is also involved in regulatory interactions with nucleic acids. The expression of CDS2 is modulated by the interaction between p53 and SIRT6, which bind to the CDS2 promoter region, facilitating transcription. Additionally, miR-16, a microRNA, targets the 3'-untranslated region of CDS2 mRNA, leading to its post-transcriptional inhibition. The loss of miR-16, often observed in various cancers, results in increased CDS2 expression (Blunsom2020CDP-Diacylglycerol).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of CDS2 in cellular processes, influencing both its enzymatic activity and expression levels through complex regulatory networks.
