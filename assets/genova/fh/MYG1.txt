# MYG1

## Overview
MYG1, also known as C12orf10, is a gene that encodes the MYG1 exonuclease, a protein with significant roles in RNA processing within both the nucleus and mitochondria of human cells. The MYG1 exonuclease is categorized as a 3'-5' exonuclease, primarily targeting RNA substrates, and is essential for the turnover of nuclear and mitochondrial mRNA, thereby coordinating the translational machinery of both organelles (Grover2019Myg1). This protein is crucial for ribosome maturation and translation, as it processes ribosomal RNA necessary for the assembly of the pre-40S ribosomal complex (Grover2019Myg1). MYG1's activity is dependent on Mg2+ ions and is vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and oxidative state, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis (Grover2019Myg1). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and vitiligo, due to its role in cellular processes and interactions (Philips2010Promoter; Chen2024MYG1).

## Function
MYG1, also known as MYG1 exonuclease, is a protein that plays a crucial role in RNA processing within both the nucleus and mitochondria of healthy human cells. It functions as a 3'-5' exonuclease, primarily targeting RNA substrates, and is involved in the turnover of nuclear and mitochondrial mRNA, thereby coordinating the translational machinery of both organelles (Grover2019Myg1). MYG1 is essential for ribosome maturation and translation, as it processes ribosomal RNA in the ITS-1 region, which is necessary for the assembly of the pre-40S ribosomal complex (Grover2019Myg1). 

In mitochondria, MYG1 processes the 3'-termini of mitochondrial ribosomal and messenger RNAs, influencing the translation of mitochondrial proteins and supporting mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (Grover2019Myg1). The protein's activity is dependent on Mg2+ ions and is crucial for maintaining the balance of RNA processing and turnover, which supports cellular translational capacity and mitochondrial function (Grover2019Myg1). MYG1's dual localization and function underscore its role in maintaining cellular energy balance and oxidative state, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Grover2019Myg1).

## Clinical Significance
The MYG1 gene, also known as C12orf10, has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MYG1 is identified as an oncogenic gene that accelerates cancer proliferation and metastasis. It is upregulated in CRC tissues, particularly in patients with distant metastasis, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and progression-free survival. MYG1 promotes glycolysis in CRC by recruiting HSP90 to phosphorylate PKM2, enhancing its stability and oncogenic functions (Chen2024MYG1).

MYG1 is also linked to vitiligo, a skin disorder characterized by depigmentation. The gene's expression is elevated in the skin of vitiligo patients, and specific polymorphisms, such as the promoter polymorphism -119C/G, are associated with increased susceptibility to the condition. The Arg4Gln polymorphism affects the mitochondrial localization of the MYG1 protein, potentially influencing its function in vitiligo pathogenesis (Philips2010Promoter).

In addition, MYG1 is involved in mitochondrial functionality, and its altered expression is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction observed in vitiligo. This dysfunction is linked to increased reactive oxygen species levels and oxidative stress in vitiligo lesions (Grover2019Myg1).

## Interactions
MYG1, also known as MYG1 exonuclease, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MYG1 interacts with the HSP90/GSK3β complex to promote the phosphorylation and stability of PKM2, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This interaction enhances PKM2's stability and nuclear accumulation, contributing to CRC progression through glycolysis regulation (Chen2024MYG1). MYG1 also binds to PKM2, maintaining its stability, which is crucial for glycolysis and CRC progression (Chen2024MYG1).

MYG1's interaction with mitochondrial proteins includes its binding to cytochrome c (Cyt c), which is involved in the oxidative respiratory chain and apoptosis regulation. MYG1 inhibits the release of Cyt c from mitochondria, thereby reducing apoptosis in CRC cells (Chen2024MYG1). This interaction highlights MYG1's role in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on cancer cell survival.

In yeast, MYG1 has been identified as a new antiviral factor, working in parallel with NUC1 and the SKI complex to ensure cell fitness in an L-A virus-dependent manner. Human MYG1 can rescue the growth defect of a yeast nuc1Δ myg1Δ mutant, suggesting functional conservation across species (Chau2022Diverse).
