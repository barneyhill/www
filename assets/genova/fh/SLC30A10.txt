# SLC30A10

## Overview
SLC30A10 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 30 member 10, a critical component of the ZnT family of zinc transporters. This protein is primarily recognized for its role as a manganese efflux transporter, essential for maintaining manganese homeostasis within human cells. Unlike other members of the ZnT family, SLC30A10 features a unique structural loop that influences its substrate specificity, allowing it to function effectively in manganese transport. The protein is predominantly localized on the cell surface, where it facilitates the efflux of manganese ions, thereby protecting cells from manganese-induced toxicity. This function is particularly vital in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, where it aids in manganese excretion and prevents neurotoxicity associated with manganese accumulation. Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1 (HMNDYT1), underscoring its significance in human health (Taylor2019SLC30A10; LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10).

## Structure
The SLC30A10 protein is a member of the ZnT family of zinc transporters, characterized by a conserved structure with six transmembrane helices. These helices are integral to the protein's function in metal transport (Seve2004In; Kambe2015The). Unlike other ZnT family members, SLC30A10 features a loop rich in basic residues instead of the typical histidine-rich loop between helices IV and V (Seve2004In). This structural variation may influence its substrate specificity, as SLC30A10 can function as a manganese transporter (Kambe2015The).

The protein operates as a homodimer, a common quaternary structure among ZnT transporters, facilitating the zinc/proton (Zn2+/H+) exchange mechanism (Kambe2015The). The transmembrane domains V and VI contain conserved residues crucial for its function, although the overall homology can vary among different ZnT proteins (Seve2004In). The cytosolic COOH-terminal portion of the protein forms a binuclear zinc-binding site, which may stabilize the homodimer or regulate transport activity through conformational changes (Kambe2015The). The SLC30A10 gene is predicted to code for a 52.7 KDa protein, and its sequence has been submitted to Genbank under the accession number BK004163 (Seve2004In).

## Function
The SLC30A10 gene encodes a manganese efflux transporter that is crucial for maintaining manganese homeostasis in human cells. This protein is localized on the cell surface and functions to reduce intracellular manganese levels by facilitating its efflux, thereby protecting cells from manganese-induced toxicity (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10). In healthy cells, SLC30A10 traffics to the cell surface, a process essential for its role in manganese transport (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10). The transporter is particularly active in the liver, where it aids in the excretion of manganese through bile, and in the gastrointestinal tract, where it mediates manganese efflux from enterocytes (Taylor2019SLC30A10; LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10).

SLC30A10's activity is vital for preventing manganese accumulation in the brain, which can lead to neurotoxicity and conditions resembling parkinsonism (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10). The protein's function is specific to manganese, as it does not significantly affect the levels of other metals like zinc or copper (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10). Proper functioning of SLC30A10 is essential for cellular and organismal health, as it prevents manganese-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC30A10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in manganese (Mn) homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A10 lead to hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1 (HMNDYT1), a rare recessive syndrome characterized by symptoms such as dystonia, parkinsonism, polycythemia, and liver disease, including cirrhosis (Tavasoli2019A; Ward2021GWAS). These mutations impair the gene's ability to mediate Mn efflux, resulting in Mn accumulation in the body, particularly affecting the basal ganglia and leading to neurological symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10; Mercadante2019Manganese).

The condition is treatable with chelation therapy and iron supplementation, which help manage Mn levels and improve symptoms (Tavasoli2019A). In some cases, mutations in SLC30A10 can lead to increased liver enzyme levels, such as ALT and AST, indicating liver dysfunction (Ward2021GWAS). The gene's dysfunction due to mutations also results in increased susceptibility to Mn toxicity, which can lead to apoptosis and neurodegeneration, particularly in the basal ganglia (LeyvaIllades2014SLC30A10).

## Interactions
SLC30A10 is involved in the transport and distribution of manganese (Mn2+) ions within cells. It can form a heterodimer with SLC30A3, enabling the transport of both zinc (Zn2+) and Mn2+ into endosomes. This interaction activates the EGFR/MEK/ERK1,2 signaling pathway, which can be reduced by the Zn2+ chelator TPEN (Rozenberg2022The). SLC30A10 also interacts with ATP2C1, a transporter that moves Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions in the Golgi apparatus to prevent Mn2+-induced neurotoxicity (Rozenberg2022The).

Mutations in SLC30A10, such as the SLC30A10-Δ105-107 mutation, disrupt its normal function, leading to Mn accumulation in the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that SLC30A10 is involved in Mn detoxification by transporting Mn from the Golgi vesicles to other organelles for expulsion (Carmona2018SLC30A10). The wild-type SLC30A10 protein facilitates the rapid efflux of Mn from the cell, likely through a direct efflux mechanism at the plasma membrane, preventing Mn from accumulating in the Golgi apparatus (Carmona2018SLC30A10). These interactions highlight the critical role of SLC30A10 in maintaining Mn homeostasis and preventing toxicity.
