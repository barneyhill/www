# PDIA3

## Overview
PDIA3 is a gene that encodes the protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, commonly referred to as ERp57, ERp60, or P58. This protein is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family and plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells, where it is involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, essential for the proper folding of glycoproteins (Jessop2006ERp57). PDIA3 is characterized by its redox activity and is known to interact with calnexin and calreticulin, forming complexes that facilitate the correct folding and assembly of glycoproteins (Galligan2012The). Beyond its role in protein folding, PDIA3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including membrane-initiated signaling pathways and cytokine signaling, and has been associated with several diseases, particularly cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Fan2024PDIA3; Paglia2023Protein).

## Structure
The PDIA3 gene encodes a protein known as ERp57, ERp60, or P58, which is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family. The PDIA3 protein consists of 505 amino acids, including a signal peptide of the first 24 amino acids, resulting in a mature protein of 481 amino acids (Galligan2012The). The protein structure includes two a-type domains with Cys-Gly-His-Cys active sites, one b-type domain, one b' type domain, and an ER retention sequence (Gln-Glu-Asp-Leu) (Galligan2012The). These domains are part of the thioredoxin superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of TRX-like domains that can be catalytically active or inactive (Galligan2012The).

PDIA3 is involved in the correct folding of glycoproteins, often forming complexes with calnexin and calreticulin (Galligan2012The). It is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, placenta, lung, pancreas, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and spermatozoa (Galligan2012The). The protein is known for its redox activity, specifically its ability to reduce insulin disulfides, and it has no protease activity (Galligan2012The). Common post-translational modifications of PDIA3 include glycosylation and phosphorylation.

## Function
PDIA3, also known as ERp57, is a multifunctional protein primarily involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells. It plays a critical role in the oxidative folding of glycoproteins, ensuring their structural integrity and proper function. PDIA3 interacts with calnexin and calreticulin, forming transient mixed disulfides with substrate proteins, which are essential for the correct folding and assembly of glycoproteins (Jessop2006ERp57).

PDIA3 is crucial for the efficient folding of glycoproteins with 'small, disulphide-rich' domains, such as clusterin and the b1 integrin subunit, by facilitating the correct formation of disulfide bonds and preventing misfolding (Jessop2006ERp57). It also plays a role in maintaining redox homeostasis in the ER by forming mixed disulfides with various substrates, including oxidoreductases like Ero1La (Jessop2006ERp57).

Beyond its role in the ER, PDIA3 is involved in rapid membrane-initiated signaling pathways, such as those activated by 1α,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, influencing cellular processes like protein kinase C activation and osteoblast differentiation (Chen2010Proteindisulfide; Wang2010Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
PDIA3, also known as protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PDIA3 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor survival outcomes. Its inhibition has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and increase chemosensitivity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Paglia2023Protein). In endometrial cancer, PDIA3 overexpression is associated with better overall survival, particularly in early-stage cancers and certain histological types like endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (Yu2023Protein). 

In colorectal cancer, PDIA3 is overexpressed and linked to the STAT3/PD-1 signaling pathway, promoting tumor progression and immune evasion by influencing macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype (Fan2024PDIA3). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high PDIA3 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, leading to poorer prognosis (Takata2016Increased). 

These findings highlight PDIA3's role as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions across various cancer types, due to its involvement in critical signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment modulation.

## Interactions
PDIA3, also known as ERp57, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It forms complexes with calreticulin and calnexin, which are essential for the folding of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (Chen2013Chaperone). PDIA3 also interacts with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in a complex known as the 'statosome', influencing cytokine signaling pathways, particularly in the context of IL-6 signaling in hepatoma cells (Burniston2014Conditional). This interaction is significant for modulating STAT3 activity, as the absence of PDIA3 increases STAT3 activity, which can be reversed by PDIA3 transfection (Burniston2014Conditional).

In the context of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, PDIA3 interacts with the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds crucial for the virus's structure and function (Chamberlain2019Lung). PDIA3's role in cancer is highlighted by its interaction with STAT3 in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it modulates cell survival and proliferation through the STAT3 signaling pathway (Kondo2019Downregulation). These interactions underscore PDIA3's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
