# PIK3R1

## Overview
The PIK3R1 gene encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, commonly referred to as p85α, which is a critical component of the class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) (Fruman2017The). This regulatory subunit plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by forming a complex with the catalytic subunits of PI3Ks, thereby modulating their activity. The p85α protein is characterized by its multiple domains, including SH3 and SH2 domains, which facilitate interactions with phosphorylated receptor-tyrosine kinases and other signaling proteins (Yu1998Regulation). These interactions are essential for the activation and regulation of the PI3K pathway, which is involved in various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival (Bilanges2019PI3K). Mutations in PIK3R1 have been implicated in several diseases, including immunodeficiencies and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Ramirez2020APDS2; Cheung2011High).

## Structure
The PIK3R1 gene encodes the regulatory subunit p85α of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling. The primary structure of p85α includes several domains: an N-terminal SH3 domain, a breakpoint cluster region (BCR) homology domain, two proline-rich domains, and two SH2 domains (Yu1998Regulation). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as phosphorylated receptor-tyrosine kinases and insulin receptor substrates, which are essential for PI3K activation (Hallmann2003Altered).

The secondary structure of p85α features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing p85α to interact effectively with the catalytic subunit p110, forming a heterodimeric PI3K holoenzyme (Yu1998Regulation). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of PI3K activity, as p85α can act as both an activator and inhibitor depending on the context (Hallmann2003Altered).

PIK3R1 also produces splice variant isoforms, including p55α and p50α, which lack certain domains present in the full-length p85α, such as the SH3 domain and the BCR homology region (Ueki2002Molecular). These isoforms have distinct functions and contribute to the complex regulation of PI3K signaling.

## Function
The PIK3R1 gene encodes the regulatory subunits of class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), including p85α, p55α, and p50α, which are crucial for the regulation of the PI3K pathway in healthy human cells (Fruman2017The; Okkenhaug2003PI3K). These subunits form a complex with the catalytic subunits (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) of PI3Ks, maintaining them in an inactive state in the cytosol until recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (Bilanges2019PI3K; Engelman2006The). This recruitment leads to the activation of the PI3K complex, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to generate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger (Bilanges2019PI3K; Tang2017Autosomal).

PIP3 plays a critical role in cell signaling by recruiting proteins with pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, such as Akt, to the plasma membrane, where they become activated (Bilanges2019PI3K; Lucas2014Heterozygous). This signaling pathway is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (Fruman2017The; Lucas2014Heterozygous). The p85α subunit also stabilizes the p110 catalytic subunit and can act as a negative regulator by inhibiting PI3K signaling when in excess (Engelman2006The). The PIK3R1 gene is essential for normal immune function, influencing B cell development and immune responses (Okkenhaug2003PI3K; Conley2012Agammaglobulinemia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3R1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Activated PI3K δ syndrome type 2 (APDS2) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PIK3R1, leading to hyperactivation of the PI3K δ pathway. This results in recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy, and autoimmune conditions (Deau2015A; Ramirez2020APDS2). SHORT syndrome, characterized by short stature, hyperextensible joints, and distinctive facial features, is also linked to PIK3R1 mutations, specifically in the C-terminal SH2 domain, which lead to decreased PI3K activity (Dyment2013Mutations).

Somatic mutations in PIK3R1 contribute to vascular malformations and overgrowth, with clinical phenotypes similar to those caused by PIK3CA variants. These mutations are often found in domains common to all PIK3R1 products and include missense and insertion-deletion variants (Cottrell2021Somatic). In cancer, particularly glioblastoma and endometrial cancer, PIK3R1 mutations enhance PI3K pathway signaling, promoting tumorigenesis (Cheung2011High; Quayle2012Somatic). These mutations often coexist with PTEN mutations, affecting cellular signaling pathways and contributing to cancer progression (Cheung2011High).

## Interactions
The PIK3R1 gene encodes the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. The p85α subunit interacts with the p110 catalytic subunits (p110α, p110β, or p110δ) to stabilize them and inhibit their catalytic activity. This interaction is essential for the regulation of PI3K activity and is mediated through the SH2 domains and the inter-SH2 domain of p85α (Dornan2017Conformational).

Mutations in PIK3R1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to diseases such as Activated PI3K Delta Syndrome (APDS) and various cancers. For instance, a splice mutation resulting in the deletion of amino acid residues 434-475 in the inter-SH2 domain of p85α leads to hyperactivation of PI3K signaling by impairing the inhibitory contacts with the p110δ subunit (Lucas2014Heterozygous; Dornan2017Conformational).

In the context of endometrial cancer, PIK3R1 mutations such as E160* can inhibit the homodimerization of wild-type p85α, affecting its interaction with PTEN, a tumor suppressor protein. This mutation diminishes PTEN stability, contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Cheung2011High).
