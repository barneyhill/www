# CAPN9

## Overview
CAPN9 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 9, a member of the calpain family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. Calpain 9 is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the gastric surface mucus cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and defense against stress-induced injuries. As a classical calpain, calpain 9 is characterized by a conserved domain structure, including a protease domain and a penta-EF-hand domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Hata2016A; SORIMACHI2011Calpain). Calpain 9 forms a heterodimeric complex with calpain 8, known as G-calpain, which is crucial for gastric mucosal protection (Hata2016A). Beyond its role in the gastrointestinal system, calpain 9 is also involved in apoptotic processes necessary for lumen formation in breast epithelial cells and has been implicated in fibrosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, making it a potential therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases (Kim2019Calpain; Chen2010Role).

## Structure
CAPN9, a classical calpain, is characterized by a conserved domain structure typical of this family. It includes an N-terminal anchor helix, a protease domain (CysPc) composed of protease core domains (PC1 and PC2), a calpain-type β-sandwich domain (CBSW), and a penta-EF-hand domain (PEF) (Hata2016A). The protease domains of CAPN9 share 59-71% amino acid identity with other classical calpains like CAPN1 and CAPN2, indicating a high level of conservation (SORIMACHI2011Calpain). CAPN9 forms a heterodimeric complex known as G-calpain with CAPN8, where CAPN9 serves a regulatory role (Hata2016A). This complex is crucial for gastric mucosal defense, as evidenced by increased susceptibility to gastric ulcers in mice lacking CAPN9 (SORIMACHI2011Calpain).

CAPN9 requires co-expression with CAPNS1 for its activity, suggesting a regulatory interaction (Hata2016A). The protein's activity is Ca2+-dependent and can be inhibited by calpastatin, the only endogenous inhibitor of conventional calpains (SORIMACHI2011Calpain). While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variants are not provided, the presence of conserved domains suggests a similar functional role across vertebrates (SORIMACHI2011Calpain).

## Function
Calpain 9 (CAPN9) is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the gastric surface mucus cells of the stomach. It plays a crucial role in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and defense against stress-induced injuries, such as those caused by ethanol. CAPN9 forms a protease complex with calpain 8, known as G-calpain, which is essential for gastric mucosal protection. This complex is activated by increased intracellular calcium levels and is involved in mucosal restitution after gastric injury (Hata2010Calpain).

In breast epithelial cells, CAPN9 is involved in the apoptotic mechanism of lumen formation. It is expressed in central luminal cells undergoing apoptosis, indicating its role in the apoptotic processes necessary for lumen formation. Inhibition of CAPN9 expression significantly reduces lumen formation, suggesting its critical role in this process. CAPN9 may act as an initiator protease in apoptosis, potentially regulating this process at both transcriptional and translational levels (Chen2010Role).

CAPN9 is also implicated in TGFβ-induced mesenchymal transition and fibrosis, where it is identified as a potential therapeutic target due to its involvement in these processes (Kim2019Calpain).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CAPN9 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. CAPN9 is involved in fibrosis, particularly in lung, liver, and cardiac tissues. Studies have shown that CAPN9 expression is upregulated in fibrotic tissues, and its deficiency in mice confers protection against fibrosis induced by agents like bleomycin and carbon tetrachloride (Kim2019Calpain). This suggests that CAPN9 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating fibrotic diseases (Kim2019Calpain).

In the context of gastric health, CAPN9, in conjunction with CAPN8, forms a protease complex known as G-calpain, which is crucial for gastric mucosal defense. Downregulation of CAPN9 has been observed in some gastric cancer patients, indicating a potential role in tumor suppression (Hata2010Calpain). Mutations in CAPN9, such as the R277W single nucleotide polymorphism, may reduce its proteolytic activity, potentially increasing susceptibility to gastropathies caused by irritants like alcohol (Hata2010Calpain). These findings highlight the importance of CAPN9 in maintaining gastric mucosal integrity and its potential involvement in gastric diseases.

## Interactions
Calpain 9 (CAPN9) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of fibrosis and gastrointestinal functions. CAPN9 forms a protease complex known as G-calpain with CAPN8, where CAPN8 serves a catalytic role and CAPN9 acts as a regulatory subunit. This interaction is crucial for the enzymatic activity of G-calpain, which is involved in stress-induced gastric mucosal defense (Hata2016A).

In the context of peritoneal fibrosis, CAPN9 interacts with proteins involved in fibrosis pathways. It has been shown to regulate the expression of fibronectin (FN) and collagen I (Col I), which are key components of the extracellular matrix. CAPN9 also influences the β-catenin signaling pathway, where its knockdown results in reduced activation of β-catenin and snail, proteins associated with fibrosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) (Li2022Inhibition).

CAPN9 is also targeted by miR-585-3p, a microRNA that inhibits its expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of the CAPN9 gene. This interaction plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Lu2021MiR5853p).
