# SPR

## Overview
Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is a gene that encodes the enzyme sepiapterin reductase, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a critical cofactor involved in the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. The SPR protein functions as a homodimer and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the reduction of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin to BH4, thereby supporting the activity of aromatic hydroxylases and nitric oxide synthases (Haruki2013Tetrahydrobiopterin; THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). Mutations in the SPR gene can lead to sepiapterin reductase deficiency, a disorder characterized by neurological symptoms due to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis (Friedman2012Sepiapterin). The enzyme's interactions with various proteins and its involvement in significant signaling pathways underscore its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Ranjpour2021Elevated).

## Structure
Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is a dimeric protein with a hexameric assembly, where each monomer is classified as an alpha and beta (a/b) class protein. The monomer features a 3-layer (aba) sandwich architecture and a Rossmann fold topology, which is crucial for its function (Yco2015Effect). The SPR monomer contains an NADP-binding Rossmann-like domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes several key regions with specific residues: Gly11, Ser13, Arg14, Phe16 (Region 1), Ala38, Arg39 (Region 2), Asn97, Ala98, Gly99, Ser100 (Region 3), Tyr167 (Region 4), and Leu198, Thr200, Met202 (Region 5) (Yco2015Effect). These regions are composed of basic polar, neutral polar, and neutral non-polar residues, with a basic, positively charged character due to the presence of arginine residues.

The SPR protein's quaternary structure as a homo 6-mer does not affect the binding site location for ligands, indicating that dimerization does not block ligand access (Yco2015Effect). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation may occur, although specific details are not provided in the context. The SPR protein's structure allows it to interact with various inhibitors, which can modulate or inhibit its activity by competing with NADP+ or affecting the dimerization interface (Yco2015Effect).

## Function
Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is a crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor essential for the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. In healthy human cells, SPR catalyzes the reduction of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin to BH4, which is vital for the function of aromatic hydroxylases, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylases, as well as nitric oxide synthases (Haruki2013Tetrahydrobiopterin; THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). BH4 is also involved in the recycling and salvage pathways, where SPR helps regenerate BH4 from its oxidized forms, maintaining neurotransmitter synthesis and nitric oxide production (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin; Cronin2023Peripheralized).

SPR is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in maintaining neurotransmitter balance, impacting neurological function and vascular health (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). The enzyme functions as a homodimer and is part of the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family, utilizing NADPH as a cofactor (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). Its activity is crucial for preventing neurological symptoms associated with BH4 deficiency, such as motor and cognitive deficits (Haruki2013Tetrahydrobiopterin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPR gene, which encodes the enzyme sepiapterin reductase, lead to sepiapterin reductase deficiency (SRD), an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by impaired biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a crucial cofactor for the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. As a result, individuals with SRD experience a range of neurological symptoms, including motor and speech delays, dystonia, axial hypotonia, and oculogyric crises. The disorder often mimics cerebral palsy, leading to frequent misdiagnoses (Friedman2012Sepiapterin).

SRD is classified as a type of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) due to its favorable response to treatment with L-DOPA and 5-hydroxytryptophan, which can significantly improve motor and sleep symptoms, although cognitive deficits may persist (ABELING2006Sepiapterin; Friedman2012Sepiapterin). The condition is not detectable by neonatal screening because it does not cause hyperphenylalaninemia, a common marker for other BH4 deficiencies (Dill2012Child).

Genetic studies have identified multiple mutations in the SPR gene, including missense, nonsense, and splice-site mutations, with c.596-2A>G and p.R150G being the most common (Friedman2012Sepiapterin). These mutations lead to reduced enzymatic activity, resulting in neurotransmitter imbalances and associated clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
Sepiapterin reductase (SPR) is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in various biological processes. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPR interacts with proteins associated with the AKT/MTOR and GSK3B pathways. It is connected to MTOR via AKT and also interacts with ARAF through AKT, indicating its role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Ranjpour2021Elevated). The gene network analysis suggests that SPR is co-expressed with genes such as ARAF, C3, CAMK2G, and MAP2K2, and is co-localized with ARAF and C3 genes, highlighting its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Ranjpour2021Elevated).

SPR also plays a role in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for neurotransmitter synthesis, and is a target for drug development due to its involvement in pain pathways. Inhibitors like tranilast and sulfasalazine have been studied for their ability to bind and inhibit SPR, affecting its activity in the BH4 pathway (Moore2019Repurposing; Yco2015Effect). These interactions suggest that SPR's activity can be modulated through its binding with various compounds, impacting its role in physiological and pathological processes.
