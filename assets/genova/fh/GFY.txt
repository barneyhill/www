# GFY

## Overview
The GFY gene encodes the protein known as the golgi associated olfactory signaling regulator, which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in olfactory signaling, and it is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. The GFY gene is expressed predominantly in brain tissue, where it is implicated in both cardiovascular and neurological functions. Research has linked mutations in the GFY gene to various health conditions, including atherosclerosis and neuropathy, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Mansour2023Microvascular). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential significance in understanding and treating related diseases.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The GFY gene has been implicated in several cardiovascular and neurological conditions. It is primarily expressed in brain tissue and has been associated with atherosclerosis, particularly through the narrowing of peripheral arterial vasculature, suggesting a link between GFY gene mutations and cardiovascular conditions involving arterial health (Mansour2023Microvascular). Specifically, the GFY gene has been associated with carotid plaque build-up, which can lead to cardiovascular complications in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Mansour2023Microvascular). 

In the realm of neurological conditions, the GFY gene has been linked to neuropathy complications in T2DM patients. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4802605, in the GFY gene has been identified, with the risk allele A showing a significant association with neuropathy, indicating that mutations in the GFY gene may contribute to these complications (Mansour2023Microvascular). 

Additionally, the GFY gene has been noted in studies related to early-onset coronary artery disease (CAD), where it was associated with hypertension, a risk factor for CAD, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain unexplored (Yamada2018Identification). These associations highlight the potential clinical significance of the GFY gene in various disease contexts.
