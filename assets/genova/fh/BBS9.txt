# BBS9

## Overview
BBS9 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 9 protein, a critical component of the BBSome complex, which is essential for ciliary function and transport in human cells. The BBS9 protein is characterized by several structural domains, including an N-terminal β-propeller, a γ-adaptin ear (GAE) domain, a platform domain, and C-terminal α-helical domains, which facilitate its interactions within the BBSome complex (Ludlam2019Molecular; Klink2020Structure). As a part of the BBSome, BBS9 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of this complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport within cilia, impacting cellular signaling and function (Ludlam2019Molecular). Mutations in the BBS9 gene can lead to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, a disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical features, including retinal degeneration, obesity, and renal abnormalities, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Khan2016Homozygosity; Nishimura2005Comparative).

## Structure
The BBS9 protein is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary function. Structurally, BBS9 includes several domains: an N-terminal β-propeller, a γ-adaptin ear (GAE) domain, a platform domain, and C-terminal α-helical domains (Ludlam2019Molecular). The β-propeller domain of BBS9 is negatively charged around its central cavity and interacts with a positively charged patch on BBS8 (Klink2020Structure). This domain was modeled using the pdb entry 4YD8, with modifications to include methionine residues and missing loops (Klink2020Structure).

BBS9 forms a stable binary subcomplex with BBS8, confirmed by the visibility of two superhelical arrangements of TPR motifs (Klink2020Structure). The GAE domain of BBS9 is crucial for its interaction with BBS1, and mutations at this interface are pathogenic (Klink2020Structure). BBS9 also interacts with BBS5 through its two PH domains, one of which interacts with BBS8 and an unstructured loop of BBS9 (Klink2020Structure).

The BBS9 protein does not form a coiled-coil interaction with BBS2 and BBS7, but it associates with them via its α-helical domain (Ludlam2019Molecular). Specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of BBS9 are not provided in the context.

## Function
The BBS9 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is essential for ciliary transport in human cells. The BBSome is composed of eight subunits, and BBS9 plays a central role in its assembly by interacting with the BBS2/BBS7 dimer through its α-helical domain. This interaction is vital for linking the dimer to the hexameric subcomplex, ensuring the stability and proper assembly of the BBSome (Ludlam2019Molecular). The BBSome is involved in retrograde transport, moving protein cargos, including membrane proteins, out of the cilium, which is critical for the signaling functions of primary cilia (Ludlam2019Molecular).

BBS9 is also implicated in cilia biogenesis and function. Knockdown studies in zebrafish and mouse cells have shown that BBS9 is essential for normal cilia formation, as its absence leads to cilia defects (Veleri2012Knockdown). The BBS9 protein's role in healthy cells is to facilitate the proper assembly and function of the BBSome, which is necessary for ciliary transport and cellular function (Ludlam2019Molecular). Mutations in BBS9 can disrupt these processes, leading to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, characterized by various phenotypes such as cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and obesity (Ludlam2019Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS9 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of clinical manifestations. These include retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, and cognitive impairment (Khan2016Homozygosity; Nishimura2005Comparative). BBS9 is part of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliogenesis, and mutations in this gene can disrupt the integrity of this complex, leading to the diverse symptoms observed in BBS (Khan2016Homozygosity).

Clinical studies have identified various mutations in the BBS9 gene, such as a homozygous GrA transversion affecting the splice donor site of intron 17, which disrupts normal splicing and leads to premature termination of mRNA (Nishimura2005Comparative). Another study reported a novel protein-truncating mutation (p.Ser100Leufs*24) in a consanguineous Pakistani family, resulting in a frameshift mutation and a truncated protein (Khan2016Homozygosity). These mutations are not found in control samples, suggesting a strong association with BBS (Nishimura2005Comparative).

The genetic heterogeneity of BBS, involving more than 20 genes, complicates diagnosis and management, emphasizing the need for genetic screening to identify specific mutations in different populations (Tang2021Novel; AlMat’hammi2024Homozygous).

## Interactions
BBS9 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is essential for protein transport in primary cilia. Within the BBS2-7-9 subcomplex, BBS9 interacts with the α-helical domain of BBS2, facilitating the connection of the BBS2/BBS7 dimer to the larger BBSome complex, which includes BBS1, BBS4, BBS5, BBS8, BBS9, and BBS18 (Ludlam2019Molecular). BBS9 does not form a coiled-coil interaction with BBS2 or BBS7, but it associates with the BBS2/BBS7 dimer through specific interactions, crucial for the assembly and stability of the BBSome (Ludlam2019Molecular).

Mutations in BBS9, such as G141R, can disrupt its folding and expression, leading to decreased binding to BBS2 and failure of BBSome assembly (Ludlam2019Molecular). The BBS9 β-propeller domain is involved in these interactions, and its proper folding is necessary for the stability of the BBSome. The BBS2 R632P mutation specifically disrupts the interaction between BBS2 and BBS9 by affecting the helical domain of BBS2, which is critical for binding to BBS9 (Ludlam2019Molecular). These interactions highlight the importance of BBS9 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the BBSome complex.
