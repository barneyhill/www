# PPIAL4C

## Overview
PPIAL4C is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4C, which belongs to the cyclophilin family of peptidylprolyl isomerases. These enzymes are known for their role in catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides, which is a critical process in protein folding and function. The PPIAL4C protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding, trafficking, and assembly, and may play a role in the regulation of cell signaling pathways. As a member of the cyclophilin family, PPIAL4C shares structural and functional characteristics with other cyclophilins, which are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
