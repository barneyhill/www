# ATRNL1

## Overview
ATRNL1, or attractin like 1, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. The protein, also referred to as ATRNL1, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as CUB, C-type lectin, EGF-like repeats, and kelch repeats, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Walker2007Genetic). ATRNL1 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its significance in fundamental biological functions, particularly within the central nervous system where it influences synaptic transmission and plasticity (Stark2010De). Additionally, ATRNL1 plays a role in cartilage differentiation through its circular RNA derivative, circ-ATRNL1, which modulates key transcription factors involved in chondrogenesis (Zhu2021Regulating). The gene's involvement in pathologies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and endometriosis highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2020CircATRNL1; He2024Identification).

## Structure
The ATRNL1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein that shares significant similarity with its homolog, ATRN. The primary structure of ATRNL1 includes a sequence of amino acids that are 58-59% identical and 75% similar to ATRN, indicating a high degree of conservation (Walker2007Genetic). The protein contains several key domains, including CUB and C-type lectin domains, EGF-like repeats, plexin/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) motifs, and kelch repeats, which are associated with protein-protein interactions (Walker2007Genetic). ATRNL1 uniquely features a Delta/Serrate/lag-2 (DSL) domain overlapping with the EGF domain, which is present in mammals and chickens but not in other vertebrates or invertebrates (Walker2007Genetic).

The tertiary structure of ATRNL1 is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the presence of these domains suggests a complex three-dimensional conformation that facilitates its interaction with other proteins. The quaternary structure is not described, indicating that ATRNL1 may function as a monomer or its multimeric state is not yet characterized. Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not specifically mentioned in the context provided. The evolutionary analysis suggests that ATRNL1 and ATRN arose from an ancient duplication event, with ATRNL1 being more similar to its homologs in fish than to ATRN (Walker2007Genetic).

## Function
The ATRNL1 gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and signaling events, playing a crucial role in neural development and function (Stark2010De). This protein is highly conserved among species, indicating its importance in fundamental biological processes. In humans, ATRNL1 is implicated in synaptic transmission and plasticity, primarily active in the central nervous system, where it may influence energy metabolism and body weight regulation (Stark2010De).

In the context of cartilage formation, a circular RNA derived from ATRNL1, known as circ-ATRNL1, has been shown to enhance the expression of SOX9, a key transcription factor in chondrocyte development. This interaction promotes chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting a role for ATRNL1 in cartilage differentiation and maintenance (Zhu2021Regulating). The regulatory pathway involves circ-ATRNL1 modulating SOX9 expression through miR-145-5p, highlighting its potential as a target for cartilage repair therapies, particularly in osteoarthritis (Zhu2021Regulating). Despite these insights, the specific function of ATRNL1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ATRNL1 (attractin like 1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a genetic disorder characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy that can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The gene is associated with signaling receptor activity and carbohydrate binding, and its expression is elevated in HCM cellular and animal models. This suggests that ATRNL1 may contribute to the mechanisms underlying HCM by promoting cell growth (He2024Identification). Potential therapeutic drugs, such as propylthiouracil, miR-1469, and triptolide, have been identified to regulate the expression of ATRNL1, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in HCM (He2024Identification).

In the context of endometriosis, a gynecological disorder, circATRNL1, a circular RNA derived from the ATRNL1 gene locus, is significantly upregulated in ectopic endometrial tissues. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by interacting with microRNAs miR-141-3p and miR-200a-3p, which are involved in regulating EMT processes. This interaction suggests that circATRNL1 may contribute to the progression of endometriosis by modulating cell proliferation and motility (Wang2020CircATRNL1).
