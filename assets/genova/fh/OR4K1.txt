# OR4K1

## Overview
OR4K1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 1, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals within the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of neuronal responses that culminate in the perception of smell. The gene is implicated in sensory perception and olfactory transduction pathways, which are essential for distinguishing a wide array of odorant molecules and are vital for various behaviors related to olfaction (Alonso2008Overdominance; Michaelovsky2019Risk). Additionally, OR4K1 may be influenced by evolutionary mechanisms such as balancing selection, which helps maintain genetic diversity and potentially enhances olfactory sensitivity by broadening the spectrum of detectable odorants (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Structure


## Function
OR4K1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR4K1 is active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Alonso2008Overdominance; Michaelovsky2019Risk).

The olfactory receptor genes, including OR4K1, are involved in sensory perception and olfactory transduction pathways. These pathways are crucial for the detection and differentiation of a wide range of odorant molecules, which is essential for various organismal behaviors related to smell (Michaelovsky2019Risk). The gene's involvement in these pathways suggests its role in synaptic plasticity and sensory processing, which are important for normal olfactory function (Michaelovsky2019Risk).

OR4K1, like other olfactory receptors, may also be subject to evolutionary pressures such as balancing selection, which maintains genetic diversity in the population. This diversity can enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the range of odorant-binding sites available (Alonso2008Overdominance).
