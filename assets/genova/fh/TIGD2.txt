# TIGD2

## Overview
TIGD2 is a gene that encodes the protein tigger transposable element derived 2, which is part of the Tigger transposable element-derived family. This gene is derived from pogo-like transposable elements and has been exapted for host functions in metazoan genomes, particularly in tetrapods such as mammals (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The protein encoded by TIGD2 is believed to play roles in DNA binding and regulation, potentially influencing genomic stability and gene expression regulation (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). TIGD2 is expressed in various human organs, with the highest expression observed in the placenta, suggesting a role in reproductive biology (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). Phylogenetic analyses place TIGD2 within the JR clade of pogo-like transposons, indicating its evolutionary persistence due to natural selection (Casola2007Convergent). Despite its potential significance, the specific molecular functions and interaction partners of TIGD2 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its biological and clinical roles.

## Function
TIGD2, a gene derived from pogo-like transposable elements, is part of the Tigger transposable element-derived family. It is believed to have been exapted for host functions in metazoan genomes, particularly in tetrapods such as mammals (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The TIGD2 gene is expressed in various human organs, with the highest expression observed in the placenta, suggesting a role in reproductive biology (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

Phylogenetic analyses indicate that TIGD2 is part of a subclade within the JR clade of pogo-like transposons, suggesting it is a derivative of ancient transposons that have persisted due to natural selection (Casola2007Convergent). The catalytic motif of TIGD2, primarily DD34S, shows variation likely due to positive selection following its exaptation, indicating a potential role in DNA binding and regulation (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

While the specific molecular function of TIGD2 in cell biology is not fully detailed, it is suggested to play important roles in vertebrates, possibly influencing genomic stability and gene expression regulation. Further research is encouraged to elucidate its precise functions and contributions to cellular processes (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

## Clinical Significance
The TIGD2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its genetic alterations. In the context of lung cancer, a study identified a recurrent variant of TIGD2 in Asian non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer development specific to this population (Hillmer2014468:). However, the study did not provide specific diseases or conditions directly associated with TIGD2 mutations.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), TIGD2 has been mentioned in studies involving genetic duplications. A study involving two Italian siblings with autosomal dominant PD identified a duplication of a genomic region that includes TIGD2, alongside other genes like SNCA, which is known to be a significant factor in PD (Ferese2015Four). This suggests that alterations in TIGD2 may contribute to the genetic complexity of PD, although its specific role remains unclear.

Additionally, TIGD2 has been associated with asthma in Latino populations through case-control admixture mapping, indicating a potential link to asthma susceptibility (Torgerson2012Casecontrol). However, the exact mechanism or role of TIGD2 in asthma is not detailed in the study. Overall, while TIGD2 is associated with various conditions, further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.

## Interactions
TIGD2, a gene derived from the domestication of pogo-like transposable elements, is involved in protein-protein interactions within the human genome. According to the BioGrid database, TIGD2 has three documented protein-protein interactions, although the specific partners are not detailed in the available context (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). The gene is part of a group of TIGD genes that have been exapted for host functions, suggesting a role in various cellular processes, potentially through interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic).

Phylogenetic analyses place TIGD2 within the JR clade of pogo-derived proteins, which includes other transposase-derived proteins such as JRK and JRKL. This clade is distinct from the CR clade, which is related to CENP-B, indicating that TIGD2 may have unique interaction partners and functions compared to other pogo-derived proteins (Casola2007Convergent). The catalytic motif of TIGD2, primarily DD34S, suggests that it may have undergone positive selection, potentially influencing its interaction capabilities following exaptation (Dupeyron2020Phylogenetic). Despite these insights, specific details about the nature and function of TIGD2's interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
