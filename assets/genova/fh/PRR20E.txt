# PRR20E

## Overview
The PRR20E gene encodes the proline-rich protein 20E, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by a high content of proline residues. These proteins are often involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways and structural functions, due to their ability to form flexible and dynamic structures. The specific role of proline-rich protein 20E remains to be fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to participate in protein-protein interactions, given the nature of proline-rich domains. The gene is expressed in various tissues, suggesting a potentially broad functional significance. Further research is needed to clarify its precise biological roles and any implications in human health and disease.
