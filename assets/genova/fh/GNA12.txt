# GNA12

## Overview
GNA12 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit alpha 12 (Gα12), a member of the Gα12/13 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are pivotal in signal transduction processes mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Guo2022Gα12). The Gα12 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an amino-terminal α-helical domain and a Ras-like GTPase domain, which facilitate its role in binding and hydrolyzing GTP. This protein is integral to various cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving the modulation of the mTOR pathway and cytoskeletal reorganization, impacting cell growth, proliferation, and motility (Gismondi2021Plant). GNA12's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where its altered expression can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Chia2014Breast; Gan2011P126.). The multifunctionality of Gα12, attributed to its intrinsically disordered regions, allows it to interact with multiple signaling partners, highlighting its complex role in cellular dynamics (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Structure
The GNA12 gene encodes the Gα12 protein, a member of the Gα12/13 subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction processes mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Guo2022Gα12). The Gα12 protein structure includes an amino-terminal α-helical domain and a Ras-like GTPase domain, which are crucial for binding GDP and GTP. Upon activation by GPCRs, the GDP-bound inactive form of Gα12 is converted to an active form with GTP binding, leading to dissociation from Gβγ subunits and activation of downstream effectors (Guo2022Gα12).

Gα12 has four isoforms, with isoform 1 being the longest at 381 amino acids. Isoforms 2 and 3 are shorter due to different N-termini, and isoform 4 lacks in-frame exons in the 3' coding region, making it shorter than isoform 1 (Guo2022Gα12). The protein contains structural domains such as an adenylyl cyclase binding site, a β-γ complex binding site, and switch regions that undergo conformational changes upon GTP binding (Guo2022Gα12).

GNA12 is noted for having a longer amino acid sequence compared to most other human Gα proteins, resulting in disordered C-tails and long N-terminally located intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The protein's intrinsic disorder contributes to its multifunctionality and ability to interact with multiple partners (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The GNA12 gene encodes the G protein subunit alpha 12, which is part of the heterotrimeric G protein family involved in signal transduction. In healthy human cells, GNA12 plays a significant role in modulating the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It targets RASA2, an inhibitor of HRas, which is an activator of mTOR complexes through the PI3K/Akt pathway. GNA12 can also activate RhoGEF and RhoA, leading to the activation of ROCK and triggering PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Gismondi2021Plant).

GNA12 is involved in several cell signaling pathways, including those mediated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are essential for cell survival. It influences downstream signaling pathways, such as the activation of RhoGEF and RhoA, which subsequently activates Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). This kinase phosphorylates PTEN, impacting the PI3K/Akt pathway involved in cell growth and survival (Gismondi2021Plant).

The protein is active in the cell membrane, where it influences pathways like RhoA signaling, impacting cell shape and motility. This involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration highlights its critical role in cellular processes (Gismondi2021Plant).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNA12 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), GNA12 mRNA levels are significantly up-regulated compared to non-malignant tissues, with high protein expression detected in 75% of OSCC cases. This overexpression promotes cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting that targeting GNA12 could help prevent the spread of oral cancer (Gan2011P126.). 

GNA12 is also overexpressed in certain breast cancers, including triple-negative breast cancers, where it contributes to cell migration and metastasis (O’Hayre2013The). The gene's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. Plant miRNA miR171 has been shown to target GNA12, reducing its expression and affecting the mTOR pathway, which could have therapeutic implications for conditions where GNA12 is overexpressed (Gismondi2021Plant).

While mutations in GNA12 are less frequent compared to other Gα genes, their potential oncogenic role has been noted, although further research is needed to establish their clinical significance (O’Hayre2013The).

## Interactions
GNA12, a G protein subunit alpha 12, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with RhoGEFs, which activate Rho GTPases, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. GNA12 can stimulate RhoGEF and RhoA, leading to the activation of ROCK, which phosphorylates PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Gismondi2021Plant). This interaction is significant in the modulation of the mTOR pathway, as GNA12 can also interact with RASA2, inhibiting HRas, an activator of mTOR complexes through the PI3K/Akt pathway (Gismondi2021Plant).

In the context of cancer, GNA12 signaling is linked to the expression of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2, which are crucial for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This process involves NF-κB activity, where GNA12 enhances the promoter activities of these genes via NF-κB binding, indicating a transcriptional regulation mechanism (Chia2014Breast). The interaction with NF-κB is critical for the transcription of these genes, which is essential for the invasion of breast cancer cells (Chia2014Breast).
