# LRRC1

## Overview
The LRRC1 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 1 protein, which is a member of the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role as a cytoplasmic scaffold protein. LRRC1 is involved in maintaining cellular polarity and epithelial homeostasis, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including adipocytic differentiation, signal transduction, and cell adhesion. It is expressed in multiple organs, such as the heart, lung, and kidney, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as PDZ domain-containing proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, highlight its significance in pathways related to tumor progression, immune cell infiltration, and liver fibrosis (Suzuki2002Identification; Wang2022The; Wang2024The).

## Structure
The LRRC1 protein is composed of 524 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Suzuki2002Identification; Wang2022The). These LRR domains typically form an α/β horseshoe fold, contributing to the protein's secondary structure. The protein contains 15 leucine-rich repeat motifs, which are structural motifs that facilitate these interactions (Suzuki2002Identification). 

LRRC1 is part of the LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ) family of proteins, which are known for their roles in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial homeostasis (Yang2011Dynamic). Although LRRC1 does not contain PDZ domains, it has a PDZ-ligand sequence at its C-terminus, which may influence its interaction with other proteins (Jang2020The). 

The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including epithelial tissue homeostasis and tumor growth, and interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Wang2022The). The expression of LRRC1 is regulated by transcription factors such as CREB1, and it is involved in pathways related to tumor progression and immune cell infiltration (Cai2022High). 

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms may further influence the function and localization of LRRC1, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The LRRC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular polarity, particularly during adipocytic differentiation in healthy human cells. It is highly expressed during the early stages of adipogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), where it is upregulated by the transcription factor PPARγ. This upregulation is crucial for the adipogenic potential of MSCs, as it influences the expression of adipogenesis-associated proteins such as SCD, LIPE, and FASN (Wang2022The).

LRRC1 is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LAP) and PDZ protein families, which are involved in maintaining the apical-basal polarity of epithelial cells. This polarity is essential for the structural integrity of tissues, as disruptions can lead to various pathologies, including cancer (Cai2022High). The protein contains leucine-rich repeat motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, contributing to its role in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell adhesion (Jang2020The).

In healthy tissues, LRRC1 is expressed in multiple organs, including the heart, lung, and kidney, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological functions (Suzuki2002Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRRC1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and liver fibrosis. In breast cancer, LRRC1, also known as LANO, is associated with the regulation of breast cancer stem cell (bCSC) fate through the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Low expression of LANO/LRRC1 correlates with cancer stem cell signatures and is linked to increased tumorigenicity and metastatic potential, suggesting its role in repressing stemness properties and metastatic dissemination in breast cancer (Lopez2018The).

In liver fibrosis, LRRC1 expression is significantly upregulated in fibrotic liver tissues, promoting the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through the stabilization of phosphorylated Smad2/3, a component of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. This upregulation is associated with the progression of liver fibrosis, and targeting LRRC1 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate fibrosis (Wang2024The).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LRRC1 is involved in drug resistance mechanisms. It is a target of miR-193a, and its expression is increased in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. Modulating LRRC1 expression through miR-193a has been shown to reduce cisplatin resistance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in overcoming drug resistance (Wu2020Bone).

## Interactions
LRRC1 (leucine-rich repeat containing 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as a cytoplasmic scaffold protein, playing a significant role in stabilizing phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) by inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the progression of liver fibrosis, as it enhances the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway (Wang2024The).

LRRC1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which targets activated Smad2/3 for degradation. The knockdown of LRRC1 enhances the ubiquitination of NEDD4L and p-Smad2/3, suggesting that LRRC1 impedes the interaction between NEDD4L and p-Smad2/3, thereby stabilizing p-Smad2/3 (Wang2024The).

In the context of breast cancer stem cells, LRRC1, also known as LANO, is involved in regulating the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. It affects the secretion of WNT ligands, such as WNT3a, which in turn influences the activity of the WNT/β-catenin pathway, impacting cancer stem cell fate (Lopez2018The).
