# FAM118B

## Overview
FAM118B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 118 member B, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of Cajal bodies (CBs) within the nucleus. This protein is integral to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), essential components in the pre-mRNA splicing process. FAM118B interacts with key nuclear components, such as coilin and the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein complex, to facilitate the assembly and function of snRNPs, thereby influencing RNA processing and cell proliferation (Li2014Fam118B). The protein's involvement in these critical cellular processes underscores its potential implications in diseases like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and various cancers, where disruptions in RNA processing and cell viability are observed (Li2014Fam118B).

## Function
FAM118B is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of Cajal bodies (CBs), which are subnuclear structures involved in RNA-related processes. It is essential for the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are critical for pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with key components of CBs, such as coilin and the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein complex, to facilitate snRNP assembly (Li2014Fam118B).

FAM118B is involved in stabilizing the SMN/Sm core complex and the symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) modification of Sm proteins, which enhances their binding to SMN. This interaction is vital for the proper assembly and function of snRNPs, impacting RNA processing and cell proliferation (Hebert2016Towards; Li2014Fam118B). Depletion of FAM118B disrupts CB formation, reduces splicing efficiency, and decreases cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Li2014Fam118B).

The protein's role in CBs and snRNP biogenesis suggests it is integral to the regulation of gene expression and cell viability, with potential implications in diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (Li2014Fam118B).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM118B gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes. Notably, its involvement in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been suggested. This connection arises from FAM118B's role in stabilizing the SMN/Sm core complex, which is crucial for small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. Disruptions in SMN/Sm interactions, which are affected by certain SMA-causing mutations in the SMN1 gene, may also involve FAM118B, indicating a potential link to SMA (Li2014Fam118B).

Alterations in FAM118B expression have also been observed in various cancer cell lines, suggesting a broader role in cellular viability and proliferation. The gene's expression in these contexts indicates that it may contribute to cancer pathogenesis, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Li2014Fam118B).

Research has shown that depletion of FAM118B disrupts the localization of Cajal body components and reduces splicing capacity, which can inhibit cell proliferation. These findings highlight the gene's importance in maintaining cellular functions related to RNA processing, with potential clinical implications in conditions where these processes are disrupted (Li2014Fam118B).

## Interactions
FAM118B is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of Cajal bodies (CBs), interacting with several key proteins involved in snRNP biogenesis and cell viability. It directly binds to coilin, a marker protein of CBs, as demonstrated by in vitro pull-down experiments (Li2014Fam118B). FAM118B also associates with the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein complex, which is essential for snRNP assembly. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that FAM118B interacts with both coilin and SMN, although it was not detected in reciprocal experiments when coilin was immunoprecipitated (Li2014Fam118B).

The interaction between FAM118B and SMN is particularly significant, as FAM118B is involved in the association of SMN with Sm core proteins. Depletion of FAM118B reduces the amount of SMN that associates with SmD1, a component of the snRNP complex, and affects the symmetric dimethylarginine (sDMA) modification of Sm proteins, which is crucial for their interaction with SMN (Li2014Fam118B). These interactions highlight the role of FAM118B in maintaining the structural integrity and function of CBs, as well as its potential involvement in mRNA splicing and cell viability (Li2014Fam118B).
