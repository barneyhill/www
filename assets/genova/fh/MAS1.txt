# MAS1

## Overview
The MAS1 gene encodes the MAS1 proto-oncogene, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly within the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. As a receptor, MAS1 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its involvement in signal transduction pathways. The MAS1 receptor is notably involved in the renin-angiotensin system, where it mediates vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects, counteracting the actions of angiotensin II and contributing to cardiovascular health (Hoffmann2017Mechanisms; Santos2003Angiotensin(1–7)). The receptor's interaction with proteins such as PSD95 and Gαi proteins underscores its regulatory complexity and its role in maintaining receptor stability and function (Burghi2019Participation; Bian2013Stabilization). Additionally, MAS1 is implicated in microglia-driven retinal vascular development and modulates anti-inflammatory responses, highlighting its significance in both vascular and neurological contexts (Foulquier2019The).

## Structure
The MAS1 proto-oncogene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which is essential for its role in signal transduction (Bian2013Stabilization). The receptor's C-terminus contains a PDZ domain-binding motif, specifically the ETVV (Glu-Thr-Val-Val) sequence, which is crucial for its interaction with the protein PSD95. This interaction is important for the stabilization of the MAS1 receptor by inhibiting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Bian2013Stabilization).

The MAS1 receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to the renin-angiotensin system, where it mediates effects such as vasodilation and anti-proliferation (Hoffmann2017Mechanisms). Although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided, the receptor's interaction with PSD95 suggests a significant role for its C-terminal region in maintaining receptor stability and function (Bian2013Stabilization). The receptor's structure and function are also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which regulate its expression levels (Bian2013Stabilization).

## Function
The MAS1 proto-oncogene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This receptor is involved in counteracting the effects of angiotensin II, promoting vasodilation, and reducing blood pressure, which are crucial for cardiovascular health (Santos2003Angiotensin(1–7) pages 1-1). The MAS1 receptor is activated by its endogenous ligand, angiotensin-(1–7), which leads to vasodilatory effects and contributes to the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance (Santos2003Angiotensin(1–7) pages 6-6).

In the vascular endothelium, MAS1 receptor signaling involves several pathways, including the RHO family of GTPases, ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. These pathways are essential for endothelial function, angiogenesis, and vasodilation, highlighting the receptor's role in maintaining vascular health (Hoffmann2017Mechanisms). The receptor also modulates anti-inflammatory responses by downregulating NFκB signaling, which may contribute to its protective effects in the cardiovascular system (Hoffmann2017Mechanisms).

MAS1 is also implicated in microglia-driven retinal vascular development, where it facilitates microglia recruitment and interaction with endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and vascular growth (Foulquier2019The). This receptor's activation leads to the upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as Il-10, indicating a protective mechanism in the central nervous system (Foulquier2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MAS1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. In type 2 diabetes, the MAS1 receptor is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion through its interaction with Angiotensin(1-7) (Ang(1-7)) and the CFTR protein. Studies have shown that MAS1 levels are significantly higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic individuals, suggesting an enhanced Ang(1-7)/MAS1 pathway in this condition. This upregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes by affecting insulin secretion and potentially leading to insulin resistance (Zhang2022Angiotensin(1–7) pages 0-3 of 4).

In cardiovascular health, the interaction between MAS1 and the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) is crucial for the proangiogenic effects of Ang(1-7). This interaction is important for angiogenesis, particularly in skeletal muscle, and its disruption can impair angiogenic responses. The absence of AT1R has been shown to abolish the proangiogenic effects of Ang(1-7), indicating that MAS1's interaction with AT1R is essential for these processes (Exner2020Interaction). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of MAS1 in both metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
The MAS1 proto-oncogene, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function and stability. One notable interaction is with the protein PSD95 (postsynaptic density 95), which binds to the C-terminus of the Mas receptor through its PDZ1-2 domains. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of the Mas receptor, as it prevents its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The last four amino acids of the Mas C-terminus (ETVV) are essential for this binding, and mutations in this motif significantly impair the interaction (Bian2013Stabilization).

MAS1 also interacts with Gαi proteins, which are involved in modulating intracellular cAMP levels. This interaction is suggested by the reversal of cAMP decrease upon treatment with pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of Gαi proteins in MAS1 signaling pathways (Burghi2019Participation).

In addition, MAS1 is involved in signaling pathways that include the PI3K-Akt axis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are crucial for various cellular functions such as vasodilation and anti-inflammatory responses (Hoffmann2017Mechanisms). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms in which MAS1 participates, impacting cardiovascular and neurological functions.
