# LPAR6

## Overview
The LPAR6 gene encodes the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to various cellular signaling pathways. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is primarily involved in the regulation of hair growth and skin homeostasis (Geraldo2021Role; Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic). LPAR6 is located on chromosome Xq21.1 in humans and encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in phospholipid signaling, particularly through its interaction with Gαi and Gα12/13 proteins, influencing pathways such as Rho and ROCK (Geraldo2021Role; Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic). Mutations in the LPAR6 gene are linked to hair disorders like autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Akiyama2021Isolated; Raza2014In).

## Structure
The lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Geraldo2021Role). The primary structure of LPAR6 consists of 372 amino acids and is located on chromosome Xq21.1 in humans (Geraldo2021Role). 

In terms of secondary structure, LPAR6 includes both alpha-helical and beta-sheet regions. Molecular dynamics studies have shown significant conformational changes in these regions upon binding with conotoxins, particularly in the β-sheet region between residues Gln155-Glu170, which undergoes alterations in length and orientation (Younis2017Alpha). 

The tertiary structure of LPAR6 involves the 3D folding of its transmembrane helices, which is crucial for its function as a receptor. The extracellular domain plays a significant role in ligand binding, as demonstrated by the interaction with conotoxins (Younis2017Alpha). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, influencing receptor function and signaling, although specific modifications for LPAR6 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, but specific details are not available in the context. 

Overall, LPAR6's structure is integral to its role in cellular signaling and its involvement in various diseases, including cancer.

## Function
LPAR6, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is primarily involved in the regulation of hair growth and skin homeostasis. LPAR6 is located on chromosome 13 and encodes a protein that consists of 344 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 39 kDa (Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic). This receptor is part of the P2Y receptor family and exhibits a unique ligand-binding pattern, predominantly binding to 2-acyl-LPA rather than l-acyl-LPA (Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic).

In terms of molecular function, LPAR6 interacts with Gαi and Gα12/13 proteins, activating downstream signaling pathways that influence various cellular functions. Activation of the Gα12/13 family by LPAR6 leads to the expression of SRE regulatory genes through the activation of Rho and ROCK pathways, which are crucial for morphological changes and cAMP accumulation (Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic). LPAR6 is also involved in regulating vascular permeability and the formation of hair follicles, with its loss resulting in congenital alopecia (Xiang2020Lysophosphatidic). The receptor's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LPAR6 gene are associated with several hair disorders, primarily autosomal recessive woolly hair/hypotrichosis (ARWH) and hereditary hypotrichosis. ARWH is characterized by tightly curled hair and varying degrees of hair loss on the scalp. The condition is genetically heterogeneous, with LPAR6 mutations being a common cause, especially in the Pakistani population, where they account for 52.8% of identified cases (Akiyama2021Isolated; Khan2019Biallelic). Specific mutations, such as p.D63V and p.I188F, disrupt the LPAR6-LPA signaling pathway, leading to abnormal hair growth and the clinical manifestations of hypotrichosis (Raza2014In).

The LPAR6 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor involved in phospholipid signaling, crucial for hair follicle development. Mutations can alter the receptor's structure and function, affecting its ligand binding capabilities and leading to hair disorders (Raza2014In). The p.Asp63Val variant, for example, inhibits LPA binding, which is essential for normal hair development, resulting in varying degrees of alopecia (Pedurupillay2016Segregation). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of LPAR6 in maintaining normal hair growth and its potential disruption in hair-related conditions.

## Interactions
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. LPAR6 interacts with the RB1/E2F family complexes, particularly E2F2, which suggests a mechanism through which it may exert antitumor effects by inducing cell cycle arrest in breast cancer (Lei2021Lysophosphatidic). In prostate cancer, LPAR6 is associated with the focal adhesion adaptor protein paxillin (PXN). This interaction is crucial for the migration and metastasis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, as LPAR6 signaling promotes migration through the phosphorylation of PXN (Ketscher2014LSD1).

LPAR6 also participates in interactions with conotoxins, which are peptides derived from cone snail venom. These interactions occur at the extracellular region of LPAR6, involving hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic associations. Specific residues such as Arg73, Tyr76, and Arg270 are crucial for these interactions, highlighting the significance of the extracellular domain in binding with conotoxins (Younis2017Alpha). These interactions can lead to significant conformational changes in the β-sheet and α-helical regions of LPAR6, affecting its structural stability and function (Younis2017Alpha).
