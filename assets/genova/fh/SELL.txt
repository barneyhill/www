# SELL

## Overview
The SELL gene encodes L-selectin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating leukocyte adhesion and migration. L-selectin is categorized as a cell adhesion molecule and is predominantly expressed on the surface of leukocytes, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes. It facilitates the initial attachment of these cells to the endothelium, particularly at high endothelial venules (HEVs) in peripheral lymph nodes, which is essential for leukocyte trafficking and recirculation (Schleiffenbaum1992Soluble; Ivetic2018A). The protein's structure includes a C-type lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and short consensus repeat domains, which are crucial for its function in cell adhesion. L-selectin's interactions with specific carbohydrate ligands on endothelial cells enable leukocyte rolling and tethering, processes vital for immune surveillance and response (Rosen1993Lselectin). The regulation of L-selectin activity through proteolytic shedding and intracellular signaling underscores its dynamic role in modulating immune cell behavior (Ivetic2018A).

## Structure
L-selectin, encoded by the SELL gene, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration. The primary structure of L-selectin consists of a single polypeptide chain with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 30 kDa, though it ranges from 65 to 100 kDa due to differential glycosylation (Ivetic2019Lselectin:). The secondary structure includes a C-type lectin domain (CTLD) responsible for calcium-dependent binding to glycans, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and two short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (Ivetic2019Lselectin:; Ivetic2018A). These domains are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and migration.

The tertiary structure of L-selectin forms a globular shape, facilitating its interaction with ligands. The CTLD and EGF-like domain are connected by a flexible hinge region, enhancing ligand binding under flow conditions (Ivetic2018A). L-selectin can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure component (Ivetic2019Lselectin:).

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, are essential for L-selectin's function, affecting its molecular weight and binding affinity (Ivetic2019Lselectin:). Splice variants of L-selectin have been identified, with some lacking the transmembrane domain, resulting in soluble forms (Ivetic2019Lselectin:).

## Function
The SELL gene encodes L-selectin, a cell adhesion molecule crucial for leukocyte trafficking and immune response. L-selectin is expressed on the surface of most leukocytes, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, and facilitates the initial attachment of these cells to the endothelium and high endothelial venules (HEVs) in peripheral lymph nodes. This interaction is essential for leukocyte migration and recirculation, allowing them to exit the bloodstream and enter tissues (Kishimoto1990Identification; Schleiffenbaum1992Soluble).

L-selectin functions through its interaction with specific carbohydrate ligands on endothelial cells, which are crucial for leukocyte rolling and tethering. These interactions are mediated by the lectin domain of L-selectin, which recognizes sulfated and sialylated carbohydrate structures on its ligands (Rosen1993Lselectin).

The shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface, primarily mediated by the protease ADAM17, is a regulatory mechanism that modulates leukocyte adhesion and migration. This shedding process is influenced by intracellular signaling pathways and is crucial for the dynamic regulation of leukocyte behavior during immune responses (Kahn1994Membrane; Ivetic2018A). The cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin, containing phosphorylated serine residues, plays a significant role in its function by regulating interactions with intracellular proteins and affecting cell signaling pathways (Newe2019Serine; Ivetic2018A).

## Interactions
L-selectin (SELL) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of leukocyte adhesion and rolling. It interacts with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on neutrophils, monocytes, and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. This interaction is crucial for neutrophil rolling and recruitment to inflammation sites and is dependent on calcium, as well as the sulfation, sialylation, and O-glycosylation of PSGL-1 (Spertini1996Pselectin).

L-selectin also forms complexes with cytoskeletal proteins. It directly interacts with alpha-actinin through its cytoplasmic domain, specifically the carboxy-terminal 11 amino acids, which is essential for its function in binding and rolling along the endothelium. This interaction is direct and occurs via the rod domain of alpha-actinin. Vinculin is also part of this complex, likely associating indirectly through alpha-actinin. Talin, although not directly binding to L-selectin, enhances the binding of alpha-actinin to L-selectin, suggesting a potential multiprotein complex involving these cytoskeletal proteins (Pavalko1995The).

These interactions highlight the role of L-selectin in mediating leukocyte adhesion and rolling, which are critical steps in the immune response.
