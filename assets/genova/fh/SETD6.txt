# SETD6

## Overview
SETD6 is a gene that encodes the protein lysine methyltransferase known as SET domain containing 6. This enzyme is characterized by its SET domain, which is responsible for its methyltransferase activity, targeting both histone and non-histone proteins. SETD6 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, mitotic progression, and signaling pathways such as NF-κB and Wnt, which are crucial in cancer progression (Feldman2019The; MartínMorales2017SETD6). The protein's ability to methylate key substrates like the NFκB subunit RelA and kinases such as PAK4 and PLK1 underscores its importance in modulating cellular functions (Binda2019Lysine; Feldman2019The). Mutations in the SETD6 gene, such as frameshift mutations leading to truncated proteins, can disrupt its enzymatic activity, with implications for diseases like familial colorectal cancer type X (MartínMorales2017SETD6).

## Structure
SETD6 is a protein lysine methyltransferase characterized by a catalytic SET domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (MartínMorales2017SETD6). The SET domain is responsible for the methylation of both histone and non-histone proteins, including the NFκB subunit RelA and kinases such as PAK4 and PLK1 (Binda2019Lysine; Feldman2019The). The protein also contains a Rubisco substrate-binding domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Elisha2022Structurefunction).

A frameshift mutation in the SETD6 gene results in a truncated protein, SETD6-N, which lacks the C-terminal half, including the Rubisco domain, but retains the SET domain. This mutation leads to a loss of catalytic activity while maintaining substrate-binding properties (MartínMorales2017SETD6). The mutation introduces two new amino acids followed by a premature stop codon, affecting the protein's structure and function (MartínMorales2017SETD6).

SETD6 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and mitotic progression, through its methylation activity (Feldman2019The; Elisha2022Structurefunction). The protein's activity is essential for modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB and Wnt, which are implicated in cancer progression (MartínMorales2017SETD6).

## Function
SETD6 is a protein lysine methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in regulating mitotic progression in healthy human cells. It specifically methylates Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) on lysine residues K209 and K413 during mitosis. This methylation is essential for controlling PLK1's kinase activity, which is vital for proper mitotic progression. In the absence of SETD6, PLK1 activity increases, leading to accelerated mitosis and faster cellular proliferation, indicating that SETD6 helps maintain normal mitotic pace by modulating PLK1 activity (Feldman2019The).

SETD6 also plays a role in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by methylating the NF-κB subunit RelA at lysine 310. This modification is crucial for the basal inhibition of NF-κB signaling, which is important for inflammation and immune response regulation. Dysregulation of this pathway is associated with cancer progression (MartínMorales2017SETD6).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways, SETD6 is involved in hippocampus-dependent memory formation. It influences gene expression by affecting histone methylation, particularly H3K9me2, which is linked to synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation (Webb2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SETD6 gene have been implicated in familial colorectal cancer type X (FCCTX). A specific truncating mutation, c.791_792insA (p.Met264IlefsTer3), has been identified in affected members of a family with FCCTX. This mutation results in a truncated SETD6 protein that retains substrate-binding ability but lacks enzymatic activity, leading to a dominant negative effect. The mutant protein competes with the wild-type SETD6, potentially disrupting normal signaling pathways such as NF-κB and Wnt, which are associated with cancer progression (MartínMorales2017SETD6).

Alterations in SETD6 activity also affect other cellular processes. For instance, SETD6 methylates PAK4, influencing cell adhesion and migration, which are critical in cancer metastasis. In breast cancer cells, this methylation reduces cell adhesion and migration, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Vershinin2020PAK4).

SETD6 also methylates BRD4, affecting gene transcription related to mRNA translation. This interaction influences the recruitment of transcription factors like E2F1, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and potentially contributing to cancer development (Vershinin2021BRD4).

## Interactions
SETD6 is a protein lysine methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins, influencing several cellular processes. It methylates the p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) at chromatin, which is crucial for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the physical association between PAK4 and β-catenin, promoting the transcription of β-catenin target genes (Vershinin2016PAK4). SETD6 also interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) during mitosis, methylating it at lysines 209 and 413. This methylation negatively regulates PLK1's catalytic activity, thereby influencing mitotic progression (Feldman2019The).

SETD6 is involved in a positive feedback loop with the transcription factor E2F1. It methylates E2F1 at lysine 117, enhancing E2F1's binding to the SETD6 promoter and increasing SETD6 expression (Kublanovsky2023E2F1). Additionally, SETD6 methylates BRD4 at lysine 99, which regulates the transcription of genes involved in mRNA translation. This methylation affects BRD4's interaction with E2F1, influencing the transcription of target genes (Vershinin2021BRD4). These interactions highlight SETD6's role in regulating gene expression and cellular signaling pathways.
