# CTSB

## Overview
The CTSB gene encodes cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in intracellular protein degradation and processing. As a member of the papain-like protease family, cathepsin B is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. The enzyme is characterized by its bilobed tertiary structure, which includes an active site cleft regulated by an occluding loop, allowing it to function as both an endopeptidase and a carboxypeptidase (Jevnikar2011CTSB). Cathepsin B's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and glycosaminoglycans, influencing its role in physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases (Victor2007Cysteine; Chen2012Interaction). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like gliomas, Alzheimer's disease, and tropical calcific pancreatitis (Mahurkar2006Association; Ma2022CTSB; Hook2022Cathepsin).

## Structure
The human cathepsin B (CTSB) protein is a lysosomal cysteine protease with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a 339-residue polypeptide chain, which includes a signal peptide and a propeptide region. The signal peptide is a 17-residue hydrophobic sequence at the NH2 terminus, which is cleaved after synthesis to facilitate sequestration within the endoplasmic reticulum (Jevnikar2011CTSB; Chan1986Nucleotide).

The secondary structure of cathepsin B includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its bilobed tertiary structure. This structure forms an active site cleft, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The enzyme's active site is regulated by an 18-residue occluding loop, which can move to allow endopeptidase activity (Jevnikar2011CTSB).

Post-translational modifications of cathepsin B include glycosylation, which is significant for protein sorting into lysosomes (Chan1986Nucleotide). Cathepsin B can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some variants missing exon 2, which are predominant in human tumors (Jevnikar2011CTSB). These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's function in proteolytic processes.

## Function
Cathepsin B (CTSB) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a crucial role in protein degradation and processing within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the lysosomal compartment, where it contributes to the breakdown of proteins, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jevnikar2011CTSB). CTSB is involved in regulating lysosomal dynamics and autophagy by cleaving the calcium channel MCOLN1/TRPML1 in lysosomes, which suppresses the transcription factor TFEB. This suppression reduces the expression of lysosomal and autophagy-related proteins, helping to control the number and size of lysosomes and autophagosomes in the cell (Man2016Regulation).

CTSB also participates in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by degrading ECM proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV, which is important for tissue remodeling and repair (Jevnikar2011CTSB). It can act as both a carboxypeptidase and an endopeptidase, with its activity regulated by an 18-residue occluding loop that controls substrate access to the active site (Jevnikar2011CTSB). In addition to its proteolytic functions, CTSB may have non-proteolytic roles, such as influencing protein trafficking or degradation pathways (Sigloch2016Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CTSB gene (cathepsin B) are implicated in several diseases. In gliomas, CTSB is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis, immune cell infiltration, and immunosuppression. It is particularly prevalent in high-grade gliomas and linked to malignant phenotypes such as IDH wild-type and MGMT promoter unmethylation, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Ma2022CTSB).

In Alzheimer's disease, CTSB is involved in amyloid-beta production and plaque formation. Knockout studies in mouse models have shown that reducing CTSB levels can decrease amyloid plaque load and improve memory deficits, suggesting its role in disease pathology (Hook2022Cathepsin).

CTSB mutations are also linked to tropical calcific pancreatitis, where specific polymorphisms may trigger premature trypsinogen activation, leading to pancreatitis (Mahurkar2006Association). In colon cancer, CTSB overexpression is associated with increased tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes (Chan2010Cathepsin).

Additionally, a missense mutation in CTSB has been identified in palmoplantar keratoderma, leading to increased cathepsin B activity and a gain-of-function effect (Mohamad2020Palmoplantar).

## Interactions
Cathepsin B (CTSB) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. It interacts with S100A10, also known as p11, which is localized on the surface of tumor cells in membrane microdomains called caveolae. These domains also contain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases, contributing to malignancy (Victor2007Cysteine). CTSB also interacts with the human homolog of SETA binding protein 1 (hSB1), which co-localizes with CTSB in lysosomes and suppresses TNF-induced apoptosis without affecting CTSB's enzymatic activity (Liu2006Human).

CTSB's interaction with glycosaminoglycans, such as heparin and heparan sulfate, affects its proteolytic activity by reducing its exopeptidase activity while maintaining its endopeptidase activity. These interactions also protect CTSB from inactivation at alkaline pH (Victor2007Cysteine). In cancer, CTSB interacts with the hepatitis B spliced protein (HBSP), promoting hepatoma cell migration and invasion by activating the MAPK and PI3K pathways and increasing the expression of MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (Chen2012Interaction). These interactions highlight CTSB's role in modulating cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression.
