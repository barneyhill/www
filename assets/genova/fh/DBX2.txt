# DBX2

## Overview
DBX2 (developing brain homeobox 2) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during brain development. The DBX2 protein is crucial for the differentiation and specification of neuronal cell types within the central nervous system (CNS), particularly influencing neurogenesis and the formation of neural circuits (Shoji1996Regionalized). It is expressed in specific regions of the embryonic brain, such as the alar-basal boundaries of the caudal hypothalamus and the midbrain, highlighting its role in regional specification (Shoji1996Regionalized). In adult neural progenitor cells, DBX2 is associated with aging-related processes, where it inhibits cell proliferation and promotes neural stem cell quiescence, contributing to age-associated neurogenic decline (Giuliani2023Dbx2). The gene's expression is negatively regulated by EGFR signaling, which diminishes in aged neural tissues (Giuliani2023Dbx2). Mutations or deletions of DBX2 have been linked to developmental disorders, although its precise role in human diseases requires further investigation (Carlsen2015Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure


## Function
DBX2 (developing brain homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during brain development. It is involved in the differentiation and specification of neuronal cell types, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS) (Shoji1996Regionalized). DBX2 is expressed in specific regions of the embryonic brain, such as the alar-basal boundaries of the caudal hypothalamus and the midbrain, indicating its role in regional specification (Shoji1996Regionalized). The gene is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the transcription of target genes, impacting neurogenesis and the formation of neural circuits (Shoji1996Regionalized).

In adult neural progenitor cells, DBX2 is associated with aging-related processes. It inhibits the proliferation of these cells by hindering the G2/M transition in the cell cycle, which is a critical phase for cell division (Giuliani2023Dbx2). This inhibition is linked to the upregulation of inflammatory response pathways and the promotion of neural stem cell quiescence, contributing to age-associated neurogenic decline (Giuliani2023Dbx2). The expression of DBX2 is negatively regulated by EGFR signaling, which is reduced in aged neural tissues (Giuliani2023Dbx2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deletions involving the DBX2 gene have been associated with various developmental disorders. A study on a 10-year-old boy with a 1.13 Mb de novo deletion on chromosome 12q12, which includes DBX2, reported moderate intellectual disability, impaired motor skills, hypotonia, growth delay, and physical anomalies. This suggests that haploinsufficiency of DBX2, along with other genes like NELL2, may contribute to these clinical features (Carlsen2015Haploinsufficiency).

The deletion in this patient is the smallest reported in the HSA12q12 region and overlaps with deletions in other patients, indicating a potential 12q12 deletion syndrome phenotype characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, growth retardation, and skeletal and dental anomalies (Carlsen2015Haploinsufficiency). Despite the low expression levels of DBX2 in the patient, the study highlights the uncertainty in genotype-phenotype correlations due to variability in clinical presentations (Carlsen2015Haploinsufficiency).

In limb development, DBX2 is regulated by HOX13 transcription factors, but its deletion in mice does not result in major limb skeletal abnormalities, suggesting redundancy or compensation in its function (Beccari2021Dbx2). The clinical significance of DBX2 mutations in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in developmental processes suggests potential implications in related disorders.
