# KRTAP3-2

## Overview
KRTAP3-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 3-2, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically within the high sulfur KAP3 subgroup. This protein is integral to the structural composition of hair fibers, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that enhances the mechanical strength and resilience of hair. The KRTAP3-2 protein is characterized by its high proline and serine/threonine content, with a relatively lower cysteine content compared to other KAP families. It is primarily expressed in the hair cortex, playing a vital role in maintaining the integrity and texture of hair fibers. The evolutionary conservation of KRTAP3-2, as indicated by its orthologous relationship to the sheep B3B family, underscores its essential function in hair structure across species (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP3-2 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically part of the high sulfur KAP3 gene family, which includes KRTAP3-1 and KRTAP3-3. These proteins are characterized by their high proline and serine/threonine content, with a lower cysteine content compared to other KAP families. KRTAP3-2, like other KAP3 proteins, plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of hair fibers. It interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that provides mechanical strength and resilience to hair (Rogers2006Human).

The KAP3 family proteins, including KRTAP3-2, are relatively small, with a molecular weight of approximately 10.3-10.5 kDa, and exhibit a weak repeat structure. They share a strong sequence identity of about 71%, indicating a conserved function across species. The orthologous relationship of the KAP3 family to the sheep B3B family suggests an evolutionary conservation of their role in hair fiber structure (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP3-2 is primarily active in the hair cortex, contributing to the integrity and texture of hair fibers. Its expression and interaction with keratin filaments are essential for maintaining the mechanical properties of hair, ensuring its strength and resilience (Rogers2006Human).
