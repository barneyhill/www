# CAT

## Overview
The CAT gene encodes the enzyme catalase, a critical antioxidant protein that plays a vital role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Catalase is a tetrameric enzyme predominantly located in peroxisomes, where it catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus preventing cellular damage from reactive oxygen species (Putnam2000Active; Galasso2021Browsing). As a heme-containing enzyme, catalase is highly efficient, capable of processing millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules per second, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ighodaro2018First). The enzyme's activity is integral to various physiological processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, and it interacts with other antioxidant systems to modulate oxidative stress responses (Galasso2021Browsing; Nandi2019Role). Mutations or alterations in the CAT gene can lead to conditions such as acatalasemia and are implicated in diseases like diabetes and certain cancers, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Góth2013Inherited; Galasso2021Browsing).

## Structure
The human catalase enzyme, encoded by the CAT gene, is a tetrameric protein composed of four identical subunits, each with a molecular mass of approximately 55-60 kDa, resulting in a total mass of 220-240 kDa (Nandi2019Role). Each subunit contains 497 amino acid residues and is organized into four domains: the N-terminal threading arm, C-terminal helices, wrapping loop, and a β-barrel core structure (Goyal2010Human; Nandi2019Role). The β-barrel consists of eight antiparallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices, forming a hydrophobic core (Putnam2000Active; Nandi2019Role).

The enzyme's active site contains a heme group with a pentacoordinated iron atom, essential for its catalytic activity (Putnam2000Active). The heme is positioned at the bottom of a 25 Å-long channel, which selectively allows hydrogen peroxide to reach the active site (Putnam2000Active). The enzyme also binds NADPH, which is located in a cleft between the helical domain and the β-barrel, stabilizing the enzyme and preventing the formation of an inactive form (Putnam2000Active; Nandi2019Role).

Catalase is extensively hydrated, with water molecules filling packing defects between domains and subunits, except in the hydrophobic β-barrel and near the active site (Putnam2000Active). The tetrameric structure is crucial for its function, as it sequesters the active site and prevents the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Putnam2000Active; Goyal2010Human).

## Function
Catalase, encoded by the CAT gene, is a crucial enzyme in human cells that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water and oxygen, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Putnam2000Active; Galasso2021Browsing). This enzyme is predominantly located in peroxisomes, where it plays a vital role in cellular detoxification processes (Ighodaro2018First; Galasso2021Browsing). Catalase is highly efficient, capable of breaking down millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules per second, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress (Ighodaro2018First; Galasso2021Browsing).

In healthy human cells, catalase modulates H2O2 levels, which are involved in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Galasso2021Browsing). The enzyme's activity is crucial for regulating physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cell death, and mitochondrial function (Ighodaro2018First). Catalase also interacts with other proteins involved in oxidative stress responses, such as superoxide dismutase and peroxiredoxin 5, contributing to the longevity regulating and FOXO signaling pathways in mammals (Nandi2019Role). Its function is critical in protecting cells from oxidative stress and is linked to the pathogenesis and progression of oxidative stress-related diseases (Nandi2019Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CAT gene, which encodes the enzyme catalase, have significant clinical implications. Catalase is crucial for decomposing hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress. Deficiencies in catalase activity, such as those seen in acatalasemia and hypocatalasemia, can lead to increased oxidative damage and are associated with various diseases. Acatalasemia, characterized by a near-total deficiency of catalase activity, has been linked to oral lesions and increased susceptibility to diabetes mellitus, particularly Type 2 diabetes, due to oxidative damage to insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells (Góth2013Inherited).

In Crohn's disease, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CAT gene, such as rs1001179, are associated with decreased catalase expression and activity, contributing to increased oxidative stress and disease pathogenesis (Iborra2022The). Similarly, in cancer, alterations in catalase expression can influence disease progression and therapy response. For instance, higher catalase expression is linked to a positive response in acute myeloid leukemia but correlates with faster progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Galasso2021Browsing). These findings underscore the importance of catalase in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in various diseases.

## Interactions
Human catalase (CAT) is involved in various interactions that influence its activity and stability. It interacts with NADPH, which, although not essential for catalase activity, helps protect the enzyme from inactivation by low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. This interaction is thought to decrease susceptibility to inactivation and may serve as a regulatory mechanism (Goyal2010Human).

Catalase also interacts with other antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins, to facilitate the removal of hydrogen peroxide, particularly at higher concentrations (Kodydková2014Human). These interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and protecting cells from oxidative damage.

In the context of oxidative stress, catalase activity can be modulated by bisphenol A (BPA), which binds to the enzyme and causes structural changes. This interaction is primarily driven by hydrophobic and electrostatic effects, with BPA binding strongly to the Trp185 residue of catalase (Piao2019Investigation).

Catalase's interactions extend to its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and apoptosis, where it can exhibit both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic actions depending on the context (Goyal2010Human).
