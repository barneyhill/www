# DPY30

## Overview
DPY30 is a gene that encodes the dpy-30 histone methyltransferase complex regulatory subunit, a protein integral to the regulation of histone methylation within the MLL/SET1 complexes. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, playing a pivotal role in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active gene expression and chromatin remodeling. The dpy-30 protein is characterized by its involvement in the formation of a dimerization domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins such as ASH2L, thereby enhancing the methyltransferase activity of the SET1/MLL complexes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the epigenetic landscape necessary for normal cellular processes, including embryonic stem cell differentiation and neural development. Alterations in DPY30 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Luo2023DPY30; Jiang2011Role; Chen2012Structure).

## Structure
DPY30 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of histone methylation, specifically in the MLL/SET1 complexes. Structurally, DPY30 contains a C-terminal dimerization domain (DPY30 DD), which forms a canonical four-helix-bundle conformation with an extensive hydrophobic surface. This structure is similar to the RIIa isoform of a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value of 2.1 Å when superimposed (Chen2012Structure).

The interaction between DPY30 and ASH2L is primarily mediated by hydrophobic contacts, where specific residues from ASH2L fit into a hydrophobic groove formed by the α1 helix of both DPY30 DD protomers. This interaction is crucial for the function of the MLL/SET1 complexes, as it enhances H3K4 methylation on nucleosome core particles (Lee2021Mechanism). The stability of DPY30 is dependent on its binding with ASH2L, specifically through the SDI domain of ASH2L, which prevents its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Ma2022The).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DPY30 are not fully detailed, its dimerization domain and interaction with ASH2L are critical for its regulatory functions in chromatin modification.

## Function
DPY30 is a core component of the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complexes, which are responsible for catalyzing the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4). This modification is associated with active gene expression and plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation in healthy human cells (Jiang2011Role; Luo2023DPY30). DPY30 is essential for the full methyltransferase activity of the SET1/MLL complexes, facilitating the tri-methylation of H3K4, a key epigenetic mark that promotes gene transcription by recruiting transcription factors and coactivators to gene promoters (Lee2015Roles; Luo2023DPY30).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), DPY30 is involved in maintaining a poised chromatin state at developmental genes, which is crucial for cell-fate transitions and differentiation, particularly along the neural lineage (Jiang2011Role). Although DPY30 does not directly bind to the catalytic subunit of the SET1/MLL complex, it is necessary for the methylation activity of the complex, influencing the expression of proteins such as MYC and ID, and the transcriptional activity of E2F (Luo2023DPY30). DPY30's role in histone methylation and gene expression regulation is critical for normal cellular development and function, impacting processes such as hematopoietic and neural development (Lee2015Roles; Luo2023DPY30).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DPY30 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DPY30 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with pathological grading, tumor size, TNM stage, and tumor location. Knockdown of DPY30 in CRC cells results in reduced tumorigenicity, decreased cell proliferation, and cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in promoting CRC progression through epigenetic regulation (Su2023DPY30). DPY30 also facilitates CRC metastasis by upregulating ZEB1 transcriptional expression, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells (Luo2023DPY30).

In gastric cancer, DPY30 is upregulated in cell lines and patient tissues, with its knockdown inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. High DPY30 expression is associated with poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer, and its knockdown suppresses growth and invasion of these cancer cells (Jiang2020The). In esophageal cancer, high DPY30 expression is linked to advanced tumor stages and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Mei2022Identification).

Mutations affecting DPY30, particularly in the context of the SET1/MLL complex, are associated with developmental disorders. Genomic deletions extending into DPY30 can lead to early onset of hereditary spastic paraplegias due to impaired cytoplasmic DPY30 activity (Jiang2020The).

## Interactions
DPY30 is a versatile protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It is a subunit of the mammalian COMPASS-like complexes, which are involved in regulating global histone H3 Lys-4 trimethylation. DPY30 interacts with ASH2L, a subunit of these complexes, through hydrophobic interactions between an amphipathic α helix on ASH2L and the DPY30 dimerization/docking (D/D) module. This interaction is essential for maintaining high levels of histone H3K4me3 and regulating MLL1 methyltransferase activity (Tremblay2014Molecular).

DPY30 also interacts with BAP18, a subunit of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) complex, and BIG1, among others. These interactions are mediated by a specific motif present in the interacting proteins, and the binding specificity is demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down experiments (Tremblay2014Molecular). The interaction with ASH2L is particularly important for the function of the COMPASS complex, which is involved in histone modification (Tremblay2014Molecular).

In addition to its role in chromatin modification, DPY30 is involved in the regulation of gene expression, such as activating Ccnd1 expression independently of ASH2L, suggesting its multifunctionality in gene regulation (Ma2022The).
