# VEZT

## Overview
VEZT is a gene that encodes the protein vezatin, an integral transmembrane protein involved in cell adhesion processes. Vezatin is characterized by its two transmembrane domains and plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions, which are essential for maintaining tissue integrity. As a component of the E-cadherin-catenins complex, vezatin facilitates the recruitment of myosin VIIA to adherens junctions, thereby stabilizing the interactions between the complex and the actin cytoskeleton (Bahloul2009Vezatin; Pagliardini2015Replication). Vezatin's involvement in cellular processes extends to its regulatory role in gene expression related to cell adhesion and invasion, suggesting its potential function as a tumor suppressor (Pagliardini2015Replication). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in healthy human cells and is necessary for epithelial homeostasis (Albertsen2017Genes). Alterations in VEZT expression have been linked to diseases such as gastric cancer and endometriosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Miao2013VEZT; HoldsworthCarson2016Endometrial).

## Structure
The VEZT protein, also known as vezatin, is an integral membrane protein characterized by two adjacent transmembrane domains. These domains are located at positions 134-158 and 166-188 of the amino acid sequence, indicating its role as a transmembrane protein (Bahloul2009Vezatin). The protein has two main isoforms in mice, with molecular weights of 88 kDa and 71 kDa, which differ in their C-terminal regions (Bahloul2009Vezatin). The N- and C-terminal ends of vezatin are intracellular, and the protein lacks a large extracellular region (Bahloul2009Vezatin).

Vezatin interacts with several proteins, including radixin, an actin-binding protein, which suggests its involvement in stabilizing cell-cell junctions by linking to the actin cytoskeleton (Bahloul2009Vezatin). This interaction is crucial for the stability of adherens junctions, particularly in cochlear hair cells (Bahloul2009Vezatin). The protein is also part of a molecular complex associated with the ankle links in cochlear hair cells, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of hair bundles (Michalski2007Molecular). Specific mutations in the VEZT gene, such as c.275C>G (p.A92G) and c.1747A>T (p.D503V), have been identified, affecting the first transmembrane segment and the C-terminal region, respectively (Bahloul2009Vezatin).

## Function
VEZT, or vezatin, is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion, particularly at adherens junctions. These junctions are essential for maintaining tissue integrity by linking the cytoskeleton to the cell membrane. VEZT is a component of the E-cadherin-catenins complex, which is crucial for cell-cell adhesion. It mediates the recruitment of myosin VIIA to adherens junctions, complementing E-cadherin's link to actin via β-catenin and α-catenin, thereby stabilizing the interactions between the E-cadherin-catenins complex and the actin cytoskeleton (Albertsen2017Genes; Pagliardini2015Replication).

VEZT is also involved in the regulation of gene expression related to cell adhesion and invasion, as it can enter the cell nucleus to influence these processes. This regulatory function suggests that VEZT may act as a putative tumor suppressor by targeting genes involved in cell migration and invasion (Pagliardini2015Replication). In healthy human cells, VEZT is ubiquitously expressed and is necessary for maintaining epithelial homeostasis, as its expression, along with E-cadherin, is required to preserve the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Albertsen2017Genes).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VEZT gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably gastric cancer and endometriosis. In gastric cancer, VEZT is considered a putative tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is often downregulated in gastric tumor samples, primarily due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. This downregulation is linked to increased tumor invasiveness, lymphatic metastasis, and advanced TNM stages. Restoring VEZT expression in gastric cancer cells has been shown to reduce their invasive and migratory capacities, as well as inhibit growth and tumorigenicity (Beheshtizadeh2017Analysis; Miao2013VEZT).

In endometriosis, genetic variants at the 12q22 locus, particularly the SNP rs10859871, have been associated with altered VEZT expression. This SNP is linked to increased VEZT expression in individuals carrying the risk allele, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of endometriosis by enhancing the capacity of lesion epithelia to establish and maintain connections to the basement membrane. The study of VEZT in endometriosis highlights its potential role in disease risk modulation through genetic and expression changes (HoldsworthCarson2016Endometrial).

## Interactions
VEZT, also known as vezatin, is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion by interacting with various proteins. It is known to interact with myosin VIIA, a motor protein, through its C-terminal FERM domain. This interaction is crucial for linking myosin VIIA to the cadherin-catenin complex, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions (KusselAndermann2000Vezatin). VEZT also interacts with the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at neuromuscular synapses, particularly binding to the β and δ subunits. This interaction is important for synapse maturation and stabilization (Koppel2019Vezatin).

VEZT is involved in the recruitment of Arf6, a protein that plays a role in endosomal trafficking, to AChR-bound VEZT, potentially regulating synaptic maturation (Koppel2019Vezatin). In epithelial cells, VEZT is necessary for the InlA-dependent uptake of Listeria, where it recruits myosin VIIA to the entry site, highlighting its role in cellular entry processes (Sousa2004Unconventional). VEZT's interaction with the cadherin-catenin complex is also crucial for cell-cell adhesion, as it co-immunoprecipitates with E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and both α- and β-catenins (KusselAndermann2000Vezatin).
