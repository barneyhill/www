# FAM83C

## Overview
FAM83C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 83, specifically member C. This protein is part of a larger family known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including signal transduction pathways. FAM83C has been identified as playing a significant role in cancer biology, with its expression levels being linked to tumor progression and patient prognosis in several cancer types. The protein encoded by FAM83C is implicated in modulating immune cell infiltration within tumors, which may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes (Zhang2021Comprehensive). Despite its recognized importance in oncology, further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which FAM83C contributes to cancer and other diseases (Yuan2022Pan-cancer).

## Clinical Significance
FAM83C has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), FAM83C is significantly upregulated, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. This suggests that FAM83C may play a role in tumor progression and could serve as a prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer (Zhang2021Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration, with high levels correlating with decreased infiltration of immune cells such as B cells and CD8+ T cells, which may contribute to its role in cancer progression (Zhang2021Comprehensive).

In a broader cancer context, FAM83C expression is positively correlated with other FAM83 family members, indicating potential common roles in tumor biology. Its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis across different cancer types, with low expression linked to a good prognosis in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (Yuan2022Pan-cancer). Despite its involvement in various cancers, detailed studies on FAM83C's specific mutations and their direct impact on diseases remain limited (Yuan2022Pan-cancer).
