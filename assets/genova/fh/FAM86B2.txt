# FAM86B2

## Overview
FAM86B2 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 86, specifically member B2. This gene is of particular interest due to its potential involvement in human brain development, as suggested by its interactions with other proteins, such as CCT4, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease (Zhang2015New). Although the precise biological functions of the FAM86B2 protein remain largely uncharacterized, its classification within a family of proteins with sequence similarity suggests a conserved role that may be critical in specific cellular processes. The challenges in amplifying FAM86B2 cDNA from human cells have limited detailed studies on its structure and interactions, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its functional significance (Davydova2014Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
FAM86B2, a human-specific hub gene, has been implicated in potential brain development functions through its interactions with other proteins. Notably, FAM86B2 interacts with CCT4, a gene associated with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a possible role in brain development (Zhang2015New). This interaction was identified through a 'guilt by connection' analysis, which inferred the potential functions of FAM86B2 by examining its direct linking partners. The analysis revealed that a significant percentage of the first-layer linking partners of FAM86B2 are involved in brain development, supporting the hypothesis that FAM86B2 may have associated functions in this area (Zhang2015New).

While the study by Davydova et al. primarily focused on FAM86A, it did not provide specific information on FAM86B2 protein interactions due to difficulties in amplifying FAM86B2 cDNA from human cells (Davydova2014Identification). Similarly, other studies have not detailed specific protein interactions involving FAM86B2, leaving its interaction profile largely unexplored in the current literature. Therefore, the interaction with CCT4 remains a key point of interest in understanding the functional role of FAM86B2 in human biology.
