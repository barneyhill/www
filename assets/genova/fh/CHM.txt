# CHM

## Overview
The CHM gene encodes the Rab escort protein 1 (REP-1), a critical component in the post-translational modification of Rab GTPases through prenylation. This modification is essential for the proper localization and function of Rab proteins in intracellular vesicular trafficking. REP-1, a cytosolic protein, operates as part of the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGTase) complex, facilitating the attachment of isoprene lipids to Rab proteins, which is crucial for their membrane association and function. The protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes multiple helices and β-sheets, and it contains a Rab-binding domain essential for its interaction with Rab proteins. Mutations in the CHM gene can lead to structural and functional impairments of REP-1, contributing to the pathogenesis of choroideremia, an X-linked retinal degenerative disease (Imani2018Molecular; Gutkowska2012Structure; Sergeev2009The).

## Structure
The CHM gene encodes the Rab escort protein 1 (REP-1), which plays a crucial role in the prenylation of Rab GTPases, essential for intracellular vesicular trafficking. REP-1 is a 95-kDa protein that forms part of the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGTase) complex, facilitating the transfer of isoprene lipids to Rab proteins (Imani2018Molecular; Sergeev2009The). The protein structure of REP-1 includes three structural domains with 21 helices and β-structural segments forming three major β-sheets (Sergeev2009The).

REP-1 contains a Rab-binding domain, which is crucial for its function. This domain interacts with Rab proteins via an extended interface involving the switch 1 and 2 regions. The C-terminus of REP-1 acts as a mobile lid covering a conserved hydrophobic patch, coordinating the C-terminus of Rab proteins (Gutkowska2012Structure). The C-terminal binding region (CBR) of REP-1 promotes prenylation by localizing Rab C-terminal cysteines near the RGGT active site (Gutkowska2012Structure).

Mutations in the CHM gene can lead to structural changes in REP-1, affecting its stability and function. For instance, the L550P missense mutation alters the conformation of the polypeptide backbone and hydrogen-bonding patterns, destabilizing the protein (Sergeev2009The). These structural changes can impair REP-1's ability to assist in the geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins, contributing to the pathogenesis of choroideremia (Sergeev2009The).

## Function
The CHM gene encodes Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP1), which is essential for the prenylation of Rab GTPases, a critical post-translational modification that facilitates their proper localization and function in intracellular trafficking (Gutkowska2012Structure; Tolmachova2012CHMREP1). REP1 operates in the cytosol, where it binds unprenylated Rab substrates and assists Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (RabGGTase) in attaching prenyl groups to the C-terminus of Rab proteins (Tolmachova2012CHMREP1). This modification is crucial for the Rab proteins' role in regulating vesicular transport, including endocytosis and exocytosis, by enabling their association with cellular membranes (Sergeev2009The).

In healthy human cells, REP1 ensures the correct prenylation of Rab proteins, which is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes such as vesicle movement and membrane trafficking (Gutkowska2012Structure). REP1 works alongside its paralog, REP2, which can compensate for the loss of REP1 in most tissues, except in the eye, where specific Rabs like Rab27a remain underprenylated (Gutkowska2012Structure). This functional redundancy is crucial for the proper functioning of cellular processes across different tissues (Sergeev2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHM gene, which encodes the Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), are primarily associated with choroideremia, an X-linked recessive retinal degenerative disease. This condition is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choroid, photoreceptors, and retinal pigment epithelium, leading to night blindness and eventual complete blindness in affected males (Esposito2011Comprehensive; Fioretti2021Molecular). The mutations in the CHM gene include deletions, nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and splice site mutations, often resulting in a premature termination codon that disrupts the normal function of REP-1 (van2003Novel; Ramsden2013A).

The loss of REP-1 function affects the prenylation of Rab GTPases, which are crucial for intracellular vesicular trafficking. This deficiency is particularly detrimental in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, where REP-1 is essential for normal cellular function (Zeitz2021CHM). Although REP-2, encoded by the CHML gene, can compensate for REP-1 deficiency in most tissues, it does not do so in the eye, leading to the disease's ocular phenotype (Zeitz2021CHM).

Mutations in the CHM gene can also arise from C>T transitions, a common mutation mechanism, and may involve regulatory regions such as the promoter, affecting gene expression (Esposito2011Comprehensive; Radziwon2017Singlebase). Genetic testing is crucial for diagnosing choroideremia and identifying carriers, as well as for potential gene-based therapies (Ramsden2013A).

## Interactions
The CHM gene encodes Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), which plays a crucial role in the prenylation and membrane targeting of Rab GTPases. REP-1 interacts with Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RGGTase) to facilitate the prenylation of Rab proteins, a process essential for their membrane association and function in vesicular trafficking (Esposito2011Comprehensive; Alexandrov1994Rab). The interaction between REP-1 and RGGTase is critical, as mutations such as the p.H507R variant can disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired prenylation and function of Rab proteins (Esposito2011Comprehensive).

REP-1 forms a complex with prenylated Rab proteins, assisting in their delivery to target membranes. This interaction is distinct from that of guanine-nucleotide-dissociation-inhibitor (GDI), which can retrieve Rab proteins from membranes, a function REP-1 does not perform (Alory2003Molecular; Alexandrov1994Rab). The REP-1 and RGGTase interaction is essential for the biological function of Rab proteins, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to diseases such as choroideremia, characterized by retinal degeneration (Strunnikova2009LossofFunction).
