# PRRT3

## Overview
The PRRT3 gene encodes the proline-rich transmembrane protein 3, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich regions, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular signaling pathways. While the specific biological functions of PRRT3 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply that it may participate in various cellular processes, possibly through interactions with other membrane-associated proteins. Further research is needed to clarify its role in health and disease, as well as its potential involvement in specific signaling pathways.
