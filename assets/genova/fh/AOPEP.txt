# AOPEP

## Overview
The AOPEP gene encodes the aminopeptidase O protein, a putative enzyme that is part of the M1 family of metalloproteases. This family is characterized by its zinc-binding motif, which is crucial for the catalytic activity of its members. Aminopeptidase O is primarily involved in the cleavage of amino acids from the N-terminus of peptide substrates, playing a significant role in protein processing and degradation. It is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and peptide hormone regulation. The protein's function extends to physiological roles such as blood pressure regulation and immune response, and it has been linked to muscle metabolism and gut microbiota interactions. Mutations in the AOPEP gene have been associated with medical conditions such as dystonia and muscle atrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Atasu2024Dissecting; Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase; Gao2024Aminopeptidase).

## Structure
AOPEP, or aminopeptidase O, is a protein encoded by the human AOPEP gene and is part of the M1 family of metalloproteases. This family is characterized by a zinc-binding motif that is essential for the protein's catalytic activity. AOPEP likely contains a peptidase M1 domain, which plays a role in peptide cleavage. The presence of this domain suggests that AOPEP functions in the processing of peptide substrates, although specific structural details such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not well-documented.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function of AOPEP, although specific sites and effects of these modifications are not detailed in the available information. The structural understanding of AOPEP is limited, and further research is needed to elucidate its complete molecular architecture and functional implications. The potential existence of splice variant isoforms could also contribute to the diversity of AOPEP's functional roles, but specific isoforms have not been described in the provided context. Overall, while AOPEP is recognized as a member of the metalloprotease family with a likely role in peptide processing, detailed structural insights remain to be fully explored.

## Function
The AOPEP gene encodes the aminopeptidase O protein, which is a putative enzyme belonging to the M1 family of metalloproteases. This enzyme is involved in the cleavage of amino acids from the N-terminus of peptide substrates, playing a role in protein processing and degradation. AOPEP is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is thought to influence various cellular processes, including signal transduction and peptide hormone regulation. It may also impact physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation and immune response (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).

In the context of muscle metabolism, AOPEP has been identified as a pathogenic gene related to muscle atrophy. Its expression is associated with decreased appendicular lean mass (ALM), suggesting that suppressing AOPEP expression could potentially increase ALM. This indicates a role in muscle metabolism, possibly through the regulation of angiotensin and muscle metabolism pathways (Gao2024Aminopeptidase). The gene's expression is also linked to the gut microbiota, specifically the Lachnospiraceae family, which co-regulates angiotensin and muscle metabolism, highlighting the potential of altering gut microbiota composition to improve muscle symptoms in conditions like cachexia (Gao2024Aminopeptidase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AOPEP gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. A homozygous truncating variant in AOPEP has been identified in a family with early adulthood-onset isolated dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. This variant, p.G686EfsTer17, is associated with DYT31, which causes multifocal or generalized dystonia. The mutation affects the protein's structure, leading to deficiencies in biological functions such as leukotriene-A4 hydrolase activity and interleukin-1 receptor binding, suggesting a role in dystonia pathogenesis (Atasu2024Dissecting).

AOPEP expression is also linked to appendicular lean mass (ALM). Increased AOPEP expression correlates with decreased ALM, indicating that suppressing AOPEP may enhance muscle mass. This relationship is mediated by the gut microbiota genus Lachnospiraceae, which influences muscle metabolism (Gao2024Aminopeptidase).

In Alzheimer's disease research, AOPEP has been associated with kidney disorders, such as nephrotic syndrome, in certain subtypes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Shigemizu2023Classification). Additionally, an intronic variant of AOPEP, rs2767403, has shown a potential link to suicide-related phenotypes in individuals with bipolar disorder, possibly affecting mRNA splicing and expression of related microRNAs (Lybech2021Suicide).
