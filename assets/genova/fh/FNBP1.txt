# FNBP1

## Overview
FNBP1, or formin binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and dynamics. The protein, categorized as a member of the F-BAR domain-containing family, plays a pivotal role in membrane curvature and cellular processes such as endocytosis, cell motility, and cancer cell survival. It achieves these functions through its structural domains, including the F-BAR domain, which facilitates membrane binding and curvature, and the SH3 domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions essential for actin polymerization (Heath2008FBAR; Zhang2023FNBP1). FNBP1's involvement in cellular signaling pathways and its interactions with proteins like dynamin-2 and N-WASP underscore its significance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang2023FNBP1; Wang2022Membrane).

## Structure
The FNBP1 protein, also known as formin binding protein 1, is characterized by the presence of an F-BAR domain, which is crucial for its role in membrane curvature and binding. This domain is structurally similar to BAR domains, forming elongated dimers with a central six-helical bundle, resulting in a crescent-shaped molecule. The helices in the F-BAR domain are relatively long and shallow, correlating with the diameter of the tubules they form (Heath2008FBAR).

FNBP1 also contains a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions by recruiting proteins such as WASP, WASP-interacting protein (WIP), and dynamin-2 to the plasma membrane, thereby triggering actin polymerization. The SH3 domain is separated from the F-BAR domain by a consensus Rho-binding motif (RBD) that interacts with Rho proteins (Zhang2023FNBP1).

The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. FNBP1 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles (Hinkle2022Alternative). These structural features enable FNBP1 to play a significant role in cellular processes like endocytosis, cell motility, and cancer cell survival.

## Function
FNBP1, or formin binding protein 1, plays a critical role in the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and invasion. It is a member of the F-Bar/EFC family and contains a distinct F-BAR domain that allows it to bind to curved membranes, altering plasma membrane tension and regulating cell polarity. This interaction induces tubular invagination, which activates actin assembly, a process crucial for endocytosis and cell migration driven by pseudopodia (Wang2022Membrane).

FNBP1 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process vital for cellular uptake and signaling. It is recruited to clathrin-coated pits, suggesting its role in this ubiquitous process. FNBP1 also participates in dynamin-mediated endocytosis, both clathrin-dependent and independent, and is involved in receptor trafficking through its interaction with sorting nexin 2 (SNX2) (A2016MicroarraysEnabled).

In healthy cells, FNBP1 is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cell shape and motility. It facilitates actin polymerization by recruiting proteins like N-WASP and activating the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for cell movement and structural integrity (Wang2022Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
FNBP1 (formin binding protein 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels or genetic mutations. In neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, FNBP1 is part of a 17-gene signature associated with good prognosis. High expression of FNBP1 is linked to favorable event-free survival (EFS), suggesting its potential role in stratifying patients for personalized therapies (Currie2024A). However, another study found that high expression of FNBP1 is associated with a lower probability of 5-year EFS, indicating its complex role in prognosis (Currie2024A).

In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), FNBP1 is involved in chromosomal aberrations in the 9q34.11q34.12 region, particularly in the myeloid blast phase, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of CML (Makishima2011CBL). Additionally, FNBP1 is mentioned in the context of a complex cryptic rearrangement in a CML case, highlighting its role in genetic abnormalities (Peterson2019Use).

FNBP1 has also been identified in a multi-ethnic meta-analysis as a novel gene associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although the specific implications of this association require further research (Nakamura2020A).

## Interactions
FNBP1, also known as formin-binding protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with dynamin-2, which is essential for the formation of invadopodia, structures that facilitate tumor cell invasion. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where FNBP1's role in cell migration and invasion is highlighted (Wang2022Membrane).

FNBP1 also recruits N-WASP to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for actin polymerization. This recruitment facilitates the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, leading to the assembly of the actin branch skeleton, a process vital for cell motility and endocytosis (Wang2022Membrane; Zhang2023FNBP1). The SH3 domain of FNBP1 is involved in recruiting proteins such as WASP, WASP-interacting protein (WIP), and dynamin-2, further supporting its role in actin dynamics and membrane deformation (Zhang2023FNBP1).

In the context of cervical cancer, FNBP1 is implicated in the FAK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, where it may facilitate the recruitment of the N-WASP/WIP complex to the membrane, promoting actin polymerization and enhancing integrin engagement with the extracellular matrix (Zhang2023FNBP1). These interactions underscore FNBP1's critical role in cellular adhesion and survival, particularly in cancer cells.
