# TCP11X1

## Overview
The TCP11X1 gene encodes the t-complex 11 family, X-linked 1 protein, which is a member of the t-complex protein family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. As an X-linked gene, TCP11X1 is located on the X chromosome, which has implications for its expression patterns and potential involvement in sex-linked genetic conditions. The protein encoded by TCP11X1 is thought to play a role in reproductive biology, given its homology to other t-complex proteins known to be involved in sperm function and fertility (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the biological pathways and interactions in which TCP11X1 is involved.
