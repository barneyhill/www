# SOWAHA

## Overview
The SOWAHA gene, also known as ANKRD43, encodes the protein sosondowah ankyrin repeat domain family member A, which is a part of the ankyrin repeat domain family. This family is characterized by its role in mediating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell signaling, cell cycle regulation, and cell adhesion (yi2024sowaha). The SOWAHA gene is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, indicating its potential importance in nervous system functions. Additionally, it is expressed in other tissues, including the colon, lung, and thyroid, suggesting a broader role in normal cellular activities across different tissues (yi2024sowaha). The protein encoded by SOWAHA is implicated in several cancer-related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT and P53 pathways, highlighting its significance in cell growth and apoptosis regulation (yi2024sowaha). While the precise mechanisms of SOWAHA in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated, its expression patterns and involvement in critical pathways underscore its potential role in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis (yi2024sowaha).

## Structure


## Function
The SOWAHA gene, also known as ANKRD43, encodes a protein that is part of the ankyrin repeat domain family, which is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for various biological processes, including cell signaling, cell cycle control, and cell adhesion (yi2024sowaha). SOWAHA is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, suggesting a significant role in nervous system functions. It is also found in other tissues such as colon enterocytes, respiratory ciliated cells in the lung, and thyroid glandular cells, indicating its involvement in normal cellular functions across different tissues (yi2024sowaha).

The gene is associated with various metabolic processes and enzyme activities, as indicated by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. It is involved in multiple cancer-related signaling pathways, including the PI3K-AKT and P53 signaling pathways, which are critical for regulating cell growth and apoptosis (yi2024sowaha). Although the specific mechanisms of SOWAHA in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its expression in key tissues and involvement in essential cellular pathways suggest it plays a vital role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (yi2024sowaha).

## Clinical Significance
The SOWAHA gene, also known as ANKRD43, has been identified as a potential cancer suppressor gene, particularly in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD). Alterations in its expression levels are associated with various cancer prognoses. Low expression of SOWAHA is linked to poor outcomes in several cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma (GBMLGG), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) (yi2024sowaha). Conversely, high expression is associated with poor prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and mesothelioma (MESO) (yi2024sowaha).

SOWAHA is involved in several cancer-related pathways, such as the PI3K-AKT and NF-kappa B signaling pathways, and is associated with metabolic processes and enzyme activities (yi2024sowaha). Its expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, with significant correlations found in various cancer types (yi2024sowaha). Additionally, SOWAHA's DNA methylation levels vary across different cancers, affecting survival probabilities (yi2024sowaha).

In gliomas, SOWAHA is part of the G-CIMP methylation signature, which is associated with improved prognosis and often linked to IDH1 gene mutations (McCarthy2016MethylMeter). These findings suggest that SOWAHA expression and mutations could have significant clinical implications in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.
