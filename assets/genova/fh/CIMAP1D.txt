# CIMAP1D

## Overview
CIMAP1D is a gene that encodes the protein CIMAP1 family member D, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein belongs to a family of proteins that are characterized by their specific roles in cellular signaling pathways, although the precise function of CIMAP1 family member D remains to be fully elucidated. It is hypothesized to play a role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of CIMAP1D is crucial for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease.
