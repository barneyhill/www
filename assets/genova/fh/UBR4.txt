# UBR4

## Overview
UBR4 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4, a large multidomain protein involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as an E3 ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, which is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including the cell cycle and stress responses (Kim2018Thea; BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). UBR4 is prominently expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays critical roles in neurodevelopment, such as neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Kim2018The). Additionally, UBR4 is involved in the endosome-lysosome system, influencing the trafficking and degradation of endocytosed proteins, and in secretory protein trafficking, particularly in circadian clock neurons (Kim2018Thea; Hegazi2022UBR4POE). The protein's interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and the 26S proteasome complex underscore its significance in protein quality control and cellular regulation (Hunt2019A; BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).

## Structure
The UBR4 protein, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4, is a large protein consisting of over 5,000 amino acids, making it one of the largest known single-subunit proteins (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). It contains several functional domains, including a conserved UBR box motif, microtubule-binding domains, endoplasmic reticulum-binding regions, and an atypical calmodulin-binding domain (Parsons2014p600UBR4). The E3 ligase module of UBR4 is located near the C-terminus and is characterized by a novel 'hemiRING' zinc finger and a UBR zinc-finger interacting (UZI) subdomain (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A; BarnsbyGreer2023An).

The hemiRING domain is a unique RING-related fold that interacts with E2 conjugating enzymes, specifically UBE2A and UBE2B, through a zinc finger that coordinates a single zinc ion (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A; BarnsbyGreer2023An). The UZI domain, composed of 11 α-helices, stabilizes the hemiRING structure and is crucial for its function (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). UBR4 also exhibits multiple isoforms, some of which lack the hemiRING-UZI module, suggesting potential E3-independent functions (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A). The protein's structure and interaction with E2 enzymes are essential for its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with implications for neurodevelopment and disease (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).

## Function
UBR4, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4, is a large multidomain protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It functions as an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins. This activity is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and responding to cellular stress (Kim2018Thea; BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).

UBR4 is prominently expressed in the central nervous system and plays significant roles in neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and survival. It is also involved in the maintenance of cell surface proteins and cell adhesion, which are essential for normal cellular morphology and communication (Kim2018Thea; Kim2018The).

In the context of the endosome-lysosome system, UBR4 is essential for the biogenesis and function of early endosomes, impacting the trafficking and degradation of endocytosed proteins. This role is vital for the turnover of cell surface proteins and the degradation of internalized extracellular materials (Kim2018Thea).

UBR4 also influences secretory protein trafficking, particularly in circadian clock neurons, by regulating the export of proteins from the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythm synchrony (Hegazi2022UBR4POE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBR4 gene have been implicated in a variety of diseases and conditions. UBR4 mutations are associated with early-onset dementia, developmental regression, brain atrophy, and ataxia, highlighting its role in neurodegenerative processes (Kim2018The). The gene is also linked to episodic ataxia type 8 (EA8), characterized by episodes of ataxia and other neurological symptoms, with genetic variants affecting calcium signaling and neuronal excitability (Gaudio2023Case).

In the context of cancer, UBR4's E3 ligase activity is implicated in the disease's progression, suggesting that modulating its activity could have therapeutic potential (BarnsbyGreer2023An). UBR4 is also involved in muscle protein quality control, and its dysfunction is associated with sarcopenia, a condition of muscle degeneration during aging (Hunt2021Antagonistic).

UBR4 variants have been linked to short stature, with affected individuals showing significant growth retardation (Hauer2019Evolutionary). Additionally, UBR4 mutations contribute to IgG4-related disease by altering T cell signaling and activation, potentially leading to autoimmunity and Th2 polarization (Liu2024IKZF1). These findings underscore the gene's broad clinical significance across various biological systems.

## Interactions
UBR4, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. UBR4 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2A and UBE2B, forming a complex that is essential for its E3 ligase activity. This interaction is mediated by a unique E3 module within UBR4, which includes a hemiRING zinc finger and a UBR zinc-finger interacting (UZI) subdomain. These components facilitate the recruitment and activation of UBE2A and UBE2B, which are critical for substrate specificity and degradation kinetics (BarnsbyGreer2024UBE2A).

UBR4 also associates with the 26S proteasome complex, indicating its role in regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with the E3 ligase HUWE1, which is involved in cytoplasmic protein quality control, and modulates the levels of various protein targets, contributing to processes such as myofiber hypertrophy (Hunt2019A).

In the context of neurogenesis and cell surface protein homeostasis, UBR4 binds to N-degrons of short-lived proteins, facilitating their ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for the formation of multivesicular bodies and the turnover of cell surface proteins (Kim2018The).
