# TUFM

## Overview
The TUFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor, Tu translation elongation factor, mitochondrial, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This nuclear-encoded protein is highly conserved across species, reflecting its fundamental role in cellular function. TUFM is categorized as a GTP-binding protein and is involved in the elongation phase of mitochondrial translation by forming a ternary complex with GTP and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNAs, facilitating the delivery of these tRNAs to the ribosome's A-site (Liu2024TUFM). Beyond its primary function in translation, TUFM is implicated in various cellular processes, including autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis regulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and mitochondrial quality control (Kim2021Activation; Choi2021Autophagycompetent). Alterations in TUFM expression or function are associated with several pathological conditions, including mitochondrial disorders, cancer, and metabolic diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Hershkovitz2019A; Liu2024TUFM).

## Structure
The TUFM protein, encoded by the TUFM gene, is a mitochondrial translation elongation factor involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is a nuclear-encoded protein that is evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, with significant nucleotide and amino acid homology to bacterial EF-Tu (Liu2024TUFM). The primary structure of TUFM includes three distinct domains: the N-terminal GTP-binding domain (domain I), domain II, and a C-terminal domain (domain III). Domain I contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) crucial for its localization to mitochondria (Liu2024TUFM).

The secondary structure of TUFM likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of GTP-binding proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional shape essential for its function, and TUFM can form a ternary complex with GTP and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNAs, facilitating the delivery of aa-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site (Liu2024TUFM).

TUFM may also participate in quaternary structure interactions, as it is known to dimerize, a process mediated by a GxxxG motif within its mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is necessary for its function in autophagy (Choi2021Autophagycompetent). TUFM is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at tyrosine-266, which inhibits ternary complex formation (Liu2024TUFM).

## Function
The TUFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, TUFM facilitates the elongation phase of mitochondrial translation by forming a ternary complex with GTP and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNAs. This complex delivers the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome's A-site, ensuring proper codon recognition and protein synthesis within the mitochondria (Hershkovitz2019A; Liu2024TUFM).

TUFM is also involved in regulating autophagy and mitophagy, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with the autophagy E3-like complex ATG12-ATG5 and ATG16L1, promoting the degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria and modulating immune responses (Liu2024TUFM). TUFM's role in autophagy extends to metabolic regulation, where it enhances lipid degradation and maintains mitochondrial function, contributing to energy metabolism and cellular health (Kim2021Activation).

Additionally, TUFM plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis by preventing caspase-8 activation, thereby protecting cells from programmed cell death. This function is linked to its involvement in mitochondrial quality control and mitophagy (Choi2021Autophagycompetent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TUFM gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Pathogenic variants in TUFM can lead to mitochondrial disorders such as combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 4, characterized by lactic acidosis and dilated cardiomyopathy without encephalopathy (Hershkovitz2019A). A specific mutation, p.His115Pro, has been associated with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, highlighting the gene's role in cardiac conditions (Hershkovitz2019A). 

In cancer, TUFM expression levels are critical. Reduced TUFM levels in lung cancer correlate with disease progression and promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), glycolysis, and metastasis (Liu2024TUFM). In colorectal cancer, increased TUFM expression is linked to poorer clinical outcomes and resistance to therapies (Liu2024TUFM). 

TUFM is also involved in metabolic regulation. Its upregulation is associated with improved energy balance and protection against obesity, while its role in autophagy and mitochondrial function is crucial during exercise in obesity (Kim2021Activation). In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, decreased TUFM expression is linked to increased tau phosphorylation (Liu2024TUFM). These findings underscore TUFM's multifaceted role in health and disease.

## Interactions
TUFM, or Tu translation elongation factor, mitochondrial, is involved in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids across different biological contexts. In breast cancer, TUFM interacts with CBFB, enhancing the binding of mitochondrial mRNAs to TUFM and promoting cancer progression (Liu2024TUFM). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TUFM forms a complex with NLRX1, facilitating the recruitment of Beclin-1 to mitochondria, which enhances Beclin-1's polyubiquitination and disrupts its interaction with Rubicon (Liu2024TUFM).

In the context of viral infections, TUFM interacts with the autophagy E3-like complex ATG12-ATG5 and ATG16L1, promoting mitophagy and inhibiting RIG-I-like receptor activation (Liu2024TUFM). TUFM also interacts with various viral proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 M protein, facilitating autophagy that benefits viral replication (Liu2024TUFM).

In cardiomyocytes, FUNDC1 recruits TUFM to mitochondria, maintaining mitochondrial DNA stability and preventing PANoptosis-associated cell death (Bi2022FUNDC1). TUFM interacts with mitochondrial argonaute 2 (Ago2) to facilitate the translation of electron transport chain subunits, reducing reactive oxygen species and providing protection in diabetic cardiomyopathy (Liu2024TUFM). These interactions highlight TUFM's multifaceted roles in cellular processes and disease contexts.
