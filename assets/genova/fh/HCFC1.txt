# HCFC1

## Overview
HCFC1 is a gene that encodes the host cell factor C1 protein, a transcriptional co-regulator involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and gene expression. The HCFC1 protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form two subunits, which reassociate noncovalently. It contains several functional domains, such as Kelch domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a nuclear localization signal essential for its nuclear activities (Vinckevicius2015Genomic; Michaud2013HCFC1). HCFC1 interacts with multiple transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, playing a critical role in regulating transcription at CpG-island promoters and influencing a significant portion of human promoters (Michaud2013HCFC1). Mutations in the HCFC1 gene are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and X-linked cobalamin type C-like disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Jolly2015HCFC1; Yu2013An).

## Structure
The HCFC1 gene encodes a protein that is synthesized as a 2,035-amino-acid precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in two subunits that reassociate noncovalently (Vinckevicius2015Genomic; Michaud2013HCFC1). The protein contains several specific domains, including five Kelch domains, fibronectin type III domains, and HCF proteolytic domains (Wongkittichote2021Novel). The Kelch domain, which includes repetitive antiparallel beta sheets, forms a six-Kelch-repeat β-propeller structure crucial for protein-protein interactions (Michaud2013HCFC1; Yu2013An). This domain recognizes a 4-amino-acid HCFC1 binding motif (HBM) found in various transcription factors and cofactors (Vinckevicius2015Genomic).

HCFC1 is involved in transcriptional regulation and interacts with various transcription factors, such as THAP11, E2Fs, and ZNF143, through its Kelch and other domains (Vinckevicius2015Genomic; Yu2013An). The protein also features a nuclear localization signal, which is essential for its function within the nucleus (Jolly2015HCFC1). Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, influence HCFC1's function and interactions (Michaud2013HCFC1). These structural features enable HCFC1 to act as a transcriptional co-regulator, playing a critical role in various cellular processes.

## Function
HCFC1, also known as Host Cell Factor C1, is a transcriptional co-regulator that plays a significant role in cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and gene expression in healthy human cells. It does not directly bind to DNA but associates with chromatin through its Kelch-repeat domain, interacting with various DNA-binding transcription factors such as ZNF143, THAP11, GABP, and YY1 (Michaud2013HCFC1). HCFC1 is involved in the regulation of transcription at CpG-island promoters, where it colocalizes with these transcription factors, influencing a substantial portion of human promoters (Michaud2013HCFC1).

HCFC1 is crucial for cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from the G1 to the S phase, by recruiting MLL family H3K4 histone methyltransferase complexes to E2F-responsive promoters, facilitating H3K4 trimethylation and transcriptional activation (Tyagi2007E2F). It is also involved in cell-cycle-specific regulation of gene transcription, with a significant number of genes showing differential expression in the S phase when HCFC1 is depleted (Michaud2013HCFC1).

In addition to its role in cell cycle progression, HCFC1 is essential for proper cytokinesis, with its C-terminal subunit ensuring proper exit from mitosis (Julien2003Proteolytic). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences processes like DNA replication and repair, contributing to its broad regulatory role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Julien2003Proteolytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HCFC1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly intellectual disability (ID). Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in HCFC1 have been linked to these conditions, with loss-of-function mutations leading to increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells and promoting axonal growth, contrasting with the effects of HCFC1 over-expression (Jolly2015HCFC1). HCFC1 mutations are also implicated in X-linked cobalamin type C (CblC)-like disorder, known as CblX, characterized by severe neurological impairments such as intractable epilepsy and brain malformations (Jolly2015HCFC1; Yu2013An).

The HCFC1 gene plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of MMACHC, a gene involved in cobalamin metabolism. Mutations in HCFC1 can lead to a reduction in MMACHC expression, resulting in combined methylmalonic acidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, conditions associated with cobalamin metabolism disorders (Yu2013An; Chern2022Mutations). Additionally, mutations in HCFC1, along with the transcription factor RONIN, result in ribosomopathy and are linked to developmental defects such as intrauterine growth restriction and neurogenesis issues (Chern2022Mutations).

Some HCFC1 mutations cause intellectual disability without metabolic abnormalities, suggesting a specific impact on neurological development rather than metabolic processes (Wongkittichote2021Novel). The gene is also associated with X-linked mental retardation syndrome, with mutations leading to cognitive impairments, developmental delays, and behavioral abnormalities (Hussain2024Variants).

## Interactions
HCFC1, also known as host cell factor C1, is a transcriptional co-regulator that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to influence gene expression and cell cycle regulation. It does not directly bind to DNA but associates with chromatin through its Kelch-repeat domain, forming a β-propeller structure that binds to the HCFC1-binding motif (HBM) (Michaud2013HCFC1). HCFC1 interacts with several DNA-binding transcription factors, including ZNF143, THAP11 (Ronin), GABP, and YY1, and is found at approximately 90% of the active CpG-island promoters in HeLa cells (Michaud2013HCFC1).

HCFC1 is also associated with various chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone methyltransferases (SETD1A, MLL), histone demethylases (KDM1A, PHF8), histone acetyltransferase (KAT8), and histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIN3A (Michaud2013HCFC1). It forms a multiprotein-DNA complex with the viral transactivator VP16 and the nuclear factor Oct-1 during herpes simplex virus infection, with its amino-terminal region being crucial for this interaction (Wilson2000HCF1). The interaction with VP16 is facilitated by the β-propeller structure formed by the Kelch repeats in the amino-terminal domain of HCFC1 (Wilson1997VP16).
