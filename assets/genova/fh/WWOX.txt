# WWOX

## Overview
The WWOX gene encodes the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor suppression. This protein is characterized by its two N-terminal WW domains and a central short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and steroid metabolism, respectively (Del2009WWOX:; Nunez2006WWOX). The WWOX protein is implicated in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, neurodifferentiation, and mitochondrial function, and is highly expressed in hormonally regulated tissues, suggesting a role in sex-steroid metabolism (Baryła2022WWOX; Kośla2020The; Nunez2006WWOX). Clinically, mutations in the WWOX gene are associated with severe neurological disorders such as WOREE syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCAR12), as well as neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Banne2021Neurological; Piard2019The; Steinberg2021WWOX-Related).

## Structure
The WWOX protein is a 414 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 46 kDa. It features two N-terminal WW domains and a central short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain (Del2009WWOX:; Nunez2006WWOX). The WW domains are small protein modules of 38-40 amino acids, characterized by two conserved tryptophan residues, and are involved in protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs, specifically the PPXY motif (Salah2010WWOX; Del2009WWOX:). The first WW domain is crucial for interactions with proteins such as p73 and ErbB4, often sequestering them in the cytoplasm and affecting their transactivation abilities (Del2009WWOX:).

The SDR domain of WWOX is homologous to enzymes involved in steroid metabolism, such as 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3, and includes conserved motifs typical of substrate and coenzyme binding sites (Salah2010WWOX; LudesMeyers2003WWOX). The protein's structure suggests a role in sex-steroid metabolism, supported by its expression in hormonally regulated tissues (LudesMeyers2003WWOX). Alternative splicing of the WWOX gene generates multiple transcript variants, though the protein isoforms are not well documented (Del2009WWOX:).

## Function
The WWOX gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation, and differentiation. It is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism, influencing plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and acting as a tumor suppressor (Baryła2022WWOX). WWOX interacts with transcription factors such as HIF1α, modulating its activity and influencing the glycolytic pathway, which is essential for maintaining normal metabolic processes in healthy cells (Baryła2022WWOX). 

In the central nervous system, WWOX is highly expressed in neural-origin cells and is involved in neurodifferentiation, neuron migration, and neurotransmitter management. It influences cytoskeleton organization and cellular signaling, which are essential for proper neurodifferentiation and neuron migration (Kośla2020The). WWOX also affects mitochondrial function, with reduced expression leading to decreased mitochondrial respiration and cellular dysfunction (Baryła2022WWOX). 

WWOX is active in hormonally regulated organs, such as the prostate and ovaries, suggesting its involvement in steroid metabolism. It is highly expressed in secretory epithelial cells of reproductive, endocrine, and exocrine organs, indicating a role in sex-steroid metabolism (Nunez2006WWOX).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WWOX gene are linked to several severe neurological disorders. WWOX-related epileptic encephalopathy, also known as WOREE syndrome, is characterized by early-onset drug-resistant epilepsy, profound developmental delay, and structural brain abnormalities, often leading to premature death (Aldaz2020WWOX; Piard2019The). This condition results from complete loss of WWOX function, with symptoms including spastic quadriplegia and optic atrophy (Kośla2020The; Piard2019The).

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCAR12) is another disorder associated with WWOX mutations, specifically homozygous missense mutations like p.P47T and p.G372R. It presents with cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, and intellectual disability, but is less severe than WOREE syndrome (Aldaz2020WWOX; Steinberg2021WWOX-Related).

WWOX mutations are also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where they contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation, key features of the disease (Banne2021Neurological; Aldaz2020WWOX). Additionally, WWOX is associated with autism spectrum disorder and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its broad impact on neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions (Aldaz2020WWOX; Banne2021Neurological).

## Interactions
The WWOX protein, encoded by the WWOX gene, is involved in numerous protein interactions that contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor. WWOX interacts with the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), where JNK1 inhibits WWOX-mediated apoptosis by phosphorylating WWOX at Tyr 33, a modification essential for their interaction (Chang2003JNK1). WWOX also binds to the AP-2γ transcription factor, suppressing its transactivation function by interacting with a PPPY motif in AP-2γ, which leads to the redistribution of AP-2γ to the cytosol (Aqeilan2004Physical).

WWOX interacts with the RHBDD2 protein, particularly in proliferative breast cancer cells, through a conserved LPPY motif in RHBDD2 that binds to the WW domains of WWOX. This interaction is implicated in modulating the TGFβ/SMAD3 signaling pathway (Ferretti2021RHBDD2‑WWOX). Additionally, WWOX interacts with the transcription factor Runx2, inhibiting its activity and affecting osteoblast differentiation (Salah2010WWOX). The protein also binds to ezrin, with the interaction dependent on the phosphorylation state of ezrin, which may influence cytoskeletal remodeling (Jin2006PKAmediated). These interactions highlight WWOX's multifaceted role in cellular processes and tumor suppression.
