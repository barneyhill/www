# HOMEZ

## Overview
The HOMEZ gene encodes a vertebrate-specific protein known as homeobox and leucine zipper encoding, which is characterized by its complex structural organization, including three homeodomains and two leucine zipper-like motifs. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional regulator due to its potential to bind DNA and participate in protein-protein interactions, facilitated by its structural motifs. The HOMEZ protein is involved in regulatory functions, particularly through interactions with the Hoxc8 regulatory region, indicating its role in sequence-specific DNA binding. Mutations in the HOMEZ gene have been associated with congenital heart defects, such as isolated ventricular septal defect, highlighting its clinical significance. The gene is expressed across various human tissues, although its precise biological functions and implications in disease are still under investigation (Xuan2013Identification; Bayarsaihan2003Homez).

## Structure
The HOMEZ protein is a vertebrate-specific homeobox leucine zipper protein with a complex structural organization. It is composed of 549 amino acids in humans, with a molecular weight of 61,111 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.89 (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). The primary structure includes three homeodomains (HDs) and two leucine zipper-like motifs, which are indicative of its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). The secondary structure predictions suggest the presence of α-helices with a helix-turn-helix motif, typical of homeodomains (Bayarsaihan2003Homez).

The HD2 region contains a basic region with a putative nuclear localization signal (RKTKRK), while the HD3 region is rich in proline residues, which may affect its structure and DNA-binding ability (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). The protein also features an acidic domain at the C-terminus, which is absent in fish homologs (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). Alternative splicing of HOMEZ mRNA results in a human-specific variant encoding a 418 amino acid protein (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOMEZ gene have been implicated in isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD), a common congenital heart defect. Two novel heterozygous missense mutations, c.116C > T and c.630T > A, were identified in Chinese patients with isolated VSD. These mutations result in amino acid substitutions in the HOMEZ protein: alanine to valine at position 39 (p.A39V) and serine to arginine at position 210 (p.S210R). These positions are highly conserved across species, suggesting their importance in protein function. Predictive tools indicate that these mutations could alter the protein's structure and function, potentially damaging it. The mutations were not found in 400 healthy control subjects, suggesting a specific association with VSD (Xuan2013Identification).

The HOMEZ gene, a vertebrate-specific homeobox gene, encodes a protein with a unique structural organization, including homeodomains and leucine zipper-like motifs. While the gene is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, its specific role in disease is still being explored. Previous studies have suggested a connection between congenital heart defects and polymorphisms in the HOMEZ gene in different populations (Xuan2013Identification; Bayarsaihan2003Homez).

## Interactions
The HOMEZ protein, encoded by the human HOMEZ gene, is involved in interactions with both nucleic acids and other proteins, suggesting its role as a transcriptional regulator. The protein contains three homeodomains and two leucine zipper-like motifs, which are indicative of its potential to bind DNA and participate in protein-protein interactions (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). Yeast one-hybrid and gel-shift experiments have demonstrated that HOMEZ interacts significantly with the Hoxc8 regulatory region, indicating sequence-specific DNA-binding activity (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). The HD2 region of HOMEZ is likely responsible for these DNA interactions due to its preserved features of a canonical homeodomain, while the HD3 region, which lacks a basic region, may not contact DNA but could be involved in protein-protein interactions (Bayarsaihan2003Homez).

The presence of leucine zippers, proline- and serine-rich motifs, and an acidic domain in the HOMEZ protein further supports its role in transcriptional regulation, potentially through forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in regulatory interactions (Bayarsaihan2003Homez). However, specific details on the physical interactions of the HOMEZ protein with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the available literature.
