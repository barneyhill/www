# GPRC5C

## Overview
GPRC5C is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member C, a receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs, and is involved in various physiological processes. GPRC5C plays a crucial role in maintaining the dormancy and stemness of hematopoietic stem cells and is also implicated in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in pancreatic β-cells. The receptor's interaction with hyaluronic acid is essential for preserving the quiescent state of stem cells, while its modulation of signaling pathways in β-cells is vital for maintaining cell function and viability. Additionally, GPRC5C has been associated with clinical implications in prostate cancer and olfactory disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Wei2022Association; Amisten2017Antidiabetic; Bhat2023GPRC5C; Zhang2022Hyaluronic).

## Structure
The GPRC5C protein is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, specifically classified under class C. It is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The protein consists of an extracellular domain (ECD), a 7TM domain, and an intracellular domain. Unlike other class C GPCRs, GPRC5C lacks the Venus flytrap (VFT) domain in its ECD, which is usually the orthosteric binding site. Instead, the ECD of GPRC5C is composed of three α-helices and two β-helices, suggesting a topology more similar to class A GPCRs (Zhang2022Hyaluronic).

The primary structure of GPRC5C includes a signal peptide, and the transmembrane regions are well conserved, particularly the second, third, and seventh helices. The intracellular loops, which likely interact with cytosolic proteins, are also highly conserved (Kurtenbach2011Molecular). A conserved motif, WDD, is located at the junction of EL3 and TM7, and a highly conserved motif (M/V)ENKAFSMDE is found at the C-terminus (Kurtenbach2011Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation are critical for GPRC5C function, with specific sequons identified at N203-S204-S205 and N53-K54-C. Mutations in these sites affect hyaluronic acid binding and the protein's activation response (Zhang2022Hyaluronic). The GPRC5C protein does not have consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation or residues for palmitoylation, suggesting these modifications are uncommon (Kurtenbach2011Molecular).

## Function
GPRC5C is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in maintaining the dormancy and stemness of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in humans. It is involved in a signaling axis with hyaluronic acid (HA), which is crucial for preserving the quiescent state of HSCs. This dormancy is essential for minimizing cellular stress and maintaining the long-term functionality of these stem cells (Zhang2022Hyaluronic). GPRC5C-positive HSCs are characterized by their high quiescence and significant in vivo reconstitution capacities, indicating their potential for long-term hematopoietic reconstitution (Zhang2022Hyaluronic).

In the context of pancreatic β-cells, GPRC5C is highly expressed and plays a critical role in insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. It is involved in modulating signaling pathways related to cell cycle, metabolism, and inflammation. The receptor's expression is correlated with genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting its importance in maintaining β-cell function and viability (Amisten2017Antidiabetic). GPRC5C also mediates the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which enhances β-cell function and may delay the onset of type-2 diabetes (Amisten2017Antidiabetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GPRC5C gene have been associated with various clinical implications. In the context of prostate cancer, the GPRC5C p.R14Q variant has been identified as significantly associated with increased risk in African American populations. This variant is located in the 14th amino acid of the longer isoform of GPRC5C, though its specific functional impact remains unclear. The study suggests that further research is needed to determine whether this mutation affects the processing of GPRC5C as a transmembrane protein or its binding to potential ligands (Wei2022Association).

In the olfactory system, the absence of GPRC5C leads to significant changes in ciliary structure and function. Gprc5c knockout mice exhibit altered localization of ciliary proteins and increased neuronal activity, which affects odor perception. These changes suggest that disruptions in GPRC5C function could potentially contribute to olfactory disorders such as anosmia (Bhat2023GPRC5C). Additionally, the absence of GPRC5C affects phosphoinositide distribution in cilia, which could have broader implications for ciliary function and related disorders (Bhat2023GPRC5C). However, the direct clinical significance of these findings in humans remains to be fully elucidated.
