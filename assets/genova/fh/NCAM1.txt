# NCAM1

## Overview
NCAM1, or neural cell adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein product, NCAM1, plays a pivotal role in neural development and function by mediating cell-cell adhesion, which is crucial for processes such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and stabilization. NCAM1 exists in multiple isoforms, including NCAM-120, NCAM-140, and NCAM-180, which differ in their membrane anchoring and intracellular domain lengths, allowing for diverse functional roles in the nervous system (Sytnyk2017Neural; Hansen2008Signaling). The protein is heavily involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and its interactions with other proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor receptors and spectrin, link extracellular adhesion cues to intracellular signaling pathways (Sytnyk2017Neural; Hansen2008Signaling). Additionally, NCAM1 is a major carrier of polysialic acid, which modulates its adhesive properties and interactions, promoting neural plasticity (Hansen2008Signaling). Alterations in NCAM1 expression or function have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Sasca2019NCAM1; Brennaman2009NCAM).

## Structure
The neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) is a glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is characterized by five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and two fibronectin type III repeats (Frei1992Different; Kiselyov1997The). The Ig-like domains are homologous to those found in other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, with pairs of cysteines likely forming intrachain disulfide loops (Cunningham1987Neural). The third Ig-like domain contains a crucial decapeptide sequence, KYSFNYDGSE, which is involved in NCAM-NCAM binding through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Rao1993Structural).

NCAM1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including the 180 kDa, 140 kDa, and 120 kDa variants. The 120 kDa isoform is anchored via glycosylphosphatidylinositol, while the 140 kDa and 180 kDa forms are transmembrane proteins (Frei1992Different; Kiselyov1997The). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and polysialylation are significant for NCAM1's function, influencing its adhesive properties and interactions (Hall1987Visualization; Cunningham1987Neural). The presence of polysialic acid, in particular, modulates NCAM1's aggregation and cell adhesion capabilities (Hall1987Visualization). These structural features enable NCAM1 to mediate cell-cell interactions crucial for neural development and function.

## Function
NCAM1, or neural cell adhesion molecule 1, is a critical protein involved in various molecular processes essential for neural development and function. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and exists in three major isoforms: NCAM-120, NCAM-140, and NCAM-180, which differ in their membrane anchoring and intracellular domain lengths (Sytnyk2017Neural; Hansen2008Signaling). NCAM1 plays a significant role in neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and stabilization by mediating homophilic and heterophilic interactions, particularly with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) (Hinsby2004Molecular; Hansen2008Signaling).

In healthy human cells, NCAM1 is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by modulating cell signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as spectrin and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), linking extracellular adhesion cues to cytoskeletal changes during neurite outgrowth (Hansen2008Signaling). NCAM1 also influences synaptic vesicle recycling and interacts with neurotrophic factor receptors like TrkB, which are important for synaptic signaling and plasticity (Sytnyk2017Neural).

NCAM1 is active in the cell membrane and is a major carrier of polysialic acid (PSA), which modulates its adhesive properties and interactions with other molecules, promoting plasticity by reducing homophilic binding and favoring interactions with heterophilic partners (Sytnyk2017Neural; Hansen2008Signaling).

## Clinical Significance
NCAM1 (neural cell adhesion molecule 1) is implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in NCAM1 expression or function are associated with schizophrenia, where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NCAM1 are linked to cognitive impairment and altered neuronal connectivity (Brennaman2009NCAM). In bipolar disorder, NCAM1 is identified as a target gene of miR-27a, with SNP rs895819 in miR-27a linked to the disorder. Alterations in NCAM1 expression may contribute to the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (Yang2022A). NCAM1 is also associated with mood disorders, where changes in its expression affect synaptic plasticity and connectivity, contributing to conditions like depression and anxiety (Brennaman2009NCAM).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), NCAM1 expression is linked to leukemogenesis and drug resistance. High NCAM1 expression is associated with a drug resistance phenotype, and its knockdown sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapy (Sasca2019NCAM1). NCAM1 is highly expressed in leukemic stem cells, contributing to AML initiation and maintenance (Sasca2019NCAM1). The gene's expression is prevalent in various AML subtypes and is associated with poor survival outcomes (Sasca2019NCAM1).

## Interactions
NCAM1 (neural cell adhesion molecule 1) participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in neural development and synaptic function. NCAM1 interacts with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) through its fibronectin type III modules, promoting axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. This interaction is regulated by ATP, which can inhibit the NCAM-FGFR binding (Kiselyov2003Structural). 

NCAM1 also forms complexes with spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, particularly in lipid rafts. This interaction is essential for the assembly of signaling complexes involved in intracellular signaling pathways. NCAM-180, one of the major isoforms, has a high affinity for spectrin, linking it to protein kinase C (PKC) b2, while NCAM-140 forms a complex with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPa) (Ditlevsen2007NCAM‐induced).

In the postsynaptic density, NCAM1 interacts with spectrin to recruit NMDA receptors and CaMKIIα, which are critical for synaptic strength and plasticity. Disruption of the NCAM-spectrin complex affects the accumulation of these proteins, impacting synaptic efficacy and long-term potentiation (Sytnyk2006NCAM). NCAM1 also interacts with the spike protein of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus, playing a role in viral attachment and invasion (Gao2010Identification).
