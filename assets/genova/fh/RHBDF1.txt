# RHBDF1

## Overview
RHBDF1 is a gene that encodes the protein rhomboid 5 homolog 1, also known as p100 hRho, which is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. Unlike typical rhomboid proteins, rhomboid 5 homolog 1 lacks serine protease activity due to a critical amino acid substitution. The protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the maturation and trafficking of EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, and transforming growth factor alpha. RHBDF1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and invasion, and has been associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiac fibrosis. Its function is further modulated through interactions with other proteins, including ADAM17, a metalloprotease involved in ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands (Nakagawa2005Characterization; Hosur2020Genes; Burzenski2021Inactive).

## Structure
The RHBDF1 protein, also known as p100 hRho, is an atypically long polypeptide consisting of 855 amino acids. It features seven predicted transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM7), with a significant hydrophilic sequence of 410 amino acids preceding TM1. This sequence includes a predicted PEST sequence, which may be involved in rapid proteolytic degradation (Nakagawa2005Characterization). The protein's structure is characterized by a long N-terminal cytoplasmic extension, which comprises about half of the polypeptide sequence (Nakagawa2005Characterization). 

RHBDF1 lacks the serine protease activity typical of other rhomboid proteins due to the replacement of a critical serine residue with alanine (Nakagawa2005Characterization). The protein is expressed in two isoforms: a full-size p100 hRho and a smaller p52 hRho, the latter likely resulting from proteolytic cleavage (Nakagawa2005Characterization). 

The protein forms dimers or oligomers, with dimerization not requiring the N-terminal half preceding TM1 (Nakagawa2005Characterization). RHBDF1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, but not on the cell surface (Nakagawa2005Characterization). It contains three potential N-glycosylation sites, with Asn583 being glycosylated and located on the luminal side (Nakagawa2005Characterization).

## Function
RHBDF1, also known as rhomboid 5 homolog 1, is involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in the secretion and maturation of multiple EGFR ligands, including amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα) (Burzenski2021Inactive). RHBDF1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences the trafficking and maturation of these growth factors (Nakagawa2005Characterization).

The protein interacts with immature and unglycosylated forms of transmembrane TGF-α and HB-EGF, suggesting that it modulates the activity of TGF-α family ligands through interactions with their transmembrane domains (Nakagawa2005Characterization). RHBDF1 is also implicated in the regulation of ADAM17, a metalloprotease involved in the ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, by facilitating the delivery of pro-TGFα to the plasma membrane for processing (Burzenski2021Inactive).

In human cancer cell lines, silencing RHBDF1 inhibits TGFα-mediated EGFR signaling, reducing cell proliferation and invasion, which highlights its role in cell biology and potential impact on tumor growth (Burzenski2021Inactive). The protein's function in healthy human cells is linked to its role in EGFR signaling, which is essential for normal growth and development (Burzenski2021Inactive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RHBDF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. RHBDF1 is involved in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Disruptions in this pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor progression. In vitro studies have shown that RHBDF1 deficiency suppresses the secretion of EGFR ligands such as AREG, HB-EGF, and TGFα, which can inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting potential anti-cancer effects (Burzenski2021Inactive).

The gene's role in EGFR signaling also links it to cardiac fibrosis, as observed in Rhbdf1-null mice, which exhibit heart enlargement similar to Hbegf-null mice (Burzenski2021Inactive). Additionally, RHBDF1 mutations can lead to severe multiorgan pathologies, including brain hemorrhage and cardiac hypertrophy, as seen in Rhbdf1 homozygous-null mice (Hosur2020Genes). These findings highlight the gene's critical role in normal physiological processes and its potential impact on disease when altered. The ability of RHBDF1 to adapt through exon skipping and alternative splicing may also influence the severity of these conditions, as certain mutations can result in truncated proteins that partially compensate for the loss of full-length RHBDF1 (Hosur2020Genes).

## Interactions
RHBDF1, also known as p100 hRho, interacts with several proteins, particularly those in the TGF-α family. It primarily associates with unglycosylated and immaturely glycosylated forms of transmembrane TGF-α and a single form of HB-EGF. This interaction is consistent with its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis Golgi (Nakagawa2005Characterization). RHBDF1 also interacts with the ectodomain of transmembrane TGF-α family proteins, specifically requiring the EGF-like core ectodomain for this association (Nakagawa2005Characterization).

In Drosophila models, the short form of RHBDF1 induces a strong wing phenotype, suggesting that the N-terminal cytoplasmic extension of the full-length protein inhibits its activity. This form of RHBDF1 interacts with transmembrane growth factors like HB-EGF and Spitz, potentially interfering with Notch signaling (Nakagawa2005Characterization). The protein can form dimers or oligomers, which may be relevant for its function (Nakagawa2005Characterization).

RHBDF1 is also involved in the regulation of ADAM17, a metalloprotease responsible for the ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands. It facilitates the delivery of pro-TGFα to the plasma membrane for ectodomain shedding by ADAM17, influencing EGFR signaling (Burzenski2021Inactive).
