# GLRX3

## Overview
GLRX3 is a gene that encodes the protein glutaredoxin 3, a member of the glutaredoxin family, which is involved in cellular redox regulation and iron metabolism. The protein is characterized by its thioredoxin domain and two monothiol glutaredoxin domains, which facilitate its role in iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly and trafficking (Xia2015Human; Haunhorst2010Characterization). Glutaredoxin 3 functions as a cytosolic [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperone, essential for the maturation of cytosolic and mitochondrial Fe/S proteins, and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis (Berndt2021Glutaredoxins; Camponeschi2020GLRX3). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as BOLA2 and GMP synthase, underscore its importance in various cellular processes, including the integrated stress response and iron metabolism (Li2012Human; Mechoud2020Interactions). Alterations in GLRX3 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Cha2009Preferential; Jo2021GLRX3).

## Structure
The human GLRX3 protein, also known as glutaredoxin 3, is composed of 335 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 37.4 kDa (Dai2016Generation). It features an N-terminal thioredoxin (Trx) domain and two C-terminal monothiol glutaredoxin (Grx) domains, each with a conserved Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser (CGFS) active site (Xia2015Human; Haunhorst2010Characterization). The Trx domain lacks a redox-active motif and is not involved in iron-sulfur cluster binding, but it may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Li2012Human; Haunhorst2010Characterization).

GLRX3 forms a homodimeric complex, binding two bridging [2Fe-2S] clusters with glutathione (GSH) as a ligand (Xia2015Human). The Grx domains are capable of binding these clusters, and the protein can also incorporate a [4Fe-4S] cluster in the absence of GSH (Xia2015Human). The quaternary structure involves a head-to-head configuration of the Grx domains, complexing the Fe/S clusters with non-covalently bound GSH (Haunhorst2010Characterization).

GLRX3 is involved in various cellular processes, including iron metabolism and redox signaling, and it interacts with proteins such as protein kinase C isoforms and muscle LIM protein (Haunhorst2010Characterization). The protein's multidomain structure allows for specific interactions, potentially influencing its regulatory functions (Haunhorst2010Characterization).

## Function
GLRX3, or glutaredoxin 3, is a crucial protein in human cells involved in iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster assembly and iron homeostasis. It plays a significant role in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins, such as iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), by facilitating the incorporation of [4Fe-4S] clusters, which are essential for their function (Xia2015Human; Berndt2021Glutaredoxins). GLRX3 forms stable complexes with BOLA2, which are necessary for the incorporation of [2Fe-2S] clusters into client apo-proteins like CIAPIN1, acting as a cytosolic [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperone (Berndt2021Glutaredoxins).

In addition to its role in Fe/S cluster assembly, GLRX3 is involved in the maturation of non-Fe/S, iron-containing proteins, such as ribonucleotide reductase, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair (Berndt2021Glutaredoxins). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis and supports iron metabolism (Haunhorst2010Characterization). GLRX3's function is essential for proper cellular iron regulation, and its deficiency can lead to impaired Fe/S protein and heme biosynthesis, affecting iron homeostasis and potentially leading to conditions like cardiac hypertrophy (Haunhorst2013Crucial).

## Clinical Significance
GLRX3 (glutaredoxin 3) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is significantly overexpressed in human colon and lung carcinomas, with a 55.3-fold increase in lung cancer and a 50.2-fold increase in colon cancer compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with tumorigenesis, as GLRX3 inhibits apoptosis through cell activation-associated signaling pathways, potentially contributing to cancer development (Cha2009Preferential).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), GLRX3 is identified as a cancer stem cell-related biomarker. Its knockdown in pancreatic cancer cell lines affects cancer stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the Wnt signaling pathway, indicating its role in tumor initiation and progression. High GLRX3 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in PDAC patients (Jo2021GLRX3).

GLRX3 is also overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis via the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway. Its knockdown reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2016Glutaredoxin).

In Ewing sarcoma, GLRX3 influences oxidative stress regulation and iron homeostasis, potentially serving as a predictive biomarker for targeted therapy (Vinca2024Glutaredoxin).

## Interactions
GLRX3, or glutaredoxin 3, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in cellular processes. It forms a homodimeric complex with two bridging [2Fe-2S] clusters, which are crucial for its role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and trafficking (Haunhorst2010Characterization). GLRX3 interacts with human GMP synthase, a relationship that is important for regulating the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway under nutritional stress conditions (Mechoud2020Interactions).

GLRX3 also forms [2Fe-2S]-bridged complexes with human BolA2, similar to yeast homologues, which are involved in iron metabolism and cellular iron status signaling (Li2012Human). This interaction stabilizes the [2Fe-2S] clusters against oxidative degradation (Li2012Human).

In the cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery, GLRX3 acts as a [2Fe-2S] cluster chaperone, transferring these clusters to NUBP1, which is essential for the maturation of cytosolic [4Fe-4S] proteins (Camponeschi2020GLRX3). These interactions highlight GLRX3's role in maintaining iron homeostasis and facilitating the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins.
