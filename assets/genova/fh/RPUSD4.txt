# RPUSD4

## Overview
RPUSD4 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA pseudouridine synthase D4, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This protein is classified as a pseudouridine synthase, which catalyzes the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in RNA molecules, a modification essential for RNA stability and function. RNA pseudouridine synthase D4 plays a critical role in the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly affecting the large ribosomal subunit and the 55S monosome, which are vital for mitochondrial protein synthesis and cellular energy production (Auburger2022The; Hilander2021The). The gene's function extends beyond mitochondrial roles, as it also influences pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus, thereby impacting gene expression regulation (Martinez2020Pseudouridine). Given its involvement in fundamental cellular processes, RPUSD4 is of significant interest in understanding various disease mechanisms, including metabolic disorders and reproductive health issues (Zhang2022Whole; Kafita2024Unveiling).

## Function
RPUSD4 (RNA pseudouridine synthase D4) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the modification of RNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of various RNA species, including rRNA, which impacts protein synthesis and cellular function. RPUSD4 is part of a pseudouridine synthase module that plays a significant role in mitoribosome assembly. It interacts with proteins such as TRUB2 and RPUSD3, and its activity is essential for the proper assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and the 55S monosome levels (Hilander2021The).

RPUSD4 is specifically implicated in the pseudouridylation of 16S rRNA at position Ψ1397, a modification critical for mitoribosome assembly. The knockdown of RPUSD4 leads to a reduction in mtLSU protein uL11m levels, indicating its role in maintaining proper mitoribosome function (Hilander2021The). Additionally, RPUSD4 is classified as a modulator of mitoribosomal translation, potentially impacting the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis, particularly for components of the respiratory chain such as the cytochrome-c oxidase complex IV (Auburger2022The). This suggests a broader role for RPUSD4 in mitochondrial function and RNA processing, influencing cellular energy production and overall metabolic activity.

## Clinical Significance
RPUSD4 has been implicated in several disease processes due to its role in RNA pseudouridylation and gene expression regulation. Alterations in RPUSD4 expression have been associated with diabetes, as a genetic variant, rs686646, decreases its expression in the pancreas, correlating with the disease (Kafita2024Unveiling). The gene is also involved in alternative splicing regulation, and its knockdown leads to significant changes in splicing events, which may contribute to various conditions such as mitochondrial myopathy, digestive disorders, intellectual disability, resistance to viral infection, X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, and cancer (Martinez2020Pseudouridine).

RPUSD4 has been identified as a candidate gene in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), suggesting its potential role in reproductive health (Zhang2022Whole). Although specific diseases directly linked to RPUSD4 mutations are not well-documented, its involvement in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and RNA processing suggests that dysregulation could impact cellular functions and contribute to disease mechanisms (Reyes2020RCC1L). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of RPUSD4 and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RPUSD4 is a component of a functional module involved in mitochondrial 16S rRNA regulation and mitoribosome assembly. It interacts with proteins such as TRUB2, RPUSD3, and FASTKD2, forming a pseudouridine synthase module crucial for maintaining proper levels of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and the 55S monosome (Hilander2021The). RPUSD4 co-sediments with the mtLSU in sucrose gradients, indicating its involvement in mitoribosome assembly (Hilander2021The).

RPUSD4 also interacts with RCC1L V1, a protein that may regulate the steady-state levels of pseudouridylation module proteins, including RPUSD4 itself. This interaction is significant for 16S rRNA pseudouridylation, which affects mitochondrial translation (Reyes2020RCC1L). RCC1L V1 is enriched in pulldowns with RPUSD4, suggesting a strong interaction between these proteins (Reyes2020RCC1L).

In addition to its mitochondrial roles, RPUSD4 is involved in modifying human pre-mRNA co-transcriptionally, affecting splicing. It pseudouridylates specific pre-mRNA sequences in both exons and introns, influencing alternative splicing by altering pre-mRNA-snRNA interactions, modulating pre-mRNA-protein interactions, or influencing pre-mRNA secondary structure (Martinez2020Pseudouridine).
