# OR10C1

## Overview
The OR10C1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily C member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. As a GPCR, the OR10C1 protein features a characteristic seven-transmembrane domain structure, which enables it to traverse the cell membrane and participate in signal transduction processes. Upon binding specific odorants, the receptor undergoes conformational changes that activate intracellular G proteins, ultimately leading to a neuronal response. The OR10C1 protein is subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are vital for its stability, localization, and functional regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
The OR10C1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. This structural feature allows the receptor to span the cell membrane seven times, forming a pathway for signal transduction upon binding specific odorant molecules. The seven-transmembrane domain is crucial for the receptor's ability to detect and respond to chemical signals in the environment.

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in the function and localization of the OR10C1 protein. Common modifications include glycosylation and phosphorylation. Glycosylation can affect the protein's stability and its interaction with other molecules, while phosphorylation is often involved in regulating the receptor's activity and signal transduction pathways. These modifications are essential for the proper functioning of the olfactory receptor, influencing its ability to bind odorants and initiate a cellular response.

The OR10C1 protein does not have reported splice variant isoforms, indicating a relatively conserved structure across different individuals. The specific domains and prominent folds of the OR10C1 protein are typical of olfactory receptors, facilitating its role in odor detection and signal transduction.
