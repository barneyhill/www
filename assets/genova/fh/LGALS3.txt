# LGALS3

## Overview
LGALS3 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-3, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-3 is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and immune response modulation. As a multifunctional protein, galectin-3 plays a significant role in the immune system, particularly in T cell signaling and activation, and is crucial for phagocytosis in macrophages. It also contributes to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system. The protein's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing and cancer progression. Clinically, alterations in LGALS3 expression are associated with several diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, various cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and pathological states (Di2020Galectin3; Rabinovich2009Turning; Pasquini2011Galectin3).

## Structure
The LGALS3 gene encodes the galectin-3 protein, which is a member of the galectin family characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The primary structure of galectin-3 includes a CRD and an N-terminal region with collagen-like tandem repeats and a 12-mer peptide sequence (Kaur2017Identification). The CRD is responsible for binding β-galactose in glycoconjugates and consists of approximately 135 amino acids (Tan2021Galectin-3:). The N-terminal domain (NTD) contains about 120 amino acids, featuring a tandem repeat of 7-14 amino acid residues rich in proline, tyrosine, and glycine, which is crucial for the protein's full biological activity (Tan2021Galectin-3:).

The secondary structure of galectin-3 includes beta-sheets forming a jelly-roll fold, typical of the galectin family. The tertiary structure involves a single CRD, while the quaternary structure can form dimers or oligomers (Di2020Galectin3). Post-translational modifications of galectin-3 include phosphorylation, which affects its nuclear translocation and ligand affinity (Tan2021Galectin-3:). The protein is also subject to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases, particularly MMP12, which can influence its function in macrophages (Di2020Galectin3). Splice variants of LGALS3 may exist, potentially affecting the protein's function and localization (Di2020Galectin3).

## Function
Galectin-3, encoded by the LGALS3 gene, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, apoptosis, and immune response. It is a member of the β-galactoside-binding animal lectins family and is abundantly expressed in macrophages, where it plays a critical role in phagocytosis. Galectin-3 localizes to actin-rich phagocytic cups and phagosomes, facilitating actin rearrangement necessary for the engulfment of apoptotic cells and IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (Sano2003Critical).

In the immune system, galectin-3 modulates T cell signaling and activation by forming lattices with complex N-glycans, which limits T cell receptor clustering and increases the agonist threshold for TCR signaling. This helps prevent spontaneous TCR activation and contributes to immune tolerance and inflammation regulation (Rabinovich2009Turning). Galectin-3 also influences cytokine secretion and T cell survival, playing a role in the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Rabinovich2009Turning).

Galectin-3 is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system, promoting myelin integrity and function. It interacts with glycosylated receptors to enhance oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin formation (Pasquini2011Galectin3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS3 gene, which encodes galectin-3, have been implicated in various diseases. In cardiovascular conditions, increased galectin-3 levels are associated with myocardial fibrosis and postoperative strokes in coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, although they do not correlate with incident cardiometabolic disease after adjusting for risk factors (Dong2017Galectin3). In heart failure, galectin-3 is involved in left ventricular remodeling and fibrosis, and its overexpression activates fibroblasts and macrophages, contributing to cardiac tissue remodeling (Lima2022Galectin3).

In cancer, galectin-3 is upregulated in several types, including glioblastoma, where it is associated with shorter overall survival and treatment resistance (Wang2019LGALS3; He2019Increased). It is also linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma and is involved in tumor progression in prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, and breast cancers (Dong2017Galectin3).

In neurodegenerative diseases, galectin-3 is upregulated in microglia and is involved in the regulation of microglia activation, contributing to the pathogenesis of conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (GarcíaRevilla2022Galectin3). In retinal diseases, galectin-3 exacerbates endothelial dysfunction and promotes pathological angiogenesis, playing a role in diabetic retinopathy and retinal degeneration (Zhou2023The).

## Interactions
Galectin-3, encoded by the LGALS3 gene, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing by forming spliceosomal complexes. Nuclear extracts depleted of galectin-3 fail to form these complexes, but splicing activity can be restored with recombinant galectin-3, suggesting its interaction with nuclear components, possibly glycoproteins or nonglycosylated polypeptides (Dagher1995Identification).

In cancer cells, galectin-3 stabilizes MUC4 mRNA by interacting with hnRNP-L, an RNA-binding protein. This interaction enhances hnRNP-L's binding to the CA Repeat Element in the MUC4 3' UTR, crucial for maintaining MUC4 mRNA levels (Coppin2017Galectin3). Galectin-3 also interacts with proteins in the reproductive tract, such as PSA, PAP, and ZAG, through its carbohydrate recognition domain, highlighting its role in immunomodulation and cell adhesion (Kovak2014Investigation).

In the context of colorectal cancer, galectin-3 interacts with various proteins, including those encoded by both upregulated and downregulated genes, such as HRAS, GSK3B, and KRAS, which may influence cancer progression (HAN2014Revealing). These interactions underscore galectin-3's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
