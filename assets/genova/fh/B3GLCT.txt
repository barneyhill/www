# B3GLCT

## Overview
The B3GLCT gene encodes the enzyme beta 3-glucosyltransferase, a member of the glycosyltransferase family, specifically involved in the glycosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). This enzyme catalyzes the addition of glucose to O-fucose on TSRs, forming a glucose-β1,3-fucose disaccharide, a modification crucial for the proper folding and secretion of TSR-containing proteins. These proteins are integral to various biological processes, including organogenesis and cell signaling, particularly within the ADAMTS superfamily (Kozma2006Identification; Zhang2021Peters). The enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in a non-canonical quality control pathway, ensuring the correct folding of TSR motifs (Weh2017Functional). Mutations in B3GLCT are linked to Peters Plus Syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental defects, underscoring the gene's significance in human development (Zhang2021Peters).

## Structure
The B3GLCT gene encodes the β1,3-glucosyltransferase enzyme, which is part of the GT31 glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is responsible for transferring glucose to O-fucose on thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), forming a glucose-β1,3-fucose disaccharide. The enzyme's structure includes two putative glycosyltransferase domains: the C-terminal GT domain, which is crucial for its glucosyltransferase activity, and the N-terminal GT-like domain, whose role is less clear but may assist in substrate recognition or act as a chaperone (Zhang2021Peters).

The C-GT domain adopts a GT-A fold, characterized by conserved motifs such as the DxD motif, G-loop, and xED motif, which are essential for its catalytic function. The catalytic base D421 is critical for enzymatic activity (Zhang2021Peters). The enzyme is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and contains a C-terminal REEL motif, similar to a KDEL motif, which helps retain it within the ER (Zhang2021Peters).

B3GLCT is involved in a non-canonical ER quality control pathway, marking properly folded TSR motifs necessary for the secretion of certain proteins (Weh2017Functional). The enzyme's activity does not require a metal ion, unlike other glycosyltransferases with the DxD motif (Zhang2021Peters).

## Function
The B3GLCT gene encodes the enzyme beta 3-glucosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the glycosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose to O-linked fucose on TSRs, forming a glucose-β1,3-fucose disaccharide. This modification is essential for the proper function and secretion of TSR-containing proteins, many of which are part of the ADAMTS superfamily, involved in organogenesis, tissue organization, and cell signaling during development (Kozma2006Identification; Zhang2021Peters).

B3GLCT is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is part of a quality control pathway for the folding of TSRs. The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper modification of TSRs, which may play a role in cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways in healthy human cells (Kozma2006Identification). The enzyme specifically recognizes properly folded TSR domains, indicating its function may be related to the assembly of supradomain structures rather than individual domain folding (Kozma2006Identification).

Mutations in B3GLCT can lead to Peters Plus Syndrome, characterized by various developmental defects, highlighting the enzyme's importance in developmental processes (Zhang2021Peters).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the B3GLCT gene are primarily associated with Peters Plus Syndrome (PPS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. PPS is characterized by ocular abnormalities such as central corneal clouding, cataracts, and iridocorneal adhesions, along with systemic manifestations including short stature, dysmorphic facial features, and developmental delays (Abdelmoneim2020In; TotońŻurańska2019Contribution). The B3GLCT gene encodes an enzyme crucial for glycosylation reactions, specifically attaching glucose to O-linked fucose on thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) in proteins. This process is essential for proper protein folding and secretion in the endoplasmic reticulum (Weh2017Functional; TotońŻurańska2019Contribution).

Mutations in B3GLCT, such as the c.660+1G>A variant, can lead to exon skipping and premature termination codons, resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and potentially causing PPS (TotońŻurańska2019Contribution). Other mutations, including missense mutations like D349N and G393E, completely abolish the enzyme's ability to transfer glucose, disrupting its function and stability (Zhang2021Peters). These genetic alterations lead to the absence of glucose on B3GLCT substrate proteins, which is the underlying molecular mechanism for the phenotypes observed in PPS patients (Zhang2021Peters). Additionally, B3GLCT mutations have been implicated in hydrocephalus in mouse models, affecting the secretion and function of multiple substrates, including SSPO, in ependymal cells and the subcommissural organ (Neupane2021Hydrocephalus).

## Interactions
The B3GLCT gene encodes a β1,3-glucosyltransferase enzyme that is involved in the glycosylation of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) by adding a glucose-β1,3-fucose disaccharide. This modification is crucial for the proper folding and secretion of certain proteins, particularly those in the ADAMTS superfamily, which are involved in extracellular matrix modulation and organogenesis (Holdener2019ADAMTS9). B3GLCT interacts with several human proteins, including Thrombospondin-1, Thrombospondin-2, Properdin, F-spondin, ADAMTS-13, ADAMTSL-1, and ADAMTS-5. Properdin, in particular, has been shown to lack proper modification in patients with Peters Plus Syndrome, although it is still secreted at lower levels (Weh2017Functional).

The enzyme specifically interacts with fucosylated substrates, highlighting its role in the synthesis of the Glc-β1,3-Fuc disaccharide on thrombospondin type 1 repeats. This activity was confirmed through radiochemical assays and mass spectrometry, which showed the incorporation of glucose into the acceptor substrate (Kozma2006Identification). The interactions of B3GLCT with these proteins are essential for their proper function and stability, and mutations in B3GLCT can disrupt these interactions, leading to developmental defects associated with Peters Plus Syndrome (Zhang2021Peters).
