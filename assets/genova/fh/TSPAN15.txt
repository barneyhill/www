# TSPAN15

## Overview
TSPAN15, or tetraspanin 15, is a gene that encodes a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, which are characterized by their four transmembrane domains and involvement in various cellular processes. The protein tetraspanin 15 is part of the TspanC8 subgroup, known for its role in modulating the activity of the metalloprotease ADAM10, a key player in the cleavage of cell surface proteins and signaling pathways (Koo2020The; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). Tetraspanin 15 is implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and signaling, influencing processes such as cancer metastasis and cell invasion (Harrison2021Regulation). It is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial and endothelial cells, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as cancer and venous thromboembolism (Zhang2018TSPAN15; Germain2015Metaanalysis). The protein's interactions, particularly with ADAM10, underscore its significance in cellular function and disease progression.

## Structure
TSPAN15, or tetraspanin 15, is a member of the TspanC8 subgroup of tetraspanins, characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular regions of unequal size. The larger extracellular loop contains eight conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds and maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Haining2012The; Koo2022The). This subgroup is known for its specific fold in the large extracellular domain, which is essential for its function (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8).

TSPAN15 is involved in the regulation of ADAM10, a metalloprotease, by stabilizing it at the cell surface and influencing its expression levels (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). The interaction between TSPAN15 and ADAM10 is facilitated by the ectodomain of TSPAN15, which is critical for promoting the cleavage of substrates like the platelet collagen receptor GPVI (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8; Koo2022The).

Post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation are present in TSPAN15, although an unusual palmitoylation site at the end of its C-terminus is not necessary for its function (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). The cytoplasmic domains of TSPAN15 contribute to its effects on ADAM10 trafficking and Notch signaling (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8).

## Function
TSPAN15, a member of the tetraspanin family, plays a crucial role in regulating the metalloprotease ADAM10, which is involved in the cleavage of various substrates, including cadherins and other cell surface proteins. TSPAN15 is an essential subunit of the ADAM10 scissor complex, influencing its substrate specificity and activity (Koo2020The). The interaction between TSPAN15 and ADAM10 facilitates the exit of ADAM10 from the endoplasmic reticulum, its maturation, and its function on the cell surface (Harrison2021Regulation). TSPAN15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface, forming a functional heterodimeric complex that is crucial for ADAM10's proteolytic activity (Koo2020The).

TSPAN15 is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and signaling pathways, such as β-catenin and FGFR signaling, by modulating the shedding of N-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion molecule (Harrison2021Regulation). This regulation is significant in processes like cancer metastasis, where N-cadherin is upregulated. TSPAN15 is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial, endocrine, and endothelial cells, and is involved in cancer cell invasion and tumor formation (Harrison2021Regulation). The protein's expression is dependent on ADAM10, and it plays a role in the trafficking of ADAM10 to the cell surface, which is essential for their mutual expression and function (Koo2020The).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN15 has been implicated in various cancers, including oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In OSCC, TSPAN15 is frequently upregulated, with overexpression detected in 60.9% of OSCC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and advanced clinical stages, leading to lower survival rates for patients. TSPAN15 promotes OSCC metastasis by interacting with beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC), which activates NF-κB signaling, a pathway crucial for cancer progression (Zhang2018TSPAN15).

In HCC, TSPAN15 is identified as a marker related to cancer stemness, particularly in tumors with HBV or HCV etiologies. TSPAN15 expression is linked to poor prognosis, increased tumor size, poor differentiation, and metastasis. It is associated with stemness markers such as glypican-3 and Cytokeratin-19, and its overexpression in hepatoma cells increases cell proliferation and alters cell cycle distribution. TSPAN15 also interacts with ADAM10, regulating its expression and activity, which is significant for cancer progression (Sidahmed‐Adrar2019Tspan15).

Additionally, TSPAN15 has been identified as a susceptibility locus for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with specific SNPs in the gene associated with increased risk of the condition (Germain2015Metaanalysis).

## Interactions
TSPAN15, or tetraspanin 15, is known to interact primarily with ADAM10, forming an essential component of the ADAM10 scissor complex. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and surface expression of ADAM10, as TSPAN15 helps maintain ADAM10 at the plasma membrane by preventing its endocytosis (Koo2019Tetraspanin; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). TSPAN15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface, and their interaction is significant for the functional activity of the ADAM10/TSPAN15 complex, which is involved in the cleavage of various substrates, including VE-cadherin (Koo2020The).

TSPAN15 also competes with other tetraspanins, such as Tspan5, for interaction with ADAM10. This competition affects the trafficking and stabilization of ADAM10, as Tspan5 promotes ADAM10 endocytosis, whereas TSPAN15 stabilizes it at the cell surface (Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). The presence of TSPAN15 can lead to a decrease in the association of ADAM10 with other tetraspanin web components, such as CD9 and CD81, indicating a unique interaction profile that distinguishes it from other tetraspanins (Jouannet2015TspanC8; Eschenbrenner2019TspanC8). These interactions highlight the regulatory role of TSPAN15 in modulating ADAM10's function and localization.
