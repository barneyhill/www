# HOXA4

## Overview
The HOXA4 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes the homeobox A4 protein, a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and in adult tissues. This protein plays a critical role in the differentiation and spatial organization of cells, particularly within the hematopoietic and vascular systems. As a transcription factor, homeobox A4 binds to specific DNA sequences, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and maintenance of cellular identity (MUSIALIK2015Promoter; Lillvis2011Regional). The gene's expression is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications and interactions with other proteins and non-coding RNAs, which can impact its function in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhou2023lncRNA; Wang2024Role).

## Function
The HOXA4 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is crucial for maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, which is essential for proper development and maintenance of the hematopoietic system (MUSIALIK2015Promoter). HOXA4 is also involved in maintaining spatial identity within the adult aorta, contributing to vascular health. Its upregulation can decrease susceptibility to human abdominal aortic aneurysms, indicating a protective role in vascular integrity (Lillvis2011Regional; Wang2024Role).

In the context of cellular biology, HOXA4 interacts with Transcriptional Enhancer Activator Domain (TEADs), influencing the phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells, which is vital for vascular function and repair (Wang2024Role). It also plays a role in the differentiation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells into epidermal-like cells, promoting skin repair (Wang2024Role). HOXA4 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate gene expression, impacting processes like cell proliferation and differentiation (Lillvis2011Regional). Its expression is modulated by epigenetic modifications, with TASP1 inhibiting its expression through histone methylation (Wang2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
The HOXA4 gene is implicated in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In heart failure, HOXA4 expression is upregulated by the long noncoding RNA MIAT, contributing to disease progression (Wang2024Role). Abnormal expression of HOXA4 is linked to microtia-atresia, a rare congenital condition, and increased mRNA levels are associated with hypospadias (Wang2024Role). In cancer, HOXA4 expression is significantly altered in several types, including laryngeal squamous cell cancer and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where high expression correlates with poor survival (Wang2024Role). In lung cancer, HOXA4 acts as a tumor suppressor, with hypermethylation of its CpG sites detected in cancer tissues (Wang2024Role). Conversely, in glioblastoma, HOXA4 upregulation is associated with poor prognosis (Wang2024Role). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, promoter hypermethylation of HOXA4 is linked to decreased sensitivity to certain treatments (Li2019The). Additionally, a germline mutation in HOXA4, c.194G>A, resulting in a p.Gly65Asp substitution, has been identified in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and skeletal anomalies (van2005Mutation).

## Interactions
HOXA4, a member of the homeobox gene family, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that influence its role as a transcription factor. HOXA4 can directly bind to the promoter region of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIRM1, facilitating its transcription in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of HOTAIRM1, which in turn plays a role in cell proliferation (Zhou2023lncRNA). 

The interaction between HOXA4 and HOTAIRM1 is part of a positive feedback loop that regulates endothelial cell proliferation, particularly under conditions simulating atherosclerosis (Zhou2023lncRNA). Although the specific physical interactions of HOXA4 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its regulatory relationship with HOTAIRM1 are not detailed, the study suggests that HOXA4's role in cell proliferation is partly dependent on its activation of HOTAIRM1 (Zhou2023lncRNA).

Additionally, HOXA4's promoter is regulated by the transcription factor AP-2, which can inhibit its activity. AP-2 overexpression affects both wild-type and mutant HOXA4 constructs, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism involving AP-2 binding sites (Doerksen1996Functional).
