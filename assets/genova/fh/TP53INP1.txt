# TP53INP1

## Overview
TP53INP1, or tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. The protein encoded by TP53INP1 is categorized as a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to stress by modulating autophagy and enhancing the transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Through its interactions with key proteins and microRNAs, TP53INP1 influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and acting as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in TP53INP1 expression have been implicated in the progression of various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Peuget2014Oxidative; Gironella2007Tumor; Seillier2012TP53INP1).

## Function
TP53INP1 is a crucial regulator of autophagy and transcription in human cells. It is involved in the cellular response to stress and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. TP53INP1 modulates autophagy by relocating from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon activation by stressors such as amino acid starvation or rapamycin treatment. In the cytoplasm, it co-localizes with autophagosomes, enhancing autophagic flux, as indicated by increased LC3-II levels when lysosomal degradation is inhibited (Sancho2012DORTp53inp2).

The protein contains a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is essential for its interaction with LC3 and ATG8-family proteins, facilitating autophagy-dependent cell death. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of autophagy, a process that degrades and recycles cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Seillier2012TP53INP1).

TP53INP1 also acts as a tumor suppressor by enhancing the transcriptional activity of p53, a key protein in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is involved in a feedback loop with p53, where it interacts with kinases such as HIPK2 to phosphorylate p53, thereby stabilizing it and enhancing its function (Seillier2012TP53INP1; Shahbazi2013Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TP53INP1 gene are associated with various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), downregulation of TP53INP1 is common in advanced and metastatic tumors. This downregulation promotes metastasis through the DUSP10 phosphatase-mediated activation of the ERK signaling pathway, which is modulated by p73 (Ng2017TP53INP1). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TP53INP1 expression is significantly reduced, often due to repression by the oncogenic microRNA miR-155. This reduction is linked to the aggressive nature of PDAC and poor prognosis (Gironella2007Tumor). 

In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor α-positive cases, low TP53INP1 expression is associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival. This suggests that TP53INP1 could serve as an independent prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target (Nishimoto2019Prognostic). The gene's expression is also influenced by microRNAs such as miR-155 and miR-569, which can inhibit its translation and promote mRNA cleavage, further impacting cancer progression (Nishimoto2019Prognostic). 

Overall, TP53INP1's role as a tumor suppressor is evident in its ability to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and its downregulation or altered interactions contribute to tumorigenesis in various cancers.

## Interactions
TP53INP1 interacts with several proteins involved in autophagy and apoptosis. It binds to LC3 and ATG8-family proteins through a functional LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, promoting autophagy-dependent cell death. This interaction is crucial for TP53INP1's role in autophagy, as it colocalizes with LC3 in autophagosomes and enhances autophagic flux (Seillier2012TP53INP1). TP53INP1 can displace p62 from LC3, facilitating the targeted degradation of specific proteins, which is essential for its tumor suppressor function (Seillier2012TP53INP1).

TP53INP1 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its transcriptional activity on target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, such as p21, Bax, and PUMA. This interaction is modulated by oxidative stress-induced SUMOylation of TP53INP1, which enhances its binding to p53 in the nucleus (Peuget2014Oxidative). TP53INP1 forms complexes with proteins like HIPK2 and PKCδ, which further modulate p53 activity through phosphorylation (Peuget2014Oxidative).

Additionally, TP53INP1 interacts with miRNAs, such as miR-524-5p, which targets TP53INP1 to enhance cell proliferation and suppress apoptosis, impacting cellular reprogramming processes (Nguyen2017miR5245p). These interactions highlight TP53INP1's multifaceted role in regulating autophagy, apoptosis, and tumor suppression.
