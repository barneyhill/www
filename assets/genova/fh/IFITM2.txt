# IFITM2

## Overview
Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein, which is part of the IFITM family known for its role in antiviral defense mechanisms. The IFITM2 protein is characterized by its involvement in the immune response, particularly in inhibiting viral entry into host cells. It is primarily localized in endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where it contributes to the restriction of viral replication. The protein's structure includes two transmembrane helices and a conserved CD225 domain, which are crucial for its functional activity. IFITM2 is inducible by both Type I and Type II interferons, enhancing the type I interferon signaling pathway and promoting IFN-β production. Beyond its antiviral functions, IFITM2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including endocytosis and membrane fusion, and has been associated with cancer progression and treatment resistance (Friedlová2022IFITM; Daniel‐Carmi2009The; Chen2023IFITM2).

## Structure
The IFITM2 protein is a member of the IFITM family, characterized by its role in antiviral defense. It is a type II transmembrane protein with a cytosolic N-terminus and an extracellular or endosomal C-terminus. The protein structure includes two transmembrane helices, although it is suggested that one of these may function as an intramembrane domain (IMD), which is an amphipathic helix responsible for the protein's functional activity. The IMD and the transmembrane domain (TMD) are connected by a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) (Friedlová2022IFITM).

IFITM2 contains a highly conserved CD225 domain that spans the IMD and CIL, forming a crucial structural and functional core. The N- and C-terminal regions of IFITM2 are variable, allowing for diverse post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and methylation, which influence its localization and function (Friedlová2022IFITM). Specifically, S-palmitoylation affects its trafficking between cellular compartments (Friedlová2022IFITM).

The protein is primarily localized in endosomes and lysosomes, with its localization influenced by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the N-terminal domain, including a sorting motif that targets it to endosomes (Friedlová2022IFITM). The IFITM2 gene is located on chromosome 11 and consists of two exons separated by a short intron (Siegrist2011The).

## Function
IFITM2, a member of the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein family, plays a significant role in the immune response by inhibiting viral entry into host cells. It is primarily active in the cell membrane and endosomal compartments, where it contributes to antiviral defense by restricting the replication of various viruses (Chen2023IFITM2). IFITM2 enhances the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, particularly by promoting IFN-β production. This is achieved through its interaction with the MDA5 protein, which is crucial for the activation of the IFN-β signaling pathway (Chen2023IFITM2). 

In healthy human cells, IFITM2 is involved in cellular processes such as endocytosis and membrane fusion, which are essential for its antiviral activity. The protein's N-terminal domain is particularly significant in its antiviral function and in activating IFN-β (Chen2023IFITM2). IFITM2 is inducible by both Type I and Type II interferons, which are cytokines that can inhibit viral replication and affect cell growth, differentiation, and the immune system (Daniel‐Carmi2009The). Through these mechanisms, IFITM2 plays a vital role in modulating the immune response and inhibiting viral infections by affecting both viral entry and immune signaling pathways (Chen2023IFITM2).

## Clinical Significance
IFITM2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In gastric cancer, IFITM2 is upregulated in tumor tissues and correlates with advanced disease stages, tumor invasion, and metastasis. High IFITM2 expression is linked to worse overall survival and disease-free survival, making it an independent predictor of recurrence and mortality (Xu2017IGF1IGF1RSTAT3). In colorectal cancer, IFITM2 overexpression is associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, promoting cancer progression and correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes (liu2022IFITM2). In renal clear cell carcinoma, high IFITM2 expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including worse disease-free and overall survival, and is associated with increased metastasis (Yang2021Predicative).

IFITM2 also plays a role in osteosarcoma, where its expression is associated with chemotherapy response. It is upregulated in tumors that respond well to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker (Salas2009Molecular). The protein's involvement in cancer progression is further supported by its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and metastasis (Friedlová2022IFITM).

## Interactions
IFITM2, a member of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its antiviral and cellular functions. IFITM2 interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein A (VAPA), which plays a role in cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes, affecting lipid homeostasis and membrane trafficking (Friedlová2022IFITM). This interaction is significant for the modulation of membrane structures and functions, such as membrane fusion and intracellular trafficking.

In the context of cancer, IFITM2's expression is regulated by G3BP1 and G3BP2, which are RNA-binding proteins that interact with the 3′-UTRs of IFITM2 mRNA. This interaction is crucial for the translational regulation of IFITM2, as G3BP1 and G3BP2 facilitate the transport of mRNA to specific translation sites or recruit necessary translation factors (Alam2019G3BP1). The MEK/ERK pathway is also involved in this regulatory process, with G3BPs influencing the phosphorylation of eIF4E, a downstream effector in mRNA translation (Alam2019G3BP1).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of IFITM2 in both antiviral defense and cellular processes, including its potential implications in cancer progression and treatment resistance.
