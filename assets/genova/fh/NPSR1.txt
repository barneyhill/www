# NPSR1

## Overview
The NPSR1 gene encodes the neuropeptide S receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the amygdala, hypothalamic nucleus, and hippocampus, where it modulates intracellular signaling pathways involved in anxiety, arousal, and memory (Zhang2019Physiology; Anedda2011Multiple). NPSR1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitate its interaction with neuropeptide S (NPS) and subsequent activation of signaling cascades, including calcium mobilization and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) elevation (Zhang2019Physiology; Reinscheid2021Pharmacology). Beyond its neurological functions, NPSR1 is implicated in immune responses and is associated with various inflammatory and psychiatric disorders, as well as conditions like asthma and endometriosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Tapmeier2021Neuropeptide; Anedda2011Multiple).

## Structure
The neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a highly conserved primary structure among terrestrial vertebrates. It consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, with the human isoforms NPSR1-A and NPSR1-B differing only at the C-termini, showing 93% identity (Zhang2019Physiology). The receptor is encoded by nine exons, with NPSR1-A encoding a protein of 371 amino acids and NPSR1-B encoding a protein of 377 amino acids (Zhang2019Physiology).

The secondary structure of NPSR1 includes seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs, which are highly conserved and crucial for its function (Zhang2019Physiology). These domains facilitate the receptor's role in downstream signaling pathways. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, forming a transmembrane domain with seven helices, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not provided in the context.

NPSR1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and involvement in signaling pathways (Zhang2019Physiology). The receptor's structure and function are also affected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are associated with various diseases, including asthma (Zhang2019Physiology).

## Function
The neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in modulating various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in specific brain regions, including the amygdala, hypothalamic nucleus, and hippocampus, where it influences intracellular signaling pathways such as calcium mobilization, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) elevation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation (Anedda2011Multiple; Erdmann2015Neuronal). These pathways are involved in regulating anxiety, arousal, locomotion, food intake, and fear memory (Zhang2019Physiology; Anedda2011Multiple).

NPSR1 activation leads to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum through inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine receptors, followed by store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) that facilitates extracellular calcium influx (Erdmann2015Neuronal). This receptor is also implicated in immune functions, affecting macrophage adherence, migration, and phagocytosis, and inducing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 8 (IL8) (Anedda2011Multiple). NPSR1's expression is increased in activated leukocytes and inflamed tissues, suggesting its role in immune response modulation (Anedda2011Multiple). Genetic variations in NPSR1 are associated with inflammatory diseases and panic disorders, potentially altering its signaling properties (Anedda2011Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPSR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. Variants in NPSR1 are associated with asthma, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) like rs324981 influencing the risk and severity of the disease (Acevedo2017Neuropeptide; Vendelin2006Downstream). The gene is also linked to inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where certain haplotypes are associated with altered disease risk (Anedda2011Multiple).

NPSR1 is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, with the rs142885915 variant showing a significant association with advanced stages of the condition (Tapmeier2021Neuropeptide). In cancer, particularly neuroendocrine tumors, NPSR1 is widely expressed and activates pathways relevant to tumor development, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Pulkkinen2014Neuropeptide).

The gene is also implicated in psychiatric disorders, with its role in modulating anxiety and fear responses being significant. Variations in NPSR1 may contribute to panic disorders and other anxiety-related conditions (Anedda2011Multiple). These associations highlight the clinical significance of NPSR1 in various inflammatory, psychiatric, and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
NPSR1, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with neuropeptide S (NPS) to activate various intracellular signaling pathways. Upon activation by NPS, NPSR1 couples with Gαq and Gαs proteins, leading to increased intracellular calcium and cAMP levels, respectively. This interaction results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the opening of neuronal calcium channels (Reinscheid2021Pharmacology). 

The receptor's interaction with G proteins facilitates the mobilization of intracellular calcium and the stimulation of cAMP formation, particularly in the presence of the NPSR Ile 107 variant, which shows enhanced potency in these processes (Reinscheid2005Pharmacological). NPSR1 also engages in calcium signaling pathways in neurons, where it induces a biphasic calcium signal involving calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular calcium influx through store-operated calcium entry (Erdmann2015Neuronal).

NPSR1's interactions extend to its role in immune responses and asthma, where it influences the expression of genes such as IL8, a major mediator of inflammation, and MMP10, involved in tissue remodeling (Vendelin2006Downstream). These interactions highlight NPSR1's involvement in both physiological and pathological processes.
