# DOCK5

## Overview
DOCK5 is a gene that encodes the protein dedicator of cytokinesis 5, which is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by activating Rac small GTPases, which are crucial for processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and bone resorption. DOCK5 is characterized by its DHR2 domain, which facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac GTPases, thereby activating them. This activation is essential for maintaining normal bone homeostasis and immune responses. The protein also contains a DHR1 domain and an SH3 domain, which contribute to its interactions with other proteins and its recruitment to focal adhesions. DOCK5 is involved in various cellular functions, including epithelial cell motility, endothelial cell migration, and osteoclast function, and has been implicated in neurological and developmental disorders, as well as vascular development and disease (Benson2021The; Frank2016The; Ferrandez2017Allosteric).

## Structure
DOCK5 is a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and is characterized by the presence of specific domains that contribute to its function. The protein contains a DHR2 domain, approximately 400 amino acids in length, which is responsible for its guanine nucleotide exchange activity. This domain forms a symmetrical dimer composed of three lobes: lobe A, which mediates dimerization, and lobes B and C, which form the catalytic center. Lobe B interacts extensively with the switch 1 region of the GTPase, while lobe C binds to switch 2 and contains a nucleotide sensor loop that facilitates GDP dissociation (Ferrandez2017Allosteric).

DOCK5 also includes a DHR1 domain that binds membrane phosphoinositides and an SH3 domain located at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of the DOCK A subfamily (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). The SH3 domain is not necessary for binding tensin 3 but is required for binding Elmo1 (Touaitahuata2016Tensin). The DHR2 domain is highly active towards Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases, indicating specificity for the Rac subfamily (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). The protein's flexibility and conformational dynamics are crucial for its function and inhibition, as demonstrated by the small molecule inhibitor C21, which remodels the DOCK5-Rac1 complex into an unproductive conformation (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). 

The structural dynamics of DOCK5, particularly in complex with Rac1, have been studied using techniques such as synchrotron SAXS and X-ray crystallography, revealing that the DOCK5 DHR2 domain exists as a conformational population (Ferrandez2017Allosteric).

## Function
DOCK5, a member of the DOCK family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), plays a crucial role in activating Rac small GTPases, which are essential for various cellular functions such as cytoskeletal reorganization, cell migration, and bone resorption (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). The protein is characterized by the presence of a DHR2 domain responsible for the catalytic activity that facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac GTPases, thereby activating them (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). This activation is vital for maintaining normal bone homeostasis and immune responses (Ferrandez2017Allosteric).

In epithelial cells, DOCK5 is involved in regulating motility and invasiveness. It is recruited to focal adhesions (FAs) and interacts with proteins such as Crk and p130Cas, forming a signaling cascade necessary for Rac1-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and FA turnover (Frank2016The). DOCK5 also plays a role in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion during migration by promoting FA assembly and turnover, which is crucial for stable cell protrusions (PascualVargas2020Multiplexed).

In vascular processes, DOCK5 is implicated in endothelial cell migration and membrane ruffling, contributing to vascular development (Benson2021The). Its activity is modulated by interactions with GIT2, which can inhibit its recruitment to FAs, thus controlling the invasiveness of epithelial cells (Frank2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DOCK5 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), the DOCK5 gene plays a significant role in neuronal morphogenesis. Mutations in the semaphorin-5A (Sema5A) gene, such as the Arg676-to-Cys mutation, are associated with ASD and ID and lead to increased process elongation in neuronal cells. This effect is mediated by the Dock5 signalosome, and knockdown of Dock5 or its adaptor molecule Elmo2 can mitigate these changes, suggesting that DOCK5 is involved in the abnormal signaling pathways contributing to these conditions (Okabe2024Autism).

DOCK5 is also associated with vascular development and disease. It shares regulatory mechanisms with DOCK1 and is involved in cell adhesion and osteoclast function. Knockout studies in mice have shown that DOCK5 deficiency leads to increased trabecular bone mass due to defective osteoclasts, indicating its role in bone remodeling (Benson2021The). Additionally, DOCK5 is implicated in vascular smooth muscle cell contractility, where its down-regulation by mir-21 in vitro leads to a loss of contractility (Benson2021The).

## Interactions
DOCK5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It forms part of the Crk-p130Cas-DOCK5 signaling pathway, which is crucial for focal adhesion dynamics and Rac1-regulated cell motility. DOCK5 interacts with Crk, a protein involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell motility, and this interaction is modulated by GIT2, which suppresses the interaction under normal conditions (Frank2016The). DOCK5 is also involved in the phosphorylation of proteins such as p130Cas and paxillin, influencing signaling pathways related to cell motility and invasiveness (Frank2016The).

In osteoclasts, DOCK5 regulates microtubule dynamic instability through both Rac-dependent and -independent pathways. It acts as a signaling adaptor, bringing Akt into proximity with GSK3β, which allows for the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3β, a negative regulator of microtubule dynamic instability (Guimbal2019Dock5). DOCK5's interaction with Rac1 is crucial for its function, facilitating GDP dissociation and GTP reloading, which is essential for actin polymerization and cell movement (Ferrandez2017Allosteric). The DHR2 domain of DOCK5 interacts with Rac1, forming a stable complex that is essential for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity (Ferrandez2017Allosteric).
