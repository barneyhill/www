# KIF4B

## Overview
KIF4B is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 4B, which is part of the kinesin-4 family of motor proteins. These proteins are integral to intracellular transport, particularly in the context of mitosis, where they play crucial roles in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. KIF4B is characterized by its motor domain, which facilitates its interaction with microtubules, enabling the transport of organelles and vesicles within the cell. This function is essential for maintaining cellular organization and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. The protein's involvement in genomic stability and cell division underscores its potential clinical significance, particularly in the context of cancer, where altered expression of KIF4B has been associated with poor prognosis in various tumor types (Camlin2017Motoring; Zhong2023Pancancer).

## Structure
KIF4B is a member of the kinesin family of motor proteins, characterized by its involvement in intracellular transport. The primary structure of KIF4B consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of KIF4B involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which often includes a motor domain that is crucial for binding to microtubules. This motor domain is essential for the protein's role in cellular transport.

The quaternary structure of KIF4B may involve dimerization or interaction with other proteins, which can influence its functional capabilities. Specific domains within KIF4B, such as the motor domain and coiled-coil regions, are integral to its function. These domains facilitate the protein's interaction with microtubules and other cellular components. KIF4B can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of KIF4B may exist, potentially altering its function or localization within the cell. These structural features and modifications enable KIF4B to perform its role in intracellular transport effectively.

## Function
KIF4B is a motor protein that plays a significant role in mitosis, particularly in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. It is closely related to KIF4A and is part of the kinesin-4 family, which is known for its involvement in intracellular transport and mitotic processes. KIF4B is essential for normal cell cycle completion, as its depletion in human cell lines results in abnormal anaphase spindle morphology and failed cytokinesis, leading to binucleated cells (Camlin2017Motoring).

KIF4B operates within the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and function. The protein's role in ensuring proper cell cycle regulation and completion underscores its importance in healthy cell division (Camlin2017Motoring).

The kinesin-4 family, including KIF4B, is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, which are vital for preventing aneuploidy and ensuring successful cell proliferation. These functions highlight the potential clinical importance of KIF4B in understanding and addressing issues related to cell cycle dysregulation (Camlin2017Motoring).

## Clinical Significance
KIF4B, a member of the kinesin-4 family, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromosomal stability and cell proliferation. Altered expression of KIF4B is associated with poor prognosis in several tumor types. In a pan-cancer analysis, KIF4B was identified as a high-risk gene with a hazard ratio greater than 1, indicating its potential role in tumor prognosis (Zhong2023Pancancer). Despite its low expression in tumors, KIF4B is part of a co-expression network that may influence cancer progression (Han2019Prognostic).

KIF4B's expression levels do not significantly differ between tumor and normal tissues in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting limited clinical significance in expression alterations for this specific cancer type (Han2019Prognostic). However, the gene's involvement in microtubule-based movement and other cellular processes highlights its potential impact on genomic instability and cancer progression (Zhong2023Pancancer).

While specific mutations in KIF4B are not detailed, its role in cancer suggests that changes in its interactions or expression could disrupt normal cellular processes, contributing to disease progression. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of KIF4B in cancer.
