# TEKT2

## Overview
TEKT2 is a gene that encodes the protein tektin 2, which is a member of the tektin family of filament-forming proteins. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, particularly in the axonemal microtubules. Tektin 2 is predominantly localized in the principal piece of sperm flagella, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for sperm motility. The protein's involvement in biological pathways such as chromosome condensation and axonemal dynein complex assembly underscores its importance in sperm development and motility. TEKT2's interactions with other proteins, such as TEKT2-binding protein 1, further highlight its role in linking structural components within sperm flagella. Clinically, alterations in TEKT2 expression have been associated with conditions such as non-obstructive azoospermia, testicular germ cell tumors, and cervical cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker and its significance in reproductive health and disease (Xiong2018Expression; Liu2023Identification; Yamaguchi2014Molecular).

## Function
TEKT2 (tektin 2) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, TEKT2 is primarily involved in the formation and stability of axonemal microtubules, which are essential components of these cellular structures. The protein is localized in the principal piece of sperm flagella, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the flagellum, which is critical for sperm motility (Xiong2018Expression; Liu2023Identification).

TEKT2 is part of the tektin family, which consists of filament-forming proteins that contribute to the stability and structural complexity of microtubules in cilia and flagella. This stability is vital for the proper movement and function of these organelles, impacting processes such as sperm motility and fertility (Xiong2018Expression; Yamaguchi2014Molecular). TEKT2 is also involved in biological pathways like chromosome condensation and axonemal dynein complex assembly, which are crucial for sperm development and motility (Liu2023Identification).

In the context of sperm motility, TEKT2-null sperm exhibit flagellum bending and reduced motility, likely due to disruptions in the dynein inner arm, underscoring its essential role in reproductive success (Xiong2018Expression; Yamaguchi2014Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TEKT2 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. TEKT2 is significantly down-regulated in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) and testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), suggesting its role in these conditions. The gene's down-regulation is linked to impaired spermatogenesis, which can lead to male infertility (Liu2023Identification). In TGCT, TEKT2 shows good prognostic value, with a high area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic analysis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Liu2023Identification).

In cervical cancer, TEKT2 expression is notably reduced, particularly in cases with lymph node metastasis. This down-regulation is associated with decreased cell proliferation and migration, suggesting that TEKT2 may act as a protective factor in cervical cancer (Guo2023Lymph).

TEKT2 is also implicated in sperm motility disorders. Its absence leads to structural abnormalities in sperm flagella, resulting in reduced motility, which is crucial for fertilization (Xiong2018Expression; Yamaguchi2014Molecular). Additionally, TEKT2 has been linked to diabetic nephropathy, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Li2022Integrative).

## Interactions
TEKT2 (tektin 2) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of sperm flagella. One of its primary interactions is with TEKT2-binding protein 1 (TEKT2BP1), also known as coiled-coil domain-containing protein 172 (Ccdc172). This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening, which demonstrated a strong interaction between TEKT2 and TEKT2BP1, as evidenced by a galactosidase-positive phenotype in co-transformants (Yamaguchi2014Molecular). TEKT2BP1 is primarily associated with mitochondria and, to a lesser extent, with outer dense fibers (ODF) in the middle piece of the sperm flagella, suggesting a role in linking these structures (Yamaguchi2014Molecular). 

In COS7 cells, TEKT2 and TEKT2BP1 co-localize at the perinuclear region, indicating a physical interaction that persists even after microtubule depolymerization (Yamaguchi2014Molecular). This interaction is hypothesized to be involved in the structural linkage between the ODF and mitochondria, which is crucial for sperm motility and function (Yamaguchi2014Molecular). TEKT2 is also involved in the stability of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, which is essential for proper flagellar function and motility (Nagdas2015Identification).
