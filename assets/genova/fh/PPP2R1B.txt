# PPP2R1B

## Overview
The PPP2R1B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 scaffold subunit Aβ, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme complex. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a vital role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and apoptosis. The Aβ subunit functions as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PP2A, thereby influencing the enzyme's activity and substrate specificity (Calin2000Low; Esplin2005The). Alterations in PPP2R1B, such as mutations and deletions, have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its role in tumor suppression and cellular homeostasis (Wang1998Alterations; Zhu2001PPP2R1BGene). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its clinical significance (Liu2024PPP2R1B).

## Structure
The PPP2R1B gene encodes the Aβ subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the enzyme's catalytic and regulatory subunits. The Aβ subunit is characterized by the presence of 15 HEAT repeats, which are protein-protein interaction motifs crucial for its function in forming PP2A heterotrimers (Esplin2005The). These HEAT repeats contribute to the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, facilitating interactions with other subunits and maintaining the structural integrity necessary for enzymatic activity.

A specific alteration in the Aβ subunit, the G90D mutation, occurs within the second HEAT repeat. This mutation involves a substitution of glycine with aspartate, which introduces a charge that can disrupt the packing of HEAT repeats, potentially altering the protein's structure and its interaction with regulatory subunits (Esplin2005The). This structural change is significant as it affects the binding affinity of the Aβ subunit to certain regulatory subunits, such as B56γ, which is implicated in tumorigenesis (Esplin2005The).

The Aβ subunit's structure and function are also influenced by its expression patterns and interactions with various regulatory subunits, which differ from those of the closely related Aα subunit (Esplin2005The).

## Function
The PPP2R1B gene encodes the beta isoform of the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP2R1B functions as a scaffold subunit within the PP2A holoenzyme, facilitating the assembly of the catalytic and regulatory subunits, which are essential for the enzyme's activity (Esplin2005The). PP2A plays a significant role in regulating cell growth, division, and apoptosis by maintaining the phosphorylation state of various proteins, thereby influencing signal transduction pathways and cell cycle progression (Wang1998Alterations; Calin2000Low).

The PPP2R1B-encoded subunit is involved in forming distinct heterotrimeric complexes that confer substrate specificity to PP2A, allowing it to target specific proteins for dephosphorylation (Baysal1998Genomic). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which can lead to tumorigenesis (Zhu2001PPP2R1BGene). The proper function of PPP2R1B is essential for the normal distribution and activity of PP2A holoenzymes, and disruptions in its activity can lead to pathological conditions, including cancer (Esplin2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPP2R1B gene have been implicated in various cancers, including lung, colon, breast, and cervical cancers. The gene encodes a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical enzyme involved in cell cycle control and tumor suppression. Alterations such as deletions, frameshifts, and point mutations in PPP2R1B can lead to non-conservative amino acid substitutions, potentially destabilizing the PP2A enzyme complex and contributing to tumorigenesis (Wang1998Alterations).

A specific mutation, the glycine 90 to aspartate (G90D) alteration, has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This mutation affects the interaction of the Ab subunit with the B56g regulatory subunit of PP2A, leading to a functional deficit in the enzyme complex (Esplin2005The). The G90D polymorphism has also been observed in other cancers, such as lung and ovarian cancer, although its significance in these contexts requires further investigation (Esplin2005The).

In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), down-regulation and alternative splicing of PPP2R1B transcripts have been noted, which may interfere with PP2A activity and contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Kalla2007Analysis).

## Interactions
The PPP2R1B gene encodes the Aβ subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which serves as a scaffold for assembling the PP2A holoenzyme. This subunit is crucial for binding both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PP2A, facilitating the formation of functional heterotrimers. PPP2R1B interacts with various regulatory subunits, including members of the B56 family, such as B56γ3, and the PR72 family, including PR48 and PR72. The G90D mutation in PPP2R1B specifically reduces its binding affinity to the B56γ3 subunit, while not affecting its interaction with PR72, indicating a selective impact on protein interactions (Esplin2005The).

In the context of cancer, PPP2R1B has been implicated in modulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It interacts with phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), leading to its dephosphorylation and inhibition of the pathway, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. This interaction is significant in colorectal cancer, where PPP2R1B's role in dephosphorylating p-ERK enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like Oxaliplatin (Liu2024PPP2R1B). These interactions underscore PPP2R1B's role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target.
