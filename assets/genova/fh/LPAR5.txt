# LPAR5

## Overview
The LPAR5 gene encodes the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically classified within the rhodopsin-like GPCRs. This receptor is integral to cellular signaling, mediating responses to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid involved in various physiological processes. LPAR5 is characterized by its ability to couple with G proteins, particularly Gα12/13 and Gαq, which facilitate diverse intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell shape, migration, and proliferation (Lee2006GPR92; Choi2010LPA). The receptor is notably expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and modulating immune responses (Wang2021Control). Additionally, LPAR5 has been implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Konen2023Autotaxin; Zhao2021LPAR5).

## Structure
The LPAR5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor family, specifically known as GPR92. This receptor is a member of the rhodopsin-GPCR family and is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 372 amino acids, resulting in a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 41 kDa (Choi2010LPA). 

The secondary structure of LPAR5 likely includes the typical alpha helices and beta sheets found in G protein-coupled receptors, which contribute to its ability to span the cell membrane multiple times. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, forming a transmembrane domain essential for its function as a receptor. 

LPAR5 is known to couple with G proteins, specifically Gα12/13 and Gαq, which are involved in various intracellular signaling pathways (Choi2010LPA). The receptor can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions with other cellular components. While the context does not provide specific details on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms, these aspects could contribute to the receptor's functional diversity.

## Function
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5 (LPAR5) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in regulating various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, LPAR5 is involved in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity by enhancing epithelial barrier function. This is achieved through the transcriptional modulation of claudin-4, a tight junction protein, via the activation of the EGFR-MEK-ERK pathway, which subsequently involves Rac1 and Stat3 signaling (Wang2021Control). LPAR5 is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier, as evidenced by its role in increasing transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) (Wang2021Control).

LPAR5 also influences cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling pathways, which are essential for cell shape changes, migration, and proliferation. It is coupled to G12/13 and Gq proteins, leading to Rho activation and increased intracellular calcium levels, respectively (Lee2006GPR92; Choi2010LPA). These signaling pathways are crucial for normal organismal development and various physiological processes, including nervous system development and immune responses (Lee2006GPR92; Plastira2019SmallMolecule).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LPAR5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In PTC, LPAR5 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and higher tumor stages. This suggests that LPAR5 may contribute to cancer progression through pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Wu2020Lysophosphatidic; Zhang2023Potential; Zhao2021LPAR5).

In NSCLC, LPAR5 is involved in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The ATX/LPA/LPAR5 axis is upregulated in resistant tumors, leading to immunosuppression and reduced efficacy of PD-1 blockade. Inhibition of LPAR5, particularly in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, has been shown to enhance CD8+ T cell functionality and reduce tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Konen2023Autotaxin).

LPAR5 also plays a role in regulating intestinal epithelial permeability. Loss of LPAR5 leads to increased intestinal permeability and exacerbated colitis symptoms, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis (Wang2021Control).

## Interactions
LPAR5, or lysophosphatidic acid receptor 5, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with protein kinase D (PKD) isoforms, particularly PKD2, to mediate signaling events that lead to the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of pro-inflammatory and motile phenotypes in microglial cells (Plastira2017Lysophosphatidic).

LPAR5 also engages in the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, as demonstrated in thyroid carcinoma cells. This interaction is evidenced by the phosphorylation of Akt, which is reduced upon LPAR5 knockdown, indicating its role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Zhao2021LPAR5).

In the context of intestinal epithelial cells, LPAR5 is involved in the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which subsequently activates the MEK-ERK pathway. This pathway is linked to the regulation of claudin-4 transcription, a protein essential for maintaining epithelial barrier function. LPAR5-mediated activation of Rac1 and its interaction with Stat3 further underscores its role in epithelial barrier integrity (Wang2021Control).
