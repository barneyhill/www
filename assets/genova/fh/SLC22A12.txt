# SLC22A12

## Overview
The SLC22A12 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 12, commonly known as URAT1, which is a transmembrane transporter protein primarily expressed in the renal proximal tubules. URAT1 plays a pivotal role in the reabsorption of uric acid, a process crucial for maintaining uric acid homeostasis in the human body (Nigam2018The; Jacobsson2007Identification). As a member of the organic anion transporter family, URAT1 functions as an anion exchanger, facilitating the uptake of uric acid in exchange for other anions such as chloride and lactate (Yee2021Emerging). The gene's mutations can lead to disorders such as renal hypouricemia, characterized by low serum uric acid levels and potential renal complications (PerdomoRamirez2023Pathogenic; Cha2019Contribution). Understanding the structure and function of SLC22A12 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying uric acid metabolism and related pathologies.

## Structure
The SLC22A12 gene encodes the URAT1 protein, which is a member of the organic anion transporter family. URAT1 is involved in the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal proximal tubule and is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (PerdomoRamírez2023New; Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein structure includes a long cytoplasmic loop between TMDs 6 and 7 and cytoplasmic amino and carboxy ends (PerdomoRamírez2023New). The transmembrane domains are organized into three layers, with TMDs 3, 6, 9, and 12 being critical for maintaining the integrity of transport processes (PerdomoRamírez2023New).

URAT1 is expressed on the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells in the kidneys, where it plays a crucial role in urate transport (Mancikova2015Functional). The protein's function is influenced by its interaction with the scaffolding protein PDZK1, which is essential for proper urate transport (Zhou2018Renal). Variants in the SLC22A12 gene can lead to structural changes in URAT1, affecting its stability and function, as seen in mutations that alter interactions between transmembrane domains and disrupt protein stability (PerdomoRamírez2023New). These structural features and interactions are vital for the protein's role in urate reabsorption and its association with renal hypouricemia.

## Function
The SLC22A12 gene encodes the URAT1 protein, a crucial uric acid transporter primarily expressed in the kidney's proximal tubules. URAT1 is located on the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells, where it plays a significant role in the reabsorption of uric acid from the renal tubular fluid back into the bloodstream (Nigam2018The; Yee2021Emerging). This process is essential for maintaining uric acid homeostasis, preventing excessive uric acid excretion, and maintaining normal blood uric acid levels, which is important for preventing conditions like hyperuricemia and gout (Nigam2018The; Toyoda2021Substantial).

URAT1 functions as an anion exchanger, taking up uric acid in exchange for inorganic and organic anions such as chloride, lactate, and nicotinate (Yee2021Emerging). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of serum uric acid levels, and its dysfunction can lead to metabolic diseases related to urate handling (Nigam2018The). In healthy human cells, URAT1's primary function is to maintain uric acid homeostasis, thereby preventing conditions like hyperuricemia or gout (Nigam2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC22A12 gene, which encodes the URAT1 protein, are associated with renal hypouricemia (RHUC), a condition characterized by low serum uric acid levels and increased urinary urate excretion. RHUC can lead to severe complications such as exercise-induced acute kidney injury (EIAKI), renal failure, and nephrolithiasis (PerdomoRamirez2023Pathogenic; Cha2019Contribution). The condition is often asymptomatic but can manifest as renal stone disease or acute kidney injury, particularly after physical exertion (Tasic2011Clinical).

Several specific mutations in SLC22A12 have been identified, including p.Trp258*, p.Arg90His, p.R434C, and p.R434H, which impair the function of the URAT1 transporter, leading to decreased urate reabsorption in the kidneys (Tasic2011Clinical; Cha2019Contribution; Zhou2018Renal). These mutations are prevalent in certain populations, such as the W258X variant in Japanese and Korean populations, likely due to a founder effect (Stiburkova2013Novel; Tasic2011Clinical).

The clinical presentation of RHUC can vary, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms while others remain asymptomatic. Genetic screening for SLC22A12 mutations can aid in the early diagnosis and management of RHUC, potentially preventing severe renal complications (Tasic2011Clinical; Cha2019Contribution).

## Interactions
The SLC22A12 gene encodes the urate transporter 1 (URAT1), which is involved in urate transport and interacts with several proteins to regulate uric acid levels. URAT1 forms part of a complex with the scaffolding protein PDZK1, which is crucial for its function in urate transport. Mutations in SLC22A12 can disrupt this interaction, leading to conditions such as renal hypouricemia (Zhou2018Renal).

URAT1 also interacts with other transporters, including OAT4 (SLC22A11) and GLUT9 (SLC2A9), to modulate urate reabsorption in the kidney. These interactions are essential for maintaining urate homeostasis and are implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders (Zhou2018Renal). The protein's function is further influenced by its structural domains, with specific mutations affecting its stability and interaction capabilities, such as the novel p.(S508N) mutation that impacts the transmembrane domain 12 (PerdomoRamírez2023New).

These interactions highlight the complex network of proteins involved in urate transport and the critical role of URAT1 in this process, with implications for understanding and treating disorders related to uric acid metabolism.
