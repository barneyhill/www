# PRR7

## Overview
PRR7, or proline rich 7, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in synaptic signaling and neuronal communication. The protein, also referred to as proline rich 7, synaptic, is characterized by its proline-rich region and is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. It plays a crucial role in maintaining synaptic balance and plasticity, which are essential for neural circuit development and function. PRR7 is associated with the postsynaptic density and interacts with key synaptic proteins, including PSD-95 and NMDA receptors, thereby influencing synaptic signaling pathways. Additionally, PRR7 functions as a Wnt inhibitor and acts as a synaptonuclear messenger, linking NMDA receptor activity to transcriptional regulation. Beyond its neural functions, PRR7 is also involved in T cell receptor signaling and apoptosis, highlighting its role in immune response regulation (Hrdinka2011PRR7; Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear; Lee2018Reciprocal).

## Structure
The PRR7 protein is a transmembrane adaptor protein characterized by a proline-rich region and a structure typical of transmembrane adaptor proteins (TRAPs). It consists of a short N-terminal extracellular segment, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with several conserved binding motifs. These motifs include SH2 domain binding motifs, proline-rich SH3 binding motifs, group I WW domain binding motifs, and a C-terminal class I PDZ domain binding motif (Hrdinka2011PRR7). The protein is highly conserved across species, with more than 94% amino acid identity among placental mammals (Hrdinka2011PRR7).

PRR7 contains a potential submembrane palmitoylation motif (CCXC) and is palmitoylated, associating with lipid rafts and large detergent-resistant complexes (Hrdinka2011PRR7). The protein is also a substrate for Src family kinases, indicating phosphorylation as a post-translational modification (Hrdinka2011PRR7). The region between amino acids 159-171, particularly involving Tyr-166, is critical for apoptosis induction (Hrdinka2011PRR7). PRR7's structure includes a putative lysine and arginine-rich nuclear localization sequence, suggesting its ability to translocate to the nucleus (Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear).

## Function
PRR7 (proline rich 7, synaptic) is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of synaptic signaling and neuronal communication. It plays a crucial role in maintaining synaptic balance and plasticity, which are essential for neural circuit development and function. PRR7 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it is associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD) and interacts with synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and NMDA receptors (Lee2018Reciprocal; Murata2005Proteomic).

PRR7 functions as a Wnt inhibitor, regulating excitatory synapse numbers by inducing the removal of these synapses through exosomal secretion. This process is activity-dependent and involves the activation of GSK3β and the proteasomal degradation of PSD proteins (Lee2018Reciprocal). PRR7 also acts as a synaptonuclear messenger, linking NMDA receptor activity to c-Jun-dependent transcription by inhibiting c-Jun ubiquitination. This regulation is crucial for cellular viability and is linked to the prevention of excitotoxicity (Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear).

In T cells, PRR7 is involved in the regulation of T cell receptor signaling and apoptosis, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Hrdinka2011PRR7).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PRR7 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. PRR7 is involved in synaptic regulation and its dysregulation can affect synaptic plasticity, which is crucial for cognitive functions. Aberrant regulation of PRR7 has been linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, where it plays a role in maintaining synaptic balance (Lee2018Reciprocal). 

In the context of excitotoxicity, PRR7 is associated with NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal death. Overexpression of PRR7 in neurons can lead to increased cell death, while its knockdown has been shown to reduce excitotoxic responses, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role (Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear). This mechanism is particularly relevant in neurodegenerative diseases where excitotoxicity is a contributing factor (Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear).

PRR7 is also involved in the regulation of synaptic proteins and signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling, which are critical for synapse modification and elimination. Dysregulation of these pathways can contribute to synaptic imbalances observed in various neurological conditions (Lee2018Reciprocal). The gene's role in these processes highlights its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating neurological disorders.

## Interactions
PRR7 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of T cell receptor signaling and synaptic function. In T cells, PRR7 interacts with Src family kinases (SFKs) through SH3 domain binding, which is crucial for its role in T cell receptor signaling and apoptosis. This interaction leads to reduced phosphorylation of key signaling molecules, such as ZAP-70 and LAT, and a decrease in Lck levels, a major SFK in T cells (Hrdinka2011PRR7).

In neurons, PRR7 is associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD) and interacts with PSD-95, a synaptic scaffolding protein, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is important for PRR7's role in synaptic signaling and the modulation of neural activities (Murata2005Proteomic). PRR7 also binds to NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B, suggesting its involvement in NMDA receptor-mediated signaling (Murata2005Proteomic).

PRR7 forms a complex with c-Jun and the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7, inhibiting c-Jun ubiquitination and regulating c-Jun-dependent transcription. This interaction is facilitated by a phosphodegron motif in PRR7, which suggests a direct interaction with FBW7 (Kravchick2016Synaptonuclear). PRR7's interactions with these proteins highlight its multifaceted role in both immune and neural signaling pathways.
