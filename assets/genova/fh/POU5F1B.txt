# POU5F1B

## Overview
POU5F1B is a gene that encodes the protein POU class 5 homeobox 1B, which is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including oncogenesis. The protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. POU5F1B is a human-specific oncogene that has been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer. The protein encoded by POU5F1B interacts with multiple cellular components, including E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases and receptor tyrosine kinases, influencing intracellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics. These interactions contribute to its role in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, highlighting its significance as a potential target for cancer therapy (SimóRiudalbas2022Transposonactivated; SimóRiudalbas2023POU5F1Bis).

## Clinical Significance
The POU5F1B gene is implicated in the progression of several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastric cancer (GC). In HCC, POU5F1B is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, with higher expression levels correlating with poorer patient prognosis. This overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation by activating the AKT signaling pathway, leading to increased cell growth and reduced levels of cell cycle inhibitors (Pan2018POU5F1B).

In CRC, POU5F1B is activated by an intronic enhancer, LTR66, and is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. Its expression is linked to poorer overall and relapse-free survival, making it a negative prognostic marker. POU5F1B influences signaling pathways and cytoskeletal rearrangements, enhancing cell migration and metastasis (SimóRiudalbas2022Transposonactivated).

In GC, POU5F1B is frequently amplified and overexpressed, contributing to an aggressive cancer phenotype. It enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis while inhibiting apoptosis. POU5F1B amplification is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in advanced stages of the disease, and often occurs alongside MYC amplification, suggesting a cooperative role in promoting tumorigenicity (Hayashi2013The).

## Interactions
POU5F1B, a human-specific oncogene, participates in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cancer progression. It interacts with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases UBR5 and RNF213, which are involved in its ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that affects its stability and localization (SimóRiudalbas2023POU5F1Bis). POU5F1B also interacts with receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2 and its associated proteins, including MST1R, RIN1, and SORL1, which are involved in signal transduction pathways (SimóRiudalbas2022Transposonactivated). These interactions suggest a role in modulating intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements, promoting oncogenic effects (SimóRiudalbas2022Transposonactivated).

The protein is enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), where it influences the distribution of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules, enhancing cell adhesion and migration (SimóRiudalbas2023POU5F1Bis). POU5F1B's interaction with integrins, such as ITGB1, ITGA2, and ITGAV, is crucial for the formation of focal adhesions, which are important for cancer cell migration and metastasis (SimóRiudalbas2023POU5F1Bis). These interactions highlight POU5F1B's role in restructuring membrane nanodomains and influencing the cell surface proteome, which are key processes in cancer progression.
