# QDPR

## Overview
The QDPR gene encodes the enzyme quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, a crucial component in the metabolic pathway responsible for the recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. This enzyme, categorized as a reductase, facilitates the conversion of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (BH2) back to BH4, utilizing NADH as a cofactor. The proper function of QDPR is vital for maintaining normal levels of neurotransmitters and preventing neurological disorders. Mutations in the QDPR gene can lead to dihydropteridine reductase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of neurological symptoms due to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis (Breuer2019QDPR; Himmelreich2021Molecular). The enzyme's structural features, including its Rossman fold and homodimeric quaternary structure, are integral to its function and interaction with other proteins within metabolic pathways (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine).

## Structure
The QDPR gene encodes the enzyme quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin. The enzyme is characterized by a primary structure consisting of a specific sequence of amino acids, which forms the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of QDPR includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine).

The tertiary structure of QDPR results in a three-dimensional conformation essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure facilitates the alignment of the reduced nicotinamide ring to enable hydride transfer to the pteridine substrate, a mechanism common to other reductases (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine). The enzyme forms homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, which is stabilized by a four-helix bundle motif (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine).

QDPR contains a Rossman fold, a structural motif that is crucial for NADH binding, highlighting its specificity for this cofactor over NADPH (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine). The enzyme's active site is formed upon NADH binding, involving specific connecting loops and a conserved Tyr 146 XXX Lys 150 motif, which is important for proton donation during the reduction process (Whiteley1993Dihydropteridine).

## Function
The QDPR gene encodes the enzyme dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), which is crucial for the recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in healthy human cells. BH4 is an essential cofactor for the hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, which are critical for the biosynthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin (Breuer2019QDPR; Himmelreich2021Molecular). 

DHPR facilitates the conversion of quinonoid dihydrobiopterin (BH2) back to BH4 using NADH, maintaining the availability of BH4 for enzymatic reactions (Breuer2019QDPR). This process is vital for the normal functioning of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis (Foroozani2015Molecular). 

In the cellular context, DHPR is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in maintaining normal neurological function by ensuring adequate levels of neurotransmitters (Breuer2019QDPR). The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing hyperphenylalaninemia and associated neurological disorders (Himmelreich2021Molecular). The QDPR gene's function is essential for proper neurotransmitter synthesis and neural function, highlighting its importance in cell biology and organismal health (Himmelreich2021Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the QDPR gene, which encodes the enzyme quinoid dihydropteridine reductase, are associated with dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition leads to impaired regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. As a result, patients may experience a range of neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia, dystonia, microcephaly, and brain atrophy (Breuer2019QDPR; Thöny2006Mutations). 

The clinical severity of DHPR deficiency is attributed to the accumulation of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which inhibits aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, leading to low levels of L-Dopa and 5-OH-tryptophan, and potentially affecting neural development (Thöny2006Mutations). In some cases, specific mutations such as G151S and F212C are associated with a milder form of the disease, primarily affecting serotonin metabolism (Thöny2006Mutations).

In addition to neurological symptoms, DHPR deficiency can result in hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), a condition characterized by elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, which can further contribute to neurological impairment if untreated (VelaAmieva2022Genotypic). Treatment typically involves dietary restriction of phenylalanine and supplementation with neurotransmitter precursors (Breuer2019QDPR).

## Interactions
Quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within metabolic pathways. QDPR is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes KYAT1, ALDH1A1, and THOP1, forming a network involved in various metabolic pathways. These interactions are significant in the context of liver function and metabolic disorders, as demonstrated in studies on hepatic steatosis in Prader-Willi syndrome (Pascut2023Proteome). 

QDPR also interacts with NAD(P)(H) binding proteins, showing specificity for various forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzymes. It is one of the proteins that interact with all four forms of NAD(P)(H), indicating its role in redox reactions and metabolic processes (Lim2018An). 

In the context of Leishmania braziliensis, QDPR is part of a tandem array with ORFq and β7-proteasome, which complicates selective deletion. RNA interference studies have shown that QDPR knockdown leads to increased sensitivity to antifolate compounds, suggesting its involvement in the reduced pteridine pathways and its potential role in modulating drug sensitivity (Lye2022An). These interactions highlight QDPR's multifaceted role in metabolic and regulatory processes.
