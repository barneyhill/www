# EIF4G3

## Overview
EIF4G3 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 3 (eIF4GII), a pivotal protein involved in the initiation of mRNA translation. As a component of the eIF4F complex, eIF4GII functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of other translation factors necessary for the recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA. This protein is characterized by its HEAT repeats and MIF4G domains, which are crucial for its interactions with other initiation factors and the stabilization of the translation initiation complex. eIF4GII plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, spermatogenesis, and immune response, by influencing the translation of specific mRNAs. Its activity is regulated through post-translational modifications and the existence of different splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity. The protein's involvement in translation initiation underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease contexts (Moura2015Two; Yip2012Reduced; Bezerra2022Distinct).

## Structure
EIF4G3, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 3, is a protein integral to the initiation of mRNA translation. It is a component of the eIF4F complex, which plays a crucial role in recruiting ribosomes to mRNA. The molecular structure of EIF4G3 includes multiple domains that facilitate its function. Notably, it contains HEAT repeats and MIF4G domains. These domains are essential for interactions with other initiation factors, contributing to the assembly and stability of the translation initiation complex.

The HEAT repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions, providing a scaffold for the binding of other proteins. The MIF4G domains are critical for the interaction with other components of the eIF4F complex, enhancing the recruitment of ribosomes to the mRNA. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of EIF4G3, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its role in translation initiation.

EIF4G3 may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity. These variants can lead to differences in the protein's interaction capabilities and regulatory mechanisms, allowing for a range of functional outcomes in the translation initiation process.

## Function
EIF4G3 encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4GII, which is a crucial component of the pre-initiation complex involved in the initiation of mRNA translation. This protein acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of other translation factors, including eIF4E and the poly-A binding protein (PABP), which bind to the 5' cap and poly-A tail of the mRNA strand, respectively. This interaction is thought to circularize the mRNA, ensuring efficient re-initiation of translation by 40S ribosomal subunits released from 80S ribosomes at the mRNA stop codon (Yip2012Reduced).

eIF4GII is particularly important for the translation of pre-existing mRNA transcripts and is selectively recruited during specific cellular processes such as cell differentiation and spermatogenesis. It is also involved in the translation of genes crucial for antigen presentation in lymph node stromal cells, which play a role in immune tolerance (Yip2012Reduced). In healthy cells, eIF4GII is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions by facilitating the translation of specific mRNAs, impacting processes like cell growth, proliferation, and response to cellular stress (Yip2012Reduced). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the translation of specific mRNAs, affecting various cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
EIF4G3 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in translation initiation and cell proliferation. In the context of sarcomas, high expression of EIF4G3 is associated with a worse prognosis. It is negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells, which are linked to better outcomes. EIF4G3 is also positively correlated with tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy response (Qin2023Identification).

In type 1 diabetes (T1D), reduced expression of EIF4G3 is observed in the pancreatic lymph nodes of both NOD mice and human patients. This downregulation is associated with decreased DEAF1 function, affecting the translation of genes involved in antigen presentation and potentially contributing to autoimmune responses (Yip2012Reduced).

In T. brucei, EIF4G3 is essential for protein synthesis and cell growth. Its knockdown results in significant inhibition of these processes, highlighting its critical role in translation initiation. This suggests that alterations in EIF4G3 expression or function could impact cellular viability and proliferation (Moura2015Two).

## Interactions
EIF4G3, a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, engages in several critical protein interactions essential for translation initiation. In trypanosomatids, EIF4G3 interacts with EIF4AI, a homolog of eIF4A, through its MIF4G domain, which is crucial for this binding. Mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction (Moura2015Two). EIF4G3 also binds specifically to EIF4E4, another eIF4E homologue, and this interaction is mediated by conserved motifs in the N-terminal region of EIF4G3. Mutations in these motifs, such as the FSL motif, impair binding to EIF4E4 (Moura2015Two).

EIF4G3 forms a complex with EIF4E4, PABP1, and RBP23, resembling the canonical eIF4F complex found in metazoans. This complex is involved in translation initiation and is associated with ribosomal protein mRNAs (Bezerra2022Distinct). EIF4G3 also co-precipitates with several translation initiation factors, including EIF1A and eIF3 subunits, indicating its broader role in translation initiation processes (Bezerra2022Distinct). These interactions highlight the functional differentiation of EIF4G3 in translation regulation, particularly in the context of trypanosomatid organisms.
