# DYRK2

## Overview
DYRK2 is a gene that encodes the protein dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2, which is a member of the CMGC group of kinases. This protein is characterized by its ability to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, a feature that underpins its classification as a dual-specificity kinase (Wei2022Selective; CorreaSáez2020Updating). The DYRK2 protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, muscle differentiation, and neurite development. It functions as a scaffold protein in the E3 ligase complex, contributing to genomic stability and telomere maintenance (CorreaSáez2020Updating). Additionally, DYRK2 is involved in modulating transcription factors and signaling pathways, such as apoptosis and Sonic hedgehog signaling, through its kinase activity (CorreaSáez2020Updating). The gene's expression and activity have significant implications in cancer biology, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Yan2016Low; Taira2012DYRK2).

## Structure
DYRK2 is a protein kinase that belongs to the CMGC group of kinases, characterized by its dual-specificity kinase domain capable of phosphorylating serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (Wei2022Selective; CorreaSáez2020Updating). The primary structure of DYRK2 includes a conserved kinase domain and a DYRK-homology box (DH box), which is essential for its tertiary structure formation (CorreaSáez2020Updating). The secondary structure of DYRK2 typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its bilobal kinase fold, a common feature in the tertiary structure of kinases (Wei2022Selective).

DYRK2 contains a kinase domain spanning residues 222-535, which includes critical sites such as the active site Asp348 and the ATP binding site Lys251 (CorreaSáez2020Updating). The protein also features a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that facilitates its translocation into the nucleus (CorreaSáez2020Updating). Post-translational modifications of DYRK2 include phosphorylation by ATM kinase and regulation by MDM2 ubiquitin ligase, which influence its interaction with p53 (CorreaSáez2020Updating).

DYRK2 has six identified splice variants, with isoform 2 being the most commonly referenced. The DYRK2-203 transcript encodes a 528 amino acid protein, while DYRK2-202 encodes a 601 amino acid protein with a larger N terminus (CorreaSáez2020Updating).

## Function
DYRK2 is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the G2/M phase, by acting as a scaffold protein in the E3 ligase complex. This function is essential for genomic stability and telomere maintenance, as DYRK2 phosphorylates substrates like katanin p60 and TERT, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (CorreaSáez2020Updating). DYRK2 also acts as a priming kinase for GSK3β, facilitating the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of proteins such as c-Myc and c-Jun, which are important for cell cycle control (Becker2012Emerging).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, DYRK2 is involved in muscle differentiation and modulates axonal and dendritic neurite development by phosphorylating NDEL1, affecting F-actin dynamics (CorreaSáez2020Updating). It also influences transcription factors such as NFAT, p53, and Gli2, and is involved in pathways like apoptosis and Sonic hedgehog signaling (CorreaSáez2020Updating). DYRK2's activity is modulated by its phosphorylation status, which affects its stability, kinase activity, and substrate specificity (LaraChica2021A).

## Clinical Significance
DYRK2 plays a significant role in cancer biology, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. In colorectal cancer (CRC), low expression of DYRK2 is associated with advanced clinical stages and poorer prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. DYRK2 inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its depletion leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, which are linked to metastasis (Yan2016Low).

In breast cancer, DYRK2 is downregulated in invasive tissues, correlating with increased levels of oncogenes such as c-Jun and c-Myc, which promote tumor progression. DYRK2 functions as a priming kinase for GSK3β, necessary for the degradation of these oncogenes, and its loss leads to their stabilization and increased expression (Taira2012DYRK2).

DYRK2 expression varies across different cancer types, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in some cancers like esophageal carcinoma and kidney chromophobe, while low expression is associated with poor outcomes in others, such as colorectal and liver cancers. Genetic alterations and methylation of DYRK2 also play roles in cancer development and prognosis (Qiu2022A).

## Interactions
DYRK2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It physically interacts with HSF1, a transcription factor, by phosphorylating it at serine residues S320 and S326, which is crucial for HSF1 activation. This interaction is enhanced under proteotoxic stress conditions, and specific binding regions on DYRK2, identified as BR1 and BR2, are essential for this interaction (Moreno2020The).

DYRK2 also interacts with CDC25A, a cell cycle regulator. It phosphorylates CDC25A, leading to its degradation, which is necessary for cell cycle progression. This interaction is kinase-dependent, and DYRK2's activity is modulated by its autophosphorylation status (LaraChica2021A).

In the context of hypoxia, DYRK2 interacts with SIAH2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which leads to DYRK2 degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction involves multiple domains of SIAH2, including the N-terminal and zinc-finger domains (Pérez2012Mutual).

DYRK2 modulates the protein levels of FBXW7, a tumor suppressor, in a kinase activity-dependent manner. This interaction affects FBXW7 isoforms post-transcriptionally, highlighting DYRK2's role in protein stability regulation (Jiménez-Izquierdo2023FBXW7).
