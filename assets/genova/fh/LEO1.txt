# LEO1

## Overview
The LEO1 gene encodes the LEO1 homolog, a protein that is a critical component of the Paf1/RNA polymerase II complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. As a conserved subunit of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), LEO1 plays a significant role in transcription elongation, chromatin remodeling, and gene regulation, impacting cellular processes such as differentiation and quiescence (Laurent2023LEO1). The protein is characterized by its structural interactions within the Paf1 complex, forming a heterodimer with Paf1 and contributing to the complex's stability and function (Chu2013Structural). LEO1's involvement in histone modifications and chromatin state modulation underscores its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression (Verrier2015Global). Clinically, mutations in the LEO1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Brandler2017Paternally; Weckhuysen2024Burden).

## Structure
The LEO1 protein is a component of the Paf1 complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by associating with RNA polymerase II. Structurally, LEO1 forms a heterodimer with Paf1 through antiparallel beta-sheet interactions, which are essential for its function within the Paf1 complex (Chu2013Structural). The LEO1 segment in the heterodimer consists of one alpha-helix and six beta-strands, contributing to a butterfly-shaped structure when combined with the Paf1 segment (Chu2013Structural). 

The interaction between LEO1 and Paf1 is stabilized by multiple main-chain hydrogen bonds and an ionic bond between specific residues, highlighting the importance of these interactions for the structural integrity of the Paf1/Leo1 subcomplex (Chu2013Structural). LEO1 is also involved in binding to histone H3, with specific regions being crucial for this interaction, indicating its role in recognizing substrates during PAF1C-coordinated histone modifications (Chu2013Structural).

LEO1 is part of a high-molecular-mass complex, approximately 1.7 MDa, which includes other components such as Pol II, Paf1, and Cdc73, but not Srb5 (Mueller2002Ctr9). This association underscores its role in the transcriptional machinery.

## Function
The LEO1 gene encodes a protein that is a conserved subunit of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C), which is associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a significant role in transcription elongation and RNA processing in human cells (Laurent2023LEO1). LEO1 is crucial for the efficient entry into quiescence, a reversible state of cell cycle arrest, in human fibroblasts. It regulates gene expression and maintains low levels of H3K9me2, a histone modification associated with gene silencing, during quiescence (Laurent2023LEO1). In the absence of LEO1, there is a misregulation of genes, with significant changes in the expression of genes involved in processes such as neuron death, transition metal ion transport, angiogenesis, sterol biosynthesis, and cell motility (Laurent2023LEO1).

LEO1 also influences chromatin structure, as its knockout leads to increased levels of H3K9me2 in many genomic regions, affecting gene expression (Laurent2023LEO1). This protein is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, impacting cellular differentiation and maintaining normal cell morphology under serum deprivation conditions (Laurent2023LEO1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LEO1 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and developmental delay. Studies have identified de novo and inherited variants in LEO1 associated with these conditions, highlighting its role as a novel disease gene in NDDs (Weckhuysen2024Burden). Specifically, two paternally inherited deletions of the LEO1 promoter were found in patients with ASD, suggesting a significant contribution to the disorder's etiology (Weckhuysen2024Burden).

Research has shown that noncoding structural variants (SVs) affecting LEO1 are recurrent in individuals with ASD. These mutations disrupt an upstream regulatory element crucial for transcription, potentially impacting gene regulation and contributing to ASD (Brandler2017Paternally). The expression of LEO1 and its neighboring gene MAPK6 was found to be higher in fibroblast cell lines from deletion carriers, indicating a possible alteration in gene regulation linked to ASD (Brandler2017Paternally).

The identification of LEO1 as a risk gene for autism and intellectual disability underscores the importance of re-analysis in improving diagnostic yield and understanding the genetic basis of NDDs (Weckhuysen2024Burden).

## Interactions
LEO1 is a component of the Paf1 complex (PAFc), which is associated with RNA polymerase II and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Within the Paf1 complex, LEO1 interacts with other core components such as Paf1, Ctr9 (Tpr1), Rtf1 (Prf1), and Cdc73. These interactions are crucial for the complex's function in transcription elongation and histone modifications, including H3K36 trimethylation and H2B monoubiquitination (Verrier2015Global; Mueller2002Ctr9).

LEO1 is also involved in modulating chromatin states by promoting histone turnover, which affects chromatin stability and heterochromatin spreading. It interacts with the histone acetyltransferase Mst1, facilitating H4K16 acetylation, although a direct interaction has not been detected. This recruitment might be mediated through other proteins or chromatin modifications (Verrier2015Global).

LEO1's role extends to RNA interactions, as it is necessary for the Paf1 complex's interaction with RNA and nucleosomes in vitro. This interaction is suggested to be involved in the recruitment of the Paf1 complex to chromatin via RNA interactions, particularly at the IRC boundary element, which is transcribed into a non-coding RNA (Verrier2015Global).
