# CTAGE6

## Overview
The CTAGE6 gene encodes the protein CTAGE family member 6, which is part of the CTAGE (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen) family. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. CTAGE family member 6 is characterized by its involvement in intracellular transport and may play a role in the secretory pathway, given its structural features that suggest a transmembrane localization. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of tumor antigenicity and immune response modulation. Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional dynamics and clinical relevance of CTAGE6 in human health and disease.
