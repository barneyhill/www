# CD163

## Overview
CD163 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein, which functions as a scavenger receptor primarily expressed on monocytes and macrophages. The CD163 protein is characterized by its nine extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are crucial for its role in the immune system. This receptor is involved in the clearance of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes, thereby preventing oxidative stress and inflammation. It also plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and promoting tissue repair by facilitating the uptake and degradation of these complexes within macrophages. The expression of CD163 is regulated by various cytokines, and its soluble form, sCD163, serves as a biomarker for macrophage activation in several inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Due to its involvement in immune regulation, CD163 is considered a potential therapeutic target for modulating inflammation (Kowal2011CD163; Etzerodt2013CD163; Ferreira2020CD163).

## Structure
CD163 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by nine extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains of type B. These domains are separated by a proline-serine-threonine (PST) rich polypeptide of about 35 amino acids (Van2010Scavenger). The SRCR domains have a compact fold with a curved six/seven-stranded β-sheet cradling an α-helix, and are characterized by 6 or 8 cysteine residues, resulting in a typical disulphide linkage pattern (Van2010Scavenger; Etzerodt2013CD163). The SRCR domains are followed by a short PST linker domain that connects to a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic tail (Van2010Scavenger).

The cytoplasmic tail undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms with different tail lengths, with the most common form having a 49 amino acid tail (Van2010Scavenger). CD163 is heavily glycosylated, mainly with N-linked glycans, as indicated by a reduction in molecular weight after endoglycosidase F treatment (Van2010Scavenger; Kowal2011CD163). The observed mass of human CD163 is 110 kDa under non-reducing conditions and 130 kDa under reducing conditions (Van2010Scavenger). The protein also exists in a soluble form, which includes most of the extracellular part of the membrane-bound form, including all SRCR domains (Kowal2011CD163).

## Function
CD163 is a scavenger receptor primarily expressed on monocytes and macrophages, playing a significant role in the regulation of inflammation and immune response. It is involved in the clearance of hemoglobin-haptoglobin (Hb-Hp) complexes, which are formed during hemolysis. This process prevents oxidative stress and inflammation by internalizing these complexes, leading to the release of anti-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and carbon monoxide (CO) (Etzerodt2013CD163; Kowal2011CD163). The binding of CD163 to Hb-Hp complexes triggers the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), aiding in the clearance of hemoglobin and providing protection against inflammation (Kowal2011CD163).

CD163 is also involved in the endocytic pathway, facilitating the uptake and degradation of these complexes within macrophages, which results in the production of anti-inflammatory metabolites like biliverdin and CO (Etzerodt2013CD163). The receptor's expression is associated with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, and it is upregulated by anti-inflammatory mediators such as glucocorticoids and IL-10, while being inhibited by pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-gamma (Kowal2011CD163). CD163's role in immune regulation and tissue repair highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating inflammation (Ferreira2020CD163).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD163 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CD163 expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, but higher expression correlates with negative prognostic factors such as invasion, metastasis, and reduced survival rates. This suggests that CD163 could serve as a biomarker for tumor progression and prognosis in CRC (Ma2022CD163). 

In inflammatory diseases, CD163 expression is influenced by cytokines, with anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10 increasing its expression, while inflammatory stimuli such as IL-4, TNF-α, and LPS decrease it (Skytthe2020Targeting). CD163 is upregulated in conditions like septic shock, where it plays a protective role by modulating inflammatory responses. CD163-deficient mice show increased mortality in endotoxin shock due to heightened inflammatory cytokine production (Fujiwara2020CD163).

Soluble CD163 (sCD163), a form of the receptor shed from the cell surface, serves as a biomarker for macrophage activation and is elevated in diseases such as sepsis, liver diseases, and metabolic conditions like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Zhi2017Clinical; Etzerodt2013CD163). Elevated sCD163 levels are also linked to inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (Etzerodt2013CD163).

## Interactions
CD163 is a scavenger receptor that participates in several significant protein interactions. It is well-known for its high-affinity binding to hemoglobin-haptoglobin (HbHp) complexes, a process that is calcium-dependent and involves the third scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain. This interaction facilitates the internalization of HbHp complexes, which is crucial for preventing oxidative stress and inflammation (Van2010Scavenger; Kowal2011CD163).

CD163 also interacts with the tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), a cytokine in the TNF superfamily. This interaction occurs through multiple sites across eight of the nine SRCR domains of CD163, including the HbHp recognition site. The binding of TWEAK to CD163 results in its internalization and degradation, suggesting that CD163 acts as a scavenger receptor for TWEAK, modulating its biological effects (Van2010Scavenger; Akahori2015CD163).

Additionally, CD163 binds to HMGB1-haptoglobin complexes, enhancing the endocytic uptake of these complexes and promoting anti-inflammatory responses, such as increased IL-10 secretion (Yang2016Identification). CD163 also interacts with various pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, playing a role in immune response modulation (Etzerodt2013CD163).
