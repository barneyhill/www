# MRPS23

## Overview
MRPS23 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ribosome's small 28S subunit. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPS23 is involved in the early assembly of the mitoribosomal small subunit, a critical step for mitochondrial translation and the electron transport chain, which are vital for cellular respiration and metabolism (Correia2024Quantitative). Beyond its primary role in mitochondrial protein synthesis, MRPS23 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including tumorigenic pathways, through its interactions with proteins such as RIPK3 and p53 (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). Alterations in MRPS23 expression have been associated with several diseases, including mitochondrial disorders and various cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Ittiwut2023Genetic; Pu2017High).

## Function
MRPS23 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the small 28S subunit. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). The MRPS23 protein is involved in the early assembly of the mitoribosomal small subunit (mtSSU), a critical step for mitochondrial translation and the electron transport chain, which are vital for cellular respiration and overall cellular metabolism (Correia2024Quantitative).

In healthy human cells, MRPS23 is part of the mitochondrial translation machinery, ensuring the proper synthesis of proteins required for mitochondrial function. This process is integral to maintaining the efficiency of the electron transport chain, which is necessary for ATP production and energy supply in cells (Cheong2020Expression). The protein's activity is localized within the mitochondria, where it contributes to the assembly and function of the mitoribosome, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Correia2024Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MRPS23 gene have been implicated in several diseases. A homozygous variant, c.119C>T; p.P40L, in MRPS23 is associated with a mitochondrial disorder characterized by symptoms such as altered consciousness, recurrent vomiting, delayed growth and development, hearing impairment, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and liver dysfunction. This disorder is particularly noted in individuals of Hmong hill tribe descent and is linked to deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and IV (Ittiwut2023Genetic).

In cancer, high expression of MRPS23 is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to increased cell proliferation and is linked to poor survival outcomes. MRPS23 overexpression correlates with larger tumor size and advanced tumor stages, making it a potential prognostic marker for HCC (Pu2017High). Similarly, MRPS23 is upregulated in breast cancer, where it is involved in tumorigenic processes and may interact with proteins involved in aerobic metabolism (Oviya2021Mitochondrial).

MRPS23 expression alterations have also been linked to cervical cancer, where it correlates with lymph node metastasis, and breast cancer, where gene amplification is associated with increased proliferation (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). These findings suggest that MRPS23 plays a significant role in both mitochondrial disorders and cancer progression.

## Interactions
MRPS23, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that may influence its role in tumorigenic processes. In breast cancer, MRPS23 has been shown to interact with several proteins, including RIPK3, a kinase involved in necroptosis, and p53, a well-known tumor suppressor protein. The interaction with RIPK3 was validated and demonstrated a moderately positive correlation in co-expression, suggesting a potential role in cell death pathways (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). The interaction with p53 was confirmed through GST pulldown assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating MRPS23's involvement in cancer-linked cellular pathways (Oviya2021Mitochondrial).

MRPS23 also interacts with proteins localized in different cellular compartments, such as the nucleus. It has been found to interact with nuclear proteins like CDK11 and NPAS2, and subcellular localization analysis indicated that MRPS23 can localize to the nuclear membrane (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). These interactions suggest that MRPS23 may have extraribosomal functions, potentially influencing processes beyond mitochondrial protein synthesis.

The study of MRPS23's interactions highlights its potential role in various cellular processes, including those related to cancer, and suggests that it may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions in tumorigenic pathways (Oviya2021Mitochondrial).
