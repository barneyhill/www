# FGF21

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast growth factor 21, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family. This protein functions as an endocrine hormone with significant roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as energy homeostasis. Unlike other fibroblast growth factors, FGF21 lacks a heparin-binding domain, which allows it to circulate systemically and exert its effects on distant tissues (Jung2023Heatingmediated). The protein is primarily produced in the liver and acts on various tissues, including adipose tissue and the central nervous system, to influence metabolic processes such as glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity, and thermogenesis (Fisher2016Understanding; Kharitonenkov2005FGF21). FGF21's activity is mediated through its interaction with the β-Klotho co-receptor, which is essential for its tissue-specific effects (Lewis2019Going). The gene and its encoded protein have garnered interest for their potential therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Falamarzi2022The; Keuper2019Circulating).

## Structure
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is characterized by a unique structural motif known as the β-trefoil fold, which is common among fibroblast growth factors. This fold consists of 12 β-strands forming six two-stranded β-hairpins arranged in a pseudo three-fold symmetry, creating a barrel structure capped by a triangular top (Jung2023Heatingmediated). A distinctive feature of FGF21 is its additional C-terminal loop, comprising approximately 30 residues, which is crucial for its interaction with co-receptors such as β-Klotho (Jung2023Heatingmediated). This loop is essential for forming a ternary complex with FGF receptors (FGFRs) and β-Klotho, necessary for FGF21's endocrine function (Jung2023Heatingmediated).

FGF21 lacks a heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) binding site, distinguishing it from other FGFs and allowing it to function in an endocrine manner (Jung2023Heatingmediated). The protein's thermal stability is attributed to its β10-β12 loop, which contains a high proportion of proline residues, contributing to its resistance to thermal denaturation (Jung2023Heatingmediated). The C-terminal loop is susceptible to proteolytic degradation, posing challenges for clinical applications (Jung2023Heatingmediated).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone primarily produced in the liver, playing a significant role in regulating metabolism. It is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, influencing processes such as glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. FGF21 acts on adipose tissue, where it promotes glucose uptake through the upregulation of the glucose transporter GLUT1, independent of insulin action (Kharitonenkov2005FGF21). It also induces thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue by activating uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and other thermogenic genes, contributing to increased energy expenditure and weight loss (Fisher2016Understanding).

FGF21 is involved in the adaptive response to fasting and nutrient deprivation, facilitating metabolic adaptations such as lipolysis and ketogenesis. It is a downstream target of PPARα, activated during fasting and ketogenic diets, and plays a role in fatty acid oxidation and ketosis (Fisher2016Understanding). In the central nervous system, FGF21 influences food preferences and reward behavior by acting on dopaminergic neurons, potentially reducing sugar intake and preventing negative metabolic effects like obesity and type 2 diabetes (Xie2017Fibroblast). FGF21's activity is mediated through its interaction with the β-klotho co-receptor, which determines tissue specificity and sensitivity (Lewis2019Going).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FGF21 gene are associated with several metabolic and liver-related diseases. Elevated levels of FGF21 are observed in conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), often as a compensatory response to metabolic stress (Falamarzi2022The; Keuper2019Circulating). In obesity, FGF21 levels correlate with body mass index (BMI) and fat mass, and are higher in metabolically unhealthy obesity compared to metabolically healthy obesity (Keuper2019Circulating). 

In liver diseases, FGF21 plays a significant role in modulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, which are crucial in slowing the progression of NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Falamarzi2022The). FGF21 levels are also elevated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where they may contribute to growth retardation and bone disorders (Xie2020FGF/FGFR). 

FGF21 is implicated in mitochondrial disorders, where its levels are elevated in response to mitochondrial dysfunction, making it a potential biomarker for such conditions (Sun2021Skeletal). In colorectal cancer, FGF21 expression is higher in polyps than in cancerous tissues, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Rejali2023Mixed).

## Interactions
FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) is involved in several interactions that influence its function in metabolic regulation and osteogenesis. In the context of osteogenesis, FGF21 enhances the activity of bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) by up-regulating BMP-2-dependent Smad signaling pathways, specifically Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, which is crucial for osteogenic differentiation. This interaction does not involve the p44/42 MAPK pathway, indicating a selective enhancement of BMP-2 signaling by FGF21 (Ishida2013Interactions).

FGF21 also interacts with the CCR4-NOT complex, particularly through its subunit CNOT6L, which regulates the stability of Fgf21 mRNA. The CCR4-NOT complex, in association with the RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP), promotes the degradation of Fgf21 mRNA by targeting AU-rich elements in its 3' untranslated region. This interaction is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as it modulates the levels of FGF21 in response to metabolic cues such as feeding (Morita2019Hepatic).

These interactions highlight the dual role of FGF21 in both metabolic regulation and bone tissue engineering, suggesting its potential therapeutic applications in metabolic disorders and skeletal health.
