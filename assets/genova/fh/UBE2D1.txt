# UBE2D1

## Overview
UBE2D1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1, a crucial component of the ubiquitination pathway, which is involved in protein degradation and regulation within cells. As a member of the E2 enzyme family, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1 plays a pivotal role in transferring ubiquitin from the E1 activating enzyme to the substrate, often in conjunction with an E3 ligase, thereby tagging proteins for proteasomal degradation. This enzyme is characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins involved in the ubiquitination process (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, and has been associated with the regulation of AMPA receptors and cholesterol homeostasis (Zhang2011The; Ghilarducci2021Functional). Clinically, UBE2D1 is significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with cancer progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Mu2024Aberrant; Zhou2018Gain).

## Structure
UBE2D1, a member of the UBE2D family, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process. The primary structure of UBE2D1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (RomanTrufero2022The). This domain contains the active site cysteine crucial for its function (RomanTrufero2022The).

The secondary structure of UBE2D1 is characterized by four α-helical and four β-sheet regions, which are typical features of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (RomanTrufero2022The). These structural elements contribute to the enzyme's ability to interact with other proteins, such as E1 and E3 enzymes, facilitating the ubiquitination process (RomanTrufero2022The).

In terms of tertiary structure, UBE2D1 can form a closed 'active' configuration when bound to an E3 enzyme, which is necessary for its function in ubiquitination (RomanTrufero2022The). The quaternary structure involves interactions with RING E3 ligases, where the RING domains bind to specific sites on UBE2D1, involving residues from structured loops and β-strands (Meghan2022Review).

UBE2D1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination itself, which can regulate its activity and interactions (Garg2020Structural).

## Function
UBE2D1 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation in cells. It is involved in the initial monoubiquitination of substrates, a necessary step for subsequent polyubiquitination, which tags proteins for degradation by the proteasome (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (RomanTrufero2022The).

In the context of AMPA receptor regulation, UBE2D1 initiates the ubiquitination of the GluA2 subunit, which is crucial for AMPAR trafficking and function in neuronal cells (Ghilarducci2021Functional). UBE2D1 also plays a role in the ubiquitination of the LDL receptor (LDLR), partnering with the E3 ligase IDOL to regulate cholesterol homeostasis (Zhang2011The). Additionally, UBE2D1 is involved in the ubiquitination of the E3 ligase March-I, which is important for immune function by regulating MHC-II and CD86 expression on antigen-presenting cells (Lei2018Ubiquitinconjugating). These activities highlight UBE2D1's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2D1 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common and deadly form of liver cancer. The gene is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared to noncancerous hepatic tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Zhou2018Gain). High expression levels of UBE2D1 correlate with reduced overall survival in HCC patients, making it a prognostic predictor (Mu2024Aberrant; Zhou2018Gain). UBE2D1 promotes HCC growth by decreasing p53 levels through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway, which facilitates tumor growth (Zhou2018Gain).

UBE2D1 is also associated with chemoresistance in HCC. Overexpression of UBE2D1 reduces the efficacy of chemotherapy agents like cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil by enhancing cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis (Mu2024Aberrant). The interaction between miR-101 and UBE2D1 is significant, as miR-101 can suppress UBE2D1 expression, thereby increasing DNA damage and enhancing chemosensitivity (Mu2024Aberrant). These findings suggest that UBE2D1 expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Mu2024Aberrant).

## Interactions
UBE2D1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, engages in several significant protein interactions that facilitate its role in ubiquitination processes. It interacts with the ubiquitin ligase RNF167, which is crucial for the ubiquitination of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2. This interaction is essential for the initial monoubiquitination of GluA2, a step necessary for subsequent polyubiquitination by the UBE2N/UBE2V1 complex (Ghilarducci2021Functional). The interaction between RNF167 and UBE2D1 is characterized by a strong binding affinity, with a dissociation constant of approximately 0.5 µM, indicating a robust interaction necessary for the ubiquitination process (Ghilarducci2021Functional).

UBE2D1 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase IDOL, mediating the sterol-dependent degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR). This interaction is facilitated by the RING domain of IDOL, which forms a complex with UBE2D1, crucial for LDLR ubiquitination and degradation (Zhang2011The). Additionally, UBE2D1 is involved in the ubiquitination of the E3 ligase March-I, regulating its expression and activity, which is important for the modulation of MHC-II and CD86 expression (Lei2018Ubiquitinconjugating). These interactions highlight UBE2D1's role in various cellular pathways through its participation in ubiquitination processes.
