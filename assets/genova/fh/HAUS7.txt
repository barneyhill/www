# HAUS7

## Overview
HAUS7 is a gene that encodes the protein HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 7, which is a critical component of the augmin complex involved in microtubule organization during cell division. The protein is categorized as a structural component of the microtubule-binding complex, playing a pivotal role in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules necessary for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Li2018A; Lawo2009HAUS). HAUS7 is part of the T-II subcomplex within the augmin complex, which includes other subunits such as HAUS2, HAUS6, and HAUS8, and is characterized by a flexible, clamp-like structure that facilitates microtubule branching (Manka2023Structural; Zupa2022The). The gene is expressed in various human tissues, with significant activity in reproductive cells, indicating its role in oocyte maturation and spermatogenesis (Li2018A). Mutations in HAUS7 have been associated with conditions such as severe oligozoospermia and primary ovarian insufficiency, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Li2018A; Katari2018Chromosomal).

## Structure
HAUS7 is a component of the augmin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule organization during cell division. The protein is part of the T-II subcomplex, which includes HAUS2, HAUS6, HAUS7, and HAUS8. This subcomplex is responsible for microtubule binding and is characterized by a flexible, clamp-like structure that facilitates microtubule branching (Manka2023Structural; Zupa2022The).

The N-terminal region of HAUS7 is predicted to contain a globular calponin homology (CH) domain, which is structurally similar to the microtubule-binding CH domain found in the Ndc80 complex. This domain is thought to contribute to microtubule binding, although the exact configuration and engagement with microtubules remain to be experimentally verified (Manka2023Structural; Zupa2022The; Travis2023Integrated).

In terms of quaternary structure, HAUS7 forms a dimer with HAUS2 within the T-II subcomplex, which also includes a dimer of HAUS6 and HAUS8. This assembly results in a four-helix bundle structure, contributing to the overall architecture of the augmin complex (Travis2023Integrated). The augmin complex's structure is highly conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Travis2023Integrated).

## Function
HAUS7, a subunit of the HAUS augmin-like complex, plays a critical role in microtubule organization during cell division. It is involved in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, which are essential for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis (Li2018A; Lawo2009HAUS). The HAUS complex, including HAUS7, localizes to interphase centrosomes and spindle microtubules, ensuring the integrity of the mitotic spindle and centrosomes (Lawo2009HAUS). HAUS7 is expressed in various human tissues, including the testes and ovaries, and is particularly active during the maturation of oocytes and spermatogenesis, indicating its role in reproductive cell division (Li2018A).

In healthy human cells, HAUS7 contributes to the recruitment of γ-tubulin to spindle microtubules, a process necessary for robust bipolar spindle formation (Lawo2009HAUS). Deficiencies in HAUS7 can lead to dysfunctional spindles, chromosome disarrangement, and mislocalization of spindle γ-tubulin, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability during cell division (Li2018A). The HAUS complex, including HAUS7, is crucial for the proper alignment and separation of chromosomes, ensuring accurate cell division and preventing genomic instability (Giotti2018Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAUS7 gene have been linked to severe oligozoospermia (SO), a condition characterized by a low sperm count, which can lead to male infertility. A specific hemizygous mutation (c.G386T:p.G129V) in HAUS7 was identified in two brothers with SO, inherited from their mother. This mutation is predicted to be highly pathogenic and may cause chromosome misalignment during meiosis, leading to reduced spermatogenesis and potentially affecting sperm motility (Li2018A). The HAUS7 gene is also implicated in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) due to its role in DNA repair and chromosomal stability. A microdeletion involving HAUS7 was found in a patient with POI, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of HAUS7 may contribute to this condition (Katari2018Chromosomal).

Alterations in HAUS7 expression have been studied in the context of low-grade glioma (LGG). While HAUS7 expression is not significantly elevated in LGG compared to normal tissue, its expression level is associated with tumor progression and prognosis. High expression of HAUS7 is considered a risk factor for poor prognosis in glioma patients (Wang2023A).

## Interactions
HAUS7 is a component of the augmin complex, which plays a critical role in microtubule organization during cell division. Within the augmin complex, HAUS7 interacts with other subunits, including HAUS6 and HAUS8, to form the TII tetramer. This tetramer is essential for microtubule binding and branching, with HAUS7 contributing through its N-terminal domain, which is predicted to fold into a calponin homology (CH) domain. This domain is similar to those found in other microtubule-binding proteins like Ndc80, suggesting a role in stabilizing microtubule interactions (Zupa2022The).

The interaction of HAUS7 within the augmin complex is crucial for the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) to spindle microtubules, facilitating microtubule nucleation and branching. The binding affinity of the augmin complex to microtubules is modulated by phosphorylation, and HAUS7, along with HAUS6, is involved in this regulatory process (Ustinova2023Microtubule; Zupa2022The).

HAUS7's interactions are primarily within the context of the augmin complex, and it does not have specific documented interactions with nucleic acids. Its role is largely structural, contributing to the complex's function in microtubule dynamics during mitosis (Ustinova2023Microtubule; Zupa2022The).
