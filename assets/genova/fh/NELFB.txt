# NELFB

## Overview
NELFB is a gene that encodes the protein negative elongation factor complex member B, which is a critical component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, primarily by inducing transcriptional pausing in the promoter-proximal region of genes. The NELF complex, including NELFB, interacts with the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and RNA polymerase II to stabilize the paused transcription complex, a process that is essential for proper gene expression and cellular differentiation (Narita2003Human; Hewitt2018Negative). NELFB is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle progenitor cell differentiation and hematopoietic stem cell function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to environmental cues (Robinson2021Negative; Liu2017Dynamic). Additionally, NELFB has significant implications in cancer biology, particularly in modulating antitumor immunity and enhancing the efficacy of T-cell-based therapies (Wu2022RNA).

## Function
NELFB is a component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, which plays a critical role in regulating transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). This complex is involved in establishing transcriptional pausing by stabilizing RNAPII in the promoter-proximal region, a process essential for proper gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation (Narita2003Human; Liu2017Dynamic). NELFB, along with other NELF subunits, contributes to the repression of transcription elongation by interacting with DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor) and RNAPII, causing transcriptional pausing. This pausing is reversed by P-TEFb, which phosphorylates RNAPII, allowing transcription to proceed (Narita2003Human).

In muscle progenitor cells, NELFB is crucial for maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation. It stabilizes paused RNAPII at promoter sites, enhancing transcription rates and preventing premature differentiation, which is vital for efficient muscle repair and stem cell pool repopulation (Robinson2021Negative). NELFB's role in transcriptional pausing is also significant in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, where its depletion leads to altered transcriptional landscapes and affects cell differentiation (Liu2017Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NELFB gene have significant implications for antitumor immunity and cancer therapy. In CD8+ T cells, NELFB is crucial for maintaining chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation, which are essential for effective antitumor responses. Deletion of Nelfb in these cells leads to impaired immune responses, increased T cell exhaustion, and reduced memory T cell populations, resulting in more robust tumor growth in knockout models (Wu2022RNA). Conversely, overexpression of NELFB enhances the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, increasing survival in tumor-bearing models by promoting memory stem cell markers and reducing exhaustion markers (Wu2022RNA).

The clinical significance of NELFB is further highlighted by its potential as a target for improving CD8+ T cell-based adoptive cell therapy, suggesting that modulating NELFB expression could enhance CAR-T cell efficacy and overall antitumor immunity (Wu2022RNA). These findings underscore the potential of NELFB as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy, offering a strategy to overcome challenges such as T cell exhaustion and improve treatment outcomes.

## Interactions
NELFB is a component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating RNA polymerase II transcription elongation. It interacts with other subunits of the NELF complex, including NELFA, NELFC/D, and NELF-E, forming a multiprotein complex that is essential for transcriptional pausing (Hewitt2018Negative; Yu2020Negative). NELFB also interacts with the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) complex, which is involved in the transition of RNA polymerase II from pausing to productive elongation (santana2024nelf).

In addition to its interactions within the NELF complex, NELFB is associated with RNA polymerase II and nascent RNA, influencing transcriptional pausing and promoter architecture (santana2024nelf). It is recruited to enhancers and promoters of target genes, facilitating chromatin accessibility and RNA polymerase II pausing at these loci (Wu2022RNA). NELFB's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in more transient interactions, such as modulating the expression of inflammatory genes in macrophages by interacting with transcription factors like PU.1 and components of the AP-1 complex (Yu2020Negative). These interactions highlight NELFB's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and cellular responses.
