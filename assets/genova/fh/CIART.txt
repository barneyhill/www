# CIART

## Overview
CIART, also known as CHRONO, is a gene that encodes the circadian associated repressor of transcription, a nuclear transcription factor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. The protein functions as a transcriptional repressor, interacting with core clock components such as BMAL1 and CLOCK to modulate the transcription-translation feedback loop essential for maintaining circadian rhythms. By disrupting interactions between BMAL1 and transcriptional co-activators, CIART influences the acetylation of histones, thereby affecting gene expression patterns linked to circadian cycles (Annayev2014Gene; Rosensweig2018Periodicity). Additionally, CIART's interactions with other circadian proteins, such as PERIOD2, further underscore its role in fine-tuning cellular timekeeping mechanisms (Crosby2022CHRONO). Beyond its role in circadian regulation, CIART has been implicated in the cellular response to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Tang2023A).

## Function
CIART, also known as CHRONO, is a nuclear transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of the mammalian circadian clock. It functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily interacting with core clock proteins such as BMAL1 and CLOCK. CIART represses the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex, which is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms. This repression is thought to occur through CIART's ability to disrupt BMAL1's interaction with the transcriptional co-activator CBP, thereby influencing the circadian acetylation of histone H3K9 at CLOCK/BMAL1 target sites (Annayev2014Gene; Rosensweig2018Periodicity).

CIART is active in the cell nucleus, where it modulates gene expression by binding to the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex on DNA, both in vivo and in vitro. This interaction suggests that CIART is involved in the negative arm of the transcription-translation feedback loop that governs circadian rhythms (Annayev2014Gene). In healthy human cells, CIART's regulatory activities contribute to the fine-tuning of circadian rhythms, impacting physiological processes such as sleep-wake cycles and hormone release (Rosensweig2018Periodicity).

## Clinical Significance
CIART (circadian associated repressor of transcription) has been identified as a significant factor in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alterations in CIART expression or function can influence susceptibility to viral infections, particularly COVID-19. Studies have shown that CIART knockout cells exhibit resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that CIART plays a role in facilitating viral entry or replication (Tang2023A). The gene's interaction with the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) pathway, which is involved in fatty-acid metabolism, is crucial in this process. Downregulation of the RXR pathway in CIART knockout cells leads to decreased fatty-acid synthesis, impairing viral infection (Tang2023A).

CIART's role in regulating the circadian clock also suggests potential implications for conditions related to circadian rhythm disruptions. While the study does not directly link CIART mutations to specific diseases, its involvement in circadian regulation implies that alterations could contribute to sleep disorders, metabolic syndrome, and mood disorders (Tang2023A). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its potential as a therapeutic target for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly other viral diseases (Tang2023A).

## Interactions
The human gene CIART, also known as CHRONO, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of circadian rhythms through its interactions with key components of the circadian clock. CHRONO acts as a repressor of the CLOCK:BMAL1 transcriptional activator complex, which is central to the circadian transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL). It contains a minimal repressive domain (MRD) that interacts with the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1, competing with other regulators such as CRY and coactivators CBP/p300 for binding (Crosby2022CHRONO). This competition highlights CHRONO's role as a direct regulator of BMAL1 function.

CHRONO also interacts with the circadian repressor PERIOD2 (PER2) by binding to its Casein Kinase 1 (CK1)-binding domain. This interaction reduces PER2 stability by inhibiting CK1 phosphorylation at the stabilizing S662 residue, thereby affecting PER2 turnover (Crosby2022CHRONO). These interactions suggest that CHRONO fine-tunes cellular timekeeping by modulating multiple protein-protein interactions critical for maintaining circadian rhythmicity. The study of CHRONO's interactions with BMAL1 and PER2 provides insights into its role in the negative arm of the circadian feedback loop, contributing to the modulation and refinement of core clock components (Crosby2022CHRONO).
