# SEC61A1

## Overview
The SEC61A1 gene encodes the Sec61 translocon subunit alpha 1, a pivotal component of the Sec61 complex, which is integral to the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its 10 transmembrane helices that form the central channel of the Sec61 complex. The Sec61α subunit plays a crucial role in the co-translational and post-translational transport of nascent polypeptides into the ER, facilitating their proper folding and modification. The Sec61 complex operates as a heterotrimer, comprising Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ subunits, and is involved in maintaining ER calcium homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes (Sicking2021Complexity; Lang2017An). Mutations in SEC61A1 have been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and protein biogenesis (Parys2022Sec61; Van2020Defective).

## Structure
The SEC61A1 gene encodes the Sec61α subunit, a core component of the Sec61 translocon complex, which is crucial for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The Sec61α protein consists of 10 transmembrane helices arranged in two pseudo-symmetrical halves around a central pore, which is sealed by a 'pore ring' of hydrophobic side chains and a short 'plug' helix (Sicking2021Complexity; Lang2017An). This structure forms the central channel of the Sec61 complex, facilitating the passage of proteins into the ER (Van2020Defective).

The Sec61 complex functions as a heterotrimer, including the Sec61α, Sec61β, and Sec61γ subunits, with Sec61β and Sec61γ located on the outskirts of the complex (Lang2017An). The Sec61α subunit interacts with various proteins, such as BiP, which binds to its ER luminal loop, and Ca2+-calmodulin, which interacts through an IQ motif in its N-terminal domain (Linxweiler2017Let’s). These interactions are essential for the channel's function and regulation, including its role as an ER Ca2+-leak channel (Parys2022Sec61). The Sec61 complex is also associated with the TRAP and OST complexes, which influence its conformation and function (Parys2022Sec61).

## Function
The SEC61A1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the Sec61 complex, a critical component of the protein translocation channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This complex facilitates the translocation of nascent polypeptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen and membrane, a crucial step in protein synthesis and folding (Sicking2021Complexity; Lang2017An). The Sec61 complex operates as a heterotrimeric channel that exists in dynamic equilibrium between closed and open states, allowing the entry of polypeptides and the efflux of Ca2+ ions when open (Sicking2021Complexity).

The Sec61α subunit, characterized by 10 transmembrane helices, forms the central channel of the complex. It interacts with ribosomes to facilitate the insertion of nascent proteins into the ER membrane (Parys2022Sec61). The channel's gating is influenced by signal peptides and allosteric effectors, such as the TRAP complex and BiP, which reduce the energy barrier for channel opening (Sicking2021Complexity). The Sec61 complex is also involved in maintaining ER calcium homeostasis, with its open state contributing to Ca2+ leakage, which is implicated in cellular processes like apoptosis (Lang2017An). The Sec61 complex's function is essential for the biogenesis of many proteins in human cells, impacting cellular homeostasis and protein distribution (Lang2017An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEC61A1 gene are associated with a range of diseases due to their impact on protein translocation and calcium homeostasis. Autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is linked to mutations such as Q92R and V67G, which disrupt neutrophil maturation by causing ER stress and dysregulated calcium homeostasis (Sicking2021Complexity; Van2020Defective). These mutations lead to a differentiation arrest at the promyelocyte stage, resulting in a low number of circulating mature neutrophils (Van2020Defective).

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is another condition associated with SEC61A1 mutations, specifically V85D and E381*, which result in impaired B-cell differentiation and low antibody production due to increased ER Ca2+ leakage and unresolvable ER stress (Sicking2021Complexity; Parys2022Sec61).

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is linked to mutations like V67G and T185A, which affect renal function by impairing protein transport and calcium regulation (Sicking2022Phenylbutyrate). The R236C mutation is associated with autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD), characterized by increased calcium leakiness and reduced autophagy, leading to liver cyst formation (Weiand2024Comparative).

High expression levels of SEC61A1 have been identified as a risk factor for poor outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Ji2024High).

## Interactions
The SEC61A1 protein, a subunit of the Sec61 complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SEC61A1 interacts with the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor, guiding the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the Sec61 channel for protein translocation (Linxweiler2017Let’s). It also forms a channel with Sec61β and Sec61γ, with strong interactions between Sec61α and Sec61β confirmed through luminescence-based assays (Sicking2021Lights).

The Sec61 complex interacts with auxiliary proteins such as Sec62 and Sec63, forming oligomers that are crucial for protein transport across the ER membrane. Sec62 interacts with the N-terminal domain of Sec61α via its C-terminal domain (Linxweiler2017Let’s). Additionally, Sec61α interacts with the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, with TRAPα showing a specific interaction with Sec61α, as demonstrated by bimolecular luminescence complementation studies (Sicking2021Lights).

Sec61α also interacts with BiP, an ER luminal chaperone, which binds to the ER luminal loop 7 of Sec61α, influencing channel gating (Lang2017An). These interactions are vital for the co-translational and post-translational transport of proteins across the ER membrane.
