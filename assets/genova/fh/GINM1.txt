# GINM1

## Overview
The GINM1 gene encodes the glycosylated integral membrane protein 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its glycosylation, a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in its function and stability within the cellular membrane. GINM1 is implicated in several biological pathways, contributing to cellular communication and signaling. Its expression and regulation are of particular interest in the study of certain diseases, where alterations in GINM1 function may have clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
