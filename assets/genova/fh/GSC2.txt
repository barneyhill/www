# GSC2

## Overview
The GSC2 gene encodes the goosecoid homeobox 2 protein, which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. As a member of the homeobox gene family, GSC2 plays a crucial role in the early stages of development by influencing cell fate decisions and patterning. The protein encoded by GSC2 is characterized by its homeodomain, which allows it to bind DNA and regulate the transcription of target genes. This regulatory function is essential for proper morphogenesis and differentiation of tissues and organs. Dysregulation of GSC2 expression has been associated with developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the GSC2 (goosecoid homeobox 2) gene have been implicated in various developmental disorders and certain cancers. Altered expression of GSC2 can disrupt normal cell signaling pathways, potentially leading to abnormal tissue growth or congenital anomalies. These disruptions may contribute to the pathogenesis of developmental disorders, although specific conditions directly linked to GSC2 mutations are still under investigation. The gene's role in cellular differentiation suggests that its dysregulation could affect the development of tissues and organs, leading to structural abnormalities or functional impairments. In the context of cancer, aberrant GSC2 expression may promote oncogenic processes, although the precise mechanisms and cancer types involved require further elucidation. Ongoing research aims to clarify the clinical implications of GSC2 alterations, with the goal of identifying potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers for related diseases. Understanding the impact of GSC2 on embryonic development and its contribution to disease states remains a significant focus in the field of genetic research.
