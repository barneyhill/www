# TNFRSF18

## Overview
TNFRSF18, also known as the gene encoding the protein TNF receptor superfamily member 18 (GITR), is a critical component of the immune system. This gene is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is primarily expressed on regulatory T cells and activated T cells. The protein it encodes, GITR, is a type I transmembrane receptor characterized by its cysteine-rich domains, which facilitate its structural stability and function. GITR plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses by interacting with its ligand, GITRL, and engaging in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK. These interactions are crucial for T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production, influencing both immune activation and regulation. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various clinical contexts, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, where it can serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target (So2019The; Wang2021Structures; Nocentini2005GITR:).

## Structure
The TNFRSF18 protein, also known as GITR, is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Its extracellular domain is characterized by cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are common structural motifs in this receptor family. Specifically, the human GITR contains 19 cysteines in its extracellular domain, contributing to its structural stability through disulfide bond formation (Wang2021Structures). The protein's structure includes three cysteine-rich domains, with CRD1 and CRD2 being unique compared to other TNFRSF members, while CRD3 is involved in receptor-receptor interactions, forming homodimers (Wang2021Structures).

The GITR receptor can form a hexameric network on the cell surface through receptor dimerization, which is crucial for receptor clustering and signal amplification (Wang2021Structures). This hexameric structure is facilitated by interactions at the CRD3 domain, where specific phenylalanine residues play a critical role (Wang2021Structures). The receptor-ligand interface is relatively small, leading to weaker interactions compared to other TNF receptor-ligand complexes (Wang2021Structures). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is typical for members of this receptor family (Wang2021Structures).

## Function
TNFRSF18, also known as GITR, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and plays a significant role in immune regulation. It is primarily expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and activated T cells, with lower expression on naive T cells. Upon T cell activation, GITR expression is upregulated, particularly in the presence of CD28 signaling (So2019The). GITR interacts with its ligand, GITRL, which is expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and endothelial cells, to modulate immune responses (Nocentini2005GITR:; Bosmans2021Glucocorticoid).

GITR functions as a co-stimulatory receptor, promoting T cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production. It is involved in the activation of several signaling pathways, including the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB and MAPK pathways, through its interaction with TRAF molecules (So2019The). These pathways influence cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation (Bosmans2021Glucocorticoid).

In Tregs, GITR engagement can disrupt self-tolerance and modulate the balance between Tregs and effector T cells, affecting immune responses and potentially leading to autoimmune diseases (So2019The; Nocentini2005GITR:). GITR's role in immune regulation is complex, as it can both enhance and suppress immune responses depending on the context (Bosmans2021Glucocorticoid).

## Clinical Significance
TNFRSF18, also known as GITR, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or function. In cancer, TNFRSF18 expression is associated with immune escape mechanisms and can serve as a biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy, particularly in melanoma with NRAS mutations. These mutations can lead to the downregulation of TNFRSF18, affecting the tumor's immune environment and potentially influencing the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapies such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatments (Dong2022Thirteen).

In lung adenocarcinoma, TNFRSF18 is noted for having higher copy number variation (CNV) amplification frequencies, which may contribute to oncogenesis and impact prognosis. The gene's expression differences between tumor and normal tissues suggest its role in cancer development and progression (Huang2022Genomic).

In diffuse gliomas, TNFRSF18 is identified as a risk factor, with its expression correlating with poorer prognosis. It is part of a TNF family-based signature used to categorize patients into risk groups, highlighting its potential impact on clinical outcomes (Wang2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
TNFRSF18, also known as GITR, interacts with its ligand GITRL to form complexes that are crucial for immune signaling. The GITR-GITRL interaction is unique within the TNF receptor superfamily, as it involves a smaller binding interface and forms a hexameric network in humans through receptor dimerization at the CRD3 domain. This dimerization is essential for receptor clustering and signal amplification (Wang2021Structures). Mutations at this interface can significantly reduce IL-2 secretion, indicating disrupted signaling (Wang2021Structures).

GITR also interacts with several TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), including TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, and TRAF5, which are recruited to its cytoplasmic region. These interactions activate signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK, which are important for T-cell activation and survival (So2019The). TRAF2 and TRAF5 enhance GITR-mediated NF-κB activation, while TRAF2 can also inhibit it under certain conditions (Dostert2019The). Additionally, GITR binds to Siva, an intracellular molecule with a death domain, which may regulate NF-κB activation by inhibiting the GITR-TRAF2 interaction (So2019The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory role of GITR in immune responses.
