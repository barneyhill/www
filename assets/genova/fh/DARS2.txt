# DARS2

## Overview
The DARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase 2, a crucial enzyme involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs, a fundamental step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins. The proper function of DARS2 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, particularly in high-energy-demanding cells such as neurons. Mutations in the DARS2 gene are linked to leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL), a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and specific MRI findings (Isohanni2009DARS2; Rumyantseva2020DARS2). The regulation of DARS2 involves complex interactions and post-translational modifications, which are critical for its stability and function within the mitochondrial environment (Johnson2024Targeted).

## Structure
DARS2 encodes the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, a protein crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. The primary structure of DARS2 is composed of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and folding. The tertiary structure of DARS2 forms a three-dimensional shape essential for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to interact effectively with its substrates and other molecules within the mitochondria.

DARS2 may also participate in forming a quaternary structure through interactions with other proteins, which could be important for its function in the mitochondrial environment. The protein contains specific domains, including a catalytic domain responsible for the enzymatic activity of attaching aspartic acid to its corresponding tRNA, and an anticodon-binding domain that ensures the correct tRNA is charged with the amino acid.

Post-translational modifications and the presence of splice variant isoforms can influence the function and localization of DARS2, potentially affecting its role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. These modifications and variants may alter the protein's stability, activity, or interaction with other mitochondrial components.

## Function
The DARS2 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the attachment of aspartic acid to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in the translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins (Rumyantseva2020DARS2; Konovalova2013Mitochondrial). The proper functioning of DARS2 is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, which are crucial for cellular metabolism and overall organismal health (Rumyantseva2020DARS2).

DARS2 activity is particularly important in neurons, especially in high-energy-demanding cells like Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. These cells are highly sensitive to the loss of DARS2, which can lead to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration (Rumyantseva2020DARS2). The enzyme's role in maintaining oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function is crucial for the survival of these neurons, as its depletion results in significant mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of Purkinje cells (Rumyantseva2020DARS2).

In healthy cells, DARS2 ensures proper mitochondrial translation by maintaining adequate mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase activity, which is essential for the synthesis of proteins required for mitochondrial respiratory chain function (Konovalova2013Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DARS2 gene are associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL), a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder. LBSL is characterized by slowly progressive pyramidal and cerebellar dysfunction, often accompanied by dorsal column dysfunction. Symptoms include spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, and decreased position and vibration sense, with some patients experiencing axonal neuropathy leading to decreased or absent tendon reflexes and distal weakness (Yelam2019Leucoencephalopathy; Isohanni2009DARS2).

The condition is typically diagnosed through characteristic MRI findings, which show symmetrical white matter lesions and elevated lactate levels in the brain, while serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels remain normal (Isohanni2009DARS2). Most patients with LBSL have compound heterozygous mutations in the DARS2 gene, often involving a splice site mutation in intron 2 that causes exon 3 skipping, leading to a frameshift and premature termination codon (Guang2023Mutations). The mutational spectrum of DARS2 includes numerous pathogenic variants, with a significant proportion being missense substitutions (Bostanova2024Identification).

Clinical presentation can vary significantly, even among patients with identical mutations, suggesting the influence of secondary genetic factors (Isohanni2009DARS2). The age of onset ranges from infancy to middle age, and the progression speed can vary, with some cases presenting as early as childhood and others in adulthood (Li2021Leukoencephalopathy).

## Interactions
DARS2, a mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its function and stability. It is a substrate for FBXO24-mediated ubiquitylation, which targets DARS2 for degradation. This interaction is dependent on the SCF FBXO24 E3-ligase activity, and DARS2 shows increased polyubiquitylation when co-expressed with FBXO24 (Johnson2024Targeted). The acetylation of DARS2, particularly at lysine 368, protects it from degradation, indicating a regulatory mechanism involving post-translational modifications (Johnson2024Targeted).

DARS2 also interacts with mitochondrial targeting sequences and has specific motifs that modulate its stability. Several lysine residues on DARS2 serve as ubiquitination acceptor sites, crucial for its stability and degradation (Johnson2024Targeted). In the context of immune responses, DARS2 acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) due to its homology with bacterial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, triggering cytokine release from macrophages (Johnson2024Targeted).

These interactions highlight the complex regulation of DARS2 through its interactions with FBXO24 and the role of ubiquitination and acetylation in modulating its stability and function.
