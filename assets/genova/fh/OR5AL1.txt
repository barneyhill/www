# OR5AL1

## Overview
The OR5AL1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AL member 1, which is involved in the detection of odorants. This protein belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for signal transduction across cell membranes. Olfactory receptors, such as the one encoded by OR5AL1, play a pivotal role in the sense of smell by binding specific molecules and initiating a neuronal response that is interpreted as a distinct odor. The OR5AL1 gene is located on chromosome 11 and is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are the largest gene family in the human genome (Qiu2020aarFDC).
