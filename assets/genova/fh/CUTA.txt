# CUTA

## Overview
The CUTA gene encodes the cutA divalent cation tolerance homolog protein, which is primarily involved in metal ion homeostasis and cellular signaling processes. This protein, categorized as a metal-binding protein, plays a crucial role in regulating the β-cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its interaction with β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), thereby influencing Alzheimer's disease pathology (Zhao2012CutA). Additionally, CUTA is integral to copper homeostasis, possessing a high copper-binding capacity that is conserved across species, from bacteria to mammals (Hou2015The). The protein also affects the folding and secretion of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in neurotransmission (Liang2009Protein). Clinically, CUTA has been implicated in breast cancer, where its upregulation suggests a role in copper-dependent processes associated with cancer development (Blockhuys2017Defining). The structural and functional attributes of CUTA underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease pathology.

## Structure
The human CUTA gene encodes the HsCutA1 protein, which is involved in metal ion homeostasis. The molecular structure of HsCutA1 has been determined at a resolution of 2.05 Å. The protein functions as a trimer, with each subunit adopting a ferredoxin-like fold. This fold is characterized by a double motif where an antiparallel β-sheet packs against antiparallel α-helices. The structure includes an additional short strand and a C-terminal helix (Bagautdinov2008Structure).

The secondary structure of HsCutA1 features a β-hairpin formed by strands 2 and 3, which acts as an oligomerization site. The tertiary structure assembles such that conserved regions in the subunits form three potential active sites at the trimer interfaces. Electrostatic surface potentials reveal large negatively charged patches around the trimer-interface clefts, suggesting a role in substrate docking (Bagautdinov2008Structure).

The quaternary structure involves a dimer of trimers, with the nonpolar face of one trimer interacting with the same face of another, while the negatively charged face is exposed to the solvent. The buried interface between the two trimers is about 2470 Å², indicating more extensive interactions within the trimer than between the trimers (Bagautdinov2008Structure).

## Function
The CUTA gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of β-cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its interaction with β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). This interaction primarily occurs in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, where CUTA influences the intracellular trafficking of BACE1, affecting the generation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Zhao2012CutA). Overexpression of CUTA has been shown to reduce BACE1-mediated APP processing and Aβ secretion, while knockdown of CUTA increases these processes, indicating its regulatory role in APP processing (Zhao2012CutA).

CUTA is also involved in copper homeostasis, as it has a high copper-binding capacity. This function is conserved across species, from bacteria to mammals, and is crucial for maintaining metal ion balance within cells (Hou2015The). In mammalian cells, CUTA can affect copper uptake, which is significant given the role of copper in various enzymatic activities and cellular functions (Hou2015The).

Additionally, CUTA influences the folding, oligomerization, and secretion of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in neurotransmission. It affects the processing and trafficking of AChE, although it is not the membrane anchor for this enzyme (Liang2009Protein). The protein's involvement in these molecular processes suggests a potential role in signal transduction and cellular homeostasis (Zhao2012CutA).

## Clinical Significance
The CUTA gene, known for its role in cellular metal ion homeostasis, has been implicated in breast cancer due to its upregulation in this disease. It is part of a gene cluster with ATOX1 and COX17, which are involved in copper transport and homeostasis. CUTA is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein, and COX17 may function as a chaperone delivering copper to CUTA within mitochondria. However, functional network analysis suggests that CUTA's nearest neighbors are cytoplasmic proteins, raising questions about its cellular compartmentalization (Blockhuys2017Defining).

The study of copper-binding proteins, including CUTA, highlights their importance in cancer, as several such proteins are upregulated in breast cancer. This suggests a potential role for copper-dependent processes in cancer development. The exact mechanisms by which CUTA contributes to cancer remain unclear, necessitating further molecular studies to explore its interactions with COX17 and ATOX1 and to determine its precise localization within cells (Blockhuys2017Defining).

While the context does not provide specific information about diseases directly caused by mutations in the CUTA gene, its altered expression in cancer suggests a significant role in disease pathology related to copper metabolism.

## Interactions
The CUTA protein interacts specifically with the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), primarily in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. This interaction is mediated by the N terminus of the H component of CUTA isoform 1 and the transmembrane domain of BACE1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed this interaction, which does not occur with other proteins such as APP or Nicastrin (NCT) (Zhao2012CutA). The interaction between CUTA and BACE1 is crucial for regulating the intracellular trafficking of BACE1, influencing the processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the generation of the neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Overexpression of CUTA can reduce BACE1-mediated APP processing and Aβ secretion, while RNA interference knockdown of CUTA can increase these processes (Zhao2012CutA).

CUTA does not appear to interact directly with nucleic acids, and its interaction with BACE1 does not affect the secretion of CUTA itself, suggesting that CUTA secretion is mediated by other proteins (Zhao2012CutA). The specific domains of CUTA and BACE1 are essential for their interaction, highlighting the importance of the transmembrane domain of BACE1 in this process (Zhao2012CutA).
