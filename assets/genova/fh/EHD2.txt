# EHD2

## Overview
EHD2 (EH domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in membrane dynamics, particularly in the stabilization and function of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. The EHD2 protein is a member of the EHD-containing protein family and is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is crucial for its role in membrane remodeling and endocytosis. Structurally, EHD2 includes an amino-terminal GTPase domain, a helical domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal EH domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Functionally, EHD2 is implicated in mechanotransduction, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction, and it plays a significant role in adipocyte function and insulin signaling. Clinically, EHD2 has been associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and treatment response, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Morén2012EHD2; Torrino2018EHD2; Shen2020EHD2).

## Structure
EHD2 is a member of the EHD-containing protein family, characterized by its involvement in membrane remodeling and endocytosis. The molecular structure of EHD2 includes several key domains: an amino-terminal GTPase domain, a helical domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal EH domain. The GTPase domain, despite its name, binds and hydrolyzes ATP rather than GTP, which is crucial for its function in membrane dynamics (Morén2012EHD2; Bar2009The).

The EH domain of EHD2 contains two EF-hand calcium-binding motifs and is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with proteins containing NPF motifs (Naslavsky2005Cterminal; Bar2009The). The helical domains form a lipid-binding surface, contributing to the protein's ability to associate with membranes (Bar2009The).

EHD2 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its quaternary structure and function. This dimerization is mediated by a conserved interface within the G domain and is crucial for its ATPase activity and membrane remodeling capabilities (Morén2012EHD2; Bahl2015Role). The protein's structure is further stabilized by a coiled-coil domain, which is important for its inhibitory role in endocytosis (Bar2009The). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate EHD2's activity and interactions.

## Function
EHD2 (EH domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the dynamics and stability of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane involved in various cellular processes such as mechanotransduction, lipid metabolism, and signal transduction. In healthy cells, EHD2 is associated with caveolae and is crucial for maintaining their stability at the plasma membrane. It oligomerizes into rings on highly curved membranes, which stimulates its ATPase activity, essential for stabilizing caveolae and controlling their turnover (Morén2012EHD2).

EHD2 is involved in mechanotransduction by translocating to the nucleus under mechanical stress, where it regulates the transcription of genes involved in caveolae formation and other cellular processes (Torrino2018EHD2). It also plays a role in adipocyte function, where it is upregulated during adipocyte maturation and is involved in lipid droplet formation and insulin signaling (Morén2019EHD2). EHD2's function is ATP-dependent, requiring nucleotide binding for its localization to caveolae and its membrane-remodeling activity (Morén2012EHD2).

## Clinical Significance
EHD2 has significant clinical implications in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low EHD2 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, yet paradoxically correlates with better metastasis-free survival and improved chemotherapy efficacy. This suggests that EHD2 may act as a tumor suppressor and serve as a predictive biomarker for chemotherapy response in TNBC patients (Shen2020EHD2).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), high EHD2 expression is linked to more aggressive cancer features, such as extrathyroidal extension and higher tumor stages. It is associated with the BRAF V600E mutation and increased risk of recurrence, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for PTC (Kim2017Prognostic).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), reduced EHD2 expression is related to increased cell motility and decreased E-cadherin levels, contributing to metastasis and chemotherapy resistance. This under-expression suggests EHD2 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in ESCC (Li2013Effects).

Overall, EHD2's role in cancer progression and treatment response highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across different cancer types.

## Interactions
EHD2 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of caveolae, small invaginations in the plasma membrane. EHD2 colocalizes with caveolin1-positive structures, indicating its presence in caveolae, and interacts with caveolin1-positive membranes (Morén2012EHD2). It also interacts with cavin1 and pacsin2, proteins associated with caveolae. Pacsin2 is involved in remodeling caveolar membranes, and EHD2 binds to pacsin2 with an affinity of 37 μM, independent of the SH3 domain of pacsin2 but dependent on the NPF motifs (Morén2012EHD2). EHD2 colocalizes with all four members of the cavin protein family (cavin1-4) on caveolae, suggesting a tight interplay between EHD2, cavins, and pacsin2 at caveolae (Morén2012EHD2).

EHD2 also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, aligning along actin filaments. This interaction may not be direct, as several candidate actin-binding proteins, including filamin A, have been linked to caveolae. EHD2's association with the neck of caveolae and its interaction with actin suggest a regulated link between caveolae and the actin cytoskeleton (Mayor2014ClathrinIndependent). EHD2's interactions are crucial for its role in stabilizing caveolae at the plasma membrane and regulating their dynamics (Morén2012EHD2).
