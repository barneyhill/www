# KIAA1143

## Overview
KIAA1143 is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is implicated in various cellular processes and disease contexts. Although the specific functional category of the KIAA1143 protein remains to be fully characterized, it has been associated with significant roles in endosomal transport and the regulation of natural killer cell proliferation, particularly in the context of malaria (Nambou2021Weighted). The gene's expression levels have been linked to prognostic outcomes in prostate cancer, suggesting its potential utility as a biomarker for disease stratification (Nalejska2014Prognostic). Additionally, KIAA1143 has been studied in relation to Graves' ophthalmopathy and liver fibrosis due to HCV infection, although its precise role in these conditions requires further investigation (Ijaz2019HCV; Virakul2021Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
KIAA1143 has been identified as having potential clinical significance in several diseases through its altered expression levels. In prostate cancer, KIAA1143 is one of six genes identified with potential prognostic significance. Its expression levels can help stratify patients with more or less aggressive forms of prostate cancer, offering insights beyond the traditional PSA biomarker (Nalejska2014Prognostic).

In the context of malaria, KIAA1143 has been associated with asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infection. It is part of a gene module involved in biological processes such as endosomal transport and regulation of natural killer cell proliferation, which are significant in understanding the pathogenesis of malaria (Nambou2021Weighted).

In Graves' ophthalmopathy, KIAA1143 showed more than 2-fold hypermethylation in orbital fibroblasts, although its mRNA expression did not differ significantly between active and inactive disease states (Virakul2021Integrative).

While KIAA1143 is mentioned in the context of liver fibrosis due to HCV infection, the specific role or impact of its expression changes in this condition is not detailed (Ijaz2019HCV). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of KIAA1143 in these and potentially other conditions.
