# VIRMA

## Overview
VIRMA, also known as KIAA1429, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the m6A methyltransferase complex, specifically within the MACOM subunit. The protein, categorized as a scaffold protein, plays a pivotal role in RNA biology by facilitating the methylation of adenosine residues in mRNA, particularly in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and near stop codons. This methylation is crucial for regulating mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation, thereby influencing gene expression (Yue2018VIRMA). Structurally, the VIRMA protein adopts a horse-shaped conformation with multiple armadillo-like repeats, which are essential for its interactions with other components of the methyltransferase complex, such as WTAP, METTL3, and METTL14 (Yan2022AIempowered; Su2022Cryo-EM). Beyond its fundamental role in mRNA processing, VIRMA is implicated in alternative polyadenylation and has been associated with various cancers, where its dysregulation can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Xu2021VIRMA; Zhu2020Genetic).

## Structure
VIRMA, also known as KIAA1429, is a core component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, specifically within the MACOM subunit. The protein adopts a horse-shaped conformation composed of 20 ARM-like (ARML) modules, which are organized into distinct domains: Belly (ARML1-4), Chest (ARML5-7), Back (ARML8-10), Neck (ARML11-15), and Head (ARML16-20) (Su2022Cryo-EM). These domains are connected by helices, with the Belly and Chest linked by Connect Helix-1 and the Chest and Back by Connect Helix-2. The Neck and Head domains follow a canonical stacking architecture, with the Back and Neck adopting different stacking orientations due to hydrophobic interactions (Su2022Cryo-EM).

VIRMA forms a twisted α-solenoid-like superhelix with 17 armadillo-like (ARML) repeats, contributing to its role in m6A modification at the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) (Yan2022AIempowered). The protein's surface is mostly negatively charged, with some positively charged and conserved regions crucial for interactions with other MACOM components, particularly WTAP (Su2022Cryo-EM). The structural core of MACOM is formed through extensive interactions between VIRMA and the WTAP dimer, involving a large interface area with multiple salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Su2022Cryo-EM). These interactions are essential for the stability and function of the MACOM complex.

## Function
VIRMA, also known as KIAA1429, is a critical component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which is responsible for the methylation of adenosine residues in mRNA, particularly in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) and near stop codons. This methylation process influences mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression (Yue2018VIRMA). VIRMA acts as a scaffold within the methyltransferase complex, recruiting core components such as METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP to guide region-selective methylation (Yue2018VIRMA).

In healthy human cells, VIRMA is involved in alternative polyadenylation (APA), influencing the selection of polyadenylation sites and affecting the length of the 3' UTR. This process is crucial for mRNA metabolism regulation, impacting mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Yue2018VIRMA). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it stabilizes WTAP and interacts with polyadenylation cleavage factors such as CPSF5 and CPSF6, further linking m6A methylation with APA (Yue2018VIRMA). Through these functions, VIRMA plays a vital role in cellular processes such as cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis (Yue2018VIRMA).

## Clinical Significance
The VIRMA gene, also known as KIAA1429, plays a significant role in various cancers through its involvement in m6A RNA methylation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alterations in VIRMA, such as copy number variations, are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. These genetic changes are linked to more advanced tumor stages and the presence of TP53 and TERT mutations (Zhu2020Genetic). In breast cancer, VIRMA is frequently amplified, with copy number variations observed in a significant portion of cases. This amplification correlates with pathological stages and may serve as a biomarker for patient staging (Zhao2021Gene).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), VIRMA is upregulated, promoting tumor progression by mediating m6A methylation of the tumor suppressor gene DAPK3. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (Xu2021VIRMA). In gastric cancer, VIRMA expression is linked to tumor grade, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Zhu2021Role). These findings highlight VIRMA's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
VIRMA, also known as KIAA1429, is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which includes METTL3, METTL14, and WTAP. It acts as a scaffold within this complex, facilitating the methylation of mRNA by recruiting and stabilizing the core components METTL3 and METTL14, thereby guiding m6A modification at specific sites, particularly in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) and near the stop codon of mRNAs (Yue2018VIRMA).

VIRMA interacts with polyadenylation cleavage factors such as CPSF5 and CPSF6 in an RNA-dependent manner. These interactions suggest a role for VIRMA in alternative polyadenylation, influencing the length of the 3′UTR and mRNA processing (Yue2018VIRMA). The WTAP-VIRMA complex also plays a regulatory role by counteracting the binding of the METTL3-METTL14 complex to double-stranded DNA, thus maintaining its RNA methylation activity (Yan2023WTAP–VIRMA).

VIRMA's interactions extend to other proteins such as HAKAI and ZC3H13, which are part of the m6A methyltransferase complex, further highlighting its central role in mRNA methylation and processing (Yue2018VIRMA). These interactions are crucial for the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, impacting various cellular processes and cancer progression.
