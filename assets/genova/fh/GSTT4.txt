# GSTT4

## Overview
The GSTT4 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione S-transferase theta 4, which is part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family. This family of enzymes plays a crucial role in the detoxification process by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. The GSTT4 protein is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and protection against oxidative stress. It is expressed in various tissues and may have implications in cellular defense mechanisms and susceptibility to certain diseases. The study of GSTT4 and its encoded protein is significant for understanding its potential role in pharmacogenomics and toxicology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
