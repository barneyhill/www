# KLHL17

## Overview
KLHL17 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 17, also known as actinfilin, which is predominantly expressed in the brain. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain and multiple Kelch domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and synaptic plasticity (Hu2023Autismrelated; Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin). KLHL17 is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine dynamics and neuronal activation, playing a critical role in calcium signaling and synaptic function (Hu2023Autismrelated). The gene has been implicated in various neurological disorders, such as infantile spasms and epilepsy, and is also associated with certain cancers, including prostate cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both neural and oncological contexts (George2018A; Zhou2024Identification).

## Structure
KLHL17, also known as actinfilin, is a brain-specific protein characterized by its distinct structural domains. The protein contains a Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain at its N-terminal region, which is involved in dimerization and interaction with the Cullin 3 (CUL3) ubiquitination complex (Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin). The C-terminal region of KLHL17 comprises six Kelch domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with the F-actin cytoskeleton (Hu2023Autismrelated; Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin). These Kelch domains form a beta-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure and enabling its role in F-actin remodeling and dendritic spine enlargement (Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin).

The full-length KLHL17 protein is essential for maintaining dendritic spine morphology, as both the N-terminal BTB domain and the C-terminal Kelch domains are required for its function (Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin). KLHL17 forms circular puncta in dendritic spines, indicating its quaternary structure involves oligomerization (Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin). The protein's interaction with synaptopodin (SYNPO) is crucial for synaptic plasticity, affecting calcium dynamics and the distribution of the spine apparatus (Hu2023Autismrelated). KLHL17's expression is regulated by neuronal activity, highlighting its dynamic role in synaptic function (Hu2023Autismrelated).

## Function
The KLHL17 gene, also known as actinfilin, is a brain-specific gene that plays a crucial role in the regulation of dendritic spine dynamics and neuronal activation. It is essential for the activity-dependent enlargement of dendritic spines, which is linked to calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity. KLHL17 regulates calcium dynamics by affecting the frequency and amplitude of calcium events in neurons and influences the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in dendritic spines, particularly in larger, mushroom-like spines (Hu2023Autismrelated).

KLHL17 interacts with synaptopodin (SYNPO), an F-actin-binding protein that organizes the spine apparatus and controls ER distribution. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structure of the spine apparatus and contributes to synaptic plasticity. KLHL17 deficiency leads to fewer dendritic spines containing SYNPO, affecting synaptic plasticity and neuronal activation (Hu2023Autismrelated).

In neurons, KLHL17 is distributed in the soma and along dendrites, with some colocalizing with F-actin. It is involved in the formation and maintenance of functional synapses by affecting the expression of synaptic markers such as PSD95 and synaptophysin (Hu2020KLHL17Actinfilin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLHL17 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurological disorders and cancers. In the context of neurological disorders, KLHL17 is associated with infantile spasms (IS), a rare form of epilepsy characterized by seizures in the first year of life. This association is linked to deletions in the chromosome region 1p36, which includes the KLHL17 gene. The gene is suggested to play a role in actin-based neuronal function, and its deletion may contribute to the pathogenesis of IS (Paciorkowski2011Copy; George2018A). KLHL17 is also considered a candidate gene for epilepsy in patients with deletion 1p36 syndrome, where it may interact with the postsynaptic density network, influencing synaptic function (Paciorkowski2011Copy).

In cancer, KLHL17 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer (PCa) due to its high expression in PCa tissues and its association with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting its role in the aggressive behavior of PCa cells (Zhou2024Identification). Additionally, KLHL17 is implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where lower expression levels are associated with a pro-inflammatory environment that may promote tumorigenesis (Connelly2024Allelic).

## Interactions
KLHL17, also known as actinfilin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. KLHL17 interacts with synaptopodin (SYNPO), an F-actin-binding protein, to regulate the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within dendritic spines. This interaction is essential for controlling calcium dynamics and dendritic spine enlargement, which are critical for synaptic plasticity (Hu2023Autismrelated). The interaction between KLHL17 and SYNPO is weak, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and super-resolution imaging, suggesting an indirect interaction possibly mediated by the F-actin cytoskeleton (Hu2023Autismrelated).

KLHL17 contains an N-terminal BTB domain and C-terminal Kelch domains, which are involved in its interaction with SYNPO. The N-terminal fragment of KLHL17 interacts with full-length SYNPO, while the C-terminal region of SYNPO interacts with full-length KLHL17. Overexpression of the C-terminal region of SYNPO disrupts this interaction, leading to altered calcium dynamics and reduced ER distribution in dendritic spines (Hu2023Autismrelated). These interactions highlight the role of KLHL17 in maintaining synaptic structure and function, which may be relevant to its association with autism spectrum disorders.
