# TMPRSS13

## Overview
TMPRSS13 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 13, a member of the Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases (TTSP) family. This protein is characterized by its serine protease domain, which plays a crucial role in proteolytic activation of precursor proteins, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis. TMPRSS13 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and is involved in processes such as cell migration and tissue remodeling. It also plays a significant role in facilitating viral entry into host cells, notably in the context of influenza and coronaviruses, by cleaving viral envelope proteins. Additionally, TMPRSS13 interacts with immune cells, suggesting a potential role in immune response regulation. The protein's involvement in cancer progression and viral infections highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Gatineau2022IL4I1; Varela2020TMPRSS13).

## Structure
TMPRSS13 is a member of the Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases (TTSP) family, characterized by a serine protease domain located at the C-terminal extracellular region. The primary structure of TMPRSS13 includes an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and an intermediate region with ancillary domains (Joushomme2024Development). The protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, requiring activation at specific residues (Joushomme2024Development).

The secondary structure of TMPRSS13 involves conserved secondary structures identified through sequence alignment and homology modeling (Escalante2021Structural). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, and the protein exhibits a conserved catalytic triad of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural). The loop between residues 50-70 shows notable variations, which may affect the molecular structure (Escalante2021Structural).

TMPRSS13 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, resulting in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing (Varela2020TMPRSS13). The dominant form is a glycosylated full-length protein (~70 kDa), with a phosphorylated form (~90 kDa) also present (Varela2020TMPRSS13). These modifications and isoforms contribute to the protein's functional diversity and role in cellular processes.

## Function
TMPRSS13, a type II transmembrane serine protease, is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in proteolytic activation of precursor proteins. This activity is crucial for cellular signaling and homeostasis. TMPRSS13 is expressed in epithelial tissues, including the oral cavity, esophagus, bladder, stomach, and skin, where it participates in processes such as cell migration and tissue remodeling (Varela2020TMPRSS13). Its activity is typically localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with other proteins to modulate their function.

In the context of viral infections, TMPRSS13 facilitates the entry of viruses like influenza and coronaviruses into host cells by cleaving viral envelope proteins, such as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This cleavage enhances the fusogenic properties of the spike protein, promoting viral entry into cells (Gatineau2022IL4I1). TMPRSS13's role in immune cells, including T and B lymphocytes, suggests it may also be involved in immune response regulation (Gatineau2022IL4I1).

While TMPRSS13's function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression in various epithelial tissues and immune cells indicates a potential role in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS13 is implicated in several cancers, notably colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer, where its expression is significantly upregulated. In CRC, TMPRSS13 promotes cell survival, invasion, and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. High expression levels of TMPRSS13 are observed in cancerous tissues compared to normal colon tissues, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Varela2020TMPRSS13). Silencing TMPRSS13 in CRC cell lines increases apoptosis and reduces invasive potential, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Varela2020TMPRSS13).

In breast cancer, TMPRSS13 is associated with tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy. Studies have shown that TMPRSS13 expression correlates with increased tumor burden and metastasis in breast cancer models (Murray2020The). 

TMPRSS13 is also identified as a potential driver gene in colorectal adenomas, where it may promote adenoma development and progression via the HGF/MET axis (Lin2017The). Additionally, TMPRSS13 mutations have been observed in renal cell carcinoma, where it is associated with PD-L1-positive expression, suggesting a role in immune response modulation (Wang2018Somatic).

## Interactions
TMPRSS13, a transmembrane serine protease, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its biological functions. It has been identified as a receptor for the immunosuppressive enzyme IL4I1 on T lymphocytes. This interaction was confirmed through proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that TMPRSS13 may play a role in IL4I1-mediated immunosuppression (Gatineau2022IL4I1).

TMPRSS13 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, facilitating viral entry into host cells. This interaction is significant in the context of viral infections, as TMPRSS13 enhances the cleavage of the spike protein, promoting the virus's entry and replication (Kishimoto2021TMPRSS11D). The interaction between TMPRSS13 and the spike protein is competitive with IL4I1, which can interfere with the spike protein's binding to TMPRSS13, potentially reducing viral entry (Gatineau2022IL4I1).

These interactions highlight TMPRSS13's role in both cancer progression and viral infections, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these contexts.
