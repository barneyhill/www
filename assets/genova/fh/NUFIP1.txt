# NUFIP1

## Overview
NUFIP1 (nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, autophagy, and ribonucleoprotein complex assembly. The protein encoded by NUFIP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that plays a critical role in mRNA processing and transport, particularly in the context of synaptic function and local protein synthesis (Bardoni2003NUFIP1). It acts as a ribosome receptor during starvation-induced ribophagy, facilitating the degradation of ribosomes to recycle nutrients and support cell survival under nutrient-deprived conditions (Wyant2018NUFIP1). Additionally, NUFIP1 is involved in the assembly of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes, interacting with core components such as fibrillarin (Wyant2018NUFIP1). The protein's interactions with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and its role in autophagy underscore its importance in both neurological and oncological contexts, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2021Targeting; Bardoni1999A).

## Function
NUFIP1 (nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 1) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in mRNA metabolism and is associated with active synaptoneurosomes, indicating its involvement in RNA processing and transport (Bardoni2003NUFIP1). NUFIP1 interacts with ribosomes and is implicated in the regulation of local protein synthesis near synapses, suggesting a role in translational control similar to that of FMRP (Bardoni2003NUFIP1).

In the context of autophagy, NUFIP1 functions as a ribosome receptor for starvation-induced ribophagy, facilitating the degradation of ribosomes under nutrient deprivation conditions. This process is crucial for recycling nutrients and promoting cell survival during starvation (Wyant2018NUFIP1). NUFIP1 interacts with LC3B, a protein associated with autophagy, to mediate the delivery of ribosomes to autophagosomes (Wyant2018NUFIP1).

NUFIP1 is also involved in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, including the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP), and interacts with core components like fibrillarin (Wyant2018NUFIP1). Its subcellular localization is tightly regulated, which is essential for its function in developmental processes and cellular homeostasis (Bardoni2003NUFIP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUFIP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NUFIP1 is identified as a potential oncogene. It is significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous ones, and its high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival and increased recurrence rates. Knockdown of NUFIP1 in CRC cell lines has been shown to suppress cell growth, induce cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis, suggesting its critical role in CRC progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2021Targeting).

NUFIP1 is also involved in neurological conditions. It interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and this interaction is crucial for normal cognitive development. Although the direct clinical significance of NUFIP1 mutations in neurological disorders is not fully detailed, its role in RNA metabolism and mRNA export suggests that disruptions could contribute to conditions like Fragile X syndrome (Bardoni2003NUFIP1). The protein's involvement in ribophagy and its response to mechanical stress also indicate potential implications in diseases like glaucoma, although specific clinical outcomes are not yet fully understood (Shim2019The).

## Interactions
NUFIP1 (nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 1) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a relationship confirmed through various experimental methods such as GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction is specific, as NUFIP1 does not bind to FXR1P or FXR2P, which are proteins similar to FMRP (Bardoni1999A). NUFIP1 also interacts with ribosomes, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation, facilitating their delivery to autophagosomes by binding to LC3B, a microtubule-associated protein. This interaction is crucial for the autophagic degradation of ribosomes, known as ribophagy (Wyant2018NUFIP1).

NUFIP1 forms a heterodimer with ZNHIT3 and is involved in the assembly of the box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP), interacting with core components like fibrillarin (FBL), NOP58, and SNU13/15.5K (Wyant2018NUFIP1). It also interacts with LC3 in response to cyclic mechanical stress, suggesting a role in the surveillance and degradation of damaged nuclear components through autophagy (Shim2019The). These interactions highlight NUFIP1's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in RNA metabolism and autophagy.
