# CD320

## Overview
The CD320 gene encodes the transcobalamin receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the cellular uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) by binding to transcobalamin-bound cobalamin. This receptor is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family and is characterized by its extracellular domain, which contains LDLR type A domains essential for ligand binding (Quadros2009The; Alam2016Structural). The CD320 protein is predominantly expressed in tissues with high cellular proliferation, such as bone marrow, where it supports vital processes like DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation (Boachie2021Intracellular; Quadros2010Positive). Mutations in the CD320 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as methylmalonic acidemia and neural tube defects, underscoring its importance in vitamin B12 metabolism and cellular function (Pangilinan2022Probing; Quadros2010Positive).

## Structure
The CD320 protein, also known as the transcobalamin receptor, is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. It features an extracellular domain with two LDLR type A (LDLR-A) domains separated by an epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domain, although the exact function of the EGF domain remains undetermined (Alam2016Structural). The primary structure of CD320 consists of 282 amino acids, including a signal peptide, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain (Quadros2009The). The extracellular domain is heavily glycosylated, contributing to the protein's size as observed in SDS-PAGE analysis (Quadros2009The).

The tertiary structure of CD320 includes several disulfide bridges and bound calcium ions, which stabilize the protein (Alam2016Structural). The LDLR-A domains contain central calcium ions bound by conserved acidic residues and backbone carbonyls in an octahedral coordination, and they feature a conserved PLxWRCD motif (Alam2016Structural). The quaternary structure of the CD320-transcobalamin complex is a 1:1 stoichiometry, although mutations in the EGF-like domain can lead to altered quaternary structures (Alam2016Structural). The CD320 protein is involved in the cellular uptake of transcobalamin-bound cobalamin, with high specificity and affinity for transcobalamin (Quadros2009The).

## Function
The CD320 gene encodes the transcobalamin receptor (TCblR), which is essential for the cellular uptake of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in human cells. This receptor binds to transcobalamin (TC) that is saturated with cobalamin, facilitating the internalization of the TC-cobalamin complex into cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis (Gick2020Cellular; Quadros2009The). The receptor is located on the plasma membrane and is particularly active in tissues with high proliferation rates, such as the bone marrow, where it supports DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation (Boachie2021Intracellular; Quadros2010Positive).

The CD320 receptor is crucial for maintaining adequate vitamin B12 levels, which are necessary for the function of enzymes like methionine synthase and methylmalonyl CoA mutase. These enzymes are involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA, respectively, processes vital for DNA synthesis and cellular metabolism (Quadros2009The; Lai2011Downregulation). The expression of the CD320 receptor is linked to the cell cycle, with higher expression in actively proliferating cells and downregulation in quiescent cells, ensuring sufficient cobalamin uptake during periods of increased cellular activity (Gick2020Cellular; Jiang2010Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD320 gene, which encodes the transcobalamin receptor, are associated with several clinical conditions due to impaired vitamin B12 uptake. A notable mutation is the p.E88del variant, a single codon deletion that leads to decreased cellular uptake of cobalamin, resulting in elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (Hcy) (Quadros2010Positive). This mutation has been linked to methylmalonic acidemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of MMA, and is often detected through newborn screening (Quadros2010Positive).

The p.E88del variant has also been associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in certain populations, although its prevalence and impact vary (Pangilinan2022Probing). In some cases, individuals with this variant exhibit neuropsychological issues such as language acquisition deficits and anxiety, though many develop normally (Pangilinan2022Probing).

In mice, the absence of the CD320 receptor leads to anemia and reproductive deficits when on a vitamin B12-deficient diet, highlighting the gene's role in vitamin B12 metabolism and its potential impact on fertility and development (Bernard2018Mice). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CD320 mutations in both metabolic and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
The CD320 protein, also known as the transcobalamin receptor, is involved in the cellular uptake of vitamin B12 by binding to transcobalamin (TC)-bound cobalamin. This interaction is facilitated by the low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLR-A) domains of CD320, which are crucial for ligand binding (Quadros2009The; Pangilinan2022Probing). The interaction between CD320 and TC is characterized by high affinity and specificity, with the LDLR-A2 domain being the primary determinant of high-affinity binding, while LDLR-A1 enhances specificity and affinity (Alam2016Structural). The binding involves a network of electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, including a salt bridge between Arg122 of TC and Glu136 of LDLR-A2 (Alam2016Structural).

The CD320 receptor does not bind to haptocorrin, another cobalamin-binding protein, due to electrostatic differences (Alam2016Structural). The interaction is also pH-dependent, with lower pH reducing the affinity between TC and CD320, which aligns with the expected receptor-ligand segregation during endocytosis (Alam2016Structural). Additionally, the CD320DE88 mutant binds TC tightly in vitro, indicating no compromised binding ability (Alam2016Structural).
