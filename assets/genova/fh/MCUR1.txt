# MCUR1

## Overview
MCUR1, or mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its localization in the inner mitochondrial membrane and its structural features, which include two transmembrane domains and coiled-coil domains. These structural elements are crucial for its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions within the MCU complex, thereby regulating mitochondrial calcium uptake. The MCUR1 protein acts as a scaffold, essential for the assembly and stabilization of the MCU complex, and plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. This regulation is vital for various cellular processes, including energy production and apoptosis. Dysregulation of MCUR1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Alevriadou2021Molecular; Mammucari2017Structure; Ren2018MCUR1Mediated).

## Structure
MCUR1 is characterized by containing two transmembrane domains and coiled-coil domains, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex (Tomar2016MCUR1). The coiled-coil domains facilitate the binding of MCUR1 to MCU and EMRE, which is crucial for the assembly and stabilization of the MCU complex (Tomar2016MCUR1). The interaction between MCUR1 and MCU is specifically mediated through the D1 and D4 regions of MCU and the D3 region of MCUR1, highlighting the importance of these structural domains in the functional assembly of the complex (Tomar2016MCUR1).

In yeast, homologs of MCUR1, such as Put6 and Put7, share structural similarities, including a mitochondrial targeting sequence, a coiled-coil domain, and a transmembrane domain, suggesting a conserved structural framework across species (Zulkifli2020Yeast). These homologs form a large hetero-oligomeric complex in the mitochondrial membrane, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving multiple protein interactions (Zulkifli2020Yeast).

MCUR1 undergoes post-translational processing, as evidenced by a ~28 kDa band observed in SDS-PAGE analysis, which is smaller than the expected ~39 kDa band, indicating the removal of the first 140 amino acid residues at the N-terminus (Zulkifli2020Yeast).

## Function
MCUR1, encoded by the CCDC90A gene, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, which regulates calcium uptake into mitochondria. This protein is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and contains two transmembrane domains. It acts as a scaffold factor necessary for the proper assembly and function of the MCU complex, interacting directly with MCU and EMRE through coiled-coil domains (Alevriadou2021Molecular; Mammucari2017Structure).

MCUR1 plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, which is vital for various cellular functions, including energy production and apoptosis regulation. It modulates mitochondrial calcium uptake, influencing oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Downregulation of MCUR1 leads to decreased mitochondrial calcium uptake, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and impaired ATP synthesis, which can activate AMP kinase-dependent pro-survival autophagy (Mammucari2017Structure; Cui2019Progress).

MCUR1 is also implicated in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly, affecting mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium uptake. This dual role suggests that MCUR1 is involved in both direct regulation of calcium uptake and broader mitochondrial respiratory functions (Pallafacchina2021From; Paupe2015CCDC90A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MCUR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In ovarian cancer, MCUR1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is downregulated by the microRNA miR-4732-5p, which promotes cancer cell viability, migration, and invasion. This downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting that MCUR1 plays a critical role in cancer progression (Li2023miR‑4732‑5p).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MCUR1 is often upregulated, leading to increased mitochondrial calcium uptake and enhanced tumor cell survival and proliferation. This upregulation contributes to cancer progression by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which affects cell survival pathways (Vultur2018The).

MCUR1's role in mitochondrial calcium uptake and its interaction with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of this process has been linked to pathological conditions affecting the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain, although specific mutations in MCUR1 and their direct clinical significance in these diseases are still being explored (Alevriadou2021Molecular).

## Interactions
MCUR1 (mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial calcium uptake. MCUR1 is a component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, where it interacts directly with the MCU itself. This interaction is essential for the regulation of mitochondrial calcium uptake, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation assays that show MCUR1's association with MCU (Ren2018MCUR1Mediated). The interaction between MCUR1 and MCU is critical for maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, which is vital for cell survival, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Ren2018MCUR1Mediated).

In addition to its role in the MCU complex, MCUR1 is implicated in the regulation of the AKT/MDM2/P53 signaling pathway. MCUR1 inactivates P53 through the ROS/AKT/MDM2 pathway, which is important for cell survival under oxidative stress conditions. This interaction affects the levels of phosphorylated AKT and MDM2, leading to changes in P53 expression (Ren2018MCUR1Mediated). These interactions highlight MCUR1's multifaceted role in cellular processes beyond its primary function in mitochondrial calcium regulation.
