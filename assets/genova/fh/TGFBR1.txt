# TGFBR1

## Overview
TGFBR1, or transforming growth factor beta receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase protein, known as activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK-5). This protein is a critical component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, which regulates a wide array of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and homeostasis. TGFBR1 functions by forming a heterotetrameric complex with TGFBR2, facilitating the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad proteins, which then translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene expression. The protein's structure includes a kinase domain and a transmembrane domain, essential for its signaling capabilities. TGFBR1 is implicated in various physiological processes, such as immune response, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis, and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the aortic wall. Mutations in the TGFBR1 gene are associated with connective tissue disorders like Loeys-Dietz syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Bian2005TGFBR1☆6A; Heldin2016Signaling; Loeys2006Aneurysma).

## Structure
The TGFBR1 protein, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK-5), is a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. The primary structure of TGFBR1 consists of 503 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 56.4 kDa. An alternatively spliced isoform exists, comprising 379 amino acids with a molecular weight of 41.7 kDa (Chen2006Isolation).

The secondary structure includes a protein kinase domain, spanning residues 201-491, and a transmembrane domain located between residues 126-148. The protein also features an activin type I and II receptor domain (residues 30-100) and a TGF beta type I GS motif (residues 175-203) (Chen2006Isolation).

In terms of tertiary structure, the kinase domain of TGFBR1 adopts a canonical protein kinase fold, with an N-lobe consisting of a twisted five-stranded β-sheet and a single α helix. The C-lobe is mostly α-helical, containing a catalytic loop with a His-Arg-Asp (HRD) motif and an activation loop initiated by an Asp-Phe/Leu-Gly (DF/LG) motif (Goebel2019Structural).

The quaternary structure involves dimerization with TGFBR2, forming a heterotetramer that is crucial for signaling. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for TGFBR1 activation (Tebben2016Crystal).

## Function
TGFBR1, or transforming growth factor beta receptor 1, is a serine/threonine kinase receptor that plays a pivotal role in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This receptor is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and homeostasis. Upon ligand binding, TGFBR1 forms a complex with TGFBR2, which phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smad proteins (R-Smads). These phosphorylated R-Smads then form complexes with Co-Smad proteins and translocate to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes, influencing cellular responses such as growth inhibition and differentiation (Gordon2008Role; Shi2003Mechanisms).

TGFBR1 is active in several cellular locations, including the cell membrane and cytoplasm, where it influences processes like immune response, wound healing, and embryonic development. It is also involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating extracellular matrix remodeling (Gordon2008Role). In smooth muscle cells, TGFBR1 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the aortic wall, preventing aneurysmal degeneration by regulating signaling pathways such as ERK and AngII/AT1R (Yang2016Smooth). Additionally, TGFBR1 is involved in amelogenesis, promoting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP20, which is crucial for enamel formation (Gao2009TGF‐beta1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGFBR1 gene are associated with several connective tissue disorders and cancers. Notably, TGFBR1 mutations are implicated in Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arterial tortuosity, aneurysms, hypertelorism, and bifid uvula or cleft palate. LDS is caused by heterozygous mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, leading to aggressive arterial aneurysms and a high incidence of pregnancy-related complications (Loeys2006Aneurysma). Specific missense mutations in TGFBR1, such as M318R, D400G, T200I, and R487P, result in a loss of function in the type I transforming growth factor beta receptor, contributing to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Loeys2005A).

TGFBR1 mutations are also linked to conditions resembling Marfan syndrome and familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). These mutations often occur de novo or segregate with the disease in families, suggesting a causative link (Mátyás2006Identification). Additionally, the TGFBR1*6A allele is associated with an increased risk of several cancers, including colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer, and may contribute to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Bian2005TGFBR1☆6A). The Int7G24A intronic variant of TGFBR1 is significantly associated with renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, indicating a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Chen2004An).

## Interactions
TGFBR1, also known as transforming growth factor beta receptor 1, participates in various interactions that regulate TGF-β signaling. It forms a heterotetrameric complex with TGFBR2, which is essential for its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of SMAD proteins, leading to their nuclear translocation and regulation of gene expression (Heldin2016Signaling). TGFBR1 interacts with FKBP12, which binds to its GS domain and inhibits its kinase activity (Heldin2016Signaling). 

Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) interacts with TGFBR1, inhibiting TGF-β/Smad signaling by blocking Smad activation and reducing Smad2 phosphorylation. This interaction occurs in caveolae-enriched microdomains and is mediated by the scaffolding domain of Cav-1 (Razani2001Caveolin1). 

TGFBR1 also forms complexes with various cell-surface proteins, such as CD109, which directs receptor localization to caveolae and promotes degradation, and Neuropilin-1, which modulates Smad phosphorylation (Heldin2016Signaling). Betaglycan, a coreceptor, can bind TGFBR1 and either promote or suppress TGF-β signaling depending on its expression and localization (Heldin2016Signaling). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving TGFBR1 in TGF-β signaling pathways.
