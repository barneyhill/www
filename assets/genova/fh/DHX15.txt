# DHX15

## Overview
The DHX15 gene encodes the DEAH-box helicase 15, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases, which are part of the super-family 2 (SF2) of helicases. This protein is characterized by its conserved helicase core, which includes tandem RecA-like domains and a C-terminal domain, facilitating its role in RNA processing and metabolism (Enders2023Structure; Becker2023Molecular). DEAH-box helicase 15 is primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis, playing a crucial role in the maturation of mRNA and ribosomal subunits, respectively (Abdelhaleem2003The; Bohnsack2021Regulation). Additionally, it participates in the innate immune response by interacting with key signaling proteins and pathways (Kanwal2024Analysis). The clinical significance of DHX15 is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the context (Portolés2024Identification; Ito2017RNA).

## Structure
The DHX15 protein is a DEAH-box helicase, part of the super-family 2 (SF2) of helicases, characterized by a conserved helicase core formed by tandem RecA-like domains (RecA1 and RecA2) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Enders2023Structure; Becker2023Molecular). These domains are connected by flexible linkers, allowing for concerted domain motions essential for its function (Becker2023Molecular). The RecA-like domains form the ATP binding site at their interface and, together with the CTD, create the RNA binding cleft (Becker2023Molecular). The structure of DHX15 includes a RecA1 domain (blue), a RecA2 domain (cyan), and a C-terminal domain (orange) (Becker2023Molecular).

The G-patch motif of ribosome biogenesis factor NKRF binds to DHX15, acting as a flexible brace that enhances RNA affinity and stabilizes a conformation compatible with RNA binding (Studer2020Structural). This interaction restricts the conformational freedom of DHX15, allowing for efficient ATP hydrolysis and RNA translocation (Studer2020Structural). The G-patch motif binds across the helicase surface, tethering the catalytic core to the C-terminal domains, which stabilizes a conformation compatible with RNA binding (Studer2020Structural). The G-patch motif contains conserved glycine residues that provide flexibility, allowing hydrophobic residues to interact with surface cavities on DHX15 (Studer2020Structural).

## Function
DHX15 (DEAH-box helicase 15) is an RNA helicase that plays a significant role in RNA processing and metabolism in human cells. It is primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for the maturation of mRNA molecules before they are translated into proteins. This function is essential for the proper expression of genes and the production of functional proteins in healthy human cells (Abdelhaleem2003The). DHX15 is also crucial in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of ribosomal subunits. It is required for an early pre-rRNA cleavage event at the A' site within the 5' external transcribed spacer of the initial pre-rRNA transcript, a process facilitated by the G-patch protein cofactor NKRF (Bohnsack2021Regulation).

In addition to its role in splicing and ribosome biogenesis, DHX15 is involved in the release of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) from pre-rRNA binding sites, although its exact role in human pre-60S complexes remains to be demonstrated (Bohnsack2021Regulation). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it facilitates the unwinding of RNA structures, which is essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (1 page 6 of 30).

## Clinical Significance
The DHX15 gene has significant clinical implications due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DHX15 is overexpressed and associated with poor patient survival. Its overexpression promotes tumor growth and metastasis, while its deficiency reduces tumor volume and impairs liver metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Portolés2024Identification). Elevated levels of DHX15 in the blood of HCC patients also indicate its potential as a diagnostic marker (Portolés2024Identification).

In glioma, DHX15 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is lower in glioma cell lines compared to normal neural stem cells, and its knockdown enhances cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of DHX15 reduces tumor growth, highlighting its role in inhibiting glioma progression (Ito2017RNA).

DHX15 also plays a crucial role in vascular biology. Its deficiency leads to impaired endothelial energy metabolism, reduced vascular density, and impaired lymphatic drainage, which are critical for tumor metastasis. These findings suggest that DHX15's interaction with Akt1 is significant for endothelial cell function and that its dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression (Ribera2021The).

## Interactions
DHX15, a multifunctional RNA helicase, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene expression processes. It is a component of the RIG-I and MDA5 interactomes, interacting directly with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS to activate the NF-B and MAPK pathways, crucial for the innate immune response to viral infections (Kanwal2024Analysis). DHX15 also interacts with the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 6 (NLRP6), forming condensates with NLRP6 and RNA, which are essential for activating type I and III interferon-stimulated genes and cytokine IL-18 production (Kanwal2024Analysis).

In the context of pre-mRNA splicing, DHX15 interacts with the U6 snRNA and is involved in the disassembly of post-splicing complexes. It is regulated by G-patch proteins, such as Spp382 (Ntr1) in yeast and its human homologue TFIP11, which stimulate its catalytic activity (Kanwal2024Analysis). DHX15 also interacts with CMTR1, inhibiting its methyltransferase activity, and this interaction is mediated by the OB-fold domain of DHX15 and the G-patch domain of CMTR1 (InestaVaquera2017DHX15). These interactions highlight DHX15's role in RNA processing and immune response regulation.
