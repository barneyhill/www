# C11orf98

## Overview
C11orf98 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 98. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in transcriptional regulation and cancer-related signaling pathways. Although the precise functions of C11orf98 remain largely uncharacterized, it is known to interact with several key proteins, including ESR1, ESR2, FOXA1, JUN, and WWP2, suggesting a role in the regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C11orf98 is implicated in nucleolar functions through its interactions with nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin (NCL) (Chu2017Identification; Cao2022Nascent). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its potential importance in fundamental cellular processes (Chu2017Identification). C11orf98 has also been associated with cancer, particularly bladder cancer, where it is linked to poor survival outcomes and is sensitive to CDK7 inhibition (Yang2021CDK7). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the molecular activities and clinical significance of C11orf98.

## Function
C11orf98 is a protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 11, and its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely uncharacterized. However, studies suggest that C11orf98 is involved in the regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity, as indicated by its interactions with proteins such as ESR1, ESR2, FOXA1, JUN, and WWP2. These interactions imply a potential role in transcriptional regulation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The protein is also known to interact with nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin (NCL), which are enriched in its subinteractome, suggesting a possible involvement in nucleolar functions (Chu2017Identification; Cao2022Nascent). The C11orf98 microprotein is highly conserved between humans and mice, indicating its potential importance in cellular processes (Chu2017Identification).

C11orf98 has been identified in the cytoplasm, but its specific molecular activities and cellular roles are not fully detailed (Hwang2020Bioinformatic). The protein's interactions and conservation suggest it may play a significant role in cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation, although further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
C11orf98 has been implicated in bladder cancer, where it is associated with super-enhancers and is sensitive to CDK7 inhibition. High expression levels of C11orf98 are significantly correlated with poor survival outcomes in bladder cancer patients. Functional assays have demonstrated that silencing C11orf98 can significantly suppress bladder cancer cell colony formation, suggesting its role in cancer pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2021CDK7).

In addition to its role in bladder cancer, C11orf98 is involved in protein-protein interactions with nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin (NCL), which are proteins associated with cancer-related pathways. These interactions suggest that C11orf98 may participate in signaling cascades and regulatory networks critical for malignant transformation (Chu2017Identification; Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The gene is also noted for its potential involvement in transcription regulation through interactions with proteins such as ESR1, ESR2, FOXA1, JUN, and WWP2, which are linked to cancer signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of C11orf98 in other diseases remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to clarify its role in cancer and other conditions.

## Interactions
C11orf98 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that suggest its role in transcriptional regulation and cancer-related signaling pathways. It interacts with proteins such as ESR1, ESR2, FOXA1, JUN, and WWP2, indicating its involvement in the regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The interaction with WWP2, particularly, suggests a role in ubiquitination processes, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient of 0.75 in whole blood and -0.55 in thymoma, highlighting potential cancer-specific interactions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C11orf98 is also a putative interaction partner of nucleophosmin (NPM1) and nucleolin (NCL), which are known to be involved in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The subinteractome of C11orf98 is enriched with oncoproteins, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways. This includes interactions with proteins like FOXA1, JUN, and MYC, which are critical in transcriptional regulation and oncogenic processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory role of C11orf98 in transcription factor activity and its involvement in cancer-associated molecular pathways.
