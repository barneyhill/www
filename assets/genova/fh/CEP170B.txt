# CEP170B

## Overview
The CEP170B gene encodes the centrosomal protein 170B, which is a member of the centrosomal protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the organization and function of the centrosome, a critical cellular structure that plays a key role in microtubule organization and cell cycle progression. Centrosomal protein 170B is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell division and maintenance of genomic stability. Mutations or dysregulation of CEP170B have been associated with certain pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance in disease contexts. The protein's role in the centrosome suggests it may be involved in pathways that are crucial for proper cell function and division (Qiu2020aarFDC).
