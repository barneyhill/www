# RAB23

## Overview
RAB23 is a gene that encodes the RAB23 protein, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are pivotal in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The RAB23 protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, and is integral to the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, a critical pathway for developmental processes such as cerebellar development and granule cell precursor proliferation (Davie2017The; Hor2021Multifaceted). As a negative regulator of the Shh pathway, RAB23 influences ciliary function and planar cell polarity, interacting with various proteins to modulate signaling activities (Gerondopoulos2019Planar). Mutations in the RAB23 gene are associated with Carpenter syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly, underscoring its clinical significance (Jenkins2007RAB23; Jenkins2011Carpenter).

## Structure
The RAB23 protein is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. The primary structure of RAB23 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific domains such as the GTP-binding domain, which is crucial for its function as a molecular switch cycling between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states (Park2013Structural; Davie2017The).

The secondary structure of RAB23 includes conserved motifs like the P-loop, Switch I, and Switch II regions, which are typical of the Rab family and are essential for nucleotide binding and regulatory activity (Park2013Structural). The tertiary structure of RAB23, as predicted by 3D protein modeling, closely resembles experimentally solved crystal structures, with the GTP-binding pocket and protein interaction surfaces being colocated (Davie2017The).

RAB23 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins. Phosphorylation sites on RAB23 have been identified, and these modifications are linked to cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation (Waschbüsch2020Phosphorylation). However, specific details about the quaternary structure, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms of RAB23 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
RAB23 is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes, including cerebellar development and granule cell precursor proliferation. In healthy cells, RAB23 acts as a repressor of the Shh pathway, influencing the basal level of Shh signaling and facilitating primary cilium-dependent extrinsic Shh signaling activation (Hor2021Multifaceted). RAB23 is involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis and modulates Shh pathway activities through interactions with components like Smoothened (Smo) and Gli transcription factors. It promotes the proteolytic cleavage of Gli3 into its repressor form and regulates the protein turnover dynamics of Smo in the primary cilium (Hor2021Multifaceted).

RAB23 is also implicated in cilium formation and planar cell polarity, activated by the Inturned (Intu) and Fuzzy (Fuz) proteins, which form a specific GEF complex for RAB23. This complex is crucial for cilium formation, as depletion of either Intu or Fuz compromises this process (Gerondopoulos2019Planar). RAB23's role in ciliary function and planar cell polarity is essential for maintaining proper cellular signaling and development (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB23 gene are primarily associated with Carpenter syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by craniosynostosis, polysyndactyly, obesity, and other congenital malformations. The majority of Carpenter syndrome cases result from homozygous truncating mutations in RAB23, with a significant founder effect observed in some populations (Jenkins2007RAB23; Jenkins2011Carpenter). These mutations lead to a loss of function in the RAB23 protein, which is a member of the Rab-family of small GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking and a negative regulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Jenkins2007RAB23; Seixas2013Rab).

The L145X nonsense mutation is particularly common among patients of northern European descent, suggesting a shared ancestral origin (Jenkins2007RAB23). Other mutations, such as missense mutations and splice-site mutations, have also been identified, expanding the mutation spectrum of RAB23 (BenSalem2012A; Jenkins2011Carpenter). These mutations can lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which reduces the presence of mutant transcripts and contributes to the disease phenotype (Jenkins2011Carpenter).

In addition to Carpenter syndrome, RAB23 mutations in mice have been linked to neural tube defects and embryonic lethality, highlighting the gene's critical role in development (Banworth2017Consequences). However, in humans, RAB23 mutations do not frequently contribute to craniosynostosis or limb malformations outside of Carpenter syndrome (Jenkins2007RAB23).

## Interactions
RAB23, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator of this pathway by interacting with the Gli1 transcription factor in a Suppressor of Fused (Su(Fu))-dependent manner. RAB23 inhibits Gli1 function by reducing its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, a process that requires its GTPase activity (Chi2012Rab23). The interaction between RAB23 and Su(Fu) is crucial, as demonstrated by the lack of RAB23's inhibitory effect on Gli1 in Su(Fu) null fibroblasts (Chi2012Rab23).

RAB23 also plays a role in ciliary trafficking, particularly affecting the Hedgehog pathway receptor Smoothened (Smo). It regulates the ciliary levels of Smo, suggesting a role in protein recycling within the cilium (Boehlke2010Differential). RAB23's interaction with early endosomal markers like EEA1 and Rab5Q79L, but not with late endosomal markers, indicates its involvement in early endosomal and recycling compartments (Evans2003Rab23). These interactions highlight RAB23's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and trafficking processes.
