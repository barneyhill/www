# TACC1

## Overview
TACC1, or transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the TACC family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal TACC domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function in cellular processes, particularly in mitotic spindle dynamics and transcriptional regulation. The TACC1 protein is involved in the organization of microtubules and centrosomes, playing a crucial role in cell division and genomic stability (Gergely2000The; Thakur2013Role). Additionally, TACC1 acts as a coactivator for nuclear hormone receptors, such as thyroid hormone receptors and retinoic acid receptors, influencing transcriptional regulation (Guyot2010The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components and its post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Aurora-C kinase, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular organization and function (Gabillard2011AuroraC). TACC1's involvement in oncogenic pathways and its dual role as an oncogene and tumor suppressor in different cancer types highlight its clinical significance (Cully2005Transforming; Xu2021Loss).

## Structure
TACC1, a member of the transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC) protein family, is characterized by a conserved C-terminal TACC domain, approximately 200 amino acids in length, which is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure. This domain is crucial for the protein's localization to centrosomes and microtubules, playing a significant role in mitotic spindle dynamics (Gergely2000The; Thakur2013Role). The N-terminal region of TACC1 varies in sequence and length, contributing to the diversity of its isoforms produced through alternative splicing. These isoforms may have distinct functions, particularly in their interactions with nuclear elements and chromatin remodeling complexes (Still2004Structurefunction).

TACC1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as Aurora-C, which phosphorylates TACC1 on serine 228. This modification is important for its function during cytokinesis (Gabillard2011AuroraC). TACC1 interacts with several proteins, including the microtubule-associated protein ch-TOG and the transcription factor GAS41/NuBI1, suggesting its involvement in multiple protein complexes within the cell (LAUFFART2002Interaction). The protein's ability to form ordered polymeric structures in the cytoplasm further underscores its structural and functional roles in cellular organization (Gergely2000The).

## Function
TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1) is involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) such as thyroid hormone receptors (TR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR). TACC1 acts as a coactivator, enhancing transcriptional activation by TRα and RARα, and is essential for the regulatory activity of these receptors. It interacts with these receptors in the absence of ligands, suggesting its role in modulating transcriptional activity when NRs are unliganded (Guyot2010The).

TACC1 is also involved in the organization of transcription in NR-complexes, potentially interacting with coactivators and chromatin remodelers. It influences the nuclear localization of TRα1 and RARα, affecting their availability to target genes (Guyot2010The). Beyond transcriptional regulation, TACC1 is implicated in mitotic spindle assembly and dynamics, contributing to proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation during cell division (Gergely2000The; Thakur2013Role). TACC1's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
The TACC1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell survival and transformation. In breast cancer, TACC1 is located within a chromosomal region frequently amplified, suggesting its potential as an oncogene. Overexpression of TACC1 can transform fibroblasts and cooperate with oncogenic Ras to induce transformation, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Cully2005Transforming). In gastric cancer, TACC1 overexpression is associated with poorly differentiated tumors and is an independent prognostic factor for shorter survival, indicating its potential as a marker for aggressive cancer types (Ding2013Impact).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the TACC1 variant 25 (TACC1v25) is downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and promotes autophagy, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. This variant affects the ERK and AKT/mTOR pathways, which are crucial in cancer progression (Xu2021Loss). TACC1's interactions with the PI3K/Akt pathway and its ability to prevent apoptosis further underscore its significance in cancer biology (Cully2005Transforming). These findings highlight the complex role of TACC1 in cancer, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context and specific variant involved.

## Interactions
TACC1 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1) is known to interact with a variety of nuclear receptors and other proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. TACC1 interacts with several nuclear receptors, including thyroid hormone receptors (TR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR), particularly in their unliganded forms. It has been shown to interact more significantly with TRα2 than with TRα1, and these interactions are influenced by specific amino acids in TACC1, such as Leu 609 and Ile 610 (Guyot2010The). TACC1 also interacts with other nuclear receptors like RARα, RXRα, PPARγ, GR, and ERα, with these interactions being reduced upon ligand binding (Guyot2010The).

In addition to its interactions with nuclear receptors, TACC1 is phosphorylated by Aurora-C kinase at serine 228, indicating a specific interaction and modification site. This phosphorylation was confirmed through in vitro experiments and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Gabillard2011AuroraC). TACC1 is also involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during mitosis, interacting with centrosomal proteins and microtubules, although it is not as concentrated at centrosomes as other TACC family members (Gergely2000The). These interactions highlight TACC1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential involvement in oncogenic pathways.
