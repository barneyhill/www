# HDLBP

## Overview
The HDLBP gene encodes the high-density lipoprotein binding protein, commonly referred to as vigilin, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein characterized by its 15 hnRNP K homology (KH) domains. These domains facilitate the binding of HDLBP to a wide array of RNA molecules, playing a significant role in the regulation of translation and mRNA stability (Zinnall2022HDLBP; Cheng2017A). The protein is involved in lipid metabolism and transport, particularly in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis by interacting with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Bu1994Linkage; Gurda2015Homocysteine). HDLBP's interactions with ribosomal components and its involvement in cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking underscore its importance in both RNA and lipid metabolic pathways (Zinnall2022HDLBP). The gene's expression and function are linked to various physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders, making it a subject of ongoing research (Zinnall2022HDLBP; Kim2015Proteogenomic).

## Structure
The human gene HDLBP encodes the high-density lipoprotein binding protein, also known as vigilin. This protein is characterized by its 15 hnRNP K homology (KH) domains, which are RNA-binding motifs crucial for its function (Zinnall2022HDLBP; Cheng2017A). The KH domains are typically involved in recognizing tetranucleotide sequences, and in HDLBP, they facilitate binding to a wide range of RNA molecules, including more than 80% of ER-localized mRNAs (Zinnall2022HDLBP). The C-terminal KH domains, particularly KH13 and KH14, serve as the main mRNA-binding interface (Cheng2017A).

The primary structure of HDLBP includes a sequence of amino acids that form these KH domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding capabilities. While the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the provided context, the modular nature of the KH domains suggests a structure that supports multivalent interactions with RNA (Zinnall2022HDLBP). HDLBP is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of translation and mRNA stability, and it interacts with components of the translational apparatus, such as ribosomes and tRNAs (Zinnall2022HDLBP; Cheng2017A).

## Function
The HDLBP gene encodes the high-density lipoprotein binding protein, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. This protein is involved in binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis within the body. HDLBP is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle trafficking, which are vital for the transport and regulation of cholesterol levels (Bu1994Linkage; Gurda2015Homocysteine).

In healthy human cells, HDLBP contributes to the regulation of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, which is important for cardiovascular health. The protein's involvement in lipid transport pathways suggests that it may influence the functionality of HDL, potentially impacting processes like cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (Dergunov2023Differential; Wang2011PathwayWide). The gene's expression and activity are also linked to the regulation of sterol transport and metabolism, highlighting its role in complex lipid metabolic processes (Wang2011PathwayWide). The precise molecular mechanisms by which HDLBP influences these pathways remain an area of active research.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HDLBP gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. HDLBP is crucial for protein synthesis and cellular processes, particularly in secretory cell types such as fibroblasts, pancreatic, and immune cells. Misregulation of HDLBP can lead to impaired viral replication, atherosclerotic plaque formation, and autism (Zinnall2022HDLBP). In cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, HDLBP plays a significant role in tumor initiation and growth. Deletion of HDLBP in A549 cells has been shown to reduce tumor growth in vivo, indicating its oncogenic properties (Zinnall2022HDLBP). A nonsynonymous mutation in HDLBP (S61A) has been identified in lung cancer tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Kim2015Proteogenomic).

HDLBP is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases. Its knockdown in atherosclerosis-prone mice leads to reduced atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its potential as a target for cardiovascular research (Zinnall2022HDLBP). Additionally, HDLBP has been associated with obesity in the context of specific chromosomal deletions (D’Angelo2014Investigation). These findings suggest that HDLBP's regulatory role in various biological processes may contribute to its involvement in multiple disease phenotypes.

## Interactions
The HDLBP protein, also known as high density lipoprotein binding protein, is involved in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with components of the translational apparatus, including the 40S ribosomal subunit and the signal recognition particle (SRP). HDLBP binds to 18S rRNA at expansion segment 6SB and helix 16, which are near the binding sites of eukaryotic initiation and elongation factors such as EIF4A, EIF4G1, and EEF2 (Zinnall2022HDLBP). It also interacts with the 7SL RNA component of the SRP, displaying distinct binding patterns compared to other RNA-binding proteins (Zinnall2022HDLBP).

HDLBP is known to bind ER-targeted mRNAs through multivalent interactions, particularly recognizing long CU-rich motifs within the coding sequences of these mRNAs (Zinnall2022HDLBP). It also binds to tRNAs, especially those decoding CU/UU-containing codons, which may facilitate tRNA recycling or reduce tRNA diffusion from the ribosome (Zinnall2022HDLBP). The protein's interactions with ribosomal components and its proximity to EEF2 and EIF4G2 binding sites suggest a role in influencing ribosome elongation arrest, crucial for efficient targeting and translocation of nascent peptides to the ER lumen (Zinnall2022HDLBP).
