# DSG4

## Overview
Desmoglein 4 (DSG4) is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein desmoglein 4, a member of the desmosomal cadherin family involved in cell-cell adhesion. This protein is integral to the structure and function of desmosomes, which are specialized adhesive junctions that provide mechanical strength to tissues, particularly in the epidermis and hair follicles. Desmoglein 4 is predominantly expressed in highly differentiated keratinocytes and trichocytes, playing a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the skin and hair. Mutations in the DSG4 gene are linked to various hair and skin disorders, including localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis and monilethrix, which are characterized by hair fragility and sparse hair growth. The protein's expression and function are regulated through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, underscoring its importance in tissue cohesion and response to mechanical stress (Bazzi2006Desmoglein; Schaffer2006Mutations).

## Structure
Desmoglein 4 (DSG4) is a cadherin-type cell adhesion molecule that is part of the desmosomal cadherin family. The primary structure of DSG4 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which includes specific domains such as the cadherin domain. The extracellular domain of DSG4 has been expressed as a 91.7-kDa protein using baculovirus and as a 98.6-kDa protein in CHO cells, with the difference attributed to glycosylation, a common post-translational modification (Nagasaka2004Defining). DSG4 is expressed in highly differentiated keratinocytes and trichocytes, particularly in the hair shaft cortex and the granular layer of the epidermis (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). 

The protein is localized to desmosomes, which are structures that provide mechanical support to tissues, and it co-localizes with desmoplakin, a desmosomal plaque protein (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). DSG4 is the last desmoglein expressed during keratinocyte differentiation and is uniquely expressed in the hair cortex (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). The study of DSG4's molecular structure has involved the production of recombinant proteins, focusing on the extracellular domain, which includes the signal peptide and prosequence (Nagasaka2004Defining).

## Function
Desmoglein 4 (DSG4) is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion, particularly within desmosomes, which are specialized structures that provide mechanical support to tissues under stress. DSG4 is predominantly expressed in highly differentiated keratinocytes and trichocytes in the human epidermis and hair follicles. In the epidermis, DSG4 is found in the upper spinous and granular layers, where it contributes to the structural integrity and stability of the skin by localizing to desmosomes and interacting with the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (Bazzi2006Desmoglein).

In hair follicles, DSG4 is highly expressed in the hair cortex, lower hair cuticle, and upper inner root sheath cuticle, where it colocalizes with desmoplakin, a desmosomal plaque protein. This expression pattern is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the hair shaft, as mutations in DSG4 are associated with hypotrichosis, a condition characterized by sparse hair (Bazzi2006Desmoglein).

DSG4's expression is regulated at the transcriptional level and possibly through post-translational modifications, aligning with the expression of other differentiation markers during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). Its role in desmosomes underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the epidermis and hair follicles, particularly in areas subjected to high mechanical stress (Bazzi2006Desmoglein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSG4 gene are associated with several hair and skin disorders. Localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH) is characterized by fragile, sparse hair on the scalp, trunk, and limbs. This condition is caused by biallelic missense or deletion mutations in DSG4, which disrupt keratinocyte adhesion and the normal transition from proliferation to differentiation in hair follicles (Lee2020Mutations; Schaffer2006Mutations). A specific recurrent in-frame deletion in Pakistani families removes exons 5-8, leading to the loss of essential domains for dimerization and cadherin interaction (Lee2020Mutations).

DSG4 mutations also cause monilethrix, a condition marked by hair fragility and a beaded appearance of the hair shaft. The overlap between LAH and monilethrix can complicate clinical diagnosis, necessitating light microscopy to identify the characteristic node-internode configuration of monilethrix (Lee2020Mutations). Additionally, DSG4 mutations have been linked to keratosis pilaris atrophicans, presenting with localized hypotrichosis of the eyebrows and eyelashes, along with generalized keratotic follicular papules (CohenBarak2018Desmoglein).

Altered DSG4 expression is also implicated in inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis. Reduced DSG4 mRNA levels have been observed in psoriasis patients, suggesting a role in exacerbating skin inflammation and psoriasiform dermatitis (MorenoSosa2021Desmoglein4).

## Interactions
Desmoglein 4 (DSG4) is a desmosomal cadherin that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion within epithelial tissues, particularly in the epidermis and hair follicles. DSG4 is incorporated into desmosomes, where it co-localizes with desmoplakin (DP), a desmosomal plaque protein, indicating a physical interaction within these structures (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, as desmosomes are key components in cell adhesion (Bazzi2006Desmoglein).

DSG4 is expressed in highly differentiated keratinocytes and trichocytes, where it is involved in the terminal differentiation process. Its expression coincides with other differentiation markers such as cytokeratin 1 and protein kinase C delta (PKCd), suggesting a role in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (Bazzi2006Desmoglein). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may influence its interactions and molecular weight (Bazzi2006Desmoglein).

Mutations in DSG4 disrupt its function, leading to hair and skin disorders such as localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis. These mutations affect DSG4's ability to maintain proper cell-cell adhesion, highlighting its critical role in hair shaft integrity and epidermal cohesion (Schaffer2006Mutations).
