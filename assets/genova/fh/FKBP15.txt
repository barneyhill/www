# FKBP15

## Overview
FKBP15 is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase family member 15, which is part of the FKBP (FK506-binding protein) family. This protein functions primarily as a chaperone, facilitating protein folding and trafficking within cells by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. FKBP15 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. It is particularly significant in the context of dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs), where it influences osteogenic differentiation by interacting with the actin filament system. This interaction affects cell shape and spreading, which are vital for osteogenesis. FKBP15's involvement in the miR-7974/FKBP15 pathway further underscores its role in cytoskeletal stability and bone tissue engineering (Zheng2023M6A). Additionally, FKBP15 has been implicated in various diseases, including Parkinson's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2022Penetrating; Seaman2014Analysis).

## Function
FKBP15, a member of the FKBP prolyl isomerase family, is involved in protein folding and trafficking within cells. It functions as a chaperone, assisting in the proper folding of proteins by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues. FKBP15 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control. In the context of dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs), FKBP15 is implicated in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation. It interacts with the actin filament system, affecting cell shape and spreading, which are crucial for osteogenesis. Overexpression of FKBP15 inhibits the reorganization of the actin filament system, leading to a downregulation of osteogenic-related genes and a decrease in calcium deposits, suggesting its role in inhibiting osteogenesis by affecting cytoskeletal remodeling (Zheng2023M6A). FKBP15 is also involved in the miR-7974/FKBP15 pathway, where its expression is regulated by miR-7974, impacting the stability of the actin cytoskeleton and osteogenic differentiation (Zheng2023M6A). The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular structure and function, particularly in the context of bone tissue engineering and dental development (Zheng2023M6A).

## Clinical Significance
FKBP15 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), FKBP15 is associated with the retromer and WASH complexes. The VPS35 D620N mutation, linked to PD, affects the association with FKBP15, suggesting a potential mechanism involving FKBP15 and LRRK2, another protein associated with both PD and inflammatory bowel disease (Seaman2014Analysis).

In cancer, FKBP15 expression is notably altered. It is upregulated in breast cancer patients and is associated with immune cell infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In LUAD, FKBP15 expression is positively correlated with various immune cells, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils, indicating its role in the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression (Wang2022Penetrating).

Additionally, FKBP15 is involved in a genetic rearrangement with the PAX5 gene in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), forming the fusion gene PAX5::FKBP15. This rearrangement is part of the PAX5alt subtype, which accounts for a significant portion of B-ALL cases (Črepinšek2024PAX5). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FKBP15 in various diseases.

## Interactions
FKBP15, also known as FKBP133, is involved in interactions with the actin filament system through its WH1 domain, which is crucial for intracellular cargo transport and changes in cell shape and spreading. This interaction is significant for the osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs) (Zheng2023M6A). Immunofluorescence studies have shown that FKBP15 co-localizes with actin filaments in DFSCs, and its overexpression inhibits the reorganization of the actin filament system, affecting cell reshaping and spreading (Zheng2023M6A).

The role of FKBP15 in actin cytoskeleton remodeling is essential for osteogenesis, as demonstrated by differences in cytoskeleton organization between control and FKBP15-overexpressing DFSCs. Control DFSCs exhibit a fibroblast-like phenotype with spreading filopodia, while FKBP15-overexpressing cells have a square-like shape with fewer filopodia (Zheng2023M6A). The specific mechanisms of FKBP15 binding to the actin cytoskeleton and affecting its recombination require further validation (Zheng2023M6A).

FKBP15 is also a direct target of miR-7974, with its expression being modulated by miR-7974 mimics and inhibitors. This interaction plays a role in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation in DFSCs (Zheng2023M6A).
