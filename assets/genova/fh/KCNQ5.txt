# KCNQ5

## Overview
KCNQ5 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 5 (Kv7.5), a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability. This protein is part of the KCNQ family of potassium channels, which are characterized by their involvement in generating M-type currents, essential for stabilizing the resting membrane potential and modulating action potential firing in neurons (Schroeder2000KCNQ5). Kv7.5 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, where it contributes to synaptic inhibition and network oscillations (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5). The protein's structure includes six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming P-loop, typical of voltage-gated potassium channels, and it functions as a tetramer (Howard2007Structural). Mutations in KCNQ5 have been associated with various neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy, underscoring its clinical significance (Lehman2017LossofFunction).

## Structure
The KCNQ5 gene encodes a potassium channel protein that is part of the KCNQ family, characterized by its role in mediating M-type currents. The primary structure of the KCNQ5 protein consists of 897 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 99 kDa (Schroeder2000KCNQ5). The protein includes six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming P-loop, which are typical features of voltage-gated potassium channels (Schroeder2000KCNQ5). 

The secondary structure involves these transmembrane domains forming alpha helices, which are crucial for the channel's function. The tertiary structure is defined by the folding of these helices, contributing to the channel's ability to selectively conduct potassium ions. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the channel as a tetramer, which is a common feature among voltage-gated potassium channels (Howard2007Structural).

KCNQ5 also contains a conserved cytoplasmic region known as the A-domain, which is involved in subunit interactions and is critical for channel assembly (Howard2007Structural; Schroeder2000KCNQ5). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate the channel's activity. Several splice variants of KCNQ5 exist, including those expressed in the brain and skeletal muscle, which exhibit different gating kinetics (Schroeder2000KCNQ5).

## Function
The KCNQ5 gene encodes a potassium channel that plays a significant role in regulating neuronal excitability by controlling the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. This channel is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, where it contributes to the modulation of synaptic inhibition and network oscillations (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5). KCNQ5 channels are involved in generating M-type currents, which are crucial for stabilizing the resting membrane potential and modulating action potential firing in neurons (Schroeder2000KCNQ5).

In the hippocampus, KCNQ5 is localized to the postsynaptic site of inhibitory synapses on pyramidal cells and interneurons, where it helps dampen synaptic inhibition and shape network synchronization (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5). The channel's activity is modulated by muscarinic receptors, and it can be inhibited by M1 muscarinic receptor activation, which affects neuronal excitability (Schroeder2000KCNQ5). KCNQ5 also plays a role in controlling the resting properties and release probability of synapses, influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Huang2011KCNQ5). Its function is essential for maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, which is critical for normal cognitive and neural function (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNQ5 gene, which encodes the Kv7.5 potassium channel, are linked to several neurological disorders, including intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathy. These mutations can manifest as either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, both of which affect neuronal excitability. Loss-of-function mutations, such as p.Val145Gly and p.Leu341Ile, lead to a depolarizing shift in the activation curve and reduced channel expression, resulting in decreased neuronal repolarization reserve and a lowered seizure threshold (Lehman2017LossofFunction). Gain-of-function mutations, like p.Pro369Arg, stabilize the activated state of the channel, increasing neuronal excitability and potentially causing severe phenotypes such as infantile spasms and tonic seizures (Lehman2017LossofFunction).

Alterations in KCNQ5 expression are also associated with other conditions. Down-regulation of KCNQ5 is observed in presbycusis, an age-related hearing loss, due to DNA hypermethylation, which may contribute to the development of this condition (Bouzid2018Downexpression). Additionally, KCNQ5 polymorphisms have been linked to myopia, and its down-regulation is noted in presbycusis (Manville2019KCNQ5). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNQ5 in various neurological and sensory disorders.

## Interactions
KCNQ5, a member of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q, is known to interact with various proteins, influencing its function and regulation. It can form heteromeric channels with KCNQ3, which enhances current amplitude when co-expressed at low ratios, suggesting a potential interaction that affects channel properties (Schroeder2000KCNQ5). This interaction is further supported by changes in sensitivity to tetraethylammonium (TEA), a potassium channel blocker, indicating heteromeric channel formation (Schroeder2000KCNQ5).

KCNQ5 is also involved in synaptic inhibition in the hippocampus, where it localizes to postsynaptic sites at inhibitory synapses. It co-localizes with gephyrin, a postsynaptic marker for GABAergic and glycinergic synapses, but not with presynaptic markers like bassoon, indicating its postsynaptic role (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5). This localization suggests that KCNQ5 participates in modulating synaptic inhibition and network oscillations, particularly in the CA3 area of the hippocampus (Fidzinski2015KCNQ5).

The A-domain of KCNQ5, a conserved structural feature among Kv7 subtypes, plays a role in channel assembly and interaction with other Kv7 subunits, such as Kv7.3, facilitating the formation of functional heteromeric channels (Howard2007Structural).
