# SLC38A7

## Overview
SLC38A7 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 7, also known as SNAT7, which is a sodium-coupled amino acid transporter. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 38 and is characterized by its role in the transport of amino acids, particularly glutamine, across cell membranes. SLC38A7 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, contributing to the recycling of glutamate and maintaining amino acid homeostasis. The protein's structure includes a 5+5 inverted repeat fold, typical of the bacterial LeuT structure, and it is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its broad functional significance. SLC38A7 is implicated in adaptive responses to nutritional stress and is co-expressed with lysosomes in certain cell types, mediating the flux of amino acids essential for cellular growth and function (Pochini2014Membrane; Hellsten2018Nutritional; Crocco2022The).

## Structure
The SLC38A7 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 38, which is characterized by a 5+5 inverted repeat fold typical of the bacterial LeuT structure (Pochini2014Membrane). The protein is composed of 461 amino acids and is encoded by the SLC38A7 gene located on chromosome 16q21 (Pochini2014Membrane). The human and rat SNAT7 proteins, which are part of the SLC38 family, have extracellular C-and N-terminals, and no N-glycosylation sites have been predicted. However, phosphorylation sites, including a PKC binding site (T174) and a PKA binding site (T179), have been identified in the human isoform (Pochini2014Membrane).

The SLC38A7 protein is part of system N transporters, which are involved in the uptake of amino acids such as glutamine, alanine, asparagine, histidine, and arginine (Pochini2014Membrane). While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SLC38A7 are not provided, the protein's structural characteristics are inferred from its homology to other members of the SLC38 family and its role in amino acid transport. The protein is ubiquitously expressed, indicating its broad functional significance across different tissues (Pochini2014Membrane).

## Function
SLC38A7, also known as SNAT7, is a sodium-coupled amino acid transporter primarily involved in the transport of glutamine across cell membranes. It plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis, particularly in the brain, where it is highly expressed in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (Crocco2022The). SLC38A7 is implicated in the reuptake and recycling of glutamate, an essential excitatory neurotransmitter, thereby contributing to the regulation of neurotransmitter levels and preventing excitotoxicity in neuronal cells (Crocco2022The).

In the context of amino acid starvation, SLC38A7 is transcriptionally upregulated, suggesting its involvement in adaptive responses to nutritional stress. However, its protein expression remains stable, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism that ensures consistent amino acid transport under varying conditions (Hellsten2018Nutritional). SLC38A7 is also co-expressed with lysosomes in certain cell types, mediating the flux of glutamine and asparagine, which is vital for cellular growth and function (Hellsten2018Nutritional).

Overall, SLC38A7's function in healthy human cells is centered on its role as a transporter and sensor of amino acids, contributing to neurotransmission and cellular metabolism (Hellsten2018Nutritional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SLC38A7 gene have been associated with various health conditions, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9806843 in the SLC38A7 gene has been linked to a reduced risk of diabetic retinopathy, a common vascular complication of T2D. This SNP is thought to exert a protective effect by influencing the expression of SLC38A7, which plays a role in glutamine transport and the reuptake and recycling of glutamate in neurons. Excess glutamate can be toxic to retinal neurons, suggesting that SLC38A7 may help mitigate this risk by maintaining glutamate homeostasis (Crocco2022The).

SLC38A7 is also implicated in the glutamine-glutamate/GABA cycle, which is crucial for synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter balance. Disruptions in this cycle can lead to excitotoxicity, a condition linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although the direct clinical significance of SLC38A7 mutations in these diseases is not fully established, its role in neurotransmitter regulation suggests potential implications for neurological health (Kandasamy2018Amino).

## Interactions
SLC38A7, a member of the solute carrier family, is involved in amino acid transport and has been identified as a transporter for the drug anastrozole. The protein interacts with ALPPL2, another gene of interest, affecting its expression and function. Overexpression of SLC38A7 in HEK293T cells increases anastrozole uptake, while co-overexpression with ALPPL2 reduces this uptake, likely due to decreased SLC38A7 expression (Dudenkov2019Anastrozole). This interaction suggests that ALPPL2 may regulate SLC38A7 expression, influencing anastrozole transport across the plasma membrane (Dudenkov2019Anastrozole).

The study also highlights an epistatic interaction between SLC38A7 and ALPPL2, where specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes are associated with altered plasma concentrations of anastrozole. The minor allele of the SNP rs11648166 in SLC38A7 is linked to increased expression, while the minor allele of rs28845026 in ALPPL2 is associated with decreased expression. This genetic interaction results in higher anastrozole concentrations in individuals homozygous for the minor alleles of both SNPs, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism between these genes (Dudenkov2019Anastrozole).
