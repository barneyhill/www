# HECTD3

## Overview
HECTD3 is a gene that encodes the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 3, a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by its C-terminal HECT domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins. HECTD3 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, immune responses, and protein degradation pathways. It is involved in non-degradative polyubiquitination of apoptosis-related proteins and mediates the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of other proteins, impacting cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The protein's interactions with substrates such as MALT1, caspase-8, and TRAF3 underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing immune responses. HECTD3's activity is modulated by factors like HER2/ERK and miR-153, and it is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and cardiac conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rangrez2020The; Jiang2019The; Li2018HECTD3).

## Structure
HECTD3 is a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, characterized by a C-terminal HECT domain essential for its ligase activity. This domain is divided into two lobes: the N-lobe, which contains the E2 binding motif, and the C-lobe, where the catalytic cysteine (C832) is located. These lobes are connected by a flexible hinge, allowing for the necessary conformational changes during ubiquitin transfer (Lorenz2017Structural; Jiang2019The).

The protein consists of 861 amino acids and includes an N-terminal DOC domain (residues 219-397) responsible for substrate binding (Jiang2019The). HECTD3 also has two known phosphorylation sites at the N-terminus, S12 and T157, which may regulate its activity (Jiang2019The).

HECTD3 interacts with various substrates, such as MALT1, caspase-8, caspase-9, and TRAF3, often through non-degradative polyubiquitination pathways (Jiang2019The). The protein's activity and expression are influenced by factors like HER2/ERK and miR-153 (Jiang2019The). Despite its functional significance, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, specific folds, or splice variant isoforms of HECTD3 is not available in the current literature (Lorenz2017Structural; Jiang2019The).

## Function
HECTD3 encodes a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its ability to modify substrate proteins via ubiquitination. In healthy human cells, HECTD3 is involved in the nondegradative polyubiquitination of apoptosis-related proteins such as MALT1, caspase-8, and caspase-9, which contributes to the regulation of immune responses and drug resistance in cancer cells (Jiang2019The). It also mediates the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of proteins like Tara and CRAF, impacting cell cycle regulation and the MAPK pathway (Jiang2019The).

HECTD3 is active in the regulation of type I interferon production by mediating the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3, which is essential for the stabilization of the TRAF3-TBK1 complex. This complex is necessary for the TRIF- and STING-dependent induction of type I IFN, particularly during bacterial infections (Li2018HECTD3). HECTD3's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating apoptosis, immune responses, and protein degradation pathways (Jiang2019The). The protein is active in various cellular compartments, influencing processes like cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, which are vital for the proper functioning of immune responses and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
HECTD3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in protein ubiquitination. In cancer, HECTD3 is associated with prosurvival functions and chemoresistance. It is overexpressed in breast cancer, leading to cisplatin resistance through the stabilization of MALT1, and promotes survival by ubiquitinating caspase-8. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, it contributes to cisplatin resistance by blocking caspase-9 activation. Conversely, in ovarian cancer, downregulation of HECTD3 enhances carboplatin-induced apoptosis. High HECTD3 mRNA levels correlate with poor prognosis in liver, brain, ovarian, and uterine cancers, but with favorable outcomes in thyroid and lung cancers (Jiang2019The).

Beyond cancer, HECTD3 is implicated in cardiac diseases. It attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation by modulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly affecting SUMO2-sumoylated proteins and STAT1 signaling. Overexpression of HECTD3 in mice reduces pathological hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration, suggesting its protective role in cardiac conditions (Rangrez2020The; Goto2021The). These findings highlight HECTD3's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and cardiac diseases.

## Interactions
HECTD3, a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with MALT1 through its DOC domain, promoting MALT1's polyubiquitination and stability, which is linked to cisplatin resistance in cancer cells (Li2013The). HECTD3 also interacts with caspase-8, catalyzing K63-linked polyubiquitination to prevent its recruitment into the TRAIL-induced DISC, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Jiang2019The).

HECTD3 binds to Stat3, modifying it with K27-linked polyubiquitin chains, and interacts with TRAF3, promoting its interaction with TBK1 and subsequent phosphorylation events (Jiang2019The). It also interacts with Syntaxin 8, promoting its ubiquitination, which may be relevant in neurodegenerative diseases (Zhang2008Interaction).

In the context of inflammation, HECTD3 interacts with NLRP3, inhibiting its inflammasome assembly and activation by blocking the NLRP3-NEK7 interaction (Cheng2024HECTD3). It also interacts with SUMO2, suppressing calcineurin signaling and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (Rangrez2020The). These interactions highlight HECTD3's role in regulating apoptosis, immune response, and protein degradation pathways.
