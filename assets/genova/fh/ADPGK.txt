# ADPGK

## Overview
ADPGK, or ADP-dependent glucokinase, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ADP-dependent glucokinase, a member of the kinase family. This enzyme is distinct in its ability to phosphorylate glucose to glucose-6-phosphate using ADP as a phosphoryl donor, a function that is particularly crucial under conditions of low ATP availability, such as ischemia or hypoxia (Richter2016The; Guo2024Current). Structurally, ADPGK is a monomeric protein with a ribokinase-like topology, featuring a unique disulfide bond that aids in nucleotide binding (Richter2016The). Functionally, it is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it links glycolysis with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, playing a vital role in T cell activation (Kamiński2012T). ADPGK's involvement in various metabolic pathways and its expression in tumor cells highlight its potential significance in cancer progression and metabolic disorders, although its precise biological roles in many eukaryotic cells remain to be fully elucidated (Xu2023ADPdependent; Guo2024Current).

## Structure
The ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of approximately 54 kDa. It is structurally related to ribokinases and relies on magnesium as a cofactor (Imle2019ADPdependent). The primary structure of ADPGK includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ADPGK gene, with the first 21 amino acids serving as an ER-targeting sequence (Imle2019ADPdependent). The secondary structure of ADPGK features a ribokinase-like topology, consisting of a large domain with a central curved ten-stranded mostly parallel β-sheet and a small domain with a curved five-stranded β-sheet and three α-helices (Richter2016The).

The tertiary structure of ADPGK is characterized by a ribokinase-like fold, with a large nucleotide-binding loop structured by a disulfide bond between two conserved cysteines, C414 and C469, which is unique to metazoan ADPGKs (Richter2016The). This disulfide bond helps organize the nucleotide-binding loop, facilitating nucleotide positioning and specificity (Richter2016The). The enzyme's active site is located between the large and small domains, with specific residues forming hydrogen bonds with glucose (Richter2016The). ADPGK does not have a quaternary structure as it is monomeric (Richter2016The).

## Function
ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate using ADP as a phosphoryl donor, distinguishing it from the more common ATP-dependent hexokinases. This reaction is a crucial step in glycolysis, particularly under conditions where ATP is scarce, such as during ischemia or hypoxia, allowing cells to conserve ATP (Richter2016The; Guo2024Current). ADPGK is highly expressed in hematopoietic lineage cells, including T cells, where it plays a significant role in linking enhanced glycolysis with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during T cell activation. This process is essential for the expression of genes driven by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) (Kamiński2012T).

ADPGK is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, with its active site oriented towards the cytosol, enabling its participation in glycolytic regulation upon T cell activation (Kamiński2012T). The enzyme is involved in a glucose sensing system that modulates metabolism via regulation of N-and O-glycosylation (Guo2024Current). Despite its high expression in tumor cells, ADPGK does not significantly contribute to glycolysis in these cells, although it can enhance tumor cell survival under stress conditions (Guo2024Current). The specific biological function of ADPGK in most eukaryotic cells remains unclear, necessitating further research (Guo2024Current).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADPGK gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, ADPGK is associated with hormone-dependent breast and prostate tumors. High expression of ADPGK promotes glucose uptake via glycolysis, stimulating tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. In breast cancer, ADPGK driver mutations are linked to increased cell migration and metastasis, while its suppression can induce apoptosis in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells (Guo2024Current). In prostate cancer, ADPGK overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and accelerates cancer progression through the ALDOC-AMPK signaling pathway (Xu2023ADPdependent).

ADPGK also plays a role in hematological malignancies, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. Knockout of ADPGK reduces tumor aggressiveness and disrupts glycolysis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tandon2020ADPdependent). In metabolic disorders, ADPGK mutations affecting miRNA binding have been linked to human BMI and obesity, indicating its influence on energy metabolism (Guo2024Current). Additionally, altered ADPGK expression in fetal membranes is associated with preterm birth, suggesting an imbalance in glycolysis affects energy synthesis in fetal tissues (Guo2024Current).

## Interactions
ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) is known to interact with aldolase C (ALDOC) in prostate cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which plays a significant role in prostate cancer progression. The interaction between ADPGK and ALDOC was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that ADPGK can directly bind with ALDOC proteins. Immunofluorescence assays further revealed significant colocalization of ADPGK and ALDOC in PC3 cells. Overexpression of ADPGK leads to increased ALDOC protein expression, while knockdown of ADPGK results in decreased ALDOC levels. This interaction affects glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in prostate cancer cells, with ALDOC silencing leading to decreased AMPK phosphorylation levels (Xu2023ADPdependent).

ADPGK has also been identified as a potential binding protein in studies using chemical reporters to analyze metabolite-protein interactions. These studies have identified ADPGK as a novel binding protein for certain lipid metabolites, indicating its involvement in broader metabolic processes (Tsukidate2020Targeted). However, specific details on the physical interactions of ADPGK with other proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
