# BCL2

## Overview
The BCL2 gene encodes the BCL2 apoptosis regulator, a pivotal protein in the regulation of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. As a member of the BCL2 family, this protein is classified as an anti-apoptotic regulator, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by inhibiting apoptosis. The BCL2 protein is characterized by its BCL-2 homology (BH) domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins in the apoptosis pathway. It is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it preserves mitochondrial integrity by preventing the release of apoptogenic factors. This function is essential for the survival of cells under normal physiological conditions and is implicated in various pathological states when dysregulated. The BCL2 gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in numerous cancers and autoimmune disorders, where its overexpression or mutation can lead to disease progression (Czabotar2013Control; Kapoor2020Targeting; Tzifi2012The).

## Structure
The BCL2 protein is characterized by a sequence of amino acids forming the BCL2 family, with a primary structure that includes BCL-2 homology (BH) domains crucial for its function (Gross1999BCL2). The secondary structure of BCL2 consists of alpha helices, forming a helical bundle known as the Bcl-2 fold. This fold comprises seven amphipathic helices (α1-α4, α6-α8) that pack against a central hydrophobic helix (α5) (Rautureau2010Intrinsically). 

The tertiary structure of BCL2 features a hydrophobic surface groove formed by α-helices 2, 3, 4, and 5, which is essential for interactions with the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family (Czabotar2013Control). This groove allows the binding of BH3-only proteins, which is key to regulating apoptosis (Kvansakul2013Structural). 

BCL2 proteins often have a transmembrane domain for anchoring to organelles, particularly the mitochondria (Czabotar2013Control). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect the activity of BCL2 (Gross1999BCL2). Splice variants of BCL2 exist, influencing its role in apoptosis regulation (Gross1999BCL2).

## Function
The BCL2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in healthy human cells. This protein is part of the BCL2 family, which includes both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members. BCL2 itself is an anti-apoptotic protein that helps maintain cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. It achieves this by preserving mitochondrial membrane integrity, thereby preventing the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, which are necessary for the activation of the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (Tzifi2012The).

BCL2 is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, the nuclear envelope, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In these locations, it regulates calcium storage and affects apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX and BAK, inhibiting their activity and preventing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (Ola2011Role; Tzifi2012The). The balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins is crucial for determining cell fate, and BCL2's role in inhibiting apoptosis is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological conditions (Cory2002The; Hardwick2013Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
The BCL2 gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers and diseases associated with its overexpression or mutations. In hematological malignancies, BCL2 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to the survival of cancer cells by inhibiting apoptosis. This overexpression is often due to chromosomal translocations, such as t(14;18), which are common in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Fairlie2021CoOperativity; Kapoor2020Targeting). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), BCL2 overexpression results from hypomethylation and the loss of regulatory microRNAs, miR-15 and miR-16 (Kapoor2020Targeting).

BCL2's role extends beyond blood cancers, as its deregulation is also observed in solid tumors, including lung, prostate, liver, and breast carcinomas. In some cases, high BCL2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, although it can predict better outcomes in ER- and PR-positive breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy (Fairlie2021CoOperativity). The gene's involvement in autoimmune disorders is also notable, where its overexpression can lead to conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus by preventing the apoptosis of self-reactive cells (Singh2019Regulation). The development of BH3 mimetics, which target BCL2, represents a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance in these diseases (Czabotar2013Control).

## Interactions
The BCL2 protein is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate apoptosis. It interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bim through its BH3 domain, inhibiting their function and preventing apoptosis (Kazi2011The). BCL2 also binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) through its BH4 domain, which is crucial for its anti-apoptotic function. This interaction dampens calcium flux through these channels, protecting cells from apoptosis by suppressing excessive calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria (Vervliet2015Bcl2).

BCL2 forms complexes with calcineurin and DARPP-32, regulating IP3-induced calcium release. In T-cells and B-cell cancer cells, BCL2 limits IP3R activity through direct inhibition and a regulatory mechanism involving calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (Vervliet2015Bcl2). The protein also interacts with Beclin 1, a key autophagy regulator, through its BH3 domain. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which can influence the binding affinity and potentially regulate autophagy (Lee2019Structural). These interactions highlight BCL2's role in balancing cell survival and death through complex regulatory mechanisms.
