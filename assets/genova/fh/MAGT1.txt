# MAGT1

## Overview
MAGT1 is a gene that encodes the magnesium transporter 1 protein, which is integral to maintaining magnesium homeostasis and facilitating glycosylation processes in human cells. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, specifically interacting with the STT3B subunit. This interaction is crucial for the N-linked glycosylation of proteins, a process essential for the proper folding and function of many cellular proteins, including those involved in immune responses (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium; Blommaert2019Mutations). MAGT1 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it also functions as a magnesium transporter, influencing cellular magnesium uptake and homeostasis (Goytain2005Identification). Mutations in the MAGT1 gene are linked to XMEN disease, a primary immunodeficiency that underscores the gene's critical role in immune function and magnesium regulation (Li2014XMEN; Watson2022Identification).

## Structure
MAGT1 is a magnesium transporter protein encoded by the MAGT1 gene, consisting of 335 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 38,036 Da (Goytain2005Identification). The primary structure of MAGT1 includes a sequence that features five putative transmembrane regions, although the final product likely has four transmembrane domains due to cleavage of the first region (Goytain2005Identification). The protein also contains an N-linked glycosylation site and several phosphorylation sites, suggesting potential regulation by phosphorylation (Goytain2005Identification).

MAGT1 shares structural similarities with the OST3/OST6 subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, indicating a role in glycosylation processes (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium). It predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, supporting its function as a glycosylation accessory protein (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium). The protein's structure includes a signal peptide, a thioredoxin domain, and transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function within the OST complex (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium). MAGT1 is also involved in magnesium transport across cell membranes, with its activity influenced by pH and possibly by phosphorylation-dependent regulation (Goytain2005Identification).

## Function
MAGT1 (magnesium transporter 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in magnesium homeostasis and glycosylation processes in human cells. It is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, specifically associated with the STT3B subunit, and is crucial for the proper glycosylation of STT3B substrates due to its oxidoreductase activity (Blommaert2019Mutations). This glycosylation process is essential for the folding, stability, and function of many secreted and cell surface proteins, including immune-response proteins like the natural-killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) protein, which is involved in anti-viral and anti-tumor cytotoxicity (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium).

MAGT1 is also suggested to function as a magnesium transporter, essential for Mg2+ uptake in vertebrate cells, although its role in glycosylation is emphasized (Blommaert2019Mutations). It localizes predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in human lymphocytes, where it interacts with components of the OST complex, such as ribophorin I, OST48, and STT3B, indicating its involvement in N-linked glycosylation (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium). The protein's function is partly interchangeable with its paralog, TUSC3, although they have different tissue distributions (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAGT1 gene are associated with XMEN disease, a primary immunodeficiency characterized by impaired magnesium transport, leading to defective immune responses. This condition is marked by a loss of function in the MAGT1 gene, resulting in decreased intracellular magnesium levels, which are crucial for proper immune cell function. Patients with XMEN disease exhibit increased susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections and EBV-associated lymphomas due to impaired cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. This impairment is primarily due to the loss of expression of the NKG2D receptor, which is essential for recognizing and eliminating virally infected and transformed cells (ChaigneDelalande2013Mg; Li2014XMEN; Watson2022Identification).

The disease is also associated with a decreased CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio, increased CD8+ T-cell counts, and elevated B-cell counts. Patients often present with recurrent infections, autoimmune cytopenias, and various EBV-associated malignancies (Li2014XMEN; Ravell2020An). Magnesium supplementation has shown potential in restoring NKG2D expression and cytotoxic function, although it is not a definitive treatment (ChaigneDelalande2013Mg; Ravell2020An).

## Interactions
MAGT1 is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, specifically associated with the STT3B subunit, playing a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation of proteins. It physically interacts with other components of the OST complex, such as ribophorin I, OST48, and STT3B, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays (PLA) and native coimmunoprecipitation (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium; Blommaert2019Mutations). These interactions suggest that MAGT1 is part of a protein complex within the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to its role in glycosylation processes (MatsudaLennikov2019Magnesium).

MAGT1 also interacts with TUSC3, a homolog protein, which can compensate for the loss of MAGT1 function in certain cells. This compensatory mechanism is evident in the upregulation of TUSC3 in the absence of MAGT1, as observed in patient fibroblasts and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cell lines (Blommaert2019Mutations). The interaction between MAGT1 and TUSC3 highlights their partially redundant roles in glycosylation and magnesium transport.

In endothelial cells, MAGT1 is upregulated in response to TRPM7 silencing, indicating a compensatory interaction to maintain magnesium homeostasis. This suggests an interplay between MAGT1 and TRPM7 in regulating magnesium levels (Castiglioni2023The).
