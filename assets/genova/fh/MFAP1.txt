# MFAP1

## Overview
MFAP1, or microfibril associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the essential cellular process of pre-mRNA splicing. The MFAP1 protein functions as a non-snRNP component of the spliceosome, a complex molecular machine responsible for the precise removal of introns and the joining of exons in pre-mRNA. Characterized by its intrinsic disorder and structural flexibility, MFAP1 acts as a scaffolding factor, facilitating the alignment and assembly of spliceosomal components. This flexibility allows MFAP1 to adapt to various splicing contexts, potentially influencing alternative splicing events. The protein's interaction with other spliceosomal proteins, such as Prp38, underscores its critical role in splicing regulation. Despite its weak sequence similarity to yeast Spp381, MFAP1 shares functional and structural characteristics with this yeast splicing factor, highlighting its evolutionary conservation and importance in eukaryotic gene expression (Ulrich2017Human).

## Structure
MFAP1 is characterized by a lack of stable tertiary structure, exhibiting structural flexibility and short, high-affinity protein-protein interaction sites. This flexibility allows for a high rate of sequence divergence, particularly in regions that maintain an elongated, flexible structure (Ulrich2017Human). The protein is predicted to be intrinsically disordered with a high percentage of solvent-exposed residues and a tendency to form α-helices. This structural disorder is consistent with previous predictions and is supported by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which shows significant α-helical content that transitions to a random coil structure upon heating (Ulrich2017Human).

MFAP1 contains a Prp38-binding motif, specifically the RxxxRxxR motif, which is conserved in most MFAP1 orthologs (Ulrich2017Human). The protein acts as a scaffolding factor in spliceosomes, aligning and gathering spatially separated parts of the spliceosome during splicing (Ulrich2017Human). MFAP1 is a non-snRNP protein, allowing for differential recruitment in alternative splicing situations, potentially influencing the efficiency of splice events (Ulrich2017Human). The protein's structural features and interaction capabilities suggest it performs Spp381-like functions in multicellular eukaryotes (Ulrich2017Human).

## Function
MFAP1 (microfibril associated protein 1) is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression regulation in eukaryotic cells. It functions as part of the spliceosome, a complex molecular machine responsible for the removal of introns and the joining of exons in pre-mRNA. In humans, MFAP1 is considered a cryptic ortholog of the yeast splicing factor Spp381, sharing structural and functional similarities despite weak sequence similarity (Ulrich2017Human). MFAP1 interacts with the Prp38 protein, a component of the spliceosome, through a conserved RxxxRxxR motif, which is crucial for its function in splicing (Ulrich2017Human).

MFAP1 is characterized by a lack of stable tertiary structure, allowing it to act as an elongated scaffolding factor within the spliceosome. This structural flexibility enables MFAP1 to potentially transmit conformational changes and align spatially separated parts of the spliceosome during assembly, which is essential for the functional pairing of splice sites (Ulrich2017Human). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to spliceosome complex formation and function, influencing cellular processes and organismal development (Ulrich2017Human).

## Interactions
MFAP1, a human protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the spliceosome complex. It is identified as a cryptic ortholog of the yeast protein Spp381, sharing structural features and functional similarities. MFAP1 interacts with the Prp38 protein, a component of the spliceosome, through conserved binding interfaces. This interaction is supported by cross-species studies showing that human MFAP1 can bind to yeast Prp38 and vice versa, indicating functional interchangeability (Ulrich2017Human).

In Drosophila, MFAP1 interacts with the Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) and TDP-43, a disease-associated RNA-binding protein. The interaction with VCP is nucleotide-dependent and involves the N-terminal region of MFAP1, while the C-terminal region mediates the interaction with TDP-43 (Rode2017The). These interactions suggest that MFAP1 may act as a platform for multiple splicing factors, influencing RNA splicing and potentially stabilizing MFAP1 itself (Rode2017The).

In Caenorhabditis elegans, MFAP1 interacts with splicing factors such as Prp38 and SYF2, indicating its role as a splicing factor. It affects alternative splicing, particularly in the recognition of weak splice sites, and is essential for development (Ma2012The).
