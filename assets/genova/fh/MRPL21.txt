# MRPL21

## Overview
MRPL21 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L21, a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Cheong2020Expression; O’Brien2003Properties). Unlike cytoplasmic ribosomes, mitochondrial ribosomes have a unique composition, with a higher protein-to-RNA ratio, reflecting their evolutionary divergence from bacterial ribosomes (O’Brien2003Properties). The proper function of MRPL21 is crucial for cellular energy metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to severe developmental and cellular consequences (Cheong2020Expression). Additionally, MRPL21 has been associated with various pathological conditions, including cancers and mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Pecorelli2013Genes; Kim2017Mitochondrial).

## Function
MRPL21 encodes a protein that is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Cheong2020Expression; O’Brien2003Properties). The mitochondrial ribosome, where MRPL21 is active, is distinct from cytoplasmic ribosomes in its composition and function, having evolved to include more proteins and less RNA compared to its bacterial counterparts (O’Brien2003Properties).

MRPL21's involvement in mitochondrial translation is vital for cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function. Dysfunctional mitochondrial translation can lead to developmental arrest and early embryonic lethality, highlighting the importance of MRPL21 in maintaining cellular viability and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). Although specific functions of MRPL21 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its role in the mitochondrial ribosome suggests it is integral to the proper functioning of the mitochondrial translation machinery, which is essential for the energy needs of the cell (Gan2006Identification).

## Clinical Significance
MRPL21 has been implicated in various cancers and other conditions through its altered expression. In colorectal cancer, MRPL21 is upregulated in synchronous adenoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in colorectal tumorigenesis and tumor growth (Kim2017Mitochondrial). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), MRPL21 is aberrantly expressed, indicating a possible role in rapid proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, invasiveness, and tumor size (Kim2017Mitochondrial).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MRPL21 is part of a risk model associated with cell pyroptosis and metabolism, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Bin2022Establishment). The study suggests that MRPL21, along with other RNA-binding proteins, plays a role in AML pathogenesis, although further validation is needed (Bin2022Establishment).

MRPL21 is also upregulated in lymphomonocytes of Rett syndrome patients, indicating increased mitochondrial activity and a potential link to mitochondrial dysfunction observed in the syndrome (Pecorelli2013Genes). However, it remains unclear whether these changes are primary or secondary effects related to Rett syndrome.
