# LOXHD1

## Overview
The LOXHD1 gene encodes the protein lipoxygenase homology PLAT domains 1, which is integral to the auditory system, particularly in the mechanotransduction process within the inner ear. This protein is characterized by multiple PLAT (polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin) domains, which are essential for its localization and function in cochlear hair cells (Grillet2009Mutations; Wang2024LOXHD1a). As a molecular hub, LOXHD1 interacts with key components of the mechanotransduction channel complex, such as TMC1, ensuring the proper conversion of mechanical sound vibrations into electrical signals necessary for hearing (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a). Mutations in the LOXHD1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss and other auditory impairments, highlighting its critical role in auditory function (Yu2021Recessive; Grillet2009Mutations).

## Structure
The LOXHD1 protein is characterized by its unique structure, primarily composed of PLAT (polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alpha-toxin) domains. It contains up to 15 PLAT domains, which are believed to facilitate targeting to the plasma membrane (Grillet2009Mutations; Wang2024LOXHD1a). Each PLAT domain forms a beta sandwich structure, consisting of two sheets with four strands each, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Grillet2009Mutations). 

In Ewing sarcoma cells, an alternative transcription start site was identified, leading to a LOXHD1 transcript with 33 exons encoding a protein of 1891 amino acids, including 13 PLAT domains and one coiled-coil domain. This coiled-coil domain, located between amino acids 596 and 658, contains a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS), suggesting potential nuclear functions (Deng2021Oncofusiondrivende). 

Mutations in the LOXHD1 gene, such as those affecting the PLAT domains, can lead to structural changes, including truncated proteins and defects in gene splicing, which are associated with hearing loss (Bai2020Five). The protein's expression and localization in hair cells, particularly in the inner ear, are crucial for auditory function (Grillet2009Mutations).

## Function
The LOXHD1 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the proper functioning of auditory mechanosensitive channels in the inner ear, specifically within the stereocilia of inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a). LOXHD1 plays a critical role in the mechanotransduction (MET) process, which is responsible for converting mechanical sound vibrations into electrical signals necessary for hearing (Wang2024LOXHD1). The protein localizes at the tips of stereocilia, particularly in rows 2 and 3, where it maintains the MET channel complexes (Wang2024LOXHD1a).

LOXHD1 is indispensable for the proper localization and function of TMC1, a key component of the MET channel complex. It ensures that TMC1 remains concentrated within 100 nm of the tip link insertion point, which is crucial for force transmission (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a). In the absence of LOXHD1, TMC1 becomes mislocalized, leading to impaired auditory function and potential hearing loss (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a). LOXHD1 also interacts with other MET channel complex proteins, such as CIB2, LHFPL5, and the tip-link protein PCDH15, highlighting its role as a molecular hub in the auditory mechanotransduction process (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LOXHD1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the auditory and visual systems. LOXHD1 mutations are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically DFNB77, characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss. This condition can present as prelingual mild-to-severe hearing loss, with variability in onset age and severity. The hearing loss is often progressive, with a down-sloping audiogram pattern, indicating more severe loss at higher frequencies (Yu2021Recessive; Grillet2009Mutations).

In addition to hearing loss, LOXHD1 mutations have been implicated in dominant late-onset Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD), a disorder affecting the corneal endothelium. FCD is characterized by the development of guttae on the Descemet membrane, leading to decreased visual acuity and corneal edema. Mutations in LOXHD1, such as the missense variant c.1904T>C (p.Leu635Pro), are thought to cause protein aggregation, contributing to the pathogenesis of FCD (Riazuddin2012Mutations).

The LOXHD1 gene encodes a protein with PLAT domains, crucial for its function in cochlear hair cells. Mutations in these domains can disrupt mechanotransduction, leading to hearing impairment (Trouillet2021Loxhd1Mutations). The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of LOXHD1-related conditions underscores the complexity of its clinical significance.

## Interactions
The LOXHD1 protein is involved in several critical interactions within the auditory mechanotransduction process. It interacts with key proteins such as TMC1, CIB2, LHFPL5, and the lower tip-link protein PCDH15. These interactions have been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting LOXHD1's role as a molecular hub in the auditory system (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a). LOXHD1 is essential for maintaining the proper localization of TMC1 at the tips of stereocilia in inner hair cells, which is crucial for the mechanical activation of the MET channels by sound-induced forces. Without LOXHD1, TMC1 becomes mislocalized, leading to impaired force transmission and hearing loss (Wang2024LOXHD1; Wang2024LOXHD1a).

LOXHD1 selectively interacts with TMC1 but not with its paralogue TMC2, indicating a specific role in the localization and function of TMC1-driven channels (Wang2024LOXHD1). It also interacts with LHFPL5 and PCDH15, which are crucial for force transmission from the tip link to the MET channel (Wang2024LOXHD1). These interactions suggest that LOXHD1 provides stability and cohesiveness to the MET channel complex, ensuring proper auditory function (Wang2024LOXHD1).
