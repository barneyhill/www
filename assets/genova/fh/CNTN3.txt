# CNTN3

## Overview
The CNTN3 gene encodes the protein contactin 3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is primarily involved in neural development and function. Contactin 3 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in the nervous system, particularly in processes such as axon guidance, synapse formation, and neuronal differentiation. Structurally, contactin 3 is characterized by six immunoglobulin-like domains and four fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Korotkov2022Downregulation; Peng2019Defining). The expression of CNTN3 is developmentally regulated, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels have been linked to patient prognosis (Wang2020Screening; Korotkov2022Downregulation).

## Structure
Contactin 3 (CNTN3) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its structural composition of six immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and four fibronectin type III (Fn) domains. This protein is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is a common feature among the contactin family members (Korotkov2022Downregulation; Peng2019Defining). The second fibronectin domain (Fn(2)) of CNTN3 is particularly significant as it mediates binding with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions (Peng2019Defining).

The primary structure of CNTN3 includes specific amino acids critical for its interaction with APP, such as V752, R714, R760, and R764, which are located on one face of the Fn(2) domain (Peng2019Defining). The tertiary structure is likely influenced by these domains, facilitating its role in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins. Post-translational modifications of CNTN3 may include glycosylation, which is typical for proteins with GPI anchors, although specific modifications for CNTN3 are not detailed in the provided context (Korotkov2022Downregulation). The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested by the potential for alternative splicing, a common feature in the contactin family (Korotkov2022Downregulation).

## Function
Contactin 3 (CNTN3) is a brain-specific cell-adhesion molecule that plays a significant role in neural development. It is primarily expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and amygdala, where it is involved in critical processes such as the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural cells. CNTN3 is essential for axon guidance and the formation and organization of synapses, which are crucial for proper brain development and function (Korotkov2022Downregulation).

CNTN3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is anchored to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol. It contains six Ig-like domains and four fibronectin type III repeats, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins, such as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases γ. These interactions are vital for the construction and maintenance of specific neuronal networks (Zhu2019Prognostic).

The expression of CNTN3 is developmentally regulated, with peak levels occurring during the early postnatal period. This expression pattern suggests its involvement in promoting neurite outgrowth and supporting neuronal differentiation, which are essential for establishing functional neural circuits (Korotkov2022Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CNTN3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In the context of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by benign tumors in multiple organs, CNTN3 is significantly down-regulated in cortical tubers. This downregulation is not due to a deletion or specific mutation in CNTN3 but may be related to mTOR deregulation, potentially contributing to the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with TSC, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, and epilepsy (Korotkov2022Downregulation).

CNTN3 has also been associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where low expression levels of CNTN3 correlate with shorter overall survival, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor gene (Wang2020Screening). Additionally, the interaction between CNTN3 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been studied, with specific binding sites identified. Disruptions in this interaction could have implications for neurodevelopmental disorders, although the clinical significance of CNTN3 mutations in this context remains to be fully elucidated (Peng2019Defining). Variants in contactin genes, including CNTN3, have been implicated in ASD, highlighting the gene's potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders (Korotkov2022Downregulation).

## Interactions
Contactin 3 (CNTN3) is known to interact with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a significant interaction in the context of neural development and neuropsychiatric diseases. The binding between CNTN3 and APP is mediated by specific domains on each protein. The second Fibronectin domain (Fn(2)) of CNTN3 is crucial for this interaction, while the copper binding domain (CuBD) of APP is essential for binding with CNTN3. Key amino acids on one face of CNTN3-Fn(2) and one face of APP-CuBD are critical for this interaction, with specific residues such as V752A, R714A, R760A, and R764A in CNTN3 being identified as important for binding (Peng2019Defining).

The interaction between CNTN3 and APP is part of a broader network of interactions involving the Contactin family, which includes CNTN4, CNTN5, and others. Among these, APP binds most strongly to CNTN3 and CNTN4. This interaction is significant for synaptic development and axon guidance, suggesting a role in neural connectivity and signaling (Peng2019Defining). The study of these interactions provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.
