# USP17L5

## Overview
USP17L5 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 5, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The protein encoded by USP17L5 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and stress responses. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions when dysregulated. Understanding the precise mechanisms and interactions of USP17L5 is essential for elucidating its role in health and disease.
