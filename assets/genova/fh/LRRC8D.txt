# LRRC8D

## Overview
The LRRC8D gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 8 VRAC subunit D, which is a critical component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). This transmembrane protein is involved in cellular osmoregulation by facilitating the efflux of chloride ions and organic osmolytes, thereby maintaining cell volume and homeostasis under osmotic stress conditions (Pervaiz2019Absolute). As a subunit of the VRAC, LRRC8D contributes to the channel's permeability to various substrates, including organic osmolytes and certain drugs, and influences the channel's activation mechanisms and substrate specificity (Unknownauthors2021MechanismsofActivationofLRRC8VolumeRegulatedAnionChannels). The protein's role extends to physiological processes such as insulin secretion and glia-neuron communication, underscoring its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Pervaiz2019Absolute). Additionally, LRRC8D's involvement in the transport of therapeutic compounds highlights its potential clinical significance in drug resistance and disease pathophysiology (Ghouli2022Structurefunction).

## Structure


## Function
LRRC8D is a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), which plays a crucial role in cellular osmoregulation by mediating the efflux of chloride ions and organic osmolytes. This process is essential for maintaining cell volume and homeostasis, particularly under conditions of osmotic stress (Pervaiz2019Absolute). The VRAC complex is a hetero-hexameric assembly that includes LRRC8A as an essential component, with LRRC8D contributing to the channel's permeability to organic osmolytes such as taurine and myoinositol, as well as certain drugs (Pervaiz2019Absolute).

In healthy human cells, LRRC8D is involved in various physiological processes, including insulin secretion and glia-neuron communication, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Pervaiz2019Absolute). The presence of LRRC8D in VRAC influences the channel's activation mechanisms and substrate specificity, which are critical for its function in different tissues (Pervaiz2019Absolute). The subunit composition of VRAC, including LRRC8D, affects the channel's response to changes in membrane tension and ionic strength, which are factors that can modulate its activity (Unknownauthors2021MechanismsofActivationofLRRC8VolumeRegulatedAnionChannels).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LRRC8D gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, low expression of LRRC8D is associated with increased resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. This resistance is linked to shorter survival rates in patients treated with these drugs, suggesting that LRRC8D expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker (Chen2019More). LRRC8D is also part of a six-gene signature with prognostic value in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Wang2018Identification).

In the context of glaucoma, decreased expression of LRRC8D in trabecular meshwork cells is associated with impaired volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) activity, which may contribute to increased intraocular pressure and the pathophysiology of the disease (Gasull2019The). The gene's expression is also altered in response to corticosteroid treatment in a model of steroid-induced glaucoma, highlighting its involvement in ocular hypertension (Gasull2019The).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of LRRC8D in drug resistance, cancer prognosis, and glaucoma, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
LRRC8D is a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) and interacts with other LRRC8 subunits to form functional heteromeric channels. It forms complexes with LRRC8A, which are crucial for the transport of various substrates, including cGAMP, across the plasma membrane. LRRC8D is known to inhibit the transport of cGAMP by forming complexes with LRRC8A, potentially diluting or poisoning the active cGAMP-transporting LRRC8A:C/E complexes (Lahey2020LRRC8A:CE). 

The structural studies of LRRC8D reveal that it can form a 2-fold dimer of trimers, which is distinct from the homomeric LRRC8A structures. This structural configuration suggests a higher permeability for organic osmolytes in LRRC8D-containing heteromeric complexes (Unknownauthors2021MechanismsofActivationofLRRC8VolumeRegulatedAnionChannels). 

LRRC8D also plays a role in the transport of therapeutic compounds, such as the antibiotic blasticidin S and the anti-cancer drug cisplatin, when paired with LRRC8A. It is permeable to neutral and positively charged compounds like myo-inositol, taurine, GABA, and lysine (Ghouli2022Structurefunction). These interactions highlight the diverse functional roles of LRRC8D in cellular transport processes.
