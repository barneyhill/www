# HTATIP2

## Overview
HTATIP2, also known as TIP30, is a gene that encodes the HIV-1 Tat interactive protein 2, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. This protein functions as a transcriptional cofactor and is implicated in the modulation of T cell activation and proliferation, as well as the inhibition of angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in monocytes and macrophages (Patel2023HTATIP2; Cardinale2023Genomewide). HTATIP2 is also involved in the stabilization of p53 mRNA, promoting apoptosis under oxidative stress, particularly in cancerous cells (Zhao2008TIP30). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis, with its dysregulation linked to various cancers, including glioblastoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma (Hegi2022Epigenetic; Yang2021Bioinformatics; He2023Elaboration; Nanok2017Aberrant).

## Structure


## Function
HTATIP2, also known as TIP30, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of T cell activation and proliferation. In primary human CD4+ T cells, HTATIP2 modulates T cell activation by influencing the expression of activation markers such as CD69. Knockdown of HTATIP2 results in reduced T cell activation and increased cell proliferation, suggesting its role in balancing these processes (Cardinale2023Genomewide). HTATIP2 is also implicated in signaling pathways involving kinases, receptors, and transcription factors, which are crucial for T cell function (Cardinale2023Genomewide).

In monocytes and macrophages, HTATIP2 acts as a transcriptional cofactor that inhibits angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Silencing HTATIP2 enhances the angiogenic and arteriogenic activities of these cells, indicating its role in regulating blood vessel formation (Patel2023HTATIP2). The protein is involved in the stabilization of p53 mRNA, promoting apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions, particularly in cancerous cells (Zhao2008TIP30). HTATIP2's activity in the cytoplasm and nucleus is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (King2004Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
HTATIP2, also known as TIP30, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in DNA repair and cellular signaling pathways. In glioblastoma (GBM), the epigenetic silencing of HTATIP2 is linked to increased nuclear localization of the DNA-repair protein MPG, enhancing the tumor's DNA repair capacity and contributing to treatment resistance against alkylating agents (Hegi2022Epigenetic). This suggests that HTATIP2 acts as a negative regulator of nuclear MPG function, impacting the efficiency of the base excision repair (BER) pathway and influencing the cellular response to DNA damage (Hegi2022Epigenetic).

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), HTATIP2 methylation is associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis. High methylation levels of HTATIP2 correlate with longer overall survival, indicating its potential as a favorable predictive marker (Nanok2017Aberrant). The gene's methylation status could serve as a predictive biomarker for CCA, impacting clinical decisions regarding patient management and treatment strategies (Nanok2017Aberrant).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), HTATIP2 expression is linked to poor prognosis. In LIHC, high expression of HTATIP2 is associated with poor survival outcomes (Yang2021Bioinformatics). In LUAD, HTATIP2 is part of a prognostic signature linked to poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its role as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker (He2023Elaboration).
