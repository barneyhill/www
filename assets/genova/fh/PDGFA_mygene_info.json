family comprised of both platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF).

These proteins bind and activate PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases, which play a role in a wide range of developmental processes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
