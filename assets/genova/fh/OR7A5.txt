# OR7A5

## Overview
The OR7A5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily A member 5, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of odorants. This receptor is part of the olfactory receptor family, which is responsible for the sense of smell. OR7A5 is notably expressed in human spermatozoa and testis, where it plays a crucial role in sperm motility and chemotaxis by responding to specific odorants. The activation of this receptor leads to calcium signaling pathways that are essential for sperm capacitation and motility, thereby influencing reproductive processes and fertility (Tong2021Ectopic; Flegel2016Characterization; Lee2018Therapeutic). The study of OR7A5 and its ligands offers potential insights into therapeutic strategies for managing fertility (Lee2018Therapeutic).

## Function
OR7A5 is an olfactory receptor that plays a significant role in sperm motility and chemotaxis. It is expressed in human spermatozoa and testis, where it is activated by specific odorants, leading to characteristic calcium responses that influence sperm motility patterns (Tong2021Ectopic; Flegel2016Characterization). The activation of OR7A5 by odorants such as PI-23472 induces sperm capacitation and increases Ca2+ levels, which are crucial for the chemical communication between sperm and egg cells, potentially impacting human fertility (Lee2018Therapeutic). 

OR7A5 is also involved in the broader physiological processes of sperm function, including the modulation of flagellar beating frequency and sperm velocity, which are essential for successful fertilization (Abaffy2015Human). The receptor's activation by ligands like 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-[2H]-furanone is implicated in calcium signaling, further supporting its role in sperm motility and function (Raka2021Human). These findings suggest that OR7A5 is integral to the reproductive process, influencing sperm behavior and potentially offering therapeutic targets for fertility management (Lee2018Therapeutic).
