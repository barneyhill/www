# ID3

## Overview
ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) is a gene that encodes a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins, which function as transcriptional regulators. Unlike other HLH proteins, the ID3 protein lacks a DNA-binding domain, allowing it to modulate transcription by forming heterodimers with other HLH proteins and inhibiting their DNA-binding capabilities (Coppé2003Id). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is particularly significant in neurogenesis and immune system development (Tzeng1998Id1; Ishiguro1995Expression). ID3 is expressed in multiple tissues and plays a role in the DNA damage response, influencing genomic stability through its interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair pathways (Lee2017ID3). Additionally, ID3 has clinical significance in oncology, where its expression levels and mutations are associated with various cancers, impacting prognosis and disease progression (Rohde2017Relevance; Zhao2022Comprehensive).

## Function
ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins that functions as a transcriptional regulator. It lacks a DNA-binding domain and instead forms heterodimers with other HLH proteins, inhibiting their ability to bind DNA and thereby regulating transcriptional activity (Coppé2003Id). ID3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, and plays a crucial role in neurogenesis and immune system development (Tzeng1998Id1; Ishiguro1995Expression).

In healthy human cells, ID3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression patterns critical for normal cellular function and organismal development (Coppé2003Id). It is expressed in various tissues, including the epidermis, where it is involved in regulating keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Coppé2003Id). ID3 also plays a role in the immune system, where its expression is modulated during lymphocyte activation, suggesting a role in the transition from a resting to a proliferative state (Ishiguro1995Expression). In the nervous system, ID3 is expressed in astrocytes and is implicated in regulating astrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Tzeng1998Id1).

## Clinical Significance
ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression or mutations. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ID3 expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). This downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, making ID3 a potential prognostic biomarker in AML (Zhao2022Comprehensive). In pediatric aggressive B-cell lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, ID3 mutations are frequent and are associated with MYC rearrangements, contributing to lymphomagenesis. These mutations are linked to advanced disease stages but do not directly impact survival outcomes (Rohde2017Relevance).

In ovarian adenocarcinomas, ID3 expression is reduced, with decreased mRNA and protein levels observed in cancer cell lines compared to normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. This downregulation is not commonly due to mutations, suggesting that decreased expression may play a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer (Arnold2001Decreased). In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), overexpression of ID3, along with ID1 and IGJ, is associated with poor prognosis, characterized by reduced event-free and overall survival (CruzRodriguez2017Prognostic).

## Interactions
ID3 (inhibitor of DNA binding 3) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of the DNA damage response (DDR). ID3 interacts directly with the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) through its helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of MDC1 to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), facilitating DNA repair processes. The interaction between ID3 and MDC1 is enhanced in response to DNA damage and is independent of DNA presence, as demonstrated by experiments using ethidium bromide and DNase (Lee2017ID3).

The binding of ID3 to MDC1 requires the tBRCT domain of MDC1 and the phosphorylation of ID3 at Ser65, a modification dependent on ATM kinase and MDC1. This phosphorylation is specific to ID3 among the ID family proteins due to the presence of TQ and SQ motifs (Lee2017ID3). ID3 also acts as a scaffold, facilitating the interaction between MDC1 and γ-H2AX, a DNA damage sensor protein, which is essential for the proper localization of MDC1 to DNA damage sites (Lee2017ID3).

ID3's role extends to influencing the efficiency of both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Lee2017ID3).
