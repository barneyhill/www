# ADAMTS13

## Overview
ADAMTS13 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13, a member of the ADAMTS family of zinc-dependent proteases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hemostasis by cleaving von Willebrand factor (VWF), a key component in blood clotting. The ADAMTS13 protein is characterized by a complex multidomain structure, including a metalloprotease domain, disintegrin-like domain, thrombospondin type 1 repeats, and CUB domains, which are essential for its interaction with VWF and its proteolytic activity (Akiyama2009Crystal; Zheng2013Structure–function). The gene is primarily expressed in the liver and vascular endothelial cells, and its activity is crucial for preventing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a disorder caused by the accumulation of ultra-large VWF multimers due to insufficient cleavage by ADAMTS13 (Zheng2015ADAMTS13; Dong2002ADAMTS13). Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene or the presence of inhibitory autoantibodies can lead to TTP, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in maintaining vascular health (Veyradier2004Ten; Roose2018AntiADAMTS13).

## Structure
The ADAMTS13 protein is a member of the ADAMTS family of proteases, characterized by a complex multidomain structure. It includes a signal peptide, a short propeptide, a metalloprotease (MP) domain, a disintegrin-like (D) domain, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSP1), cysteine-rich (C) and spacer (S) domains, followed by seven additional TSP1 repeats and two CUB domains (Akiyama2009Crystal; Zheng2013Structure–function). The metalloprotease domain contains a Zn2+-binding motif coordinated by three histidine residues and has three putative Ca2+-binding sites, which are crucial for maintaining the active center's shape (Petri2019Crystal).

The noncatalytic domains, particularly the DTCS domains, are essential for von Willebrand factor (VWF) recognition and proteolysis. The disintegrin-like domain and the N-terminal portion of the cysteine-rich domain share folding similarities, while the spacer domain forms a globular unit with a 10-stranded β-sandwich fold (Akiyama2009Crystal). The CUB domains interact with the spacer domain, contributing to the protein's global latency by imposing structural constraints on the MP domain (Kim2021Crystal).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, which are common in the TSP1 repeats and CUB domains (Kim2021Crystal). These modifications may influence substrate recognition and cellular localization (Zheng2013Structure–function). The protein's structure allows it to accommodate partially unfolded VWF segments, facilitating its function under shear stress conditions (Akiyama2009Crystal).

## Function
ADAMTS13 is a metalloprotease enzyme that plays a critical role in the regulation of blood clotting by cleaving von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS13 cleaves VWF at the Tyr842-Met843 peptide bond, which is essential for controlling the size of VWF multimers and preventing excessive platelet aggregation and thrombosis (Plaimauer2002Cloning; Dong2002ADAMTS13). This proteolytic activity is crucial for maintaining normal hemostasis by modulating the adhesive function of VWF, thereby preventing the formation of large VWF strings that can lead to spontaneous platelet agglutination and thrombosis in small blood vessels (Zheng2015ADAMTS13; Dong2002ADAMTS13).

ADAMTS13 is primarily synthesized in the liver, particularly in hepatic stellate cells, and is also produced by vascular endothelial cells (Shang2006Apical; Zheng2015ADAMTS13). The enzyme is active in the bloodstream and at sites of vascular injury, where it cleaves VWF multimers to prevent the accumulation of ultralarge VWF (ULVWF) multimers, which are associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) if not regulated (Zheng2015ADAMTS13; Dong2002ADAMTS13). The activity of ADAMTS13 is modulated by various factors, including shear force and the presence of divalent metal ions, which enhance its function (Shelat2005Molecular; Zheng2015ADAMTS13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene are associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a condition characterized by the formation of small blood clots throughout the body, leading to organ damage. TTP can be congenital, known as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, or acquired. Congenital TTP results from inherited mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to a severe reduction in enzyme activity. This form of TTP is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is associated with various mutations, including missense and truncating types, which significantly reduce ADAMTS13 activity levels in plasma (Veyradier2004Ten; PérezRodríguez2014Inherited).

In acquired TTP, the deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity is often due to the presence of circulating anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, which inhibit the enzyme's function. This immune-mediated form of TTP can occur during pregnancy or other conditions and is characterized by a significant decrease in ADAMTS13 activity and antigen levels during the acute phase, with the presence of autoantibodies (Roose2018AntiADAMTS13).

Mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene can also lead to altered secretion and activity of the enzyme, affecting its ability to cleave von Willebrand factor, which is crucial for preventing the accumulation of ultra-large VWF multimers and subsequent thrombotic events (Plaimauer2006Modulation).

## Interactions
ADAMTS13 interacts primarily with von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein involved in blood clotting. This interaction is crucial for regulating the size and function of VWF, preventing excessive clot formation. ADAMTS13 cleaves VWF at a specific site within the A2 domain, a process that is facilitated by multiple exosites on ADAMTS13 that bind to different regions of VWF (Gao2008Extensive; Akiyama2009Crystal). The interaction is highly dependent on shear-induced conformational changes in VWF, which expose the cleavage site and allow ADAMTS13 to bind and cleave VWF efficiently (Petri2019Crystal).

The binding of ADAMTS13 to VWF involves several non-catalytic domains, including the disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, and spacer domains, which recognize and bind to the unfolded VWF A2 domain (Akiyama2009Crystal; Petri2019Crystal). The spacer domain is particularly important for binding affinity and proteolysis of VWF (de2009Essential). The interaction is saturable, reversible, and occurs in normal human plasma, with a specific stoichiometry of one ADAMTS13 per two VWF monomers (Majerus2005Binding; FEYS2009Multi‐step). These interactions are crucial for the enzymatic activity of ADAMTS13 and its role in hemostasis.
