# FARSA

## Overview
The FARSA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), which is a crucial component of the protein synthesis machinery in human cells. This enzyme belongs to the class of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which are responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding tRNA molecules, a key step in translating genetic information into functional proteins. The FARSA protein, in conjunction with the beta subunit encoded by the FARSB gene, forms a heterotetrameric complex that facilitates the aminoacylation of tRNA with phenylalanine. This process is essential for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis. Beyond its primary role in translation, FARSA is also implicated in various cellular signaling pathways and has been associated with several systemic disorders when mutated, including phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase deficiency and certain cancers (Feng2023First; Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Kim2022Fatal).

## Structure
The FARSA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) complex, which is crucial for protein synthesis. The FARSA protein consists of 508 amino acids and includes several structural domains. The N-terminal region contains a tRNA-binding domain (DBD) with helix-turn-helix structures, forming a DNA/dsRNA binding domain (DBD1/2/3) that likely functions to recognize and bind tRNA Phe (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Schuch2021FARS1‐related). The C-terminal region comprises the catalytic module (CAM), which includes subdomains A1/A2 involved in tRNA binding and aminoacylation (Schuch2021FARS1‐related).

The quaternary structure of the FARSA protein involves forming a heterotetramer with the FARSB subunit, consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits. This assembly is essential for conjugating phenylalanine to tRNA (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Kim2022Fatal). Specific mutations in the FARSA gene, such as Leu391Pro and Arg404His, have been shown to affect the protein's conformation and stability, impacting its function (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA). The protein's structure is critical for its role in protein biosynthesis, and disruptions can lead to severe multisystem disorders (Kim2022Fatal).

## Function
The FARSA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (FARS), an enzyme essential for protein synthesis in human cells. This enzyme operates in the cytoplasm and is responsible for the aminoacylation of tRNA with phenylalanine, a critical step in translating genetic information into proteins. The FARS enzyme functions as a heterotetramer, consisting of two alpha subunits (FARSA) and two beta subunits (FARSB) (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Schuch2021FARS1‐related).

The primary role of FARSA is to catalyze the attachment of phenylalanine to its corresponding tRNA, ensuring the accurate incorporation of this amino acid into proteins during translation. This process is vital for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis, as it allows the translation machinery to incorporate phenylalanine into growing polypeptide chains (Malnar2022PhenylalaninetRNA; Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA). The FARSA protein contains a catalytic domain that participates in tRNA binding and aminoacylation, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Schuch2021FARS1‐related).

In addition to its canonical role in protein synthesis, FARSA and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are involved in key signaling pathways that may not be directly related to translation, highlighting their broader significance in cellular function (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FARSA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, are associated with a range of severe systemic disorders. Biallelic variants in FARSA can lead to phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase deficiency, characterized by interstitial lung disease, liver dysfunction, brain abnormalities, growth delay, and hepatomegaly. Common symptoms include respiratory and hepatic abnormalities, neurodevelopmental delay, failure to thrive, and hypoalbuminemia, with progressive liver function deterioration being a primary manifestation during early childhood (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Schuch2021FARS1‐related).

Specific mutations, such as P347L and R475Q, have been shown to disrupt protein stability and enzyme activity, contributing to severe phenotypes similar to Rajab syndrome, which includes hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and multi-organ involvement (Kim2022Fatal). These mutations can destabilize the protein structure, affecting its function and leading to a fatal systemic disorder (Kim2022Fatal).

In cancer, particularly mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), FARSA expression levels are implicated in tumorigenesis. FARSA is differentially upregulated in various non-Hodgkin lymphomas, but lower in MCL, where its knockdown promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Feng2023First).

## Interactions
The FARSA protein, which encodes the alpha subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, forms a heterotetramer with the beta subunit encoded by the FARSB gene. This interaction is crucial for the function of the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase complex, which is involved in linking phenylalanine to its cognate tRNA (Guo2023PhenylalanyltRNA; Kim2022Fatal). Specific mutations in FARSA, such as P347L and R404C, disrupt the interaction with FARSB, preventing the formation of a stable heterotetramer and affecting the enzyme's activity (Schuch2021FARS1‐related; Kim2022Fatal).

FARSA also interacts with antisense RNA repeats associated with the C9orf72 gene mutation, which is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The antisense RNA, specifically the CCCCGG repeat, binds to FARSA in the cytosol, inhibiting its function in aminoacylating tRNA Phe. This interaction leads to decreased levels of charged tRNA Phe and a global reduction in phenylalanine incorporation into the proteome (Malnar2022PhenylalaninetRNA). The interaction of FARSA with C4G2 repeat RNA is length-dependent, with the strongest binding observed with 32x C4G2 repeats (Malnar2022PhenylalaninetRNA).
