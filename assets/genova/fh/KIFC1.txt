# KIFC1

## Overview
KIFC1 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member C1, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-14 family. This protein is characterized by its C-terminal motor domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, enabling its movement along microtubules (Gao2019Expression). Kinesin family member C1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis, chromatin maintenance, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Wei2019Kinesin14). It is also involved in organelle transport and cell adhesion, contributing to genomic stability and cellular transport processes (Zhang2004Comparative). The protein's interactions with other cellular components and its involvement in critical pathways underscore its significance in maintaining normal cell function and its potential implications in cancer progression (Zhao2024The; Farina2013Kinesin).

## Structure
KIFC1 is a member of the kinesin-14 family, characterized by a C-terminal motor domain. The protein consists of 663 amino acids and is organized into three distinct domains: a tail domain (1-138), a coiled-coil domain (141-297), and a head/motor domain (317-663) (Sharma2022Computational). The motor domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, which facilitates movement along microtubules (Gao2019Expression). The coiled-coil domain is crucial for dimerization, which is essential for the protein's kinetic properties (Sharma2022Computational).

The structure of KIFC1 is dimeric, with a well-folded globular motor domain connected to an intrinsically disordered tail region by a continuous α-helical coiled-coil domain (Sharma2022Computational). The motor domain's structure in an Mg-ADP-bound state has been reported, although the full-length crystal structure remains unresolved (Sharma2022Computational). KIFC1 has two primary inhibitor binding sites: L5/α2/α3 and α4/α6, with the latter being more accessible to small molecules (Sharma2022Computational).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate KIFC1's activity, with a serine in the tail domain predicted to be a substrate for PKC phosphorylation (Zhang2004Comparative). The protein's unique sequences in the tail domain contribute to its specific cellular functions and localization (Zhang2004Comparative).

## Function
KIFC1, a kinesin-14 motor protein, plays a critical role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in DNA synthesis and chromatin maintenance, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. KIFC1 enters the nucleus at the onset of DNA synthesis and exits by the end of the S phase, facilitated by a nuclear localization signal in its tail domain (Wei2019Kinesin14). This protein is essential for maintaining normal cell growth and proliferation, as its absence leads to slower cell growth, fewer cell colonies, and increased cell death (Wei2019Kinesin14).

KIFC1 is crucial for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during mitosis. It ensures the correct formation of spindle structures, preventing abnormal cell division and chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidy (Wei2019Kinesin14; Zhu2005Functional). The protein is also involved in microtubule assembly and crosslinking, contributing to genomic stability and the maintenance of nuclear structure (Wei2019Kinesin14; Wu2022An).

KIFC1's role extends to organelle transport and cell adhesion, with its depletion resulting in disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport and damaged nuclear membranes (Wei2019Kinesin14). It is also implicated in vesicular and organelle trafficking, highlighting its diverse functions in cellular transport processes (Zhang2004Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
KIFC1 is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and role in tumor progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIFC1 is a downstream target of the WNT/β-catenin axis and is transcriptionally up-regulated by TCF4. Its abnormal activation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), chemoresistance, and proliferation of hepatoma cells, facilitating HCC progression. Depletion of KIFC1 can enhance paclitaxel sensitivity and suppress tumor development (Zhao2024The; Teng2019KIFC1). KIFC1 also interacts with HMGA1, an oncogenic transcription factor, and regulates Akt signaling, increasing gankyrin expression and enhancing HCC cell invasion through EMT (Han2018KIFC1).

In ovarian adenocarcinomas, KIFC1 is overexpressed and correlates with advanced tumor grade and poor overall survival, serving as a marker for metastasis onset. It is essential for the viability of cancer cells with amplified centrosomes, a common feature in aggressive ovarian tumors (Pawar2014KIFCI; Mittal2016A).

KIFC1 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it promotes cell proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis. Its inhibition leads to cell cycle arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2016The).

## Interactions
KIFC1, a kinesin-14 family motor protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It plays a significant role in the intracellular transport of double-stranded DNA, as demonstrated by its consistent presence in co-purification experiments with DNA and its critical involvement in DNA motion along microtubules (Farina2013Kinesin). KIFC1 interacts with several proteins, including Mitotic arrest deficient-like 1 (MAD2L1), Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1), Nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 (NUSAP1), Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1), Kinesin family member 11 (KIF11), Targeting Protein For Xklp2 (TPX2), and Kinesin family member 23 (KIF23), which are part of pathways related to the cell cycle, cell division, and chromosome segregation (Pawar2014KIFCI).

KIFC1 is also involved in the degradation of the misfolded F508del-CFTR protein, a major cause of cystic fibrosis. It interacts more strongly with F508del-CFTR compared to its variant, suggesting a role in early targeting for degradation (Canato2018Proteomic). In cancer cells, KIFC1 is crucial for centrosome clustering, interacting with microtubules to prevent multipolar mitosis, which is targeted by inhibitors like AZ82 and SR31527 (Zhang2016Discovery; Wu2013Discovery).
