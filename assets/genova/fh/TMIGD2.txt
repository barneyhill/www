# TMIGD2

## Overview
TMIGD2, or Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a pivotal role in immune system regulation and vascular biology. TMIGD2 is expressed on various cell types, including naive T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, where it functions as a co-stimulatory molecule enhancing immune responses and contributing to vascular development (Wang2024TMIGD2; Boulhen2023TMIGD2). The protein's interaction with the ligand HHLA2 is crucial for modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer, where it has been implicated in enhancing anti-tumor activity (Kula2024The). TMIGD2's expression patterns and interactions suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology and immunotherapy (Hu2022Identification; Boulhen2023TMIGD2).

## Function
TMIGD2, also known as Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in immune system function and vascular biology. It is constitutively expressed on naive T cells and most natural killer (NK) cells, where it acts as a co-stimulatory molecule, enhancing T cell responses by promoting cell growth and cytokine production through an AKT-dependent signaling cascade (Boulhen2023TMIGD2). TMIGD2 is also expressed on endothelial and epithelial cells, where it inhibits cell migration and enhances capillary tube development during angiogenesis, contributing to vascular development (Boulhen2023TMIGD2).

In the immune system, TMIGD2 functions as an immuno-stimulatory receptor, playing a role in modulating T-cell activation and migration. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is involved in enhancing anti-tumor activity by activating NK cells (Boulhen2023TMIGD2). TMIGD2's expression on endothelial cells suggests its involvement in maintaining endothelial cell integrity, which is crucial for proper vascular function and development. Despite its significant roles in these processes, the specific function of TMIGD2 in healthy human cells, particularly in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, remains less understood (Wang2024TMIGD2).

## Clinical Significance
TMIGD2, also known as Transmembrane and Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 2, has been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In glioma, TMIGD2 expression is upregulated in low-grade gliomas, especially in younger patients, and is associated with better overall survival outcomes. It is more highly expressed in grade 2 gliomas compared to higher-grade gliomas and glioblastomas, and is particularly elevated in the astrocytoma subtype. This expression pattern suggests that TMIGD2 may be linked to less aggressive glioma characteristics and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (Boulhen2023TMIGD2).

TMIGD2 is also associated with immune response modulation in glioma, as it negatively correlates with inhibitory immune checkpoints like PDL1 and B7H6, indicating its potential role in immunotherapy strategies (Boulhen2023TMIGD2). In HCC, TMIGD2 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is associated with improved tumor prognosis, suggesting a favorable role in cancer prognosis and therapy (Hu2022Identification).

The interaction of TMIGD2 with its ligand HHLA2 is crucial in modulating immune responses, promoting T cell growth and cytokine production through an AKT-dependent signaling cascade. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer immunotherapy, as it can enhance anti-tumor immune responses (Kula2024The).

## Interactions
TMIGD2, also known as IGPR-1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other contexts. TMIGD2 is known to interact with the ligand HHLA2, a member of the B7 family, which is primarily expressed on T cells and NK cells. This interaction co-stimulates these immune cells, leading to their proliferation and cytokine production (Wang2024TMIGD2). However, in the context of AML, HHLA2 is not required for TMIGD2's function on leukemia stem cells (LSCs) (Wang2024TMIGD2).

TMIGD2 does not form trans interactions with itself but can form cis homodimers on the same cell surface, which is essential for its function in AML. This dimerization requires the extracellular domain of TMIGD2 (Wang2024TMIGD2). The protein also influences the ERK1/2-p90RSK-CREB signaling pathway, which is crucial for the proliferation and survival of AML cells. Knockdown of TMIGD2 leads to decreased levels of phosphorylated CREB and p-ERK1/2, indicating its role in these signaling pathways (Wang2024TMIGD2). Despite extensive screening, no new binding partners for TMIGD2 were identified beyond HHLA2 (Wang2024TMIGD2).
