# SLC16A13

## Overview
SLC16A13 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 16 member 13, which is a member of the monocarboxylate transporter family. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of L-lactate across the plasma membrane, playing a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity, particularly in the liver (Schumann2021Deletion). As a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter, it is sensitive to changes in plasma lactate concentrations, which is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic health (Schumann2021Deletion). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in response to metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, indicating its role in adapting to increased metabolic demands (Schumann2021Deletion). SLC16A13 has been implicated in metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving insulin sensitivity and reducing ectopic lipid accumulation (Schumann2021Deletion).

## Function
SLC16A13, a member of the solute carrier family 16, functions as a monocarboxylate transporter, primarily facilitating the transport of L-lactate across the plasma membrane. This protein is highly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Schumann2021Deletion). SLC16A13 is described as a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter for L-lactate, with a Km value of approximately 0.47 µM, indicating its sensitivity to minor changes in plasma lactate concentrations (Schumann2021Deletion).

In healthy human cells, SLC16A13 contributes to energy homeostasis by regulating lactate transport, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular energy levels. The protein's activity influences mitochondrial function, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation while reducing fatty acid synthesis. This balance is essential for preventing ectopic lipid accumulation and maintaining insulin sensitivity, particularly under conditions of excess dietary nutrients (Schumann2021Deletion).

The gene's expression is upregulated in response to metabolic dysfunction, such as obesity, suggesting its involvement in adapting to increased metabolic demands (Schumann2021Deletion). SLC16A13's role in transporting lactate and its impact on metabolic processes highlight its importance in liver function and overall metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC16A13 gene has been implicated in several metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Genome-wide association studies have identified SLC16A13 as a susceptibility gene for T2D, with specific polymorphisms, such as rs312457, associated with increased risk of the disease (Schumann2021Deletion). In humans, increased expression of SLC16A13 in the liver correlates with metabolic dysfunction indicators, including waist circumference, BMI, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis, suggesting its role in the development of adiposity and insulin resistance (Schumann2021Deletion).

In mice, deletion of the Slc16a13 gene has been shown to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduce ectopic lipid accumulation, particularly under high-fat diet conditions. This suggests that SLC16A13 may contribute to insulin resistance through its role in hepatic lipid metabolism (Schumann2021Deletion). The gene's deletion leads to increased mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, which are associated with reduced hepatic lipid content and improved metabolic profiles (Schumann2021Deletion).

The potential therapeutic targeting of SLC16A13 is being explored, as its modulation could offer benefits in treating metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and fatty liver (Schumann2021Deletion).
