# TMEM141

## Overview
TMEM141 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 141, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by their ability to span cellular membranes. These proteins play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, transport, and cell communication. The transmembrane protein 141 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and may be involved in specific signaling pathways, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research into TMEM141 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential roles in health and disease.
