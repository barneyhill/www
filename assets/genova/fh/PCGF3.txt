# PCGF3

## Overview
PCGF3 (Polycomb Group Ring Finger 3) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. These proteins are critical components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), a key player in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The PCGF3 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by facilitating the ubiquitination of histone H2A, leading to gene silencing. However, it also has roles in transcriptional activation, particularly in embryonic stem cells, where it interacts with various transcription factors to promote gene expression necessary for differentiation and pluripotency. PCGF3 is involved in the regulation of immune responses by modulating the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), acting as a negative regulator to maintain immune homeostasis. Its interactions with other proteins, such as RING1A/B and BMI1, and its involvement in non-canonical PRC1 complexes, underscore its versatile role in cellular processes (Zhao2017Polycomb; Da2024Nuclear; Scelfo2019Functional).

## Function
PCGF3 (Polycomb Group Ring Finger 3) is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling and histone modification. In healthy human cells, PCGF3 is involved in both transcriptional repression and activation, depending on the context. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation (Zhao2017Polycomb; Scelfo2019Functional).

PCGF3 functions as a transcriptional repressor by being part of the PRC1 complex, which ubiquitinates histone H2A, leading to gene silencing. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular identity and regulating developmental processes (Scelfo2019Functional). However, PCGF3 also participates in transcriptional activation, particularly in embryonic stem cells, where it interacts with transcription factors such as USF1/2 and the pluripotency factor Tex10. These interactions facilitate the recruitment of co-activators like P300, promoting gene expression necessary for differentiation and pluripotency (Zhao2017Polycomb; Scelfo2019Functional).

PCGF3's role in modulating the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) highlights its involvement in immune response regulation. It acts as a negative regulator by preventing excessive ISG expression, which is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing tissue damage (Da2024Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PCGF3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of autoimmune diseases, particularly dermatomyositis (DM), PCGF3 acts as a negative regulator of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Reduced expression of PCGF3 in patients with MDA5+ DM correlates with increased ISG expression, suggesting that downregulation of PCGF3 may contribute to the pathogenesis of DM by enhancing ISG expression (Da2024Nuclear). This indicates a potential role for PCGF3 in the diagnosis or treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases due to its involvement in modulating the immune response (Da2024Nuclear).

In the realm of pharmacogenomics, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PCGF3 gene have been associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-induced cough among Han Chinese adults. Notably, SNPs such as rs1044147 and rs2242234 have been identified as potential risk factors for this condition, suggesting that mutations in PCGF3 may have clinical significance in the context of ACEI-induced cough (Mu2020Pnpt1). These findings highlight the importance of PCGF3 in both immune regulation and drug response, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications.

## Interactions
PCGF3 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), where it interacts with other PRC1 components such as RING1A/B and BMI1 (Gao2012PCGF). PCGF3 forms unique complexes distinct from other PCGF proteins, except for PCGF2 and PCGF4, which form relatively similar complexes (Gao2012PCGF).

PCGF3 interacts with the transcription factors USF1 and USF2, which are crucial for its recruitment to chromatin. This interaction is DNA-independent, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and size-exclusion chromatography (Scelfo2019Functional). USF1/2 act as DNA binding hubs for PCGF3, facilitating its recruitment to specific genomic sites (Scelfo2019Functional).

PCGF3 also interacts with the telomere binding protein TRF2, which specifically binds to a G-quadruplex structure in the PCGF3 promoter. This interaction is dependent on the presence of both the N-terminal basic domain and the C-terminal Myb type DNA binding domain of TRF2, and it plays a role in transcriptional regulation (Purohit2018Extratelomeric).

In embryonic stem cells, PCGF3 is part of non-canonical PRC1 complexes, such as PRC1.3 and PRC1.5, which include components like RING1B, RYBP, and casein kinase 2 (Zhao2017Polycomb). These interactions suggest a role for PCGF3 in transcriptional activation, contrasting with the traditional view of Polycomb proteins as repressors (Zhao2017Polycomb).
