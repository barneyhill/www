# BPIFC

## Overview
BPIFC is a gene located on chromosome 22q13 that encodes a protein belonging to the BPI fold containing family, which is primarily involved in lipid transfer and lipopolysaccharide binding. This protein plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by binding and neutralizing lipopolysaccharides from bacterial membranes, thereby contributing to the body's defense mechanisms, particularly in epithelial tissues (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). The BPIFC protein is categorized as a lipid-binding protein, and its expression is notably upregulated in certain inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, indicating its involvement in immune responses and inflammation (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). Additionally, BPIFC has been implicated in various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and type 2 diabetes, where it may influence disease progression and immune regulation (Li2023Machine; Zhao2024Causal).

## Function
The BPIFC gene, located on chromosome 22q13, encodes a protein involved in lipid transfer and lipopolysaccharide binding, playing a role in innate immunity (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). Proteins in the BPI fold containing family, to which BPIFC belongs, are typically involved in the binding and neutralization of lipopolysaccharides from bacterial membranes, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms, particularly in epithelial tissues (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). 

In healthy human cells, BPIFC is rarely expressed, but it shows high expression levels in skin samples from psoriasis patients, suggesting its involvement in inflammation and immune response (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating a potential role in immune cell regulation (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). 

The MIR210HG-BPIFC lncRNA-mRNA pair has been identified as significant in the context of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where its downregulation is associated with changes in hypertrophy marker genes and cellular morphology (Zhang2024Transcriptomic). This suggests that BPIFC may have a role in the progression of HCM by influencing immune-related mechanisms and cellular processes (Zhang2024Transcriptomic).

## Clinical Significance
BPIFC (BPI fold containing family C) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), BPIFC is identified as one of the prognostic genes with a high mutation frequency in a specific subtype of AML patients. This subtype, characterized by a higher mutation rate in genes like BPIFC, is associated with a worse prognosis and a higher risk score, indicating its clinical significance in the progression and treatment response of AML (Li2023Machine).

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), BPIFC is suggested to contribute to the inflammatory processes underlying insulin resistance, a key factor in T2D pathogenesis. This association highlights the potential role of BPIFC in metabolic regulation and its impact on glucose metabolism, which are critical in the development and progression of T2D (Zhao2024Causal).

While BPIFC is also expressed in human skin, the specific diseases or conditions associated with its expression in this tissue are not detailed in the provided context. However, its role in skin barrier function and local immunological defense suggests potential implications in skin-related conditions (Edqvist2014Expression).
