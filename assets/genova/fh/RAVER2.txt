# RAVER2

## Overview
RAVER2 is a gene that encodes the ribonucleoprotein, PTB binding 2, which plays a significant role in RNA processing and alternative splicing regulation. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, nuclear localization signals, and a leucine-rich region, which facilitate its function in RNA binding and protein-protein interactions (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). RAVER2 interacts with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), modulating its activity and influencing splicing events, particularly in a tissue-specific manner (Rideau2006A; Coelho2016Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in the pancreas, and is involved in critical cellular processes such as differentiation and development (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). Its evolutionary conservation among vertebrates underscores its essential role in gene expression regulation (Romanelli2012Transcriptional).

## Structure
The RAVER2 protein is predicted to be a 678 amino acid peptide, organized into twelve exons within the gene's coding sequence (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). The protein contains three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which are crucial for its role in RNA binding and processing (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). Additionally, RAVER2 has two nuclear localization signals (NLS) located at the N- and C-terminals, facilitating its transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). A central leucine-rich region (LRR) is also present, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions (Romanelli2012Transcriptional).

The protein sequence of RAVER2 is highly conserved among vertebrates, sharing 84% identity with the mouse protein, indicating a significant evolutionary conservation of its structure and function (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). RAVER2, along with Raver1, interacts with the polypyrimidine-tract binding protein (PTB) and is involved in modulating PTB activity, potentially influencing alternative splicing events (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). The protein's ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and its localization in the perinucleolar compartment suggest a dynamic role in RNA processing (Romanelli2012Transcriptional).

## Function
RAVER2 is a ribonucleoprotein involved in RNA processing and alternative splicing regulation. It interacts with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a well-known splicing repressor, to modulate the splicing of target RNAs. RAVER2 contains conserved PTB-interacting motifs, specifically the [S/G][I/L]LGxPP sequence, which are crucial for its role in splicing repression (Rideau2006A). In humans, RAVER2 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, including the heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, with higher expression levels observed in the pancreas (Romanelli2012Transcriptional).

RAVER2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression by modulating alternative splicing events. It shares a common peptide domain organization with Raver1, including RNA recognition motifs and nuclear localization signals, allowing it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of tissue-specific splicing events, contributing to cellular differentiation and development. In medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), RAVER2 promotes alternative splicing event inclusion, particularly for Aire-neutral genes, suggesting a role in immune tolerance mechanisms (Padonou2021Airedependent).

## Interactions
RAVER2 is known to interact with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a key player in RNA splicing regulation. This interaction is facilitated by conserved peptide motifs in RAVER2 that are similar to those found in Raver1, another PTB-interacting protein. These motifs enable RAVER2 to bind PTB, suggesting a role in modulating PTB's splicing repressor activity (Rideau2006A; Coelho2016Functional).

RAVER2, along with Raver1, acts as a co-factor that modulates PTB activity in a tissue-dependent manner. Both proteins share a common domain organization, including RNA recognition motifs and nuclear localization signals, which are crucial for their function in RNA processing (Romanelli2012Transcriptional). RAVER2 is involved in alternative splicing regulation, particularly in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), where it promotes the inclusion of alternative splicing events (ASEs) in Aire-neutral genes. This process is dependent on the presence of H3K36me3 marks, which facilitate the recruitment of RAVER2 and PTB to specific genomic regions (Padonou2021Airedependent).

These interactions highlight RAVER2's role in RNA metabolism and its potential impact on gene expression regulation through its association with PTB and involvement in alternative splicing.
