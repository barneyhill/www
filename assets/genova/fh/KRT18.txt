# KRT18

## Overview
Keratin 18 (KRT18) is a gene that encodes the type I intermediate filament protein known as keratin 18. This protein is predominantly expressed in simple epithelial cells and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular structural integrity and resilience. As a member of the intermediate filament family, keratin 18 forms heterodimers with keratin 8 (K8), contributing to the cytoskeletal framework that supports cellular architecture and function (Jacob2018Types; Omary2009Toward). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response, apoptosis regulation, and maintenance of organelle positioning, such as the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria (Omary2009Toward). Mutations and altered expression of KRT18 are associated with liver diseases and cancers, where it serves as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Karantza2010Keratins; Ho2022Update).

## Structure
Keratin 18 (KRT18) is a type I intermediate filament protein characterized by a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. The rod domain is organized into three subdomains (coils 1A, 1B, and 2) and two linkers (L1 and L12), facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Jacob2018Types; Omary2009Toward). The L12 region includes a highly conserved caspase-digestion site (VEVD in K18), and the tail domain contains a caspase cut site (DALD), which are recognized by epitope-specific antibodies (Omary2009Toward).

KRT18 forms heterodimers with type II keratin 8 (K8), and these heterodimers further assemble into antiparallel tetramers, which are the basic building blocks for higher-order filament assembly (Jacob2018Types; Ho2022Update). The hydrophobic interface between heterodimers is crucial for tetrameric alignment and mature intermediate filament assembly (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, are common in KRT18 and contribute to its structural heterogeneity and functional regulation (Strnad2016Simple; Omary2009Toward). These modifications play roles in stress responses and cytoprotection, particularly in epithelial cells (Omary2009Toward).

## Function
Keratin 18 (KRT18) is a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells. It is predominantly expressed in simple epithelial cells and is involved in various cellular processes, including providing mechanical resilience and protecting cells from apoptosis (Karantza2010Keratins; Omary2009Toward). KRT18, along with its partner keratin 8 (K8), forms a structural framework within the cytoplasm, which helps cells withstand mechanical and non-mechanical stressors (Jacob2018Types; Karantza2010Keratins).

KRT18 is involved in regulating protein localization and targeting, contributing to epithelial cell polarity and organelle positioning, such as maintaining mitochondrial and Golgi integrity (Omary2009Toward). It acts as a phosphate "sponge" during oxidative stress, preventing unwarranted phosphorylation of proapoptotic substrates, thereby playing an antiapoptotic role (Omary2009Toward). KRT18 is also a major caspase substrate during apoptosis, and its cleavage is used as a biomarker for cancer and liver injury (Jacob2018Types).

In the liver, KRT18 is essential for maintaining hepatocyte integrity, and mutations in KRT18 can lead to increased cell fragility and liver disease progression (Omary2009Toward). Its widespread expression across various tissues underscores its importance in maintaining epithelial cell health and function (Ho2022Update).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KRT18 gene are associated with several liver diseases and cancers. In liver diseases, KRT18 mutations are linked to conditions such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and increased fibrosis during chronic hepatitis C infection. These mutations may disrupt interactions between keratins and their binding partners, contributing to liver pathology (Ho2022Update; Omary2009Toward). KRT18 variants are also overrepresented in patients with acute and chronic liver disease, acting as risk factors rather than direct causes (Omary2009Toward).

In cancer, KRT18 expression levels serve as prognostic markers. In breast cancer, downregulation of KRT18 is associated with advanced tumor stages and shorter survival, while its overexpression reduces invasiveness and tumorigenicity (Karantza2010Keratins; Omary2009Toward). In colorectal cancer, persistent expression of a caspase-cleaved K18 fragment indicates residual tumor load and correlates with recurrence risk (Karantza2010Keratins). High serum levels of cleaved K18 fragments before treatment predict shorter survival in lung cancer patients (Karantza2010Keratins). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KRT18 in both liver diseases and various cancers.

## Interactions
Keratin 18 (KRT18) is a type I intermediate filament protein that primarily interacts with keratin 8 (KRT8) to form heterodimers, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the intermediate filament network, contributing to cellular stability and resilience (Muriel2020Keratin).

In the context of cancer, KRT18 has been shown to interact with various proteins that influence cell behavior. In breast cancer cells, the transfection of KRT18 leads to the upregulation of adhesion proteins such as desmoglein, plakoglobin, and E-cadherin, which are important for cell adhesion and may reduce malignancy by influencing cell adhesion dynamics (Bühler2005Transfection). In melanoma, KRT18 is targeted by honokiol, a natural compound that induces its degradation through ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting melanoma cell growth (Liu2020Honokiol).

KRT18 also interacts with proteins involved in muscle structure, such as desmin and KRT19, forming a reticular pattern in muscle fibers. The presence of KRT19 and desmin is necessary for the proper organization of KRT18, indicating a mutual dependence among these proteins within the intermediate filament network (Muriel2020Keratin).
