# SLC1A4

## Overview
SLC1A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 4 (ASCT1), which is a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter. ASCT1 is primarily involved in the transport of small neutral amino acids such as L-serine, L-alanine, L-cysteine, and L-threonine across cell membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis within human cells (Kanai2004The; Pironti2018A). This transmembrane protein is predominantly expressed in glial cells in the brain, where it supports neuronal function by facilitating the exchange of L-serine and other substrates, which are essential for neurodevelopment and synaptic transmission (Kanai2004The; Foster2016DSerine). Mutations in the SLC1A4 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal brain function and development (Damseh2015Mutations; Yahyaoui2019Amino).

## Function
The SLC1A4 gene encodes the ASCT1 protein, a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter that plays a crucial role in maintaining amino acid homeostasis in human cells. ASCT1 is primarily involved in the transport of small neutral amino acids, including L-serine, L-alanine, L-cysteine, and L-threonine, across cell membranes (Kanai2004The; Pironti2018A). In the brain, ASCT1 is predominantly expressed in glial cells, where it facilitates the exchange of L-serine with other extracellular substrates, supporting neuronal function by meeting the metabolic demands of neurons (Kanai2004The).

L-serine, transported by ASCT1, is essential for neuronal development and function, serving as a precursor for the synthesis of other important compounds such as L-cysteine, phosphatidyl-L-serine, and neuromodulators like D-serine and glycine (Damseh2015Mutations). The transport of D-serine, a co-agonist of NMDA receptors, is also mediated by ASCT1, indicating its role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (Foster2016DSerine). The proper function of ASCT1 is necessary for normal neurodevelopment and prevention of conditions such as microcephaly and epileptic encephalopathy (Pironti2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC1A4 gene, which encodes the alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine and glutamate transporter 1 (ASCT1), are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders include congenital microcephaly, epileptic encephalopathy, severe hypotonia, global developmental delay, spasticity, and a thin corpus callosum (Pironti2018A; Yahyaoui2019Amino). The gene is crucial for transporting L-serine across the blood-brain barrier, and its deficiency can lead to significant neurological impairments, such as developmental delay, microcephaly, and hypomyelination (Damseh2015Mutations).

Specific mutations, such as p.E256K, p.L315fs, and p.R457W, have been identified in patients with these conditions, significantly reducing L-serine transport efficiency (Damseh2015Mutations). The p.E256K mutation, in particular, has a carrier frequency of 0.7% in the Ashkenazi-Jewish population (Damseh2015Mutations). Additionally, novel mutations like p.Gly381Arg and p.Trp453* have been reported, further highlighting the gene's role in severe neurodevelopmental disorders (Conroy2016Novel; Pironti2018A).

The condition known as SPATCCM (spastic tetraplegia, thin corpus callosum, and progressive microcephaly) is also linked to SLC1A4 mutations, affecting various ethnic groups, including Ashkenazi Jewish, Irish, Italian, and Pakistani populations (Mohamed2023Novel).

## Interactions
SLC1A4, also known as ASCT1, is involved in the transport of neutral amino acids and participates in various interactions that influence its function. It is known to interact with the retromer complex, specifically through the SNX27/retromer and WASH-complex pathways, which are crucial for the endocytic recycling of certain transporters. The presence of a PDZ ligand at the C-terminus of SLC1A4 facilitates its interaction with SNX27, a component of the retromer complex. This interaction is essential for the proper recycling of SLC1A4 to the cell surface, as the removal of the PDZ ligand results in lysosomal mis-sorting and loss from the cell surface (Kvainickas2017Retromer).

SLC1A4 also interacts with other proteins involved in amino acid transport, such as SLC1A5 (ASCT2), sharing similar substrate specificities and transport mechanisms. Both transporters are involved in the sodium-dependent exchange of neutral amino acids, including D-serine, which is significant for regulating NMDA receptor function in the central nervous system (Foster2016DSerine). These interactions highlight the role of SLC1A4 in maintaining amino acid homeostasis and its potential involvement in neurological processes.
