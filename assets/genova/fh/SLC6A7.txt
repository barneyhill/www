# SLC6A7

## Overview
The SLC6A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 7 (PROT), which is a transmembrane transporter belonging to the SLC6 family of neurotransmitter transporters. This protein is primarily involved in the high-affinity transport of the amino acid L-proline across cell membranes, utilizing a sodium gradient to facilitate this process. PROT is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly within synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic nerve terminals, where it plays a critical role in modulating excitatory synaptic transmission and maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis (Pramod2013SLC6; Rudnick2013The). The gene's function and expression patterns suggest its involvement in essential neurological processes, such as learning and memory, and its potential implications in various clinical conditions, including asthma and familial Ménière's disease, underscore its significance in human health (Skarp2022New; Kim2010A).

## Function
The SLC6A7 gene encodes the PROT transporter, a member of the SLC6 family of transporters, which is primarily responsible for the high-affinity transport of L-proline in the central nervous system. This transporter is electrogenic and utilizes a sodium gradient to facilitate the uptake of L-proline and other amino acids across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter regulation (Pramod2013SLC6; Rudnick2013The). 

PROT is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in synaptic vesicles of glutamatergic nerve terminals, where it is thought to modulate excitatory synaptic transmission. This modulation is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis and may influence processes such as learning and memory (Pramod2013SLC6). The transporter is inhibited by enkephalins, indicating a regulatory mechanism that could impact synaptic activity and neurotransmitter levels (Rudnick2013The).

In healthy human cells, SLC6A7 contributes to the regulation of neurotransmitter levels and synaptic activity, supporting amino acid homeostasis and neuronal communication within the central nervous system (Rudnick2013The; Kristensen2011SLC6).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC6A7 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in neurotransmitter transport. Polymorphisms in SLC6A7 have been associated with asthma, particularly in the Korean population. Studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene that correlate with increased bronchodilator response in asthmatic patients, suggesting a potential link between SLC6A7 and asthma susceptibility (Kim2010A). However, these associations often lose significance after multiple testing corrections, indicating the need for further research to confirm these findings (Kim2010A).

In addition to asthma, the SLC6A7 gene has been studied in the context of familial Ménière's disease (MD). A missense variant in SLC6A7, c.322G>C/p.V108L, was identified in a family with MD, suggesting a potential role in the disease's genetic architecture. This variant, along with others, may contribute to MD through mechanisms involving oxidative stress (Skarp2022New). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential clinical significance, although the exact mechanisms and broader implications remain to be fully elucidated.
