# TP53INP2

## Overview
TP53INP2, or tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and ribosome biogenesis. The protein encoded by TP53INP2 is categorized as an autophagy-regulating protein, playing a pivotal role in the formation of autophagosomes by interacting with key autophagy-related proteins like MAP1LC3A/B and VMP1. This interaction is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis through the degradation and recycling of cellular components (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR). Additionally, TP53INP2 is involved in ribosomal RNA transcription within the nucleolus, contributing to ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis by facilitating the assembly of the RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sala2014Autophagyregulating; Huang2023Cytoplasmic).

## Structure


## Function
TP53INP2, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 2, plays a crucial role in both autophagy and ribosome biogenesis in healthy human cells. It is involved in promoting autophagy by interacting with autophagy-related proteins such as MAP1LC3A/B and VMP1, facilitating the formation of autophagosomes. This process is essential for degrading and recycling cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR).

In the nucleus, TP53INP2 localizes to the nucleolus, where it participates in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription. It aids in the assembly of the RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex (PIC) at ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoters, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and protein production. This function is mediated by a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in its C-terminal domain, allowing TP53INP2 to dynamically exchange between the nucleoplasm and nucleolus (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR).

TP53INP2 also interacts with several components of the POLR1 PIC, including UBTF, TAF1A, RRN3, and POLR1A, and is necessary for the proper assembly of this complex. Its knockdown results in decreased protein synthesis rates and inhibited cell proliferation, highlighting its role in cell growth and proliferation (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TP53INP2 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations, TP53INP2 is upregulated and localized in the cytoplasm, enhancing autophagy and supporting leukemia cell survival. High TP53INP2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in NPM1-mutated AML (Huang2023Cytoplasmic). 

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), TP53INP2 is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor differentiation and lymphatic metastasis. Lower expression levels are linked to increased tumor progression and poorer prognosis, indicating its role as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Cao2021Integrative).

TP53INP2 also plays a role in regulating apoptosis. It interacts with caspase-8 and TRAF6, promoting apoptosis in response to death receptor signaling. Alterations in TP53INP2 expression or mutations affecting its interactions can impact cancer cell susceptibility to apoptosis, influencing treatment outcomes (Ivanova2019Regulation). 

In skeletal muscle, TP53INP2 regulates autophagy and muscle mass. Its overexpression leads to muscle wasting, while its repression in diabetes may help preserve muscle mass, highlighting its potential impact on metabolic disorders (Sala2014Autophagyregulating).

## Interactions
TP53INP2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in autophagy and transcription regulation. It associates with autophagic membranes through its interaction with LC3, a protein crucial for autophagy, and forms a complex with ATG7, which is essential for the lipidation of LC3 and autophagosome formation (You2019TP53INP2). The interaction between TP53INP2 and ATG7 is mediated by specific regions within these proteins, with amino acids 1 to 28 in TP53INP2 being crucial for binding to ATG7 (You2019TP53INP2).

In NPM1-mutated leukemia cells, TP53INP2 interacts with mutant NPM1 proteins, facilitating its cytoplasmic localization and enhancing autophagy by promoting the interaction between LC3 and ATG7 (Huang2023Cytoplasmic). TP53INP2 also interacts with components of the POLR1 preinitiation complex (PIC) at rDNA promoters, including UBTF, TAF1A, RRN3, and POLR1A, facilitating rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis (Xu2016TP53INP2DOR). These interactions are crucial for TP53INP2's role in cellular processes, including autophagy and transcription regulation.
