# CCL1

## Overview
C-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) is a gene that encodes a small cytokine belonging to the CC chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in immune system regulation. The protein product of CCL1, also known as I-309 or TCA3, is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the CCR8 receptor, influencing various immune cell functions, including the recruitment and activation of monocytes and lymphocytes. This chemokine is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis and is particularly significant in the modulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are essential for controlling inflammatory responses (VilaCaballer2019Disruption). CCL1 is expressed in several cell types, including activated T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages, and is implicated in cardiovascular health by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell migration and endothelial cell activation (VilaCaballer2019Disruption). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are of clinical interest due to their roles in inflammatory diseases and potential therapeutic applications (White2013CC).

## Structure
The CCL1 protein, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 1, is a small chemokine with a primary structure consisting of 73 amino acids, including an N-glycosylation site at Asn 29 (Okamoto2014Total). A variant, Ser-CCL1, has an additional serine residue at the N-terminal, making it 74 amino acids long (Okamoto2014(Quasi‐)Racemic page 1 of 2). The secondary structure of CCL1 includes a flexible N-terminal peptide chain, three antiparallel beta-strands, and a C-terminal alpha-helix (Okamoto2014Total). The tertiary structure is stabilized by two disulfide bonds, a common feature among chemokines, while Ser-CCL1 has an unusual third disulfide bond (Okamoto2014Total; Okamoto2014(Quasi‐)Racemic page 1 of 2).

The quaternary structure involves dimerization through an intermolecular antiparallel beta-sheet, a typical feature in CC chemokine dimer formation (Okamoto2014(Quasi‐)Racemic page 1 of 2). CCL1 is naturally glycosylated, and this post-translational modification can significantly impact its biological function, although the exact natural glycan structure remains undetermined (Okamoto2014Total). Glycosylation does not significantly alter the protein structure but can affect its chemotactic activity (Okamoto2014Total; Okamoto2014(Quasi‐)Racemic page 0 of 2).

## Function
CCL1, also known as I-309 or TCA3, is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It primarily functions by binding to the CCR8 receptor, which is expressed on various immune cells, including T lymphocytes. In healthy human cells, CCL1 is produced by activated T lymphocytes and acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes and lymphocytes, facilitating their recruitment and activation in immune responses (VilaCaballer2019Disruption). This chemokine is also involved in maintaining immune homeostasis, particularly through its effects on regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are crucial for preventing excessive inflammatory responses (VilaCaballer2019Disruption).

CCL1 is expressed in endothelial cells and macrophages, and it plays a role in the cardiovascular system by stimulating vascular smooth muscle cell migration and activating endothelial cells in response to arterial wall injury (VilaCaballer2019Disruption). In the context of aging, CCL1 levels increase, which may contribute to a shift towards a Th2 immune bias, potentially influencing the development of age-related diseases (Mansfield2012Normal). Overall, CCL1 is a key player in immune surveillance and homeostasis, influencing both cellular and organismal immune functions.

## Clinical Significance
CCL1, a member of the CC chemokine family, plays a significant role in immune responses and is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. The interaction between CCL1 and its principal receptor, CCR8, is crucial in immune responses, particularly in Th2-mediated inflammation. Alterations in this interaction can have clinical significance in diseases characterized by Th2-mediated inflammation, such as allergic conditions and certain parasitic infections (White2013CC).

In the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, excessive production of chemokines like CCL1 can lead to persistent leukocyte infiltration, contributing to conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are marked by ongoing inflammation that can result in tissue damage and severe health outcomes, including myocardial infarction or stroke (White2013CC).

The role of CCL1 in cell survival mechanisms has also been noted, as its interaction with CCR8 can protect certain cell lines from apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in cell survival pathways (White2013CC). These findings highlight the potential of targeting CCL1 and its receptor interactions as therapeutic strategies in managing inflammatory and immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
CCL1, also known as I-309, primarily interacts with the CCR8 receptor, which is significant for its role in anti-apoptotic and proliferative activities. The interaction with CCR8 is enhanced by the C-terminal clipping of CCL1, which increases its intracellular calcium release and anti-apoptotic activity. This clipping is mediated by carboxypeptidase M (CPM), which removes three amino acids from the C-terminus of CCL1, reducing its binding affinity to CCR8 but enhancing its function as a CCR8 agonist (Denis2012CTerminal).

CCL1 also interacts with the Yaba-like disease virus protein 7L, which acts as a cell-surface receptor for CCL1. This interaction involves high-affinity binding and is associated with increased receptor signaling via heterotrimeric G-proteins and mitogen signaling pathways. The binding of CCL1 to 7L can induce downstream signaling, such as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 proteins, and may block apoptosis via the RAS/MAPK pathway, enhancing cell survival (Najarro2003Yabalike).

These interactions highlight the role of CCL1 in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in viral pathogenesis through its interaction with viral proteins.
