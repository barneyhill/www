# REC8

## Overview
REC8 is a gene that encodes the REC8 meiotic recombination protein, a crucial component of the cohesin complex specifically involved in meiosis. This protein plays a vital role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiotic cell division, which is essential for sexual reproduction. As a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, REC8 is integral to maintaining sister chromatid cohesion and facilitating homologous chromosome pairing and recombination. The protein's function is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are necessary for its cleavage and the orderly disassembly of cohesin complexes during meiosis. REC8's interactions with other cohesin subunits and regulatory proteins underscore its importance in shaping meiotic chromosome architecture and ensuring genomic stability (Brar2006Rec8; Lee2003Temporally; Sakuno2022Rec8).

## Structure
The REC8 protein is a meiosis-specific component of the cohesin complex, playing a crucial role in chromosome segregation. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, which includes several phosphorylation sites that are key to its function during meiosis (Brar2006Rec8). The secondary structure of REC8 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with other cohesin subunits.

REC8 contains a kleisin domain, which is essential for its role in the cohesin complex. This domain facilitates the binding of REC8 to other cohesin components, such as Psm3, forming a ring-like structure that encircles sister chromatids to maintain cohesion (Liu2024Phosphorylation). The quaternary structure of REC8 involves its interaction with other cohesin subunits, forming a complex that is crucial for its function in meiosis.

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating REC8's function. Phosphorylation sites on REC8 are crucial for its cleavage and the step-wise loss of cohesins during meiosis, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation (Brar2006Rec8; Liu2024Phosphorylation).

## Function
REC8 is a cohesin protein that plays a critical role in meiosis, a specialized form of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction. In healthy human cells, REC8 is essential for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during prophase I of meiosis. It is a component of the cohesin complex, which ensures that sister chromatids remain connected until they are ready to be separated during anaphase II (Lee2003Temporally; TachibanaKonwalski2010Rec8containing).

REC8 is specifically expressed in germ line cells, such as spermatocytes and spermatids, and is not found in mitotic cells like spermatogonia. This expression pattern underscores its specialized role in meiotic cell division (Lee2003Temporally). During meiosis, REC8 localizes along the synaptonemal complexes, which are structures that facilitate the pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes. This localization is crucial for the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes (Lee2003Temporally).

The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which is necessary for its cleavage and the subsequent step-wise loss of cohesins during meiosis. This process is vital for accurate chromosome segregation and the prevention of aneuploidy, which can lead to infertility and genetic disorders (Brar2006Rec8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the REC8 gene have significant clinical implications. In the context of reproductive health, partial loss of function in REC8 can lead to meiotic errors, resulting in chromosomally abnormal eggs. This increases the risk of aneuploid pregnancies and the transmission of structural chromosome abnormalities in humans, particularly affecting women who are carriers of mutations in meiosis-specific cohesin genes like REC8 (Murdoch2013Altered).

In cancer, REC8 functions as a tumor suppressor and is notably downregulated in gastric cancer (GC), especially in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive subtype. This downregulation is primarily due to promoter methylation, which is significantly higher in EBV-positive gastric tumors. The methylation of the REC8 promoter is an independent risk factor for poor survival in GC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yu2016REC8).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), REC8 is abnormally activated, promoting tumor migration, invasion, and angiogenesis through the PKA pathway. High REC8 expression is associated with increased tumor progression, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in HCC (Han2021REC8).

## Interactions
REC8, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, plays a crucial role in meiotic chromosomal events through its interactions with various proteins. It forms a cohesin complex with other subunits like Rec11 in S. pombe, which is essential for the correct localization of proteins such as Red1 and Hop1 to chromosomal axis sites, facilitating the assembly of linear elements (LinE) along sister chromatids (Sakuno2022Rec8). In S. cerevisiae, REC8 interacts with Pds5 and Rad61/Wapl, which modulate cohesin activity. Pds5 stabilizes REC8 localization, promoting homolog pairing and recombination initiation, while Rad61/Wapl promotes non-crossover recombination by removing [Pds5+Rec8] cohesin complexes (Hong2019Recruitment).

REC8 is also involved in maintaining homolog bias during crossover and non-crossover formation, with its interactions being crucial for the regulation of these processes (Hong2019Recruitment). In S. pombe, REC8 cohesin is necessary for the formation of axis-loop chromatin structures, which are vital for meiotic recombination and homolog alignment (Sakuno2021Rec8). These interactions highlight REC8's role in shaping meiotic chromosome architecture and facilitating proper chromosome segregation.
