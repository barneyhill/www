# ZNF678

## Overview
ZNF678 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 678, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 678 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, by binding to DNA and influencing gene expression. The specific biological functions and pathways involving ZNF678 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with other proteins and DNA sequences. The clinical significance of ZNF678 is not fully understood, but alterations in its expression or function may have implications in certain diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
