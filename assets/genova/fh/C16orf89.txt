# C16orf89

## Overview
C16orf89 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 16 open reading frame 89. This protein is primarily expressed in the thyroid gland and is characterized by its secretion in a glycosylated form, which is essential for its function. The protein is predicted to form homodimers and is conserved among mammals, although it lacks identifiable functional domains. Despite its high expression in the thyroid, the specific physiological role of C16orf89 remains unclear. However, it has been implicated in various cancers, including esophageal cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression levels may influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Vizeacoumar2021Mining; Afink2010Initial; Hamilton2018Global). Further research is necessary to fully understand the biological and clinical significance of C16orf89.

## Structure
The C16orf89 gene encodes two alternatively spliced mRNA variants, resulting in two protein isoforms. The major transcript variant, which is predominant in human thyroid tissue, encodes a protein of 361 amino acids with an expected molecular weight of 40.6 kDa. The minor transcript variant encodes a longer protein of 402 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 45.4 kDa (Afink2010Initial). Both proteins contain a putative signal peptide and O-glycosylation sites, indicating that they are likely secreted in a glycosylated form (Afink2010Initial).

The C16orf89 protein is strongly conserved among mammals, but no known functional domains have been identified through InterProScan analysis (Afink2010Initial). The protein is predicted to form homodimers, as demonstrated by tandem affinity purification and immunoblotting (Afink2010Initial). Glycosylation is necessary for its secretion, as shown in experiments with HEK-293 cells (Afink2010Initial). The translation of C16orf89 likely starts at the second methionine due to the poor conservation of the first ATG start site and a weak Kozak sequence (Afink2010Initial). Specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available data.

## Function
The gene C16orf89 is identified as a novel thyroid-specific gene with high expression in the thyroid gland. It is primarily expressed in the thyroid, with low expression in other tissues (Afink2010Initial). The protein encoded by C16orf89 is predicted to be secreted and undergoes glycosylation, which is necessary for its secretion. In cell studies, C16orf89 forms homodimers, indicating a potential role in protein-protein interactions (Afink2010Initial). Immunohistochemistry shows that C16orf89 is expressed in the cytosolic/membranous regions of thyroid follicular epithelial cells, but not in the colloidal content (Afink2010Initial). 

The major splice variant of C16orf89 encodes a 361 amino acid protein that is conserved among mammals, contains an N-terminal signal peptide, and is secreted in a glycosylated form (Afink2010Initial). Despite its high expression in the thyroid, the specific function of C16orf89 in healthy cells is not well understood. The study suggests that C16orf89 may have a role in thyroid-specific functions, although its exact function in healthy cells is not explicitly detailed (Afink2010Initial).

## Clinical Significance
C16orf89 has been implicated in various cancers, although its precise role and clinical significance remain unclear. In esophageal cancer, C16orf89 is significantly downregulated, suggesting it may play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of this cancer type (Vizeacoumar2021Mining). Similarly, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), C16orf89 has been identified as a differentially expressed transcript, indicating potential involvement in the disease, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Hamilton2018Global).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (nsNSCLC), higher expression levels of C16orf89 have been associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, suggesting a potential prognostic role (Fennell2014Association). However, the exact mechanisms by which C16orf89 influences these outcomes are not fully understood.

C16orf89 is also noted for its limited expression in pancreatic tissues, which may indicate a potential role in pancreatic cancer, although specific clinical significance has not been established (MAKLER2017Mining). Overall, while C16orf89 is associated with various cancers, further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.
