# TESMIN

## Overview
TESMIN is a gene that encodes the testis expressed metallothionein-like protein, which is primarily involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis. This protein is categorized as a metallothionein-like protein and is crucial for the progression of meiosis in male germ cells. TESMIN is predominantly expressed in the testes, where it plays a significant role in the transition of germ cells from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during the zygotene-pachytene stage of meiosis. This translocation is essential for meiotic progression and is mediated through interactions with the LIN9 component of the MuvB core complex (Zhang2021Nuclear; Oura2022Proximitydependent). Beyond its role in reproductive biology, TESMIN has been implicated in cell cycle regulation and is associated with various protein-protein interactions, including those with the MYBL1-MuvB complex. Additionally, TESMIN expression has clinical significance, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels correlate with cell proliferation and prognosis (Grzegrzolka2020Role).

## Function
TESMIN, also known as testis expressed metallothionein-like protein, plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the progression of meiosis in male germ cells. It is primarily expressed in the testes, where it translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during the zygotene-pachytene transition, a critical phase in meiosis. This translocation is essential for meiotic progression beyond the pachytene stage and is mediated by TESMIN's interaction with the LIN9 component of the MuvB core complex (Zhang2021Nuclear; Oura2022Proximitydependent).

TESMIN is involved in cell cycle regulation during spermatogenesis, as it interacts with components of the MYBL1-MuvB complex, which regulates cell-cycle gene expression (Oura2022Proximitydependent). The protein's function is crucial for proper meiotic progression, as demonstrated by the infertility observed in Tesmin knockout male mice, which exhibit arrested spermatogenesis at the pachytene stage (Oji2020Tesmin).

TESMIN's activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus suggests its involvement in cellular processes such as differentiation and cell cycle regulation, contributing to the overall reproductive success in males (Oura2022Proximitydependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in TESMIN expression have been linked to various clinical implications, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Increased expression of TESMIN in NSCLC is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, as it correlates positively with the expression of proliferation markers MCM5 and MCM7. This suggests that TESMIN may play a role in the proliferation of cancer cells, making it a potential marker for prognosis in NSCLC (Grzegrzolka2020Role). 

In NSCLC, higher cytoplasmic TESMIN expression is associated with poorer prognosis, as patients with elevated TESMIN mRNA levels have significantly shorter survival times. This indicates that TESMIN expression levels could serve as a prognostic factor in NSCLC (Grzegrzolka2020Role). 

TESMIN is also crucial for male fertility, as demonstrated in studies with Tesmin knockout mice. The absence of TESMIN leads to infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis, highlighting its essential role in meiotic progression and testis function (Oji2020Tesmin). These findings underscore the importance of TESMIN in both cancer progression and reproductive health.

## Interactions
TESMIN, also known as metallothionein-like 5 (MTL5), is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly in testicular germ cells. It is associated with the MYBL1-MuvB complex, which plays a role in regulating cell-cycle gene expression. This interaction was identified using proximity-dependent biotin labeling techniques, highlighting TESMIN's involvement in cell cycle regulation during spermatogenesis (Oura2022Proximitydependent).

TESMIN also interacts with proteins such as MYBL1 and LIN9, as confirmed through immunoblot analysis and significance analysis of interactome (SAINT). These interactions suggest TESMIN's role in the regulation of meiotic progression in spermatocytes (Oura2022Proximitydependent). Additionally, TESMIN has been identified as a potential interacting partner of phospholipase D6 (PLD6) in mouse testes, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis through this association (Riew2021Cellular).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TESMIN expression correlates with the expression of MCM5 and MCM7, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation and potential interactions with these proteins (Grzegrzolka2020Role). These interactions highlight TESMIN's multifaceted role in both reproductive biology and cancer cell proliferation.
