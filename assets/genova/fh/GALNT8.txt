# GALNT8

## Overview
GALNT8 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 8, a member of the glycosyltransferase family involved in the initial step of mucin-type O-glycosylation. This enzyme is categorized as a type II membrane protein and is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine and threonine residues on target proteins. This glycosylation process is essential for various cellular functions, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein stability (Ten2002All; Nakano2013Singlenucleotide). Despite its expression in multiple tissues, the enzymatic activity of GALNT8 has been reported as potentially non-functional in vitro (Kato2021Polypeptide). Variants of GALNT8 have been linked to the modulation of interferon signaling pathways, which may influence immune responses to viral infections (Nakano2013Singlenucleotide). Additionally, GALNT8 has been implicated in various cancers, with mutations affecting its function and potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Hussain2013Clinically).

## Function
GALNT8 encodes a type II membrane protein that is part of the O-linked UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) glycosyltransferase family, which is responsible for transferring GalNAc to serine and threonine residues on target proteins within the Golgi apparatus. This process is a critical step in the biosynthesis of mucin-like O-glycans, which are involved in various cellular processes such as cell motility, growth, death, cell-to-cell communication, and immune functions (Ten2002All; Nakano2013Singlenucleotide). GALNT8 is one of 20 identified human GALNT isoforms, each with different tissue distributions and substrate specificities (Nakano2013Singlenucleotide).

The enzymatic activity of GALNT8, however, has been suggested to be non-functional in vitro, despite its expression in several tissues (Kato2021Polypeptide). GALNT8 variants have been associated with the modulation of interferon (IFN) signaling pathways, potentially affecting transcriptional regulation and the immune response to viral infections (Nakano2013Singlenucleotide). The protein's role in glycosylation processes is essential for the proper functioning of glycoproteins, which play roles in cellular communication, stability, and immune response (Pucci2021Glycosyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GALNT8 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. GALNT8 is involved in mucin-type O-glycosylation, a process crucial for cell growth and differentiation. Mutations in GALNT8, particularly in its catalytic and ricin B-type lectin domains, can lead to loss of enzyme function and are associated with diseases such as ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers (Hussain2013Clinically). The G359D variant of GALNT8, located in a highly conserved catalytic region, is predicted to have a high damaging effect, altering energy and electrostatic interactions, which may impact the enzyme's function (Hussain2013Clinically).

In the context of colon cancer, GALNT8 expression is significantly higher in cohorts with elevated B4GALNT2 expression, suggesting a potential tumor-restraining role, as this expression pattern is associated with a phenotype closer to normal (Pucci2021Glycosyltransferase). Despite its polymorphic nature, no substitutions in GALNT8 have been directly linked to autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), and its enzymatic activity remains unclear, with some studies suggesting it might be non-functional in vitro (Kato2021Polypeptide).

## Interactions
GALNT8, or polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 8, is known to interact with coatomer proteins, specifically through its N-terminal cytoplasmic tails (N-tails). These interactions are crucial for the localization and recycling of GALNT8 within the Golgi apparatus. The N-tails of GALNT8 can pull down endogenous coatomer, indicating a direct interaction with these proteins. This interaction is facilitated by a common binding motif, ϕ-(K/R)-X-L-X-(K/R), found in the N-tails of glycosyltransferases that interact with COPI subunits. GALNT8 binds well to the purified human MHD of δ-COP, although its binding to the purified ζ1-COP is variable (Liu2018Recycling).

The study also suggests that the presence of this consensus sequence in the N-tails is necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting, as demonstrated by chimeric constructs. Despite the importance of these interactions, GOLPH3 is not required for the Golgi localization of GALNT8 in HeLa cells, indicating that GALNT8 may utilize alternative mechanisms for its localization (Liu2018Recycling). The interactions of GALNT8 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these coatomer proteins are not detailed in the available context.
