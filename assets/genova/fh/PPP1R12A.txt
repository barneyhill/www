# PPP1R12A

## Overview
The PPP1R12A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A, commonly referred to as myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1). This protein is a critical regulatory subunit of the myosin phosphatase complex, which plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction and cell motility by modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). MYPT1 is characterized by its structural domains, including ankyrin repeats and leucine zipper motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its regulatory functions (Grassie2011The; Chao2012Sitespecific). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, and is implicated in signaling pathways like mTOR and RhoA, influencing insulin signaling and other cellular activities (Zhang2014Quantitative; Geetha2012Protein). Mutations and alterations in the expression of PPP1R12A have been associated with congenital disorders and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Hughes2020LossofFunction; Benvenuto2020Expression).

## Structure
The PPP1R12A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase, known as MYPT1, which is involved in muscle contraction and cell motility. The protein consists of 1030 amino acids and includes several key structural domains. The N-terminal region contains eight ankyrin repeats (residues 39-296), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a PP1c-binding motif (K/R-I/V-X-F/W, residues 35-38) necessary for binding to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1δ (PP1cδ) (Grassie2011The; Chao2012Sitespecific). The C-terminal region features four leucine zipper motifs, which are important for dimerization and protein interaction (Chao2012Sitespecific).

MYPT1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at multiple sites, such as T696 and T853, which regulate its activity and interaction with myosin (Grassie2011The). Phosphorylation at these sites can inhibit myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity, affecting muscle contraction (Grassie2011The). Alternative splicing of PPP1R12A results in isoforms with or without a leucine zipper domain, influencing the protein's regulatory functions and sensitivity to signaling pathways (Grassie2011The; LaFlamme2018Alternative).

The protein's structure includes a myosin phosphatase N-terminal element (MyPhoNE) and a conserved RVxF motif, both crucial for its interaction with PP1c (Grassie2011The). These structural features enable PPP1R12A to modulate the specificity and activity of PP1cδ, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as muscle contraction and cell migration (Chao2012Sitespecific).

## Function
PPP1R12A, also known as myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by modulating the activity and specificity of the catalytic subunit of PP1. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which is essential for smooth muscle contraction and cell motility (Zhang2014Quantitative; Chao2012Sitespecific). PPP1R12A forms a myosin phosphatase holoenzyme with the δ isoform of PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1cδ), regulating muscle contraction and cell migration (Chao2012Sitespecific).

In the context of insulin signaling, PPP1R12A is involved in the regulation of serine/threonine phosphorylation events, affecting pathways such as mTOR and RhoA signaling (Zhang2014Quantitative). It interacts with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and is part of the phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) insulin-signaling pathway, influencing the phosphorylation state of IRS1 and contributing to insulin action (Geetha2012Protein). PPP1R12A's activity is modulated by insulin, which can stimulate or suppress its phosphorylation at specific sites, affecting its function and interactions with other proteins (Chao2012Sitespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R12A gene, which encodes the myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), are associated with a range of congenital disorders and developmental anomalies. Loss-of-function variants in PPP1R12A have been linked to a congenital malformations syndrome characterized by brain and genitourinary system abnormalities, including holoprosencephaly, urogenital malformations, and disorders of sex development (Hughes2020LossofFunction). These variants often result in neurological symptoms such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebral malformations, and seizures, as seen in genitourinary and/or brain malformation syndrome (GUBS) (Tong2024Functional).

In addition to congenital disorders, alterations in PPP1R12A expression have been implicated in cancer. The gene has been identified as a candidate in the development of invasive lobular breast carcinoma, where its mutation may drive tumorigenesis (Kas2017Insertional). In high-grade serous ovarian cancer, high expression levels of PPP1R12A are associated with shorter survival, suggesting its role in therapy resistance and prognosis (Benvenuto2020Expression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R12A in both developmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
PPP1R12A, also known as MYPT1, is a regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase and interacts with several proteins to regulate various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c), specifically the δ isoform, to modulate the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated myosin, which is crucial for muscle contraction and cell migration (Chao2012Sitespecific). PPP1R12A interacts with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) in an insulin-stimulated manner, a process dependent on the activation of Akt and mTOR/raptor pathways, but not MAPK, suggesting its role in insulin signaling (Geetha2012Protein).

The protein also interacts with Rho-associated kinase (ROK), which phosphorylates PPP1R12A at specific sites, affecting its activity and interaction with myosin (Grassie2011The). In the context of prostate cancer, PPP1R12A has been shown to interact with 51 proteins, as identified through tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) analyses, highlighting its involvement in pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling (Zou2021Identification). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PPP1R12A in cellular signaling and regulation.
