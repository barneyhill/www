# CLDN23

## Overview
CLDN23 is a gene that encodes the protein claudin 23, a member of the claudin family, which is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. Claudin 23 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its four transmembrane helices and two extracellular segments, which are essential for its role in regulating paracellular ion permeability and maintaining tight junction architecture (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). The protein is predominantly expressed in differentiated intestinal epithelial cells and is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). Claudin 23 interacts with other claudins, such as CLDN3 and CLDN4, forming complexes that are vital for the stability and function of tight junctions (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and neural tube defects, highlighting its clinical relevance (Baumholtz2020Functional; Alghamdi2023Identification).

## Structure
Claudin 23 (CLDN23) is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its role in forming tight junctions in epithelial cells. The protein structure of CLDN23 includes four transmembrane helices, a short intracellular N-terminal region, and a longer C-terminal region. It also features two extracellular segments (ECSs), which are crucial for its function in paracellular ion permeability and tight junction architecture (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). 

A distinctive feature of CLDN23 is its long cytoplasmic tail, consisting of 111 amino acids, which is longer than those found in many other claudins (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). This tail may play a role in its unique functional properties. The extracellular segments contain uncharged residues that are predicted to influence ion charge selectivity, contributing to the protein's ability to regulate ion permeability (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

CLDN23 forms heteromeric and heterotypic complexes with other claudins, such as CLDN3 and CLDN4, which are energetically favored over homotypic interactions. These interactions are important for the protein's role in modulating tight junction architecture and function (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). The protein's structure and interactions are further analyzed using computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, which provide insights into its pore architecture and ion selectivity (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

## Function
Claudin-23 (CLDN23) is a crucial component of epithelial tight junctions, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. CLDN23 is predominantly expressed in differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and is localized to the apical aspect of the lateral plasma membrane, corresponding to the location of bicellular tight junctions (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). It functions by regulating paracellular permeability to ions and macromolecules, thereby influencing the selective permeability of epithelial barriers (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

CLDN23 interacts with other claudins, such as CLDN3 and CLDN4, forming both homomeric and heteromeric interactions that are essential for maintaining barrier integrity. These interactions help stabilize CLDN3 and CLDN4 at the tight junction plasma membrane, influencing the morphology and function of tight junctions (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). Overexpression of CLDN23 has been shown to increase transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating enhanced barrier function, while its absence leads to increased permeability and decreased TEER (RayaSandino2023Claudin23; Hana2024Claudins). CLDN23's role in reshaping tight junction architecture is crucial for regulating barrier function in healthy human cells (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

## Clinical Significance
CLDN23 (claudin 23) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In colon cancer, lower expression levels of CLDN23 are associated with shorter survival times, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. This downregulation is observed in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and is linked to disease progression, with genetic alterations in CLDN23 contributing to the pathogenesis of colon cancer (Alghamdi2023Identification). CLDN23 is also part of a protein-protein interaction network involving other claudins, which may influence cancer progression (Alghamdi2023Identification).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CLDN23 expression varies across molecular subtypes. In the CMS2 and C1 subtypes, low CLDN23 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and progression-free survival, indicating a potential tumor-promoting function. Conversely, in the CMS4 and C4 subtypes, lower expression is associated with longer survival, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Cherradi2019&lt; p&gt; Claudin).

CLDN23 has also been linked to neural tube defects (NTDs), with rare missense variants potentially contributing to the development of these conditions (Baumholtz2020Functional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CLDN23 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
Claudin-23 (CLDN23) is involved in various interactions with other claudin proteins, particularly CLDN3 and CLDN4, within epithelial cells. These interactions occur both in cis, at the same cell membrane, and in trans, between opposing cell membranes. CLDN23 influences the localization of CLDN3 and CLDN4 in the tight junction (TJ) plasma membrane, promoting their recruitment and stabilization at TJs, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

In cis interactions, CLDN23 forms stable heteromeric complexes with CLDN3 and CLDN4, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays (PLA) and computational modeling. These interactions are energetically favored and contribute to the regulation of tight junction pore selectivity and epithelial barrier function (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). The PANEL analysis predicts stable low-energy conformations for these interactions, suggesting a preferential association order of CLDN4 > CLDN3 > CLDN23 (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).

In trans interactions, CLDN23 associates with CLDN3 and CLDN4, but not with CLDN2, as shown by immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging. These interactions are characterized by significant colocalization indices and are thought to influence the architecture and function of paracellular channels (RayaSandino2023Claudin23). Through these interactions, CLDN23 plays a significant role in reshaping TJ architecture and regulating barrier function (RayaSandino2023Claudin23).
