# NLGN2

## Overview
NLGN2 is a gene that encodes the protein neuroligin 2, a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule primarily involved in the formation and function of inhibitory synapses in the nervous system. Neuroligin 2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, which is essential for normal neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (Chih2005Control; Durieux2016Neuroligin2). The protein interacts with presynaptic neurexins and other synaptic proteins, facilitating synaptic connectivity and organization (Koehnke2008Crystal; Bemben2015The). Mutations in the NLGN2 gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper synaptic function and neural circuitry (Trobiani2020The; Vieira2021The).

## Structure
Neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) is a postsynaptic cell adhesion protein involved in synapse formation and function. The primary structure of NLGN2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the NLGN2 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a characteristic neuroligin fold. The tertiary structure of NLGN2 is described as having an a/b hydrolase fold, with a 13-stranded central curved beta-sheet surrounded by 22 alpha-helices (Zhang2022Expression). 

In its quaternary structure, NLGN2 forms a homodimer, which is a symmetrical elliptical sphere. The interface area between the NLGN2 dimer is approximately 744 Å², consisting of interacting residues that form salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions (Zhang2022Expression). 

NLGN2 contains a cholinesterase-like domain and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. The protein is also known to interact with neurexins and membrane-associated mucin domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (MDGAs), which regulate synapse formation (Zhang2022Expression). Splice variants of NLGN2 may exist, affecting its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
NLGN2 (neuroligin 2) is a postsynaptic adhesion protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of inhibitory synapses in the nervous system. It is primarily localized at inhibitory synapses, where it interacts with presynaptic neurexins to facilitate synaptic connectivity and communication (Chih2005Control; Durieux2016Neuroligin2). NLGN2 is essential for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, which is critical for normal neuronal function (Chih2005Control).

The protein is involved in the regulation of synapse organization and function, particularly at inhibitory synapses, where it enhances inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) (Chubykin2007ActivityDependent; Nguyen2016Distinct). NLGN2's function at these synapses is mediated through both gephyrin-dependent and gephyrin-independent mechanisms, with specific domains in its intracellular region playing key roles in these processes (Nguyen2016Distinct).

NLGN2's activity is crucial for maintaining synaptic plasticity and long-term synaptic maintenance, particularly in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, where it helps regulate the excitation/inhibition balance, a factor implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders (Durieux2016Neuroligin2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NLGN2 gene are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. The R215H missense mutation in NLGN2 is linked to schizophrenia and results in the retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing its proper localization to the cell surface. This leads to a loss-of-function condition, impairing GABAergic synapse formation and contributing to symptoms such as anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial learning and memory in animal models (Trobiani2020The; Chen2017Neuroligin). Other mutations, such as V510M, R621H, and A637T, have been identified in schizophrenic patients, though they do not affect protein levels or localization (Trobiani2020The).

NLGN2 is also implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability, with overlapping copy number variations and microdeletions contributing to these conditions (Vieira2021The). NLGN2 knockout mice exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased pain sensitivity, highlighting its role in anxiety-related neural circuits (Babaev2016Neuroligin; Blundell2009Increased). Alterations in NLGN2 expression or interactions can disrupt inhibitory synaptic transmission, affecting the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling, which is crucial for normal brain function (Ye2016Physical; Trobiani2020The).

## Interactions
Neuroligin 2 (NLGN2) is involved in several key protein interactions that influence synaptic function. NLGN2 forms trans-synaptic interactions with presynaptic neurexins, which are crucial for synapse formation and organization (Koehnke2008Crystal). It also interacts with serotonin transporters (SERT) in the midbrain, forming a complex that is specific to NLGN2 and not observed with other transporters. This interaction is important for maintaining SERT expression and function, as evidenced by reduced SERT levels in NLGN2 null mice (Ye2016Physical).

NLGN2 is associated with gephyrin, an inhibitory scaffolding protein, which it recruits to postsynaptic sites. This interaction is crucial for the anchoring of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors (Bemben2015The). NLGN2 also interacts with collybistin, which binds to gephyrin and facilitates its recruitment to the plasma membrane, promoting inhibitory synapse formation (Bemben2015The).

Additionally, NLGN2 interacts with γ-protocadherins, which can inhibit its synaptogenic function by preventing presynaptic differentiation. This interaction is thought to regulate inhibitory synapse density and is important for normal social behavior (Steffen2021The). These interactions highlight the role of NLGN2 in modulating synaptic connectivity and function.
