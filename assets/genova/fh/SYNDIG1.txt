# SYNDIG1

## Overview
The SYNDIG1 gene encodes the synapse differentiation inducing 1 protein, a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the development and function of excitatory synapses in the nervous system. SynDIG1 is characterized by its involvement in synaptic maturation and its association with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), although it does not function as a typical AMPAR auxiliary subunit (Lovero2013SynDIG1). Instead, SynDIG1 is part of a larger postsynaptic complex that influences synapse formation and strength, crucial for proper neuronal communication and cognitive processes (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). The protein undergoes palmitoylation, a post-translational modification essential for its stability and synaptic localization, which is regulated by neuronal activity (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). Alterations in SYNDIG1 expression have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Qin2020Alltrans; Tian2022Analysis).

## Structure
SynDIG1 is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a second hydrophobic segment that does not span the membrane (Dίaz2021Beyond; Kaur2016ActivityDependent). The primary structure includes a large intracellular N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal region, which is crucial for synapse development (Chenaux2016Loss; Kaur2016ActivityDependent). 

The secondary structure of SynDIG1 involves a three-helical bundle configuration, predicted for the region encompassing residues P178-L258 in mice. This configuration includes the transmembrane helix and two independent helices from the hydrophobic segment (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). 

Palmitoylation is a significant post-translational modification for SynDIG1, occurring at cysteine residues C191 and C192. This modification is essential for the protein's stability, localization, and function, with C192 being the principal site for palmitoylation (Dίaz2021Beyond; Kaur2016ActivityDependent). 

SynDIG1 does not function as a typical AMPAR auxiliary subunit, as it does not alter AMPAR surface expression or biophysical properties, indicating a unique role in synapse maturation (Lovero2013SynDIG1; Dίaz2021Beyond). The protein is part of the SynDIG/PRRT family, which shares a distinctive topology and lipid modification important for their function (Dίaz2021Beyond).

## Function
The SYNDIG1 gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of excitatory synapses in neurons. SynDIG1 is involved in regulating the number and strength of excitatory synapses by associating with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in hippocampal neurons (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). Although SynDIG1 can bind directly to the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2, it does not function as a typical AMPAR auxiliary subunit, as it does not affect AMPAR biophysical properties or surface trafficking (Lovero2013SynDIG1). Instead, SynDIG1 is thought to be part of a larger postsynaptic complex that regulates synapse formation and maturation (Lovero2013SynDIG1).

SynDIG1 is palmitoylated at conserved cysteine residues, a post-translational modification that is crucial for its stability, localization, and function. This palmitoylation is regulated by neuronal activity and affects SynDIG1's dendritic targeting and synaptic localization, thereby influencing synapse strength (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). SynDIG1 is active at synaptic sites, contributing to the structural and functional maturation of synapses, which is essential for proper brain function and cognitive processes (Chenaux2016Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SYNDIG1 gene have been associated with various neurological and psychiatric conditions. In the context of depression, increased expression of SYNDIG1 in the hippocampus has been linked to depression-like behaviors in mice. This suggests that SYNDIG1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, potentially through its involvement in excitatory synapse development and glutamatergic transmission (Qin2020Alltrans). 

In thyroid cancer, SYNDIG1 has been identified as an immune-related prognostic factor. Its expression is negatively regulated by miRNAs such as miR-15a-5p and miR-182-5p, indicating that miRNA-mediated regulation of SYNDIG1 could have implications for cancer prognosis and therapy (Tian2022Analysis).

Additionally, in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), increased levels of SYNDIG1 have been observed in SPG3a-mutated neuromuscular junctions, suggesting a role in the impaired development of excitatory synapses and neuromuscular junctions in this condition (Costamagna2022Autologous). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of SYNDIG1 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in synaptic function and its impact on neurological and psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
SynDIG1, also known as synapse differentiation inducing 1, is involved in synaptic development and function through its interactions with various synaptic proteins. It is known to associate with AMPA receptors (AMPARs), particularly the GluA2 subunit, in heterologous cells, although it does not function as a traditional AMPAR auxiliary subunit by altering receptor gating or pharmacology (Lovero2013SynDIG1). SynDIG1's interaction with AMPARs is mediated by its C-terminal region, and it is suggested to be part of a larger postsynaptic complex rather than a direct binding partner in neurons (Lovero2013SynDIG1; Kaur2016ActivityDependent).

SynDIG1 is also palmitoylated at cysteine residues C191 and C192, a modification crucial for its stability and localization, which is regulated by neuronal activity (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). This palmitoylation may influence SynDIG1's interactions with other synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, a key scaffolding protein at excitatory synapses (Kaur2016ActivityDependent). SynDIG1 may form heterodimers with other members of the SynDIG family, such as SynDIG4, to exert its effects on synapse development and plasticity (Lovero2013SynDIG1).
