# FAM240A

## Overview
FAM240A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 240 member A. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM240A is expressed in several tissues, with notable expression in the brain and kidney, suggesting its potential role in neurological and renal functions. The protein encoded by FAM240A is not currently categorized under a specific protein class such as kinases or receptors, indicating that its functional characterization is still under investigation. Research has highlighted its differential expression in certain pathological conditions, including chronic kidney disease and potential neurological disorders, underscoring the need for further studies to understand its biological significance and clinical implications (Ferreira2022Characterization; Acoba2024Kidney).

## Clinical Significance
FAM240A has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and potential pathogenic variants. In the context of neurological conditions, FAM240A is primarily expressed in the brain, and new pathogenic non-synonymous variants have been identified in this gene. Although specific diseases are not directly linked to these mutations, its expression pattern suggests a possible role in neurological disorders (Ferreira2022Characterization).

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), FAM240A is identified as a pathway-orphan gene with specific enrichment in the kidney cortex and medulla. It is differentially expressed in CKD patients, showing downregulation in both the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium. These expression changes may have implications for CKD pathogenesis, although the clinical significance of FAM240A mutations or alterations in kidney disease is not fully detailed (Acoba2024Kidney).

Overall, while FAM240A is associated with potential roles in neurological and kidney conditions, the precise clinical implications of its mutations or expression changes require further investigation to establish direct links to specific diseases.
