# NOB1

## Overview
NOB1 is a gene that encodes the NIN1 (RPN12) binding protein 1 homolog, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The NOB1 protein is characterized by its endonuclease activity, facilitated by a PIN domain, which is crucial for the cleavage of pre-rRNA during ribosome assembly. This protein also contains a zinc ribbon domain, which may play a role in stabilizing RNA interactions. NOB1 operates within a complex network of protein and RNA interactions, contributing to the final processing steps of 18S rRNA. Its expression levels have been linked to various cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Raoelijaona2018Domain; Liu2015Relationship; Lamanna2009Nob1).

## Structure
The human NOB1 protein is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and contains distinct structural domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of NOB1 includes a PIN domain and a zinc ribbon domain, which are connected by a flexible linker (Raoelijaona2018Domain; Veith2011Structural). The PIN domain is essential for its endonuclease activity and has a prototypical β1-α1-α2-β2-α3-β3-α4-β4-α5-β5 topology, forming a five-stranded β-sheet packed by five α-helices (Raoelijaona2018Domain). This domain is involved in the cleavage of pre-rRNA during ribosome maturation (Raoelijaona2018Domain).

The zinc ribbon domain, although its precise function is not fully understood, may stabilize pre-rRNA contacts (Raoelijaona2018Domain). It is structurally independent but connected to the PIN domain by a linker, allowing flexibility (Veith2011Structural). The zinc ribbon domain can bind RNA helices, suggesting an anchoring role (Veith2011Structural).

The interaction between NOB1 and hPno1, another protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, is mediated by a conserved sequence within the PIN domain, specifically between residues 206 and 220 (Raoelijaona2018Domain). This interaction is crucial for regulating the endonuclease activity of NOB1 (Raoelijaona2018Domain).

## Function
The NOB1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, a key component of the protein synthesis machinery in cells. NOB1 is involved in the final cleavage of 20S pre-rRNA to produce mature 18S rRNA, a process essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes (Thomson2013Eukaryotic; Lamanna2009Nob1). This cleavage occurs at site D of the pre-rRNA and is mediated by the endonuclease activity of the NOB1 protein, which contains a PIN domain responsible for its catalytic function (Veith2011Structural; Lamanna2009Nob1).

NOB1 operates within the nucleolus and cytoplasm, where it is part of a pre-40S ribosomal complex that includes the 20S precursor to 18S rRNA and several ribosome assembly factors (Lamanna2009Nob1). The protein binds specifically to the single-stranded cleavage site D at the 3′-end of 18S rRNA, forming a tetrameric complex that is crucial for its function in rRNA processing (Lamanna2009Nob1). This interaction ensures the correct processing and maturation of ribosomal RNA, which is vital for efficient protein synthesis and overall cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOB1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NOB1 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues. High NOB1 expression is associated with advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and higher histopathological grade, leading to poorer overall survival and progression-free survival in patients (Liu2015Relationship). 

In glioma, NOB1 is overexpressed in high-grade tumors, and its elevated levels are linked to shorter survival times. The gene is targeted by microRNA-326, which acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating NOB1, thereby inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Zhou2013MicroRNA326).

In prostate cancer, NOB1 expression is higher in more aggressive cell lines, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhang2014Knockdown). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, downregulation of NOB1 suppresses cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2011RNAimediated).

## Interactions
NOB1 is a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids during this process. NOB1 is part of a complex network involving the pre-40S component Ltv1, RNA helicase Prp43, and G-patch protein Pfa1, which collectively facilitate the processing of 20S pre-rRNA to 18S rRNA. These interactions are crucial for the D-site cleavage in the cytoplasm, a step catalyzed by NOB1 (Pertschy2009RNA).

NOB1 interacts with ribosomal proteins Rps5 and Rps14, which are essential for its cleavage activity. It also directly interacts with the RNA-binding protein Dim2/Pno1, forming part of a module with Rio2 that is involved in the cytoplasmic maturation of 18S rRNA (Campbell2011ProteinProtein). NOB1 binds specifically to the single-stranded RNA at cleavage site D of the 18S rRNA, with its PIN domain playing a key role in this interaction (Lamanna2009Nob1). These interactions highlight NOB1's central role in ribosome assembly and its complex regulatory network.
