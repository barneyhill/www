# NAA10

## Overview
The NAA10 gene encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 10, NatA catalytic subunit, a critical enzyme involved in the N-terminal acetylation of proteins, a modification that affects protein stability, localization, and function. As a catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex, NAA10 plays a pivotal role in the acetylation of a significant portion of the human proteome, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and development (Lee2018Nαacetyltransferase; Aksnes2019Cotranslational). Beyond its primary function, NAA10 also exhibits lysine acetyltransferase activity, impacting proteins like β-catenin and Hsp70, and participates in genomic imprinting by interacting with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) (Aksnes2019Cotranslational). Mutations in NAA10 are linked to several genetic disorders, including Ogden syndrome and Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Esmailpour2014A; Wu2018NAA10related).

## Structure
The NAA10 gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the NatA complex, responsible for N-terminal acetylation. The primary structure of NAA10 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the acetyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Deng2021Protein). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stable conformation within the complex (Deng2019Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, NAA10 forms a globular shape that allows it to interact effectively with substrates and other proteins. The quaternary structure involves its interaction with the NAA15 subunit, forming a heterodimeric NatA complex. This interaction is characterized by extensive hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, which are essential for substrate-specific recognition and catalysis (Deng2021Protein).

The NAA10 protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions. Splice variants of NAA10 can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles within the cell (Deng2021Protein). The presence of an inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) molecule at the interface between NAA10 and NAA15 is important for the stability and activity of the NatA complex (Deng2021Protein).

## Function
NAA10 encodes the catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex, which is responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of approximately 40% of the human proteome. This modification is crucial for various cellular functions, including protein stability, localization, and degradation (Lee2018Nαacetyltransferase; Aksnes2019Cotranslational). NAA10 is involved in both co-translational and post-translational acetylation processes, affecting nascent peptides and mature proteins (Lee2018Nαacetyltransferase).

In addition to its role in N-terminal acetylation, NAA10 exhibits lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity, acetylating internal lysines on proteins such as β-catenin and Hsp70, which influences their stability and function (Aksnes2019Cotranslational). NAA10 also plays a role in genomic imprinting by interacting with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to maintain DNA methylation patterns, which is important for normal development (Lee2018Nαacetyltransferase; Aksnes2019Cotranslational).

NAA10 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and development (Bader2020Severe). Its activity is regulated by various factors, including oxygen conditions, which affect its interactions and acetylation capabilities (Aksnes2019Cotranslational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAA10 gene are associated with a range of genetic disorders, primarily affecting neurodevelopment and cardiac function. One notable condition linked to NAA10 mutations is Ogden syndrome, characterized by severe developmental delays, craniofacial anomalies, and cardiac defects. This syndrome is caused by the p.Ser37Pro mutation, which significantly impairs the catalytic activity of the NatA complex (Wu2018NAA10related; Casey2015NAA10). Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (LMS) is another disorder associated with NAA10 mutations, specifically the c.471+2T>A splice donor mutation, which disrupts the retinoic acid signaling pathway, leading to eye development issues and growth deficiencies (Esmailpour2014A).

Other NAA10 variants, such as p.(His16Pro) and p.(Ile72Thr), have been linked to intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and cardiac anomalies like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Støve2018A; Bader2020Severe). These mutations often result in impaired acetyltransferase activity, affecting protein stability and function. The clinical presentation of NAA10-related disorders can vary widely, influenced by factors such as X-inactivation patterns in females and the specific nature of the mutation (Bader2020Severe; Lyon2023Expanding). The absence of complete NAA10 knockout cases suggests that the gene is essential for embryonic development (Wu2018NAA10related).

## Interactions
NAA10, the catalytic subunit of the NatA complex, interacts primarily with NAA15 to form the NatA complex, which is responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of a significant portion of the human proteome. This interaction is crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex, as NAA15 modulates NAA10's activity and helps anchor the complex to the ribosome during translation (Liszczak2013Molecular). The interaction between NAA10 and NAA15 involves several hydrophobic interfaces and hydrogen bonds, particularly between specific residues in the NAA10-α1-loop-α2 segment and NAA15-α29 and α30 helices, which are essential for the stability and proper formation of the NatA complex (Liszczak2013Molecular).

NAA10 also interacts with various proteins beyond the NatA complex. It binds to non-methylated DNA motifs and recruits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), influencing genomic imprinting and potentially contributing to cancer development (Aksnes2019Cotranslational). NAA10 interacts with proteins such as β-catenin, HIF-1α, and the androgen receptor (AR), influencing their functions through acetylation. For instance, it acetylates β-catenin, promoting cell proliferation, and acetylates HIF-1α, affecting its degradation (Aksnes2019Cotranslational). These interactions highlight NAA10's diverse roles in cellular processes and its involvement in various pathophysiological conditions.
