# ESR2

## Overview
The ESR2 gene encodes the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), a nuclear receptor protein that plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of estrogen in various tissues. As a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, ERβ functions as a transcription factor, regulating gene expression by binding to estrogen-responsive elements in DNA. This receptor is involved in numerous physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is expressed in several tissues such as the prostate, ovary, colon, and lung (Ascenzi2006Structure–function). ERβ often acts as a modulator of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity, attenuating ERα-mediated transcriptional activation and influencing cellular responses to estrogen (Ascenzi2006Structure–function). The receptor's ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, as well as its interaction with various co-regulatory proteins, underscores its complex role in gene regulation and its potential implications in health and disease (Bondesson2015Estrogen; Ascenzi2006Structure–function).

## Structure
The human ESR2 gene encodes the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), a nuclear receptor protein involved in gene expression regulation. The ERβ protein is composed of 530 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 60 kDa (Yaşar2016Molecular). It is subdivided into six functionally distinct domains: the amino-terminal A/B domain, the central C region (DNA-binding domain), the flexible hinge or D domain, the multifunctional carboxyl-terminal E domain (ligand-binding domain), and the F domain (Yaşar2016Molecular). The ligand-binding domain (E) is a globular region that includes a hormone-binding site, a dimerization interface, and a ligand-dependent co-regulator interaction function (Yaşar2016Molecular).

The secondary structure of ERβ includes a three-layered antiparallel α-helical fold, which is common within the nuclear receptor superfamily (Yaşar2016Molecular). The DNA-binding domain is highly conserved, allowing ERβ to bind to similar chromatin regions as ERα (Bondesson2015Estrogen). ERβ can form homodimers or heterodimers, which is crucial for its function (Bondesson2015Estrogen).

ERβ also has several splice variant isoforms, such as ERβ2, 4, and 5, which lack ligand-binding ability but can alter E2-ER signaling (Yaşar2016Molecular). These variants contribute to the functional diversity of ERβ and its role in normal physiology and disease (Yaşar2016Molecular).

## Function
ESR2, also known as estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in response to estrogen. ERβ is involved in various molecular processes, including the modulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It acts as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of genes by binding to estrogen-responsive elements in DNA (Ascenzi2006Structure–function).

In healthy human cells, ERβ is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the prostate, ovary, colon, and lung. It is particularly abundant in the granulosa cells of the ovary and the basal cells of the prostate (Leav2001Comparative; Ascenzi2006Structure–function). ERβ functions as a dominant regulator of estrogen signaling, often attenuating the activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and reducing ERα-mediated transcriptional activation, which includes cell proliferation (Ascenzi2006Structure–function).

ERβ is also involved in the formation of heterodimers with ERα, which can regulate gene expression differently than homodimers, potentially affecting cell growth and differentiation (Ascenzi2006Structure–function). The receptor's activity is modulated by its interaction with various co-regulatory proteins, which influence its transcriptional activity and role in cellular processes (Ascenzi2006Structure–function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ESR2 gene, which encodes the estrogen receptor beta, have been implicated in several diseases. In endometriosis, ESR2 expression is significantly higher in endometriotic tissues compared to normal endometrium, contributing to estrogen-induced inflammatory processes and resistance to progesterone, which are characteristic of the condition (Smolarz2020The). Polymorphisms in ESR2 have been associated with susceptibility to Graves' disease, with an increased frequency of the A allele observed among patients (Kisiel2007Polymorphism).

In medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a specific germline mutation, ESR2 c.948delT, results in the loss of ERβ expression, leading to unrestrained ERα-driven cell proliferation and increased RET expression, contributing to tumorigenesis (Smith2016Germline). This mutation is linked to familial MTC and C-cell hyperplasia (Smith2016Germline).

ESR2 polymorphisms have also been associated with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). The AluI polymorphism in ESR2 is more prevalent in CAD patients and is linked to increased body mass index, elevated triglycerides, and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, making it an independent risk factor for the disease (Mansur2005Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ESR2 in various conditions, emphasizing its role in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), encoded by the ESR2 gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in breast cancer cell regulation. ERβ interacts with a wide array of proteins, including transcriptional coregulators such as NCOA3, PELP1, TRIM24, and MED1, which are part of the Mediator Complex, indicating its role as a transcriptional regulator (Nassa2010A). It also associates with proteins involved in transcription regulation, mRNA splicing, and actin filament-based processes, such as SIN3A and BCLAF1, which are known to mediate gene repression and apoptosis, respectively (Nassa2010A).

ERβ forms complexes with Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), influencing gene transcription, RNA splicing, and post-transcriptional regulation. This interaction is RNA-mediated, as shown by the reduction in association following RNase treatment (Tarallo2017The). ERβ and AGO2 co-occupy numerous chromatin sites, suggesting a collaborative role in gene regulation (Tarallo2017The). ERβ also interacts with proteins such as CNOT1, MTA2, ADAR, COPA, and NOP56, which are involved in various cellular processes, including miRNA-mediated gene silencing and RNA editing (Tarallo2017The). These interactions highlight ERβ's potential oncosuppressive role in breast cancer by modulating transcriptional and post-transcriptional events.
