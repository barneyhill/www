# ARL3

## Overview
ARL3 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 3, a small GTP-binding protein involved in critical cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking and ciliogenesis. The ARL3 protein is categorized as a small GTPase, which is a class of proteins known for their role in signal transduction and regulation of various cellular functions. Structurally, ARL3 exhibits a typical G protein fold, which facilitates its function in membrane localization and interaction with other proteins. The protein plays a pivotal role in the transport and release of lipidated proteins to the ciliary membrane, acting as a cargo displacement factor. This function is essential for maintaining the structure and function of cilia, particularly in photoreceptors where efficient protein trafficking is necessary for phototransduction (Ismail2012Structural; Gotthardt2015A). Mutations in the ARL3 gene have been linked to several ciliopathies and retinal dystrophies, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Alkanderi2018ARL3; Fu2021Autosomal).

## Structure
ARL3 is a small GTP-binding protein that plays a crucial role in intracellular trafficking and ciliogenesis. Structurally, ARL3 exhibits a typical G protein fold, which is a common feature among small GTPases. This fold is characterized by a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, forming a compact three-dimensional structure (Ismail2012Structural). The protein's N-terminal region includes an amphipathic helix, which is involved in membrane localization, particularly in the GTP-bound conformation (Ismail2012Structural). This helix acts as a pocket opener, facilitating the release of myristoylated cargo from UNC119a (Ismail2012Structural).

ARL3 undergoes a conformational change upon GTP binding, which involves a two-residue register shift in β-strands. This shift displaces the amphipathic helix from a hydrophobic pocket, aiding in membrane binding (Ismail2012Structural). The interaction with UNC119a involves residues from switch I, II, and the interswitch region, with ARL3 showing a more extended interaction interface compared to similar proteins (Ismail2012Structural).

ARL3 is not predicted to be myristoylated, but it may undergo other post-translational modifications that assist in its function and localization (Ismail2012Structural). The protein's ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as UNC119a, suggests a potential quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ARL3 gene encodes a small GTP-binding protein that plays a crucial role in ciliary function and intracellular trafficking in healthy human cells. ARL3 is involved in the transport and release of lipidated proteins to the ciliary membrane, acting as a cargo displacement factor. It interacts with carrier proteins such as PDE6D and UNC119A/B to facilitate the release of lipidated cargoes, which is essential for the proper functioning of cilia (Fu2021Autosomal; Gotthardt2015A).

ARL3 cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. In its active form, it binds to effectors, inducing conformational changes that release the cargo proteins. This process is critical for maintaining the structure and function of cilia, particularly in photoreceptors where efficient protein trafficking is necessary for phototransduction (Ismail2012Structural; HankeGogokhia2016Arflike).

The protein is enriched in the primary cilium and is essential for the release of ciliary cargo such as INPP5E, NPHP3, and GNAT-1. ARL3's activity is regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Arl13B and the GTPase-activating protein RP2, which are crucial for its spatial activation within the cilia (Schwarz2017Arl3; Gotthardt2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL3 gene are associated with several retinal dystrophies and ciliopathies. In particular, compound heterozygous variants in ARL3 have been linked to autosomal recessive rod-cone dystrophy (RCD), a condition characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina (Fu2021Autosomal). A novel heterozygous variant in ARL3 has also been identified in a family with autosomal dominant retinal degeneration, highlighting its role in retinal ciliopathy (Ratnapriya2021A). These mutations can destabilize the ARL3 protein, impairing its interaction with other proteins such as RP2, which is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor function (Fu2021Autosomal).

ARL3 mutations are also implicated in Joubert syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by brain malformations and multisystem ciliopathy symptoms. Missense mutations affecting the Arg149 residue disrupt ARL3's interaction with ARL13B, leading to mislocalization of ciliary proteins and contributing to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Alkanderi2018ARL3).

In glioma, ARL3 expression levels serve as a prognostic biomarker. High ARL3 expression is associated with better responses to treatment and improved prognosis, while low expression correlates with poor outcomes (Wang2019ARL3). This suggests that ARL3 expression levels can influence tumor microenvironment dynamics and patient survival (Wang2019ARL3).

## Interactions
ARL3 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking and ciliary processes. ARL3 interacts with the delta subunit of rod-specific cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE δ) in a GTP-specific manner. This interaction stabilizes the GTP-bound form of ARL3, suggesting that PDE δ acts as an effector protein for ARL3, enhancing its affinity for GTP by decreasing the nucleotide dissociation rate (Linari1999The).

ARL3 also interacts with ARL13B, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL3, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This interaction is crucial for the activation of ARL3 within cilia, where ARL13B is localized (Gotthardt2015A). Additionally, ARL3 interacts with UNC119, a protein that stabilizes the GTP binding of ARL3, aiding in the release of lipidated cargo from carrier proteins (Ismail2012Structural; Zhang2016GTPbinding).

ARL3's interaction with PDE6d and UNC119 is essential for the release of lipidated proteins, such as prenylated and myristoylated cargo, from these carriers, facilitating their transport to the cilium (Fansa2016Sorting; Gotthardt2015A). These interactions highlight ARL3's role in ciliary function and protein trafficking.
