# TBC1D19

## Overview
TBC1D19 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 19, which is part of the TBC domain family known for its role in regulating Rab GTPases, a group of proteins involved in intracellular trafficking and signaling (Fukuda2011TBC; GabernetCastello2013Evolution). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell polarity and apoptosis, particularly in the context of cancer, such as melanoma (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). TBC1D19 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in melanoma, with its expression levels correlating with disease progression and metastasis (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Georgescu2022Apprising). Additionally, alterations in TBC1D19 have been noted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, although the clinical implications remain to be fully explored (Messina2014Genetic). The protein's interactions and regulatory mechanisms suggest a broader role in cellular signaling and structural organization, warranting further investigation into its functions and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
TBC1D19 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker in melanoma, with its expression levels being notably upregulated in melanoma tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with worse prognosis and increased metastasis in melanoma patients, suggesting that alterations in TBC1D19 expression may play a critical role in melanoma progression (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16; Georgescu2022Apprising). The study by Tang et al. developed a risk score formula incorporating TBC1D19 expression, which correlates with poorer outcomes in melanoma, highlighting its potential clinical significance in this context (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), TBC1D19 is mentioned in the context of copy number alterations, specifically a loss at the 4p15.2-p14 cytoband, affecting a small percentage of patients. However, the study does not elaborate on the direct clinical implications of this alteration (Messina2014Genetic).

While TBC1D19 is implicated in these conditions, the specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in TBC1D19 or its interactions are not extensively detailed in the available literature. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in other diseases or conditions.

## Interactions
TBC1D19 is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as a potential interactor with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) through a yeast two-hybrid screen, suggesting a role in modulating PP1-related pathways (Fardilha2011Identification). Although specific interactions with Rab GTPases are not detailed, TBC1D19 is part of the TBC domain family, which is known for regulating Rab proteins, indicating possible interactions with these GTPases (Fukuda2011TBC; GabernetCastello2013Evolution).

In the context of melanoma, TBC1D19 is associated with cell polarity and its expression levels are linked to the disruption of odontoblast polarity and apoptosis, implying interactions with proteins involved in these processes (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). The study also suggests that TBC1D19 might be regulated by various RABs, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Tang2020Tre2Bub2Cdc16). These interactions highlight the potential role of TBC1D19 in cellular signaling and structural organization, particularly in cancer-related pathways.
