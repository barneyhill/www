# STARD3NL

## Overview
STARD3NL is a gene located on chromosome 7p14-p13 that encodes the STARD3 N-terminal like protein, a membrane protein involved in lipid transport and cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The protein is characterized by the presence of a MENTAL domain, which includes four transmembrane helices and is responsible for its localization to the limiting membranes of late endosomes. Unlike its homolog STARD3, STARD3NL lacks a START domain, yet it still plays a crucial role in the formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes. These MCSs facilitate inter-organelle metabolite exchange, particularly in cholesterol transport, through interactions with ER-anchored VAP proteins. The protein's ability to bind cholesterol and create cholesterol-rich microdomains within the membrane underscores its importance in maintaining cellular lipid balance (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Wilhelm2016Touché!).

## Structure
STARD3NL is a membrane protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 7p14-p13. It features a membrane-anchored domain known as the MENTAL domain, which includes four transmembrane helices. This domain is responsible for targeting the protein to the limiting membranes of late endosomes (LEs) and is involved in cholesterol binding, creating cholesterol-rich microdomains within the membrane (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Wilhelm2016Touché!).

The MENTAL domain of STARD3NL contains FFAT-like motifs, which are crucial for its interaction with ER-anchored VAP (VAMP-associated protein) proteins. This interaction facilitates the formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and endosomes, playing a significant role in organelle tethering and potentially in cholesterol transport (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Wilhelm2016Touché!).

Unlike its homolog STARD3, STARD3NL does not possess a START domain, which is typically involved in lipid binding and exchange. Despite this, STARD3NL can still facilitate the formation of LE-ER MCSs, indicating that the START domain is not necessary for this function (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL). The protein's structure and function are primarily defined by its MENTAL domain and its interactions with VAP proteins.

## Function
STARD3NL is involved in the formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes (LEs). It functions as a lipid transfer protein (LTP) anchored on the limiting membrane of late endosomes, facilitating inter-organelle metabolite exchange, particularly in cholesterol transport. STARD3NL interacts with ER-anchored VAP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-associated proteins, VAP-A and VAP-B, to promote ER-endosome contact formation. This interaction is mediated through a FFAT-like motif in the MENTAL domain of STARD3NL, which is crucial for tethering the ER to endosomes (Wilhelm2016Touché!).

The MENTAL domain of STARD3NL binds cholesterol, creating cholesterol-rich microdomains within the membrane, which are important for maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The START domain of STARD3NL, a lipid-binding and exchange module, suggests its role in cholesterol transport between organelle membranes. Overexpression of STARD3NL results in larger and less mobile endosomes, indicating that the MENTAL domain influences endosome morphology and dynamics by modifying lipid membrane composition (Wilhelm2016Touché!).

## Interactions
STARD3NL interacts with VAP-A and VAP-B proteins through a conserved FFAT-like motif located in the MENTAL domain. This interaction is crucial for the formation of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the late endosomes (LE) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The FFAT motif in STARD3NL facilitates the recruitment of VAP proteins to these sites, which is essential for the tethering of the ER to endosomes (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL; Wilhelm2016Touché!). 

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that VAP-A and VAP-B can bind to STARD3NL in a FFAT-motif dependent manner. Mutant forms of VAP proteins that cannot recognize FFAT motifs do not interact with STARD3NL, underscoring the importance of this motif for their interaction (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL). 

The interaction between STARD3NL and VAP proteins is not only structural but also functional, as it affects endosomal dynamics by altering endosome morphology and dynamics. Overexpression of STARD3NL leads to larger and less mobile endosomes, likely due to the extensive ER-endosome contacts formed through these interactions (Wilhelm2016Touché!). These interactions are distinct from other known molecular bridges, such as ORP1L-VAP, indicating a unique role for STARD3NL in cellular processes (Alpy2013STARD3STARD3NL).
