# ARHGAP39

## Overview
ARHGAP39 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 39, also known as Porf-2 or Vilse. This protein is a member of the RhoGAP family, characterized by its ability to regulate Rho GTPases, which are pivotal in controlling various cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cell migration, and neural development. The ARHGAP39 protein contains several structural domains, including WW domains, a MyTH4 domain, and a RhoGAP domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular dynamics (Nowak2018Porf2; Ji2024Structure). Functionally, ARHGAP39 is involved in modulating the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42, influencing processes like axon guidance and dendritic spine formation, which are critical for neurodevelopment and cognitive functions (Howell2021Mechanistic; Nowak2018Porf2). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cognitive impairments and cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Nowak2018Porf2).

## Structure
The ARHGAP39 protein, also known as Porf-2 or Vilse, is a multidomain protein with several structural features. It contains two tandem WW domains in the N-terminal region, a MyTH4 domain, and a RhoGAP domain near the C-terminal tail (Nowak2018Porf2; Ji2024Structure). The WW domains, spanning amino acids 25-97, are involved in protein-protein interactions and are characterized by hydrophobic amino acids with cyclic side chains (Nowak2018Porf2; Ji2024Structure). The MyTH4 domain, located between amino acids 715-867, is associated with microfilaments and microtubules and is involved in microtubule binding (Nowak2018Porf2; Ji2024Structure). The RhoGAP domain, approximately 140 amino acids long, facilitates interactions with GTPases and is common in the RhoGAP family (Nowak2018Porf2).

The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as serine 169 and phospho-serine 589, which regulate its activity and subcellular localization (Nowak2018Porf2). ARHGAP39 can give rise to multiple RNA transcripts due to alternative splicing, resulting in different protein isoforms (Nowak2018Porf2).

## Function
ARHGAP39, also known as Porf-2 or Vilse, is a Rho GTPase activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes through its interaction with Rho GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42. These interactions are essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization, impacting cell migration, axon guidance, and dendritic spine formation (Howell2021Mechanistic; Nowak2018Porf2). ARHGAP39 is involved in the transition from lamellipodia to filopodia formation by inactivating Rac and promoting Cdc42-induced filopodia formation, which is critical for cell protrusion dynamics and migration (Howell2021Mechanistic).

In neural stem cells, ARHGAP39 influences cell cycle progression and apoptosis, impacting neurodevelopment and cognitive functions such as learning and memory (Nowak2018Porf2). It is also involved in maintaining dendritic spine morphology, which is vital for synaptic signaling and plasticity (Nowak2018Porf2). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interactions with other proteins like the WAVE complex and Myo10, further influencing cellular dynamics (Howell2021Mechanistic). ARHGAP39's role in these processes underscores its importance in both cellular architecture and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ARHGAP39 gene, also known as Porf-2 or Vilse, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of neurodevelopment, ARHGAP39 is crucial for dendritic spine formation and synaptic signaling in the hippocampus, which are essential for learning and memory. Dysregulation of ARHGAP39 can lead to cognitive impairments and has been associated with X-linked cognitive impairment and late-onset Parkinson's disease. Knockout models in mice demonstrate deficits in learning and memory, abnormal hippocampal signaling, and altered dendritic spine morphology (Nowak2018Porf2).

In oncology, variations in ARHGAP39, including mutations or changes in expression levels, have been linked to several types of cancer, such as tumors of the central nervous system, skin, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. A specific variant has been associated with prostate tumors and sarcomas in a family lineage. The gene's interactions with p53 and BAX suggest that decreased expression of ARHGAP39 could lead to increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Nowak2018Porf2).

Additionally, ARHGAP39 has been implicated in mastitis susceptibility in cows, indicating its broader role in cellular differentiation and developmental processes (Wang2015Genomewide).

## Interactions
ARHGAP39, also known as Vilse, is a Rho GTPase activating protein that interacts with several proteins to regulate cellular processes. It binds to the WAVE complex at the plasma membrane, a crucial interaction for its function in modulating Rac activity. This binding is facilitated by the WW domains of ARHGAP39, which interact with polyproline regions of WAVE, and is essential for ARHGAP39's localization and activity at the cell membrane (Howell2021Mechanistic). 

ARHGAP39 also interacts with mDia2, specifically binding to its proline-rich FH1 region, which is important for its localization at the filopodia tip. This interaction is necessary for the regulation of Cdc42 activity within filopodia, influencing filopodia dynamics (Howell2021Mechanistic). 

The protein is transported to filopodia tips by Myo10, where it binds to mDia2 and inactivates Cdc42, leading to filopodia retraction (Howell2021Mechanistic). ARHGAP39's interaction with Myo10 requires phosphorylation at tyrosine 785, which is crucial for its localization within filopodia (Howell2021Mechanistic). 

In endothelial cells, ARHGAP39 is sequestered by Robo1 and Robo4, leading to increased Cdc42 activity, which facilitates actin nucleation and cell migration (Nowak2018Porf2).
