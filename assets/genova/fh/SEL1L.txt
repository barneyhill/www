# SEL1L

## Overview
The SEL1L gene encodes the SEL1L adaptor subunit of the SYVN1 ubiquitin ligase, a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting misfolded or unassembled proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Biunno2006SEL1L; Cattaneo2008SEL1L). The SEL1L protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature and the presence of Sel1-Like Repeats (SLR motifs), which facilitate its interactions with other ER-resident proteins and its role in the ERAD complex (Jeong2016Crystal). SEL1L is also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and plays a role in regulating signaling pathways such as TGF-β, which are critical for cellular differentiation and stress responses (Shrestha2020Sel1LHrd1). Mutations in the SEL1L gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and immune deficiencies, underscoring its importance in cellular function and organismal health (Weis2024Biallelic; Wang2024Hypomorphic).

## Structure
The SEL1L protein from Mus musculus consists of 790 amino acids and shares 17% sequence identity with its yeast homolog, Hrd3p. It features a fibronectin type II domain at the N-terminus, 11 Sel1-Like Repeats (SLR motifs), and a transmembrane domain at the C-terminus (Jeong2016Crystal). The SLR motifs are located in the ER lumen and are divided into three regions: SLR-N (motifs 1-4), SLR-M (motifs 5-9), and SLR-C (motifs 10-11) (Jeong2016Crystal). The central domain of SEL1L, comprising SLR motifs 5 to 9, forms a homodimer with two-fold symmetry, primarily due to the domain-swapped structure of SLR motif 9, which provides an extensive dimeric interface (Jeong2016Crystal). The dimerization is facilitated by interactions involving helix 9A and 9B, with specific residues such as Leu 521 playing a critical role (Jeong2016Crystal). The SLR-C domain interacts directly with the N-terminus luminal loops of HRD1, another key component of the ERAD pathway (Jeong2016Crystal). The SEL1L protein can form self-oligomers in vivo, mediated by the SEL1L cent domain, which is crucial for its structural organization and function in the ERAD pathway (Jeong2016Crystal).

## Function
The SEL1L gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in human cells. SEL1L functions as an adaptor subunit of the SYVN1 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the recognition and ubiquitination of misfolded or unassembled proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), marking them for proteasomal degradation (Biunno2006SEL1L; Cattaneo2008SEL1L). This process is crucial for the degradation of misfolded luminal proteins, ensuring that only properly folded proteins are transported to their final destinations, thus preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful protein aggregates (Ninagawa2011SEL1L).

SEL1L is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER, and its expression is upregulated in response to ER stress (Cattaneo2008SEL1L). It is also implicated in the regulation of TGF-β signaling, particularly in maintaining β cell identity, by targeting TGF-β receptor 1 for degradation, thereby suppressing signaling pathways that could lead to cell dedifferentiation (Shrestha2020Sel1LHrd1). SEL1L's activity is primarily localized in the ER and nuclear envelope, where it interacts with other proteins like HRD1 to facilitate its functions (Cattaneo2008SEL1L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SEL1L gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and immune deficiencies. Hypomorphic variants of SEL1L, such as p.Gly585Asp, p.Met528Arg, and p.Cys141Tyr, have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and ataxia (UmphredWilson2024Hypomorphic; Wang2024Hypomorphic). The p.Cys141Tyr variant, in particular, is associated with severe clinical manifestations, including agammaglobulinemia and premature death, due to its impact on the SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD complex, leading to impaired protein degradation and increased ER stress (Weis2024Biallelic).

In canine models, the SEL1L p.Ser658Pro mutation is linked to progressive early-onset cerebellar ataxia, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining neuronal function and ER homeostasis (Lin2023SEL1LHRD1; Kyöstilä2012A). This mutation affects the interaction between SEL1L and HRD1, crucial for forming a functional ERAD complex, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and subsequent cellular stress (Lin2024SEL1LHRD1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SEL1L mutations in neurodevelopmental and immune-related disorders.

## Interactions
SEL1L is a key component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, interacting with various proteins to facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins. It forms a complex with HRD1, a ubiquitin E3-ligase, which is essential for the stability and function of the HRD1 ERAD complex. This interaction is mediated by an aromatic-aromatic interaction between SEL1L-F668 and HRD1-Y30, and is crucial for recruiting other components such as the E2 enzyme UBE2J1 and DERLIN proteins to HRD1 (Lin2024SEL1LHRD1).

SEL1L also interacts with OS-9 and XTP3-B, ER-resident proteins involved in the recognition and processing of misfolded proteins. These interactions are mediated by SEL1L's lumenal domain and are crucial for the degradation of certain ERAD substrates, such as the null Hong Kong variant of α1-antitrypsin (NHK) (Christianson2008OS9). SEL1L's interaction with OS-9 is enhanced following SEL1L knockdown, suggesting a complex network of interactions within the ERAD pathway (Christianson2008OS9).

Additionally, SEL1L interacts with other proteins involved in protein folding, such as PDI, BiP, and calnexin, and has been shown to form self-oligomers through its cent domain, which is important for its function in the ERAD pathway (Jeong2016Crystal; Mueller2008SEL1L).
