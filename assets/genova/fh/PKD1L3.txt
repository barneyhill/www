# PKD1L3

## Overview
The PKD1L3 gene encodes the protein polycystin 1 like 3, which is a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This protein is primarily involved in sensory perception, particularly in the detection of sour taste. PKD1L3 forms a heteromeric complex with PKD2L1, functioning as a TRP-like ion channel that is crucial for the unique 'off-response' to acidic stimuli in taste receptor cells. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including 11 transmembrane domains and a large extracellular domain, which facilitate its role in ion channel activity and protein interactions. The PKD1L3/PKD2L1 complex is predominantly expressed in the circumvallate and foliate papillae of the tongue, where it plays a significant role in taste perception by responding to changes in pH and calcium levels (LopezJimenez2006Two; Su2021Structural; Ishimaru2010Interaction).

## Structure
The PKD1L3 protein is a member of the TRP ion channel family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of 11 transmembrane domains, with the amino-terminal domain (NTD) formed by TM1-TM5 and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) formed by TM6-TM11, also known as the TRP-like domain (Su2021Structural; LopezJimenez2006Two). The protein features a large extracellular N-terminus that includes a C-type lectin binding domain and a G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), suggesting potential interactions with other proteins or carbohydrates (Ishimaru2010Interaction; Chen2011Molecular). 

The PKD1L3 protein also contains a polycystin-1, lipoxygenase, alphatoxin/lipoxygenase homology 2 (PLAT/LH2) domain in its first intracellular loop, which is involved in mediating interactions with other membrane proteins (Chen2011Molecular). The protein's structure includes a strong ion channel pore region between transmembrane domains 10 and 11, crucial for its function as an ion channel (LopezJimenez2006Two). 

PKD1L3 forms a heteromeric complex with PKD2L1, adopting a 1:3 stoichiometric assembly, which is essential for its function in taste receptor cells (Su2021Structural). The interaction between PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 through their transmembrane domains is critical for the localization of PKD2L1 to taste pores (Ishimaru2010Interaction).

## Function
The PKD1L3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) family, specifically forming a heteromeric complex with PKD2L1. This complex functions as a transient receptor potential (TRP)-like channel, which is involved in sensory modalities, particularly in taste perception. PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 are co-expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells (TRCs) distinct from those involved in detecting sweet, bitter, and umami flavors, and are primarily located in the circumvallate and foliate papillae of the tongue (LopezJimenez2006Two; Ishimaru2010Interaction).

The PKD1L3/PKD2L1 complex is crucial for sour taste detection, responding to acidic stimuli with a unique 'off-response,' where the channel opens only after the removal of the acid stimulus. This response is essential for the gustatory nerve's reaction to sour stimuli (Ishimaru2010Interaction). The interaction between PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 through their transmembrane domains is necessary for the proper localization and function of these proteins at the cell surface, which is critical for their role in taste perception (Ishimaru2010Interaction).

Structurally, the PKD1L3 protein includes a large extracellular domain with 11 transmembrane domains and an ion channel pore region, suggesting its role in ion channel activity and protein interactions (LopezJimenez2006Two). The PKD1L3/PKD2L1 complex is also involved in calcium and pH sensing, with specific structural elements contributing to its function (Su2021Structural).

## Interactions
PKD1L3 interacts with PKD2L1 to form a heteromeric channel complex that functions as a sour taste receptor in mammals. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of the channel at the cell surface of taste cells, particularly in the circumvallate and foliate papillae. The transmembrane domains of both PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 are essential for their interaction, which facilitates the trafficking of the complex to the cell surface. Without this interaction, neither protein is efficiently trafficked when expressed alone (Ishimaru2010Interaction).

The PKD1L3-PKD2L1 complex exhibits a unique "off-response" property, where the channel is activated by the removal of an acid stimulus rather than its presence. This property is thought to contribute to the sensation of sour taste (Inada2008Off‐response). The structural integrity of PKD1L3, particularly its extracellular N-terminal region, is important for its interaction with PKD2L1 and the subsequent channel activity (Inada2008Off‐response).

PKD1L3 also interacts with TRPP3, forming a receptor-ion channel complex involved in sour taste perception. GPS cleavage in PKD1L3 is necessary for its proper trafficking and function when associated with TRPP3 (Kashyap2019A).
