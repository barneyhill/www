# ZFP14

## Overview
ZFP14, also known as ZNF531, is a gene that encodes a KRAB zinc finger protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of p53 protein stability. The ZFP14 protein is characterized by its modular structure, comprising an N-terminal KRAB domain and 13 C2H2-type zinc fingers, which facilitate its interaction with specific DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This protein plays a crucial role in the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it modulates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the p53 protein, a key tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. ZFP14 is also implicated in embryonic stem cell differentiation and has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Morello2017Copy; Mohibi2022ZFP14).

## Structure
ZFP14, also known as ZNF531, is a KRAB zinc finger protein characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal KRAB domain, a linker region, and 13 C2H2-type zinc fingers located at the C-terminus (Mohibi2022ZFP14). The zinc fingers are crucial for recognizing specific DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, facilitated by variable amino acids at positions -1, +2, +3, and +6 of each zinc finger domain (Mohibi2022ZFP14). These zinc fingers are essential for the protein's interaction with the MDM2-p53 complex, as they mediate the binding rather than the KRAB domain, which is typical for other KRAB-zinc finger proteins (Mohibi2022ZFP14).

ZFP14 is involved in the regulation of p53 protein stability by promoting its ubiquitination, leading to enhanced degradation. This function is part of its role within the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Mohibi2022ZFP14). The zinc fingers allow ZFP14 to bind to MDM2 independently of p53, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Mohibi2022ZFP14). The molecular structure of ZFP14 is identical in both human and mouse, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation (Mohibi2022ZFP14).

## Function
ZFP14 is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in regulating the stability of the p53 protein, a crucial tumor suppressor involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, ZFP14 is a direct target of p53 and is induced in a p53-dependent manner upon DNA damage. This induction suggests a feedback loop where ZFP14 modulates p53 protein stability, which is essential for maintaining cellular functions and responses to DNA damage (Mohibi2022ZFP14).

ZFP14 functions as part of the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it influences p53 protein stability by modulating its ubiquitination. This interaction promotes p53 degradation, thereby regulating its levels within the cell. The zinc finger domains of ZFP14 are crucial for its association with the MDM2-p53 complex, enhancing the complex's integrity and influencing protein interactions beyond p53 regulation (Mohibi2022ZFP14).

In the context of embryonic stem cell differentiation, ZFP14, along with other Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), positively regulates target genes by binding to non-transposable element regions. This activity suggests a role for ZFP14 in specific biological states, such as during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into endoderm and mesoderm (Shen2020Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZFP14 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Specifically, the deletion of an intron in the ZFP14 gene was identified in two ALS patients, suggesting a potential link between these genetic alterations and the disease. ZFP14 proteins are involved in critical cellular processes such as RNA packaging, transcriptional activation, regulation of apoptosis, and protein folding, all of which are relevant to ALS pathology (Morello2017Copy).

In the context of vitamin D signaling, ZFP14 is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in wild-type cells, indicating its involvement in osteoblast mTOR signaling. However, its expression remains unaffected by the overexpression of vitamin D response element binding proteins (VDRE-BP), suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms that could have clinical implications, although specific diseases related to these interactions are not detailed (Lisse2010Gene).

Overall, while the precise clinical significance of ZFP14 mutations and expression alterations requires further investigation, current evidence suggests a role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential involvement in vitamin D-related pathways.

## Interactions
ZFP14, also known as ZNF531, is a zinc finger protein that interacts with several key proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer biology. It is part of the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it modulates the stability of the p53 protein. ZFP14 interacts with the MDM2/p53 complex, promoting the polyubiquitination and degradation of p53, which is crucial for regulating p53 protein levels in cells (Mohibi2022ZFP14). This interaction forms a feedback loop where p53 can induce ZFP14 expression under stress conditions, and ZFP14, in turn, regulates p53 stability (Mohibi2022ZFP14).

ZFP14 contains an N-terminal KRAB domain and 13 C2H2-type zinc fingers, which facilitate its binding to specific DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. It has been shown to bind to p53 response elements (p53-REs) in the promoters of the ZFP14 and p21 genes, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Mohibi2022ZFP14). ZFP14 can also bind directly to MDM2 independently of p53, suggesting a unique mechanism of interaction that does not rely solely on its KRAB domain (Mohibi2022ZFP14).
