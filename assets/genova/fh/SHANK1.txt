# SHANK1

## Overview
SHANK1 is a gene that encodes the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 1 protein, a crucial scaffolding protein predominantly located in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses in the brain. This protein is integral to synaptic organization and function, facilitating the assembly of receptors and other scaffolding proteins within dendritic spines. The SHANK1 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, a PDZ domain, a proline-rich region, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which enable its interactions with various synaptic proteins (Wan2021Association; Kursula2019Shanks). These interactions are essential for maintaining synaptic structure and cognitive functions, and disruptions in SHANK1 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities (Paprocka2021Case; May2021Truncating).

## Structure
The SHANK1 protein is a multidomain scaffold protein located at the postsynaptic density (PSD) of glutamatergic synapses. It is composed of several conserved domains, including an ankyrin repeat domain (ANK), an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, a PDZ (postsynaptic density 95/discs large/zona occludens-1 homology) domain, a proline-rich region, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain (Wan2021Association; Kursula2019Shanks). The ankyrin repeats are located at the N terminus, while the SAM domain is at the C terminus (Wan2021Association).

The SH3 domain, although lacking the typical proline-rich peptide binding site, interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the Ca V 1.3 channel through electrostatic interactions (Kursula2019Shanks). The PDZ domain binds class I ligands with high affinity and can dimerize, potentially affecting the oligomeric state of Shank proteins (Kursula2019Shanks). The SAM domain, although it does not bind zinc in SHANK1, can form homo-oligomeric structures (Kursula2019Shanks).

SHANK1 has 23 exons and two alternative promoters, leading to the formation of two distinct transcript isoforms: Shank1A, which includes all five domains, and Shank1B, which contains the PDZ, PRO, and SAM domains (Wan2021Association). Alternative splicing can generate different transcripts, such as Shank1B, Shank1C, and Shank1D, each lacking specific domains (Wan2021Association).

## Function
SHANK1 is a scaffolding protein primarily active in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses in the brain. It plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and function by interacting with various membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, facilitating the assembly of receptors and scaffolding proteins in dendritic spines (May2021Truncating). SHANK1 contains several domains, including ankyrin repeats, SH3, PDZ, a proline-rich region, and a SAM domain, which are essential for its protein-protein interactions (May2021Truncating).

In healthy human cells, SHANK1 is involved in maintaining synaptic structure and cognitive functions. It is co-expressed with hippocampal dendritic markers and is critical for the development and maintenance of PSDs and synapses, contributing to learning-induced dendritic spine plasticity (May2021Truncating). Proper regulation of SHANK1 is essential for synaptic maturation and function, as demonstrated by studies showing that Shank1 knockout mice exhibit smaller spine size and reduced PSD thickness compared to wild-type mice (May2021Truncating).

SHANK1's interactions with other synaptic molecules, such as Homer, are crucial for synaptic function and spine maturation. Disruptions in these interactions can impair synaptic localization and signaling, which are key mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disorders (May2021Truncating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHANK1 gene have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. Truncating variants in SHANK1 have been linked to cognitive delays, speech and language delays, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and ADHD. These variants can disrupt protein-protein interactions crucial for synaptic function, leading to impaired synaptic localization and signaling (May2021Truncating).

A specific de novo mosaic variant, p.(Gly126Arg), has been identified in a patient with moderate intellectual disability, autism, and Lennox-Gastaut type epilepsy. This variant disrupts a conserved region of the SHANK1 protein, affecting its structural stability and interactions, which may contribute to the patient's neurological symptoms. The patient's epilepsy responded well to cannabidiol treatment, highlighting a potential therapeutic approach (Paprocka2021Case).

SHANK1 mutations have also been implicated in ASD, with some studies reporting inherited deletions and de novo mutations in affected individuals. However, the clinical relevance of SHANK1 mutations in ASD remains uncertain due to their rarity (Wan2021Association).

## Interactions
SHANK1 is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. It interacts with various proteins, contributing to synaptic organization and signaling. The SHANK1 protein contains several domains, including ankyrin repeats, SH3, PDZ, a proline-rich region, and a SAM domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins (May2021Truncating).

The PDZ domain of SHANK1 interacts with proteins containing C-terminal and internal PDZ binding motifs (PDZbms). These interactions occur with low micromolar affinities and include proteins such as TBC1D10C, SLC30A10, ANKS1B, ELFN1, ARAP3, NRG1, and ATG13, although DEPTOR shows low affinity (Ali2021Integrated). The binding affinities for C-terminal PDZbms are generally higher than for internal PDZbms (Ali2021Integrated).

SHANK1 also interacts with Homer1, a scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density. Truncating variants in SHANK1 result in a loss of binding with Homer1, which is crucial for synaptic localization and function (May2021Truncating). These interactions are important for synaptic plasticity and are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (May2021Truncating).

The remodeling of the Homer-SHANK1 interactome is influenced by synaptic activity, with interactions such as Shank1_SAPAP and Shank1_PSD95 being modulated by activity changes (Heavner2021Remodeling).
