# PPP1R12C

## Overview
The PPP1R12C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12C, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex. This protein is categorized as a regulatory subunit and plays a significant role in modulating the activity of myosin phosphatase, which is essential for the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and actin cytoskeleton organization. As a member of the Myosin Phosphatase Targeting Protein (MYPT) family, PPP1R12C contains structural motifs such as ankyrin repeats and the RVXF motif, which facilitate its interaction with the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) and other proteins (Casamayor2020Controlling; Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and exists in multiple isoforms, potentially influencing its functional properties and involvement in various cellular processes, including muscle relaxation, cell shape modulation, and movement (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). Alterations in PPP1R12C expression have been linked to pathological conditions such as atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance (Perike2023Myosin).

## Structure
The PPP1R12C protein, also known as MBS85, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and actin cytoskeleton organization. The protein contains specific structural motifs that facilitate its function. These include ankyrin repeats, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, and the RVXF motif, a common docking site for PP1c-binding proteins (Casamayor2020Controlling; Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). 

The PPP1R12C protein is part of the Myosin Phosphatase Targeting Protein (MYPT) family, which includes other members like PPP1R12A and PPP1R12B. These proteins share structural motifs necessary for targeting PP1C to specific substrates or localizations (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which can inhibit its function, as seen in other MYPT family members (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R12C is expressed ubiquitously and has multiple isoforms, which may result from alternative splicing, potentially altering its functional properties (Ceulemans2002Regulator‐driven). The protein's role in cellular processes is further modulated by its interaction with other proteins and its involvement in pathways such as the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular DNA damage response (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Function
PPP1R12C encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a significant role in modulating myosin phosphatase activity. This protein is involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction by influencing the phosphorylation state of myosin light chains, which is crucial for muscle relaxation and contraction dynamics (Casamayor2020Controlling; Lartey2016Altered). 

PPP1R12C is part of the myosin phosphatase targeting protein (MYPT) family and shares structural motifs with other family members, such as the RVXF motif, which are essential for targeting PP1C to specific substrates or cellular locations (Casamayor2020Controlling). In the context of smooth muscle, PPP1R12C is involved in the transition of uterine smooth muscle from a quiescent to a contractile state, which is vital for processes like labor (Lartey2016Altered).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm and influences various cellular processes, including cell shape and movement, by modulating the phosphorylation of myosin light chains (Casamayor2020Controlling). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining proper muscle function and cellular motility, impacting overall organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP1R12C gene have been implicated in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia. Increased expression of PPP1R12C in AF patients is associated with a two-fold increase in protein expression and a significant reduction in myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a) phosphorylation, leading to atrial hypocontractility. This condition contributes to atrial cardiomyopathy, which serves as a substrate for AF and increases the risk of stroke (Perike2023Myosin). 

In experimental mouse models, overexpression of PPP1R12C has been linked to increased susceptibility to AF, atrial myopathy, and pacing-induced AF, suggesting a direct role in atrial dysfunction (Perike2023Myosin). The gene's overexpression affects myofilament dynamics, contributing to atrial remodeling and contractile dysfunction, rather than altering calcium handling (Perike2023Myosin). 

The RhoA signaling pathway is implicated in modifying PPP1R12C activity, with the T560-PPP1R12C phosphorylation site identified as a potential target for drug intervention. Inhibition of this site enhances PPP1R12C activity, further contributing to MLC2a dephosphorylation and atrial hypocontractility (Perike2023Myosin).

## Interactions
PPP1R12C, also known as MYPT3, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the PP1 catalytic domain (PP1c), acting as a scaffold to facilitate the dephosphorylation of myosin light chain 2a (MLC2a), which is significant in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF) (Perike2023Myosin). This interaction is enhanced in AF patients, suggesting a role in atrial hypocontractility (Perike2023Myosin).

PPP1R12C is also involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements by regulating myosin and actin dynamics. It is overexpressed in atrial tissues of AF patients, indicating its involvement in atrial remodeling (Perike2023Myosin). The protein's activity can be modulated by the RhoA signaling pathway, with the T560-PPP1R12C phosphorylation site being a key regulatory point. Inhibition of this site increases PPP1R12C's binding to PP1c and MLC2a, leading to further MLC2a dephosphorylation (Perike2023Myosin).

Additionally, PPP1R12C interacts with other proteins such as Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), playing roles in cellular processes like ribosomal RNA processing and apoptosis inhibition (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).
