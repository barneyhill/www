# BTN3A3

## Overview
BTN3A3 is a gene that encodes the protein butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A3, which is part of the butyrophilin family known for its role in immune regulation. The protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, including an N-terminal IgV-like domain and a membrane-proximal IgC-like domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region. BTN3A3 is involved in the modulation of immune responses, particularly through its interaction with Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells. Although BTN3A3 does not bind phosphoantigens due to a unique amino acid substitution, it supports the function of BTN3A1, another member of the BTN3A subfamily, by forming heteromeric complexes that enhance T cell activation. The protein's interactions and structural features, such as its ability to form stable homodimers, contribute to its role in immune regulation and potential impact on viral infections and cancer progression (Karunakaran2023A; Vantourout2018Heteromeric; Blazquez2018New).

## Structure
BTN3A3 is a member of the butyrophilin family, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The protein structure includes an N-terminal IgV-like (V) domain and a membrane-proximal IgC-like (C) domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region containing a juxtamembrane (JM) region and a B30.2 domain (Karunakaran2023A). BTN3A3 has a unique H381R substitution in the B30.2 domain, which prevents phosphoantigen (PAg) binding, distinguishing it from other BTN3A family members (Karunakaran2023A).

The protein forms homo- or heteromers, which are crucial for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. BTN3A3's JM region plays a significant role in promoting the close association of B30.2 domains within BTN3A complexes, enhancing plasma membrane expression and stimulatory capacity (Karunakaran2023A). Structural modeling suggests that BTN3A3 forms more stable homodimers compared to BTN3A1 due to favorable salt-bridge interactions (Karunakaran2023A).

BTN3A3 is part of a gene family that emerged with placental mammals and has undergone diversification through gene duplication events during primate evolution (Karunakaran2023A; Pinto2023BTN3A3). The protein's evolutionary history is marked by complex duplication events, contributing to its functional diversity (Pinto2023BTN3A3).

## Function
BTN3A3, a member of the butyrophilin family, plays a role in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, a subset of γδ T cells. BTN3A3 is part of the BTN3A subfamily, which includes BTN3A1 and BTN3A2, and is involved in the recognition of phosphoantigens (pAgs) by these T cells. While BTN3A1 is essential for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, BTN3A3 can support BTN3A1's function, although it does not bind pAgs due to a single amino acid change in its B30.2 domain (Blazquez2018New).

BTN3A3 is primarily active at the cell membrane and can form heteromeric complexes with BTN3A1, enhancing its stability and localization, which are crucial for T cell activation (Vantourout2018Heteromeric). Although BTN3A3 is not required for full phosphoantigen-dependent T cell activation, it can compensate for the absence of BTN3A2, indicating a supportive role in the immune response (Vantourout2018Heteromeric). BTN3A3's involvement in immune regulation suggests it may influence inflammation and infection outcomes, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Blazquez2018New).

## Clinical Significance
BTN3A3, a member of the butyrophilin family, plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in the context of tumor immunity. Alterations in BTN3A3 expression have been observed in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, breast, colon, ovarian, gastric cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Blazquez2018New). In these tumors, BTN3A3 is implicated in immune escape mechanisms and tumor cell proliferation, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Blazquez2018New).

BTN3A3, along with other BTN3A isoforms, is involved in the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which are crucial for anti-tumor immune responses. Although BTN3A1 is essential for this activation, BTN3A3 contributes to the process by helping BTN3A1 localize to the cell membrane, indicating its supportive role in immune cell activation (Blazquez2018New). The expression of BTN3A3 in tumors may be part of a complex regulatory mechanism that involves combinations of BTN3A isoforms, potentially affecting the immune system's ability to target cancer cells (Blazquez2018New).

Despite its significant role in immune modulation, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in BTN3A3 have not been explicitly documented in the provided context. However, its expression and interaction with other BTN3A isoforms suggest its clinical relevance in cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
BTN3A3, a member of the butyrophilin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in immune regulation and viral restriction. In the context of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, BTN3A3 interacts with components of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, affecting viral genome replication. This interaction is particularly evident in hBEC3-KT cells, where BTN3A3 co-immunoprecipitates with RNP components from both avian and mammalian IAV strains, leading to reduced viral protein synthesis (Pinto2023BTN3A3).

BTN3A3 also forms homodimers through intermolecular coiled-coil interactions, stabilized by specific residues such as E283 and T284, which form hydrogen bonds. These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity of BTN3A3 complexes (Karunakaran2023A). BTN3A3 participates in the formation of heteromeric complexes with BTN3A1 and BTN3A2, which are essential for phosphoantigen sensing and T cell activation. The juxtamembrane region of BTN3A3 enhances the expression and stimulatory capacity of BTN3A proteins at the plasma membrane, facilitating optimal T cell activation (Karunakaran2023A).

In the context of phosphoantigen sensing, BTN3A3, along with BTN3A1 and BTN3A2, contributes to the formation of complexes that are crucial for the activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells (Karunakaran2023A). These interactions highlight BTN3A3's role in modulating immune responses and its potential impact on viral infections and immune cell activation.
