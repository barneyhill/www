# HTR1E

## Overview
The HTR1E gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1E, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices. This receptor is primarily involved in the modulation of neurotransmitter serotonin signaling, playing a crucial role in various physiological processes, including neuroprotection and cell survival. The 5-HTR1E receptor is predominantly expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions associated with cognitive functions such as the frontal cortex and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in memory and learning (Sharma2023The). It functions by inhibiting adenyl cyclase, thereby reducing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, and can also activate other signaling pathways like RAS-RAP, SRC, and ERK, which are important for cell proliferation and survival (Sharma2023The). The receptor's interactions, particularly with neurotrophic factor α-1/carboxypeptidase E (NFα-1/CPE), highlight its role in neuroprotection against oxidative and neurotoxic stress (Sharma2021Novel). Additionally, alterations in HTR1E expression have been linked to various diseases, including ovarian cancer and brain tumors, where it may act as a tumor suppressor or influence tumor progression (Qin2021SerotoninHTR1E; Belotti2022Prognostic).

## Structure
The HTR1E gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1E, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane helices, a common feature of this receptor family (Sharma2023The). The receptor is composed of 365 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa (Sharma2023The). The primary structure includes potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are typical post-translational modifications for GPCRs, enhancing protein stability and function (Sun2021Molecular). 

The secondary structure of the 5-HTR1E receptor is defined by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which span the cell membrane and are crucial for its function as a GPCR (Sharma2023The). These helices form a pocket that serves as the orthosteric binding site for ligands, a feature that is conserved among serotonin receptors (Klein2011Toward).

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices in the membrane, allowing interaction with G proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity (Sharma2023The). The receptor does not exhibit polymorphisms among humans, indicating a conserved structure across the population (Sharma2023The). There is no information available on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of the 5-HTR1E receptor.

## Function
The HTR1E gene encodes the 5-HTR1E serotonin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in several molecular processes in healthy human cells. This receptor primarily functions by inhibiting adenyl cyclase, leading to a reduction in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which is a key signaling mechanism in cells (Sharma2023The). Beyond the classical cAMP pathway, 5-HTR1E can activate other signaling pathways, such as RAS-RAP, SRC, and ERK, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival (Sharma2023The).

In neuronal cells, 5-HTR1E interacts with neurotrophic factor α-1/carboxypeptidase E (NFα-1/CPE), recruiting β-arrestin1 and activating the ERK-BCL2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuroprotection and cell survival (Sharma2023The; Sharma2021Novel). This interaction promotes neuronal survival against oxidative and neurotoxic stress, suggesting a significant role in neuroprotection (Sharma2021Novel). The receptor is predominantly expressed in the human brain, particularly in regions such as the frontal cortex and hippocampus, indicating its potential involvement in memory and learning processes (Sharma2023The). Despite these findings, the exact physiological functions of 5-HTR1E in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Sharma2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR1E gene, encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1E, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In ovarian cancer (OC), HTR1E is identified as a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly decreased in peritoneal disseminated OC cells, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. The silencing of HTR1E promotes cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of SRC-mediated signaling pathways, suggesting its role in counteracting stress-induced OC progression (Qin2021SerotoninHTR1E).

In brain tumors, such as low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), HTR1E expression is under-expressed. It is associated with favorable prognostics in LGG but unfavorable in GBM, indicating a role in tumor progression and its potential protective role in lower-grade gliomas (Belotti2022Prognostic).

HTR1E also interacts with neurotrophic factor-α1/carboxypeptidase E (NF-α1/CPE) in neurons, promoting survival against oxidative stress. This interaction is crucial for neuroprotection, and its downregulation can lead to cognitive dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases (Sharma2021Novel).

## Interactions
The human gene HTR1E encodes the 5-HTR1E serotonin receptor, which participates in several significant protein interactions. One notable interaction is with the neurotrophic factor α-1/carboxypeptidase E (NF-α1/CPE). This interaction occurs extracellularly and is mediated by stable salt bridges between NF-α1/CPE and the extracellular loops of 5-HTR1E. This binding recruits β-arrestin1, activating the ERK-BCL2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuroprotection and cell survival (Sharma2023The; Sharma2021Novel). 

The interaction between NF-α1/CPE and 5-HTR1E has been shown to protect neurons against oxidative and neurotoxic stress. This protection is achieved through the activation of the β-arrestin/ERK signaling pathway, which enhances cell survival by increasing CREB phosphorylation and regulating pro-survival proteins (Sharma2021Novel). 

In addition to its neuroprotective role, the 5-HTR1E receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAP, SRC, and ERK pathways. In SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells, knockdown of 5-HTR1E increases SRC phosphorylation and activates ERK, influencing cell proliferation and colony formation (Sharma2023The).
