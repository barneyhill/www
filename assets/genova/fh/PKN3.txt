# PKN3

## Overview
PKN3, or protein kinase N3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AGC kinase family. The protein product, protein kinase N3, is characterized by its catalytic domain, which is homologous to protein kinase C, and is involved in ATP binding and substrate recognition. It also contains antiparallel coiled-coil (ACC) domains and a C2-like domain, which may play roles in lipid binding and activation. PKN3 is primarily involved in cellular processes such as maintaining cell morphology, motility, and the integrity of cell-cell junctions, particularly in endothelial cells. It acts as a downstream effector of phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling, influencing actin organization and adherens junction integrity. PKN3's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, and it is implicated in oncogenic processes, with alterations in its expression linked to cancer progression and metastasis (Leenders2004PKN3; Möpert2012Depletion; Mukai2016PKN3).

## Structure
PKN3 (protein kinase N3) is a serine/threonine kinase with a structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein features a catalytic domain homologous to protein kinase C, which is typical of the AGC kinase family, and is involved in ATP binding and substrate recognition (Leenders2004PKN3; Mukai2016PKN3). PKN3 also contains antiparallel coiled-coil (ACC) domains and a C2-like domain, which may be involved in lipid binding and activation, similar to the PKC family kinases (Falk2014Enzyme; Mukai2016PKN3).

The primary amino acid sequence of PKN3 is approximately 70% conserved with PKN1, with notable differences in the N-terminal region (Falk2014Enzyme). The N-terminal domain is crucial for its full enzymatic activity, suggesting a regulatory role (Leenders2004PKN3). PKN3's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly at the T-loop site, which is necessary for its activation (Leenders2004PKN3). Phosphorylation at the turn-motif T860 is also critical for its activity and stability, influencing its nuclear localization (UnsalKacmaz2011The).

PKN3 is less responsive to lipid activators like arachidonic acid compared to other PKN isoforms, indicating unique regulatory mechanisms (Mukai2016PKN3). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications play significant roles in its function in oncogenic processes.

## Function
PKN3 (protein kinase N3) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in endothelial cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cell morphology, motility, and the integrity of cell-cell junctions. PKN3 is part of the AGC kinase family and acts as a downstream effector of phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling, which is essential for proper actin organization and adherens junction integrity (Möpert2012Depletion).

In healthy human endothelial cells, PKN3 is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for cell migration and adhesion. It facilitates the formation of stress fibers and the organization of adherens junctions, maintaining cell shape and intercellular connections (Möpert2012Depletion). PKN3 also affects the glycosylation of cell-surface proteins, such as ICAM-1 and integrins, which are important for angiogenesis and cell migration (Mukai2016PKN3).

PKN3's activity is linked to the Rho/Rock pathway, influencing actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion distribution. Its depletion leads to impaired actin dynamics, resulting in abnormal cell morphology and adhesion (Möpert2012Depletion). PKN3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in processes like endothelial cell activation and response to inflammatory stimuli (Möpert2012Depletion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PKN3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer progression. PKN3 is notably upregulated in various cancer cell lines, suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis. It plays a critical role in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis, with its expression alterations potentially impacting these processes (Mukai2016PKN3). In prostate cancer, PKN3 is involved in cell proliferation and metastasis through the PI3K-Pkn3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of PKN3 in prostate cancer cells reduces metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Uehara2019Regulation). 

The use of Atu027, a liposomal siRNA formulation targeting PKN3, has shown promise in reducing tumor size and metastasis in preclinical models. Atu027 impairs endothelial cell migration and lymphatic vessel growth, which are crucial for cancer progression, without affecting cell proliferation (Aleku2008Atu027). PKN3's role in endothelial cell activation and inflammation further underscores its significance in pathological conditions. Its depletion affects actin reorganization and reduces ICAM-1 expression, impacting leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration, which are vital during inflammatory responses (Möpert2012Depletion).

## Interactions
Protein kinase N3 (PKN3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. PKN3 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and adherens junctions in endothelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining cell morphology and motility. Knockdown of PKN3 disrupts these interactions, leading to altered cell morphology and impaired cell-cell junction integrity (Möpert2012Depletion).

PKN3 also phosphorylates ARHGAP18, a RhoGAP protein, enhancing its GAP domain activity and contributing to the negative regulation of active RhoA. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal part of ARHGAP18, suggesting a feedback mechanism in Rho signaling (Dibus2020A).

In osteoclasts, PKN3 interacts with c-Src and Pyk2 in a Ror2 signaling-dependent manner, enhancing c-Src's kinase activity, which is essential for actin ring formation and bone resorption. This interaction highlights PKN3's role in osteoclastic activity and bone metabolism (Uehara2019Regulation).

PKN3 is also involved in tumor metastasis, interacting with cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and integrins. These interactions are crucial for tumor cell adhesion and invasion, with PKN3 knockdown affecting the glycosylation and function of these molecules (Mukai2016PKN3).
