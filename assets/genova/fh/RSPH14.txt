# RSPH14

## Overview
RSPH14 (radial spoke head 14 homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia, which are essential for cellular motility and signaling. The protein encoded by RSPH14 is a component of the radial spoke complex, a critical element in the axoneme of cilia and flagella, contributing to their stability and motility. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the radial spoke complex, playing a significant role in processes such as respiratory function and reproductive health. RSPH14 is regulated by RFX transcription factors, which are key in the transcriptional regulation of cilia-related genes, indicating its importance in cilia assembly and function (Lindskog2024A; Lemeille2020Interplay). Despite its recognized role in cilia, the specific functions of RSPH14 in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its complete biological significance.

## Structure


## Function
RSPH14 (radial spoke head 14 homolog) is involved in the structure and function of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play crucial roles in cell movement and signaling. The protein encoded by RSPH14 is a component of the radial spoke complex, essential for the proper motility of cilia and flagella, impacting processes such as respiratory function and reproductive health. RSPH14 is active in the axoneme, the core of cilia and flagella, contributing to their stability and function (Lindskog2024A; Lemeille2020Interplay).

In mouse ependymal cells, RSPH14 is regulated by RFX transcription factors, which are crucial for the transcriptional regulation of cilia-related genes. These factors bind to promoters of genes involved in ciliogenesis, including RSPH14, suggesting its significant role in cilia assembly and function (Lemeille2020Interplay). In the human fallopian tube, RSPH14 is detected within the cilia structure of epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in cilium motility, biogenesis, and maintenance (Lindskog2024A). Despite its recognized role in cilia, the specific function of RSPH14 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
RSPH14 is involved in the structural integrity and function of radial spoke complexes in cilia. It is part of the stalk and base regions of the RS1 and RS2 complexes in mammalian cilia, as identified through structural modeling studies using cryo-ET and cryo-EM techniques (Meng2023Highresolution; Meng2024Multiscale). Although specific interactions of RSPH14 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its presence in these complexes suggests a role in maintaining the structural framework necessary for ciliary function (Meng2023Highresolution).

RSPH14 is also mentioned in the context of its spatial expression and localization within ciliated cells of the human fallopian tube, indicating its involvement in motile cilium function (Lindskog2024A). The protein's role in ciliary structure is further supported by its decreased abundance following the depletion of Rsph9, a gene critical for radial spoke assembly, which suggests that RSPH14 is part of a network of proteins essential for the stability of these complexes (Zhu2018Rsph9). These findings highlight the importance of RSPH14 in the assembly and function of ciliary structures, although specific protein-protein interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
