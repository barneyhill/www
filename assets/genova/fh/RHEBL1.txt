# RHEBL1

## Overview
RHEBL1 is a gene that encodes the RHEB like 1 protein, which is a small GTPase involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular growth, proliferation, and survival by modulating mTORC1 activity. RHEB like 1 is categorized as a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, which are known for their involvement in various signal transduction pathways. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several pathological conditions, including various forms of cancer and pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Rahman2024Unraveling; Masetti2013DHHRHEBL1fusion).

## Clinical Significance
The RHEBL1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in the mTOR signaling pathway. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the DHH-RHEBL1 fusion transcript is a novel recurrent feature, particularly in CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive cases. This fusion leads to the overexpression of RHEBL1, which is associated with a distinct gene expression signature and a worse overall survival rate compared to patients with only the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion. The overexpression of RHEBL1 may contribute to leukemogenesis, although further investigation is needed to fully understand its role (Masetti2013DHHRHEBL1fusion).

RHEBL1 is also involved in cancer pathogenesis. It is frequently overexpressed in various human carcinomas, including liver, lung, and bladder malignancies, and is associated with poor prognoses. Its overexpression is linked to the activation of the mTORC1 pathway, promoting tumor growth and proliferation. RHEBL1 mutations, such as Q64L, enhance mTORC1 signaling, contributing to cancer development. These mutations have been identified in human cancer genome databases, with specific mutations like Y35N found in endometrial and renal clear cell cancers (Rahman2024Unraveling).
