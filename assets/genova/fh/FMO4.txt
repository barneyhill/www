# FMO4

## Overview
FMO4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 4, a member of the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidative metabolism of a variety of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, playing a significant role in detoxification processes within the liver. FMO4 is characterized by a unique C-terminal extension, which includes membrane-spanning domains and conserved motifs, distinguishing it from other FMOs and suggesting a specialized functional role (Hirani2016C.; Phillips2016Drug). The enzyme requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), NADPH, and molecular oxygen for its catalytic activity, and it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes (Phillips2016Drug). Despite its low expression levels in human tissues, FMO4 is implicated in modulating mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activities, indicating its potential involvement in central carbon metabolism and cellular stress resistance (Huang2021FlavinContaining).

## Structure
The human FMO4 protein is characterized by a C-terminal extension that distinguishes it from other flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs). This extension is approximately 23 to 26 amino acids longer than those in other FMOs and includes membrane-spanning domains and conserved motifs, suggesting a functional role that may have evolved from an ancestral gene (Hirani2016C.; Phillips2016Drug). The C-terminal extension is proposed to have arisen from a mutational event in an ancestral gene, indicating a common evolutionary origin with C. elegans FMO-4 (Hirani2016C.).

The primary structure of FMO4 includes a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain, which is typical of the FMO family, facilitating the enzyme's role in oxidative metabolism (Phillips2016Drug). The secondary structure likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, common in FMOs, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding necessary for its enzymatic activity, but detailed three-dimensional conformation is not described. There is no information on quaternary structure or post-translational modifications specific to FMO4 in the provided context. The expression of full-length FMO4 has been problematic, and its substrate range remains largely unexplored due to low expression levels (Phillips2016Drug).

## Function
FMO4, or flavin-containing monooxygenase 4, is an enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of various compounds, including drugs and endogenous substances. In healthy human cells, FMO4 is primarily active in the liver, where it contributes to detoxification processes by oxygenating nucleophilic heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulfur in substrates (Phillips2016Drug). This activity is crucial for the metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics and other compounds, producing polar, excretable products without generating reactive, toxic intermediates (Phillips2016Drug).

FMO4 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), NADPH, and molecular oxygen for its catalytic function (Phillips2016Drug). The enzyme's unique mechanism allows it to activate oxygen without a bound substrate, differentiating it from cytochrome P450 enzymes (Phillips2016Drug). Although FMO4 is expressed at low levels in human tissues, its role in modulating mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic activities has been noted, suggesting its involvement in central carbon metabolism and stress resistance (Huang2021FlavinContaining). These functions highlight FMO4's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance.
