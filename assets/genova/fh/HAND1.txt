# HAND1

## Overview
HAND1, or heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 1, is a gene that encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor crucial for cardiac development. The HAND1 protein plays a significant role in regulating the balance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, particularly during the formation of the heart's left ventricle and outflow tract (Risebro2006Hand1). It functions by forming homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as E12 and E47, which modulate its DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity (Hill2004Differential; KNÖFLER2002Human). HAND1's activity is further regulated by interactions with non-bHLH proteins, such as the LIM domain protein FHL2, which can selectively repress its transcriptional activation (Hill2004Differential). Mutations in the HAND1 gene are linked to various congenital heart defects, highlighting its critical role in heart development and function (ReamonBuettner2009A).

## Structure
HAND1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in cardiac development. The primary structure of HAND1 includes a sequence of 215 amino acids, with specific regions such as the N-terminal, bHLH domain, and C-terminal playing distinct roles in its function (ReamonBuettner2009A). The bHLH domain is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing HAND1 to form homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins like E12 and E47 (Hill2004Differential; KNÖFLER2002Human).

The secondary structure of HAND1 involves the formation of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of bHLH proteins, although specific details are not extensively covered in the context. Tertiary structure interactions include the binding with LIM domain protein FHL2, which modulates HAND1's transcriptional activity by affecting its dimerization state (Hill2004Differential).

HAND1's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form dimers, which is essential for its function as a transcription factor. The dimerization is influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can alter HAND1's activity and stability (Hill2004Differential). Specific mutations in the bHLH domain can impact HAND1's function, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity (ReamonBuettner2009A).

## Function
HAND1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a critical role in heart development by regulating the balance between cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. It is expressed in specific regions of the developing heart, such as the outer curvature of the presumptive left ventricle and the developing outflow tract (OFT) (Risebro2006Hand1). HAND1 influences the expression of cyclin D2 and its associated kinase, Cdk4, which are essential for cell-cycle entry and continued cell proliferation. Overexpression of HAND1 in embryonic cardiomyocytes leads to increased proliferation and reduced differentiation, particularly in the OFT, resulting in an expansion of the proliferative pool of undifferentiated cardiomyocyte precursors (Risebro2006Hand1).

HAND1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, such as E-factors, which affects its DNA binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The choice between forming homodimers or heterodimers is influenced by the phosphorylation status of HAND1 (Hill2004Differential). HAND1's activity is modulated by interactions with non-bHLH proteins, such as the LIM domain protein FHL2, which can repress HAND1/E12 heterodimer-induced transcription (Hill2004Differential). This complex regulation allows HAND1 to finely tune the balance between proliferation and differentiation, ensuring proper heart development (Risebro2006Hand1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAND1 gene are associated with a variety of congenital heart defects (CHDs). These include septation defects such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), which have been linked to specific mutations like p.L138P, p.E116V, and p.E119G found in malformed heart tissues (ReamonBuettner2009A). The p.A126fs frameshift mutation is prevalent in hypoplastic ventricles and, when combined with p.L138P, is associated with a shorter lifespan in patients (ReamonBuettner2009A). The p.K102E mutation impairs HAND1's transactivation activities and is linked to septal defects and hypoplastic left ventricle in a homozygous state (ReamonBuettner2009A).

HAND1 mutations also contribute to conditions like double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and ventricular septal defect (VSD). A specific loss-of-function mutation, p.K132X, results in a truncated HAND1 protein and is associated with DORV and VSD (Li2017HAND1). Another mutation, p.R118C, has been linked to tetralogy of Fallot, a type of CHD, and results in impaired transcriptional activation of the ANF promoter (Wang2016HAND1).

HAND1 loss-of-function mutations can lead to survivable congenital cardiac defects and adult heart failure, with conditions such as right bundle branch block and altered ventricular conduction (Firulli2019HAND1). These mutations disrupt normal cardiac development and function, contributing to a range of heart malformations and diseases.

## Interactions
HAND1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, engages in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. HAND1 forms heterodimers with class A bHLH proteins such as E12 and E47, significantly enhancing transcriptional activity in certain cellular contexts, such as in JEG-3 cells, where it increases the activity of a luciferase reporter containing Th1 D-box elements (KNÖFLER2002Humana). HAND1 also interacts with FHL2, a LIM domain-containing protein, which modulates its transcriptional activity. FHL2 specifically represses the transcriptional activation induced by HAND1-E12 heterodimers but does not affect HAND1 homodimer activity, indicating a selective regulatory mechanism (Hill2004Differential).

HAND1 can also form homodimers, although these interactions are generally less favored compared to heterodimerization with E factors like E47 (Scott2000The). In the context of cardiac development, HAND1's interaction with FHL2 is significant, as it occurs in the nucleus and influences transcriptional activities, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and FRET analysis (Hill2004Differential). These interactions highlight HAND1's role in modulating transcription through competitive binding and dimerization with other bHLH proteins.
