# ATE1

## Overview
The ATE1 gene encodes the enzyme arginyltransferase 1, a critical component of the post-translational modification process known as arginylation. This enzyme belongs to the class of transferases and is characterized by its GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) fold, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with tRNA. Arginyltransferase 1 plays a pivotal role in the Arg N-degron pathway, where it facilitates the addition of arginine to protein substrates, thereby influencing their stability, degradation, and function. This modification is crucial for various biological processes, including cellular homeostasis, cardiovascular development, and stress response. The enzyme's activity is regulated by factors such as acetylation and stress-induced activation, and it exists in multiple isoforms with distinct subcellular localizations, contributing to its diverse cellular functions (Van2020ATE1Mediated; Galiano2016Post‐translational; Van2022The).

## Structure
The ATE1 protein, encoded by the human ATE1 gene, is an enzyme involved in post-translational arginylation. Its structure includes a conserved GNAT (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and tRNA binding (Abeywansha2023The; Van2022The). The GNAT domain interacts with the negatively charged nucleic acids of tRNA, facilitating the transfer of arginine to protein substrates (Abeywansha2023The).

ATE1 also contains an atypical zinc-finger domain, which is essential for maintaining the protein's stability. The presence of zinc ions stabilizes the protein structure, preventing conformational changes that could affect its function (Abeywansha2023The). This zinc-finger domain plays a critical role in tRNA binding, particularly interacting with the acceptor arm of tRNA Arg (Abeywansha2023The).

The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a bilobed architecture, with a V-shaped cleft that accommodates the tRNA fragment (Van2022The). The quaternary structure of ATE1 has not been detailed in the available context, and there is no mention of splice variant isoforms or specific post-translational modifications beyond its enzymatic activity.

## Function
The ATE1 gene encodes the enzyme arginyltransferase 1, which is crucial for the post-translational modification process known as arginylation. This process involves the addition of arginine to proteins, influencing their stability, degradation, and function. ATE1 is a key component of the Arg N-degron pathway, where it targets proteins for degradation by converting secondary destabilizing residues into primary destabilizing residues recognized by N-recognins, facilitating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Van2020ATE1Mediated).

In healthy human cells, ATE1-mediated arginylation plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in various biological processes, including cardiovascular development, chromosomal segregation, and stress response (Van2020ATE1Mediated). Arginylation by ATE1 can also enhance protein stability and function, as seen in the arginylation of β-amyloid, which prevents its aggregation, and β-actin, which is crucial for actin filament formation and cell morphology (Van2020ATE1Mediated).

ATE1 is active in multiple cellular locations, with its activity regulated by factors such as acetylation and stress-induced activation. The enzyme exists in several isoforms with distinct subcellular localizations, contributing to substrate specificity and diverse cellular functions (Galiano2016Post‐translational).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ATE1 gene, which encodes the enzyme arginyltransferase 1, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, ATE1 is often downregulated, correlating with increased tumorigenic potential and metastasis. This downregulation is observed in various cancers, including prostate, colorectal, and kidney cancers, and is associated with poor patient survival and aggressive cancer phenotypes (Birnbaum2018Reduced; Rai2015Arginyltransferase). ATE1's role in cancer is thought to involve its regulation of proteins critical for cell motility, adhesion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Rai2015Arginyltransferase).

In cardiovascular development, ATE1 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality in mice due to defects in heart development and angiogenesis, highlighting its essential role in these processes (Wiley2020Posttranslational; Kwon2002An). ATE1 is also implicated in mitochondrial function, where its absence affects mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, leading to metabolic imbalances and conditions like cardiomyopathy (Jiang2020Regulation).

In neurodegenerative diseases, reduced ATE1 levels are linked to conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, potentially through its regulation of RGS proteins (Fina2021Arginyltransferase). These findings suggest that ATE1 plays a significant role in various pathological conditions through its impact on protein arginylation and cellular processes.

## Interactions
ATE1 (arginyltransferase 1) is known for its interactions with tRNA and substrate peptides, forming a complex that influences its oligomeric state. ATE1 interacts extensively with tRNA, particularly through the αC helix, which contacts the acceptor arm of tRNA, stabilizing a loop in ATE1 and facilitating substrate accommodation (Lan2024Oligomerization). This interaction is crucial for ATE1's function, as mutations in the αC helix reduce tRNA binding affinity (Lan2024Oligomerization).

ATE1 also forms a symmetric homodimer in its apo state, which is essential for its stability and function. The dimeric interface involves several interacting residues, and mutations at this interface can disrupt dimer formation, affecting protein stability and substrate interaction (Lan2024Oligomerization). The dimerization partially occludes the substrate peptide binding site, potentially inhibiting ATE1 activity (Lan2024Oligomerization).

In addition to its interactions with tRNA and substrate peptides, ATE1 is involved in the Arg N-degron pathway, forming complexes with other enzymes such as NTAN1, NTAQ1, and UBR1/UBR2. These interactions are part of a superchanneling concept, where substrates are efficiently processed by the pathway (Van2020ATE1Mediated).
