# HOXD3

## Overview
HOXD3 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D3 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox family, which is characterized by its role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. The HOXD3 gene is part of the HOX gene cluster, which is crucial for proper embryonic development and cellular differentiation. The homeobox D3 protein is primarily involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions, particularly in promoting angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. This protein exerts its effects by binding to specific DNA sequences in the nucleus, thereby modulating the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Wang2018HOXD3; Steens2022HOX). Dysregulation of HOXD3 expression has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and kidney diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kron2010DNA; DiPoï2007Distinct).

## Function
HOXD3 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). It is rapidly expressed when endothelial cell differentiation is initiated, facilitating the transition from a resting to an angiogenic state, which is essential for promoting angiogenesis (Steens2022HOX). This gene is part of a broader network of HOX genes that contribute to endothelial cell functions and the maintenance of the adult vasculature (Steens2022HOX).

In healthy human cells, HOXD3 is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell gene expression associated with angiogenesis, a process critical for wound healing and the formation of new blood vessels (Svingen2003Altered). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to modulate the expression of target genes, impacting cellular processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation (Wang2018HOXD3).

HOXD3's role in angiogenesis is further supported by its involvement in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), a key player in angiogenesis, by binding to its promoter region (Wang2018HOXD3). This highlights its importance in maintaining proper vascular function and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HOXD3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, increased DNA methylation of the HOXD3 gene is associated with higher Gleason scores and more advanced cancer stages, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Kron2010DNA). This methylation leads to gene silencing, which may confer a growth advantage in primary prostate cancer, although it is less prevalent in metastatic tissues (Kron2010DNA). 

In cutaneous melanoma, misexpression of HOXD3 has been linked to tumor development and progression. Studies have shown that transfection of HOXD3 in lung cancer cells enhances metastatic and invasive phenotypes, while reducing its expression in melanoma cells decreases these activities (Maeda2004Altered). This suggests that inappropriate expression of HOXD3 may contribute to the invasive and metastatic characteristics of certain cancers.

HOXD3 is also involved in kidney development, and its dysregulation may play a role in kidney diseases. It regulates integrins, which are significant in conditions like glomerulonephritis and polycystic kidney disease, indicating a potential link between HOXD3 and these diseases (DiPoï2007Distinct).

## Interactions
HOXD3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HOXD3 is targeted by miR-203a, which suppresses cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis by downregulating HOXD3. This interaction affects the expression of VEGFR, N-cadherin, and MMP9, while increasing E-cadherin levels (Wang2018HOXD3). HOXD3 also binds directly to the promoter region of VEGFR, regulating its expression and promoting angiogenesis (Wang2018HOXD3).

In colorectal carcinoma, HOXD3 is involved in the transcriptional activation of Integrin β3, which activates the MAPK/AKT signaling pathways. This interaction is modulated by the nuclear lncRNA HOXD-AS1, which recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to the HOXD3 promoter, leading to epigenetic repression of HOXD3 through H3K27me3 modifications (Yang2019Nuclear).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, HOXD3 acts as a transcription factor that activates the KDM5C promoter. This interaction influences cell viability and proliferation, as well as apoptosis, by affecting the expression of proteins such as p53 and Bcl2 (Cui2021HOXD3).
