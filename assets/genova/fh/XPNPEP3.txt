# XPNPEP3

## Overview
XPNPEP3 is a gene that encodes the protein X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3, a metallopeptidase involved in the cleavage of N-terminal proline residues from peptides. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial enzyme, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis. It is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis, highlighting its widespread importance in cellular processes. Beyond its mitochondrial role, X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3 is implicated in ciliary functions, particularly in the processing of ciliary proteins, which is essential for preventing cystic kidney disease. Mutations in the XPNPEP3 gene are linked to nephronophthisis-like nephropathy, a ciliopathy characterized by renal and extrarenal manifestations. The protein's involvement in both mitochondrial and ciliary pathways underscores its significance in cellular metabolism and disease prevention (O’Toole2010Individuals; Singh2017Structure; O’Toole2010Individualsa).

## Structure
The human XPNPEP3 protein is a metallopeptidase belonging to the M24B subfamily, with a molecular structure determined at a resolution of 1.65 Å (Singh2017Structure). The protein consists of two chains, each comprising residues 54-507, and is organized into two main domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 54-245) and a C-terminal domain (residues 246-507) (Singh2017Structure). The N-terminal domain features a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, while the C-terminal domain exhibits a pita-bread fold (Singh2017Structure). The active site is located in the C-terminal domain and contains a binuclear metal center with two manganese ions, Mn A and Mn B, coordinated in a distorted octahedral geometry (Singh2017Structure).

XPNPEP3 exists as a dimer in solution, with dimerization involving both N- and C-domains through electrostatic and van der Waals interactions (Singh2017Structure). The protein has a wider S1' pocket, allowing it to accommodate non-proline substrates like Ser or Ala, and features molecular complementarity for Tyr or Phe side chains at the S1 site (Singh2017Structure). XPNPEP3 has two isoforms, one located in the mitochondrial matrix and the other in the cytosol (Singh2017Structure).

## Function
XPNPEP3 encodes a mitochondrial protein that functions as an X-prolyl aminopeptidase, which is involved in the cleavage of N-terminal proline residues from peptides. This enzymatic activity is crucial for processing specific peptides within mitochondria, contributing to normal cellular metabolism and function (O’Toole2010Individuals). In healthy human cells, XPNPEP3 is primarily localized to mitochondria, where it plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis (O’Toole2010Individualsa). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, brain, and testis, indicating its widespread importance in cellular processes (O’Toole2010Individualsa).

XPNPEP3 is also suggested to have a mitochondria-independent, cilia-related function. Although it is not localized to primary cilia, basal bodies, or centrosomes, its suppression in zebrafish mimics phenotypes associated with ciliary and basal body-encoding genes. These phenotypes can be rescued by an isoform of XPNPEP3 lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting a role in the processing of ciliary proteins and potentially in preciliary functions such as vesicular transport and the assembly of intraflagellar transport particles (O’Toole2010Individuals). This dual role highlights the protein's involvement in both mitochondrial and ciliary functions, contributing to cellular processes that prevent cyst formation (O’Toole2010Individuals).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XPNPEP3 gene are associated with a nephronophthisis-like nephropathy, a kidney disorder characterized by renal interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and cyst development at the corticomedullary junction. This condition is a form of ciliopathy, typically linked to defects in primary cilia, basal bodies, and centrosomes, although XPNPEP3 itself localizes to mitochondria (O’Toole2010Individuals; O’Toole2010Individualsa). The phenotypic severity of the disease varies among affected individuals, with some experiencing mild kidney disease and neurological symptoms, while others suffer from early-onset renal failure and severe extrarenal manifestations such as mental retardation and cardiomyopathy (O’Toole2010Individuals; O’Toole2010Individualsa).

In some cases, XPNPEP3 mutations lead to a functional defect in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1, contributing to symptoms like cardiomyopathy, seizures, and mental disorders (Singh2017Structure). The gene's role in cleaving ciliary proteins suggests that its dysfunction may disrupt normal ciliary functions, contributing to the pathogenesis of nephronophthisis-like nephropathy (Singh2017Structure; O’Toole2010Individualsa). The variability in disease presentation may be due to different degrees of loss of function in the XPNPEP3 alleles (O’Toole2010Individualsa).

## Interactions
XPNPEP3, also known as X-prolyl aminopeptidase 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It plays a role in the TNF-TNFR2 signaling pathway, where it acts as an adaptor molecule. In this pathway, XPNPEP3 is recruited to the cytosolic domain of TNFR2, regulating the phosphorylation of JNK kinases and exerting anti-apoptotic functions. This interaction is mediated by its structural fold, independent of its enzymatic activity (Singh2017Structure).

XPNPEP3 also interacts with ciliary proteins, processing them into their functional forms, which is essential for preventing cystic kidney disease. It is involved in the N-terminal processing of ciliary cystogenic proteins, such as CEP290/NPHP6, ALMS1, and LRRC50, which are associated with cystic renal disease. The enzyme's cleavage activity is crucial for the biological functions of these proteins (O’Toole2010Individuals).

Additionally, XPNPEP3 is implicated in mitochondrial functions, contributing to mitochondrial fitness through its Xaa-Pro peptidase activity. Mutations in XPNPEP3 can lead to structural collapse of the enzyme, affecting its activity and leading to symptoms linked to mitochondrial defects, such as cardiomyopathy and seizures (Singh2017Structure).
