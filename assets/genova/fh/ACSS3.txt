# ACSS3

## Overview
ACSS3, or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of ACSS3 is categorized as an acyl-CoA synthetase, specifically facilitating the activation of short-chain fatty acids by converting them into their corresponding CoA derivatives, such as propionyl-CoA. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the catabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids, contributing to energy production, particularly under conditions of carbohydrate scarcity like fasting (Yoshimura2016Molecular). ACSS3 is distinct from other family members due to its substrate specificity, favoring propionate over acetate, and is upregulated under ketogenic conditions, highlighting its role in metabolic adaptation (Yoshimura2016Molecular). Beyond its metabolic functions, ACSS3 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with proteins such as PLIN3, influencing lipid metabolism and tumor progression, particularly in prostate cancer (Zhou2021ACSS3). The gene's expression levels have been associated with cancer prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers, including bladder and gastric cancer (Chang2018Mitochondrial; Zhang2020RETRACTED).

## Function
ACSS3 (acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 3) is an enzyme primarily active in the mitochondrial matrix of liver cells, where it plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by activating short-chain fatty acids, particularly propionate, through the formation of propionyl-CoA (Yoshimura2016Molecular). This process is essential for the catabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids, contributing to energy production and metabolic regulation, especially under conditions where carbohydrates are scarce, such as fasting (Yoshimura2016Molecular).

ACSS3 is distinct from other acyl-CoA synthetase family members due to its unique substrate specificity, showing a high affinity for propionate over acetate (Yoshimura2016Molecular). The enzyme's activity is upregulated under ketogenic conditions, indicating its role in metabolic adaptation during fasting by increasing propionyl-CoA synthetase activity in the liver mitochondria (Yoshimura2016Molecular). ACSS3's function in healthy cells is primarily associated with energy metabolism, as it converts propionic acid into propionyl-CoA, facilitating the utilization of short-chain fatty acids for energy production (Yoshimura2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The ACSS3 gene has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including bladder cancer (BLCA) and gastric cancer (GCa). In bladder cancer, ACSS3 is significantly upregulated under metabolic stress conditions, such as hypoxia, and is associated with poorer overall survival in patients. Its expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting an oncogenic role. Downregulation of ACSS3 has been shown to suppress BLCA cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for BLCA (Zhang2020RETRACTED).

In gastric cancer, ACSS3 is identified as a significant prognostic biomarker, with higher expression levels correlating with tumor progression and reduced patient survival. The gene plays a crucial role in cancer cell metabolism, particularly under conditions of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Knockdown of ACSS3 in gastric cancer cells reduces cell growth and mobility, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The C/EBPα-ACSS3 axis is proposed as a regulatory mechanism in gastric cancer development, highlighting its importance in cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stress (Chang2018Mitochondrial).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ACSS3 in cancer biology, particularly in its role in promoting tumor growth and progression.

## Interactions
ACSS3 interacts with the lipid droplet-associated protein PLIN3, playing a significant role in prostate cancer progression. ACSS3 promotes the degradation of PLIN3 by enhancing its ubiquitination, a process facilitated by the recruitment of the AIP4 E3 ubiquitin ligase to lipid droplets. This interaction is crucial for reducing lipid droplet deposits within tumors, thereby inhibiting the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and reversing resistance to the drug Enzalutamide (Zhou2021ACSS3).

The physical interaction between ACSS3 and PLIN3, mediated by AIP4, is a key mechanism by which ACSS3 influences lipid metabolism and cancer progression. ACSS3 does not significantly affect the mRNA levels of PLIN3 but regulates its protein levels through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to PLIN3 degradation (Zhou2021ACSS3). This interaction is essential for the tumor-suppressive effects of ACSS3, as high PLIN3 expression is associated with increased tumor stage and poor prognosis in prostate cancer (Zhou2021ACSS3).

In vivo experiments further support the role of ACSS3 in regulating PLIN3 levels, as ACSS3 knockout mice exhibit increased PLIN3 protein levels and lipid accumulation, highlighting the importance of ACSS3 in lipid metabolism and tumor suppression (Zhou2021ACSS3).
