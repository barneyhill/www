# CSKMT

## Overview
CSKMT (citrate synthase lysine methyltransferase) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of citrate synthase, a pivotal enzyme in the citric acid cycle. As a methyltransferase, the CSKMT protein specifically catalyzes the methylation of lysine residues on citrate synthase, thereby modulating its activity and influencing the efficiency of the citric acid cycle. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and ensuring that metabolic processes are aligned with the energy demands of the cell. The activity of CSKMT has significant implications for cellular and organismal energy balance, impacting metabolic health and efficiency (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
CSKMT (citrate synthase lysine methyltransferase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism. It catalyzes the methylation of lysine residues on citrate synthase, a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle. This post-translational modification is significant as it can modulate the activity of citrate synthase, thereby influencing the efficiency of the citric acid cycle, which is essential for energy production in cells. CSKMT is active within the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, where it impacts various metabolic pathways and energy production processes. By regulating citrate synthase activity, CSKMT contributes to the fine-tuning of metabolic fluxes, ensuring that energy production is aligned with the cellular demands. This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the energy needs of the organism. The activity of CSKMT, therefore, has broader implications for the overall metabolic health of the cell and can affect organismal energy balance and metabolic efficiency.
