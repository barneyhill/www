# SWI5

## Overview
SWI5 is a gene that encodes the SWI5 homologous recombination repair protein, which plays a pivotal role in the DNA repair process through homologous recombination (HR). The SWI5 protein is a key component of the SWI5-SFR1 complex, a critical mediator in the stabilization and activation of the RAD51 recombinase, which is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. This complex enhances the formation and stability of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA, facilitating efficient DNA strand exchange and repair. The activity of SWI5 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, particularly in mitotically dividing cells, where it helps prevent genomic instability and potential oncogenic transformations (Akamatsu2010Role; Lu2018Swi5–Sfr1; Laurini2020Role).

## Function
The SWI5 protein plays a crucial role in homologous recombination (HR), a vital process for repairing DNA double-strand breaks and maintaining genomic stability. In human cells, SWI5 forms a heterodimeric complex with SFR1, known as the SWI5-SFR1 complex, which interacts with the RAD51 recombinase to enhance its DNA strand exchange activity. This complex stabilizes the presynaptic RAD51 filament, facilitating the release of ADP and maintaining the filament in an active, ATP-bound state, which is essential for effective HR repair (Laurini2020Role).

The SWI5-SFR1 complex promotes the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA, a critical step in the HR process. It reduces the nucleation size required for stable RAD51 filament formation, thereby enhancing the assembly and stability of these filaments. This activity is crucial for the homology pairing and strand exchange steps of HR, which are necessary for accurate DNA repair (Lu2018Swi5–Sfr1).

SWI5 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic integrity by facilitating the repair of DNA strand breaks. This function is particularly important in mitotically dividing cells, where DNA repair is critical for preventing genomic instability and potential oncogenic transformations (Akamatsu2010Role).

## Interactions
The SWI5 protein, involved in homologous recombination repair, forms a complex with SFR1, known as the Swi5-Sfr1 complex. This complex plays a crucial role in stimulating the activity of Rad51, a recombinase essential for DNA repair. The Swi5-Sfr1 complex stabilizes Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which is vital for homology pairing and strand exchange during DNA repair processes (Lu2018Swi5–Sfr1; Argunhan2020Cooperative).

The interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 is facilitated by the N-terminal domain of Sfr1 (Sfr1N), which contains specific sites that interact with Rad51. These interactions are crucial for the stimulation of Rad51-driven strand exchange and ATPase activity, which are key processes in homologous recombination repair (Argunhan2020Cooperative).

Swi5-Sfr1 also interacts with other recombination mediators, such as Rad55-Rad57, which can compensate for the loss of Sfr1N's function in Rad51-mediated DNA repair. This suggests a cooperative interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad55-Rad57 in facilitating Rad51 activity (Argunhan2020Cooperative). These interactions highlight the complex's role in maintaining genomic integrity during DNA repair.
