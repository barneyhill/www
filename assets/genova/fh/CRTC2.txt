# CRTC2

## Overview
CRTC2, or CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription coactivator protein involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, stress response, and immune function. The CRTC2 protein is categorized as a transcription coactivator, which interacts with the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) to enhance transcriptional activity. It plays a critical role in regulating gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and the expression of genes responsive to glucocorticoids and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Hill2016CRTC2; Altarejos2011CREB). The activity of CRTC2 is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its subcellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Altarejos2011CREB; Ma2021The). Mutations in the CRTC2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including epilepsy, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Ma2024Exome; Tasoulas2019Adaptive).

## Structure
CRTC2, a member of the CREB-regulated transcription coactivators, has a modular structure comprising several distinct domains. It includes an N-terminal CREB-binding domain (CBD), a central regulatory (REG) domain, a splicing domain (SD), and a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) (Altarejos2011CREB; Ma2021The). These domains are evolutionarily conserved across species, with homologues found in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC2 is subject to post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulates its activity and subcellular localization. Phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser171, Ser275, and Ser307, promotes binding to 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration (Altarejos2011CREB; Ma2021The). Dephosphorylation, triggered by cAMP and calcium signals, facilitates nuclear translocation and interaction with CREB (Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC2 also contains a conserved Pro-rich domain involved in modulating alternative splicing of some CREB target genes (Ma2021The). While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available literature, the protein's functional domains and post-translational modifications are well-characterized. CRTC2 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRTC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In epilepsy, CRTC2 is considered a candidate gene due to its involvement in epileptiform activity and its link to the mTOR signaling pathway. Specific mutations, such as the de novo variant c.172C > T, p.(R58X), are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, autism, and developmental delay. Other missense variants, c.599G > A; p.(R200Q) and c.1849A > G; p.(I617V), are linked to milder epilepsy phenotypes (Ma2024Exome).

In cancer, CRTC2 plays diverse roles. It is involved in lung cancer, where it forms complexes that promote migration and invasion, and in hematopoietic malignancies, where its role varies between acting as a tumor suppressor and promoting DNA mismatch repair (Tasoulas2019Adaptive). Mutations in CRTC2 have been identified in lung cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer development (He2014Identification).

CRTC2 is also significant in autoimmune diseases, particularly in Th17 cell differentiation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. Mutations in CRTC2 lead to decreased Th17 differentiation, indicating its essential role in autoimmune responses (Hernandez2015The).

## Interactions
CRTC2, also known as CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. CRTC2 interacts with the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) through its N-terminal CREB-binding domain, enhancing CREB's transcriptional activity by promoting its binding to target promoters such as PEPCK, which is involved in gluconeogenesis (Wang2010Targeted; Altarejos2011CREB).

CRTC2 also interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), specifically with the ligand-binding domain of GR, enhancing the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. This interaction is crucial for the cooperative expression of genes like glucose-6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in hepatic gluconeogenesis (Hill2016CRTC2).

In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CRTC2 interacts with Activating Transcription Factor 6 alpha (ATF6α), promoting the expression of ER quality control genes. This interaction is significant for the recruitment of CRTC2 to ATF6α-regulated genes, such as the Xbp1 promoter (Wang2009The).

CRTC2 also interacts with Sec31A, a subunit of the COPII complex, affecting the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and thereby regulating hepatic lipid metabolism (Han2015The).
