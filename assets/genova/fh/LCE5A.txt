# LCE5A

## Overview
LCE5A (late cornified envelope 5A) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which is integral to the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. The LCE5A protein is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and contributes to the structural integrity of the epidermal barrier, playing a significant role in the skin's response to environmental stressors. Located on chromosome 1q21, LCE5A is part of a gene cluster associated with skin differentiation (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated). Unlike some other LCE family members, LCE5A is expressed at lower levels but is upregulated in response to cold and dry conditions, highlighting its role in enhancing barrier function and reducing water loss (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated; Niehues2016Late). The gene's expression is typically downregulated during skin barrier repair, indicating its primary function in maintaining normal barrier integrity rather than repair (de2012Expression).

## Structure


## Function
LCE5A (late cornified envelope 5A) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. This protein is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which plays a crucial role in keratinocyte differentiation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. LCE5A is located on chromosome 1q21, within a cluster of genes associated with skin differentiation (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated).

In healthy human cells, LCE5A is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the skin barrier. Its expression is typically downregulated during skin barrier repair processes, suggesting that it is more involved in normal barrier maintenance rather than repair (de2012Expression). The protein is expressed at lower levels compared to other LCE family members, such as LCE1 and LCE2, but is still considered important for the epidermal response to environmental stress (Niehues2016Late).

LCE5A is upregulated in response to cold and dry environmental conditions, indicating its role in enhancing the skin's barrier function and reducing water loss under stress (BarbollatBoutrand2017Repeated). This suggests that LCE5A contributes to the skin's adaptive response to environmental changes, supporting its function in maintaining epidermal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCE5A gene have been implicated in several skin-related conditions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the long noncoding RNA lnc-LCE5A-1, associated with the LCE5A gene, is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is linked to poor survival outcomes in patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker in HNSCC (Zou2015Transcriptome). The enforced expression of lnc-LCE5A-1 in HNSCC cell lines has been shown to reduce the expression of cancer stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Zou2015Transcriptome).

In the context of skin barrier function, LCE5A expression is downregulated following skin barrier disruption, such as tape stripping, which suggests its role in maintaining normal skin barrier integrity (de2012Expression). This downregulation is also observed in conditions like psoriasis, where the skin barrier is compromised, leading to inflammation and scaling (Niehues2016Late).

Additionally, in AEC syndrome, a disorder caused by mutations in the p63 gene, there is a noted reduction in LCE5A expression, which may contribute to the skin barrier defects observed in this condition (Clements2012Mutations).
