# RIOK2

## Overview
RIOK2 is a gene that encodes the RIO kinase 2 protein, a serine/threonine kinase involved in critical cellular processes, particularly ribosome biogenesis. The RIO kinase 2 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain and a kinase domain, which facilitate its role in the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit. This protein is essential for the final stages of pre-40S ribosomal particle maturation, a process vital for the production of functional ribosomes and, consequently, protein synthesis. RIO kinase 2's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which is crucial for its recycling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, ensuring efficient ribosome assembly and cell proliferation. Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis, RIO kinase 2 interacts with various RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors, influencing mRNA stability and transcriptional regulation. The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where it acts as an oncogenic driver and potential prognostic marker (Cerezo2020RIOK2; Ghosh2024RIOK2; Cerezo2021RIOK2).

## Structure
The human RIOK2 protein is characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain at the N-terminus, followed by a kinase domain divided into an N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) that bind ATP between them (Wang2019Crystal). The structure of RIOK2 closely resembles that of RIOK2 from the archaea Archaeoglobus fulgidus, despite having a closer sequence identity to the fungal Chaetomium thermophilum RIOK2. Notable structural differences include the absence of an aI helix on the C-terminus of the kinase domain in human and archaeal RIOK2 compared to the fungal version, and a shorter loop between b6 and b7 in human RIOK2 (Wang2019Crystal).

The ATP-binding P-loop, formed by strands b1 and b2, shows flexibility, which is common in protein kinases when binding different inhibitors (Wang2019Crystal). The most conserved regions of RIOK2 are buried within the protein, with the ATP-binding site being significantly better conserved than average (Wang2019Crystal). The surface charge distribution analysis reveals a positively charged N-terminal region, particularly the wHTH domain, which is consistent with its role as an RNA-binding domain, while the C-terminal lobe is negatively charged (Wang2019Crystal). The loop between b3 and aC is extended and disordered in human RIOK2, hypothesized to be important for RNA interactions (Wang2019Crystal).

## Function
RIOK2 (RIO kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit in human cells. It is involved in the final stages of pre-40S ribosomal particle maturation, which is essential for the production of translation-competent ribosomes (Cerezo2020RIOK2; Cerezo2021RIOK2). RIOK2 is incorporated into pre-40S particles in the nucleus and participates in their export to the cytoplasm. Its catalytic activity is crucial for its recycling back to the nucleus, a process facilitated by its phosphorylation at Ser483 by RSK, a kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway (Cerezo2021RIOK2).

Phosphorylation of RIOK2 at Ser483 is necessary for its release from pre-40S particles and subsequent re-import into the nucleus, which is a prerequisite for the completion of small ribosomal subunit maturation (Cerezo2020RIOK2; Cerezo2021RIOK2). This phosphorylation event is crucial for optimal protein synthesis and cell proliferation, as it affects the dissociation efficiency of RIOK2 and other associated maturation factors, promoting the completion of small subunit biogenesis (Cerezo2020RIOK2; Cerezo2021RIOK2). RIOK2's function is essential for proper cell growth and proliferation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Cerezo2020RIOK2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RIOK2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, RIOK2 is identified as an oncogenic driver in several types, including glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. Its overexpression is associated with shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Li2022Pancancer). In glioblastoma, RIOK2 interacts with the RNA-binding protein IMP3, modulating the MYC oncogene, which is crucial for tumor cell proliferation and survival (Chen2020RIOK2).

RIOK2 also plays a significant role in telomere maintenance. Its deficiency leads to telomere shortening, which is linked to aging and diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In these conditions, RIOK2 regulates the TRiC and dyskerin complexes, essential for telomerase activity. Loss of RIOK2 impairs telomerase function, contributing to telomere shortening and associated pathologies (Ghosh2024RIOK2).

Alterations in RIOK2 expression also affect the tumor-immune microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, which may contribute to immune suppression in cancer (Li2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
RIOK2 interacts with several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as IMP3, G3BP1, ATXN2L, and ILF3, which are involved in mRNA stability, transport, and translation. Immunoprecipitation experiments in glioblastoma (GBM) cells have shown that RIOK2 associates with both endogenous and FLAG-epitope-tagged proteins, identifying ribosome assembly factors like TSR1, LTV1, NOB1, and PNO1 as binding partners. Notably, IMP3 has a reduced association with a catalytically inactive form of RIOK2, indicating a specific interaction. This interaction is enriched in tumor cells, suggesting a distinct complex from RIOK2-ribosome assembly factor complexes (Chen2020RIOK2).

RIOK2 also plays a role in ribosome biogenesis, interacting with pre-40S ribosomal particles. Its phosphorylation at Ser483 is crucial for optimal cell proliferation and global protein synthesis, affecting its association with pre-40S particles and recycling back to the nucleus (Cerezo2020RIOK2). The N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) domain of RIOK2 is positively charged and interacts extensively with RNA, as observed in the cryo-EM structure of a yeast pre-40S particle (Wang2019Crystal). RIOK2's interactions extend to transcriptional regulation, where it binds to promoter regions of genes involved in telomere maintenance, acting as a transcription factor (Ghosh2024RIOK2).
