# TJP1

## Overview
TJP1, or tight junction protein 1, is a gene that encodes the protein ZO-1, a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. ZO-1 is a scaffolding protein belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUK) family, characterized by its multidomain structure, including PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains. These domains enable ZO-1 to interact with various transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, facilitating the assembly and maintenance of tight junctions by linking them to the actin cytoskeleton (Fanning1998The; Rouaud2020Scaffolding). The protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular barrier functions and is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation (Van2009ZO1; Fanning1998The). Alterations in TJP1 expression or function have been associated with several diseases, including kidney dysfunction and cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Lee2022High; Itoh2014The).

## Structure
TJP1, also known as ZO-1, is a scaffolding protein integral to the structure and function of tight junctions. It belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs (MAGUK) family and is characterized by a multidomain structure. The protein contains three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a region homologous to guanylate kinase (GUK) in its N-terminal half, which is similar to other MAGUK proteins (Fanning2009Zonula; Fanning1998The). These domains facilitate interactions with various tight junction transmembrane proteins and cytosolic proteins, such as claudins, occludin, and ZO-2 (Fanning1998The; Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

The C-terminal half of ZO-1 is proline-rich and interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, linking tight junction components to the cytoskeleton (Fanning1998The). ZO-1 can bind to F-actin directly or through interactions with other proteins like cingulin and paracingulin (Rouaud2020Scaffolding). The protein's ability to organize the cytoskeleton is modulated by alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms, α(+) and α(-), which are differentially expressed during development (Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

ZO-1's function is also regulated by dimerization and phosphorylation, which influence its conformation and interactions with other proteins, contributing to its role in maintaining epithelial sheet integrity (Rouaud2020Scaffolding).

## Function
TJP1, also known as tight junction protein 1, encodes the protein ZO-1, which is integral to the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. ZO-1 is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family and contains conserved protein-binding domains, including PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains, which facilitate its role as a scaffold protein. It connects transmembrane tight junction proteins, such as occludin, with the actin cytoskeleton, thereby regulating the dynamic assembly and structural integrity of tight junctions (Zhang2018The; Fanning1998The).

ZO-1 is crucial for stabilizing the tight junction solute barrier by coupling to the perijunctional cytoskeleton. Its depletion leads to increased permeability for larger solutes and altered actin localization, highlighting its role in maintaining barrier function and cell morphology (Van2009ZO1). In podocytes, TJP1 is essential for the organization of foot processes and the slit diaphragm, critical components of the glomerular filtration barrier. Its absence results in impaired foot process architecture and glomerular dysfunction (Itoh2014The). ZO-1 also interacts with signaling proteins, indicating its involvement in signal transduction pathways that control cell growth and differentiation (Fanning1998The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TJP1 gene, which encodes tight junction protein 1 (ZO-1), have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of kidney function, TJP1 is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of podocyte filtration slits. Deletion of TJP1 in podocytes leads to impaired blood filtration, resulting in non-selective proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in mice. This is due to the disorganization of the basement membrane and foot process effacement, which are critical for renal function (Itoh2014The). 

In bladder cancer, TJP1 is often upregulated, with its expression levels significantly associated with the age, grade, and stage of the disease. High TJP1 expression is linked to poor clinical outcomes and may serve as a predictive biomarker for bladder cancer staging (Lee2022High). 

TJP1 also plays a role in endothelial permeability. The absence of primary cilia in endothelial cells leads to decreased TJP1 expression, resulting in reduced barrier integrity and increased permeability. This has implications for conditions like intracranial aneurysms, particularly in patients with polycystic kidney disease (Diagbouga2021Primary). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TJP1 in various pathological conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TJP1, also known as ZO-1, is a key component of tight junctions and interacts with various proteins to maintain cellular structure and function. It binds directly to transmembrane proteins such as occludin and claudins, facilitating their connection to the actin cytoskeleton through its C-terminal domain (Zhang2018The; Fanning1998The). TJP1's PDZ domains are crucial for its interaction with other tight junction proteins, including ZO-2 and ZO-3, and for the dimerization of tight junction proteins, which is important for strand assembly (Zhang2018The; Fanning1998The).

TJP1 also interacts with signaling proteins such as AF-6 and heterotrimeric G-proteins, influencing signal transduction pathways (Fanning1998The). It forms a complex with the F-BAR-domain protein TOCA-1, which recruits the actin nucleation-promoting factor N-WASP to tight junctions, highlighting its role in actin assembly and tight junction dynamics (Van2015A). Additionally, TJP1 interacts with cadherin-binding proteins like α-catenin and β-catenin, linking the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton and playing a role in cell adhesion (Zhang2018The; Fanning1998The).
