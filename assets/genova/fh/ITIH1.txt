# ITIH1

## Overview
The ITIH1 gene encodes the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 1, a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family. This protein is primarily involved in stabilizing the extracellular matrix (ECM) and modulating inflammatory responses. ITIH1 is characterized by the presence of the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain and the vault protein inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (VIT) domain, which contribute to its role in ECM stability and immune regulation (Zhuo2008Structure). The gene is located on chromosome 3 and is expressed predominantly in the liver, where it is coupled with bikunin before being released into the bloodstream (Zhuo2008Structure). ITIH1's interactions with hyaluronic acid and its involvement in post-translational modifications, such as O-GlcNAcylation, underscore its significance in both physiological and pathological processes, including insulin resistance and cancer (Kim2019Overproduction). The protein's role in maintaining ECM integrity and regulating inflammation makes it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases, such as osteoarthritis and renal cell carcinoma (Lourido2019ITIH1; Gao2024ITIH1).

## Structure
The ITIH1 protein is part of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family and is characterized by specific domain structures. It contains the von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain and the vault protein inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (VIT) domain, which are present in the mature heavy chains (HCs) (Zhuo2008Structure). The vWA domain is involved in various biological functions, including transcription, DNA repair, and cell adhesion, and is commonly found in extracellular proteins (Zhuo2008Structure). The VIT domain is less common and is part of the vault particle, a cytoplasmic organelle with an unknown function (Zhuo2008Structure).

The ITIH1 gene is part of a cluster with ITIH3 and ITIH4 on chromosome 3, and the heavy chains are expressed in the liver, where they are coupled with bikunin before being released into blood circulation (Zhuo2008Structure). The prepropeptides of HC1-3, which include ITIH1, consist of a signal peptide, a short propeptide, a mature form of HC, and a C-terminal polypeptide. The signal peptides and propeptides are removed in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the C-terminal polypeptides are released during the coupling of the mature form of HC with bikunin in the trans-Golgi network (Zhuo2008Structure).

Alternative splicing and point mutations in the ITIH1 gene contribute to the diversity of its isoforms, although the functional significance of these variations is not fully understood (Zhuo2008Structure). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common in proteins involved in extracellular functions. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of ITIH1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ITIH1 gene encodes the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 1, a protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix (ECM) and modulating inflammation. ITIH1 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to the structural integrity of the ECM by forming stable complexes with hyaluronic acid (HA) and other matrix components. This interaction is essential for maintaining ECM stability, which is vital for processes such as cell migration and wound healing (Zhuo2008Structure).

The protein is involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role in inhibiting complement activation. ITIH1 helps control inflammation by regulating C5 convertase activity, which is important for preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Zhuo2008Structure). Additionally, ITIH1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for early knee osteoarthritis, indicating its involvement in joint health and disease processes (Lourido2019ITIH1).

Overall, ITIH1's functions in healthy human cells include maintaining ECM stability, modulating inflammation, and contributing to tissue repair and protection by inhibiting proteases (Zhuo2008Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITIH1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and systemic insulin resistance. In RCC, ITIH1 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this elevated expression correlates with a decreased 5-year survival rate for patients. Despite its high expression in tumor tissues, ITIH1 is expressed at lower levels in RCC cell lines compared to normal kidney cells. Functional studies indicate that ITIH1 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating cell proliferation and invasion, potentially through the NF-κB signaling pathway (Gao2024ITIH1).

In the context of metabolic disorders, ITIH1 overproduction is associated with systemic insulin resistance, particularly following the loss of the Gα13 protein in the liver. This overproduction leads to increased ITIH1 secretion, which contributes to insulin resistance by interacting with hyaluronan in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues. The elevated levels of ITIH1 are linked to impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, suggesting its role in the development of these conditions (Kim2019Overproduction). These findings highlight ITIH1's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
ITIH1 (inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 1) is known to interact with hyaluronan, a major component of the extracellular matrix. This interaction is significant in the context of insulin resistance, as ITIH1 binds to hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix surrounding adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, contributing to extracellular matrix stabilization and potentially exacerbating insulin resistance (Kim2019Overproduction). The binding of ITIH1 to hyaluronan is enhanced in certain mouse models, such as G13 LKO mice, indicating its role in peripheral insulin resistance (Kim2019Overproduction).

ITIH1 is also involved in post-translational modifications, specifically O-GlcNAcylation, which stabilizes the protein by reducing its ubiquitination. This modification is facilitated by O-GlcNAc transferase, an enzyme upregulated in conditions of insulin resistance (Kim2019Overproduction). Although the study does not provide specific details on ITIH1's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, it suggests that ITIH1 may form complexes with other proteins like ITIH2 and bikunin, which could have functional implications in metabolic processes (Kim2019Overproduction).
