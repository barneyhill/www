# FNDC3A

## Overview
The FNDC3A gene encodes the protein Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 3A, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by the presence of multiple fibronectin type III domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, as they facilitate interactions with other proteins and the extracellular matrix (Liedtke2019ECM; Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC3A is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, placenta, testis, and prostate gland, and is notably involved in reproductive functions, such as spermatogenesis (Daudon2022Irisin). The protein's structure, which includes a transmembrane helix and a proline-rich region, suggests its involvement in cellular signaling and tissue development (Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC3A has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including limb malformations and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Liedtke2018Fndc3a; Shivakumar2016Comparative).

## Structure
The FNDC3A protein, also known as Fibronectin Domain Containing Protein 3A, has a molecular weight of approximately 132 kDa and is composed of nine type III fibronectin modules, which are common features in proteins involved in cell adhesion and receptor binding (Daudon2022Irisin). The protein forms a transmembrane helix at its C-terminus and has an amino terminus rich in proline (PRR), which includes multiple conserved WW-domain binding motifs (Daudon2022Irisin). These motifs facilitate specific interactions with Irisin family members and are implicated in ovarian function (Daudon2022Irisin).

Post-translational modifications of FNDC3A include acetylation at amino acid 384 and phosphorylation at amino acids 203, 207, and 213 (Daudon2022Irisin). The gene encoding FNDC3A can produce two or three splice variants, depending on the species, due to alternative start and stop sites (Daudon2022Irisin). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, with significant sequence homology observed between humans and other vertebrates, such as rhesus monkeys, cattle, and mice (Daudon2022Irisin). The FNDC3A protein is essential for various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, as indicated by its fibronectin domains (Liedtke2019ECM).

## Function
The FNDC3A gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. The protein contains fibronectin type III domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and are involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and signal transduction (Daudon2022Irisin). FNDC3A is expressed in several peripheral tissues, such as the uterus, placenta, testis, and prostate gland, but not in the ovary (Daudon2022Irisin). It plays a role in reproductive functions, as evidenced by its necessity for spermatogenesis in mice, where it is present in Leydig cells and the acrosome of spermatids (Daudon2022Irisin).

In odontoblasts, FNDC3A, also known as HUGO, is overexpressed and localized in the cytoplasm, particularly around the nucleus and in the Golgi zone, suggesting a role in cellular processes related to the Golgi apparatus (Carrouel2008HUGO). The protein's structure includes a transmembrane helix and a proline-rich region, which contains conserved WW-domain binding motifs that mediate specific interactions with other proteins (Daudon2022Irisin). These features suggest that FNDC3A is involved in cellular signaling and possibly in tissue development and maintenance. However, its exact function in healthy human cells requires further experimental validation (Daudon2022Irisin).

## Clinical Significance
The FNDC3A gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in FNDC3A expression have been associated with human nonsyndromic Split Hand/Foot Malformation (SHFM), a condition characterized by limb malformations such as syndactyly and median clefts of hands and feet. The gene's involvement in extremity development suggests its potential pathogenic relevance in SHFM phenotypes (Liedtke2018Fndc3a).

In the context of cancer, FNDC3A is part of the 13q CNV region, which is frequently altered in sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC). The gene shows amplified copy number status and overexpression in S-CRC tissue samples, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis. However, the specific mechanisms by which FNDC3A contributes to cancer progression remain unclear (Shivakumar2016Comparative).

FNDC3A has also been identified as a hub gene in Alzheimer's disease (AD) modules, with its expression potentially affecting glycosaminoglycan synthesis. This alteration could influence the proliferation of β-amyloid fibrils, a hallmark of AD pathology, suggesting a possible therapeutic target (RibeirodosSantos2023The).

## Interactions
FNDC3A, also known as Fibronectin Domain Containing Protein 3A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It contains fibronectin type III domains, which are known to mediate interactions with other proteins containing similar domains. FNDC3A interacts with fibronectin, a key extracellular matrix protein, particularly in the context of nanoparticle interactions. This interaction is significant in regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, as demonstrated in studies involving 40 nm PSCOOH nanoparticles, where FNDC3A acts as a fibronectin binding receptor protein (O’Connell2015Characterization).

FNDC3A also plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly and cellular structure establishment, as seen in zebrafish studies. It influences the development of median fin folds and caudal fin regeneration through its interactions with ECM proteins, potentially involving integrins and other ECM components (Liedtke2018Fndc3a). The protein's localization in the Golgi apparatus suggests a role in protein processing and ECM protein modification, which may involve indirect interactions with chaperones like Hsp47/SerpinH1 in collagen assembly (Liedtke2018Fndc3a).
