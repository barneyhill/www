# KRTAP24-1

## Overview
The KRTAP24-1 gene encodes the keratin-associated protein 24-1 (KAP24.1), a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair. KAP24.1 is distinguished by its unique amino acid composition, characterized by a high content of serine, proline, and tyrosine, and a notably low cysteine content. This protein is primarily expressed in the mid-to-upper hair cuticle of the human scalp, where it is thought to contribute to hair structure by acting as a linker between different KAP proteins or by forming a rigid scaffold with keratin. The evolutionary analysis of KAP24.1 suggests that it diverged early from other KAP family members, highlighting its distinct functional role in hair biology (Rogers2007Characterization).

## Structure
The KRTAP24-1 gene encodes the keratin-associated protein 24-1 (KAP24.1), which is characterized by a unique amino acid composition and repeat structure. The primary structure of KAP24.1 consists of 254 amino acids with a high content of serine, proline, and tyrosine, but a notably low cysteine content (9.05 mol%) (Rogers2007Characterization). This protein features several carboxyterminal tyrosine-containing tandem decameric repeat structures, which are distinct from the cysteine-containing repeats found in other KAP family members (Rogers2007Characterization).

The secondary structure of KAP24.1 is not explicitly detailed in the available literature, but the presence of tandem repeat structures suggests potential for forming specific secondary motifs. The tertiary structure is likely influenced by the hydrophobic interactions facilitated by its amino acid composition, despite the low cysteine content, which typically contributes to disulfide bond formation in other KAPs (Rogers2007Characterization).

KAP24.1 is expressed specifically in the mid-to-upper hair cuticle of the human scalp, suggesting a specialized role in hair structure, potentially as a linker between different KAP proteins or in forming a rigid KAP-keratin scaffold (Rogers2007Characterization). The protein's evolutionary analysis indicates its uniqueness and early segregation from other KAP family members (Rogers2007Characterization).
