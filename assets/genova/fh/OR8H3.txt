# OR8H3

## Overview
The OR8H3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily H member 3, which is part of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR8H3 protein plays a role in the olfactory system by binding specific molecules, leading to the initiation of a neuronal response that results in the perception of smell. While primarily associated with olfactory function, emerging research suggests that OR8H3 may also have implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, although its exact roles in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated (Cecotka2018RegionSpecific; FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b; Mariani2016MetaAnalysis).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR8H3 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been explored in various disease contexts, although its specific role remains unclear. In breast cancer, OR8H3 is upregulated in miR-18b-deficient cells, with a fold change of 5.18, suggesting an indirect regulation mechanism possibly mediated by the transcription factor PDX1. This upregulation indicates a potential involvement in cancer biology, although the exact clinical implications are not fully understood (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b).

In Parkinson's disease, OR8H3 is under-expressed in the substantia nigra tissue of patients compared to controls, indicating a possible link to the disease's pathology. However, the clinical significance of this reduced expression is not well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in Parkinson's disease (Mariani2016MetaAnalysis).

Additionally, in acute myeloid leukemia, OR8H3 is noted for down methylation in the gene body region, which may have implications for gene expression regulation. The specific clinical outcomes of these methylation changes are not detailed, leaving the significance of OR8H3 in this context uncertain (Cecotka2018RegionSpecific). Overall, while OR8H3 is implicated in various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further investigation.
