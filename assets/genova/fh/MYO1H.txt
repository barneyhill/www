# MYO1H

## Overview
MYO1H is a gene that encodes the unconventional myosin IH, a motor protein belonging to the myosin superfamily. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and plays a critical role in intracellular movements and vesicle trafficking. Myosin IH is involved in linking the cell membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to cellular processes such as protrusion, migration, organelle transport, and endo/exocytosis (Selçuk2022MYO1H). The protein structure of myosin IH includes a conserved myosin head domain, calmodulin-binding motifs, and a specific tail region essential for cargo interaction (Spielmann2017Mutations). Mutations in the MYO1H gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including mandibular prognathism and hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its significance in both craniofacial development and neuromuscular function (Selçuk2022MYO1H; Atteeri2021Analysis).

## Structure
MYO1H encodes the unconventional myosin IH, a motor protein involved in intracellular movements and vesicle trafficking. The protein structure includes a well-conserved myosin head (MYCs domain), which is crucial for its motor function, and three short calmodulin-binding motifs (IQ motifs) that are involved in binding light chains. The protein also features a highly specific tail region, which is essential for cargo interaction (Spielmann2017Mutations).

The frameshift mutation c.2524_2524delA (p.R842Gfs*11) in MYO1H is predicted to result in a truncated protein missing the myosin tail, which may lead to a complete loss of function due to nonsense-mediated decay. This suggests that the structural integrity of the myosin IH protein, particularly the presence of the myosin tail, is crucial for its function (Spielmann2017Mutations).

MYO1H is a member of the unconventional, non-muscle Myosin-1 family, which is involved in linking the cell membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. Although the specific cellular role of Myo1h is not well understood, other Myosin-1 family members are known to be involved in cellular protrusion, migration, organelle transport, and endo/exocytosis (Selçuk2022MYO1H).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the MYO1H gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. One notable condition is mandibular prognathism, a craniofacial deformity characterized by the protrusion of the lower jaw. The rs10850110 polymorphism in the MYO1H gene, particularly the G allele, has been significantly associated with an increased risk of developing mandibular prognathism in various populations, including American, Malay, and Romanian groups (Atteeri2021Analysis). However, this association has not been consistently observed across all populations, as studies in Iranian and Brazilian populations did not find a significant link (Atteeri2021Analysis).

MYO1H has also been implicated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness in the lower extremities. A deletion mutation in the MYO1H gene was identified as a potential cause of autosomal dominant pure HSP in a Turkish family, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Selçuk2022MYO1H).

Additionally, MYO1H mutations have been linked to a recessive form of central hypoventilation with autonomic dysfunction. A homozygous frameshift mutation in the MYO1H gene was identified in affected individuals, leading to severe respiratory and autonomic symptoms (Spielmann2017Mutations).

## Interactions
MYO1H, a member of the myosin superfamily, is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins. The MYO1H protein has been implicated in the formation of multiprotein complexes, particularly in the context of neuromuscular disorders. It is associated with cytoskeleton dynamics and endosomal trafficking, which are relevant to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (Selçuk2022MYO1H). 

MYO1H has been identified as one of the proteins that co-precipitate with MYO7A, suggesting an interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is part of a complex network of proteins involved in cellular motility and structural organization (Morgan2016PDZD7-MYO7A). 

Additionally, MYO1H is involved in intracellular movements and vesicle trafficking, which are crucial for its role in cellular transport mechanisms (Spielmann2017Mutations). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its potential role in neuromuscular and cytoskeletal functions, although specific protein interactions of MYO1H are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Selçuk2022MYO1H). 

Overall, MYO1H's interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in the context of hereditary spastic paraplegia and other neuromuscular disorders.
