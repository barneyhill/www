# IL4R

## Overview
The IL4R gene encodes the interleukin-4 receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the effects of cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). This receptor is integral to the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the differentiation and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, and is involved in the signaling pathways that lead to the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is crucial for allergic reactions and inflammation (Idzerda1990Human; Pernis1995Interleukin). The IL4R protein forms part of two distinct receptor complexes, Type I and Type II, which facilitate its interaction with IL-4 and IL-13, respectively, and initiate downstream signaling cascades such as the JAK-STAT pathway (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4; Ryan1997Interleukin-4). Variations and mutations in the IL4R gene have been implicated in several immune-related disorders, including asthma, atopy, and certain lymphomas, underscoring its clinical significance in disease susceptibility and progression (Hershey1997The; Viganò2018Somatic).

## Structure
The interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is a complex protein involved in immune signaling, primarily through its interaction with interleukin-4 (IL-4). The IL4R protein consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain contains two fibronectin type III (fnIII) domains, which are crucial for ligand binding. The first fnIII domain includes conserved disulfide bonds, while the second lacks these bonds (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4). The IL4Rα chain, a key component of the receptor, features a cytokine-binding homology region (CHR) and a ws-ws motif typical of cytokine receptor type I family (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4).

The IL4R can form two types of receptor complexes: Type I, which involves the IL4Rα chain and the common γ chain, and Type II, which involves the IL4Rα chain and the IL-13Rα-1 chain. These complexes allow the receptor to respond to both IL-4 and IL-13 (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4). The receptor's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to heterodimerize with other receptor chains, facilitating signal transduction (Murata1998Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in IL4R, affecting its stability and function (Mosley1989The). Splice variants of IL4R result in different isoforms, including a soluble form that can modulate IL-4 activity by neutralizing its effects (Mosley1989The).

## Function
The interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is a critical component in the signaling pathways of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are cytokines involved in immune regulation. IL4R is expressed on various cell types, including T cells, B cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts, and plays a significant role in mediating immune responses (Puri1995Structure; Pernis1995Interleukin). 

Upon binding with IL-4, IL4R initiates a cascade of intracellular events, primarily through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This involves the activation of Janus kinases (JAK-1 and JAK-3) and the subsequent phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), which translocates to the nucleus to activate gene transcription (Pernis1995Interleukin; Ryan1997Interleukin-4). The receptor's intracellular domain contains specific motifs, such as the I4R motif, essential for the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2), linking IL4R to downstream signaling pathways like phosphoinositol 3' kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (Puri1995Structure; Ryan1997Interleukin-4).

IL4R's function in healthy human cells includes promoting the proliferation and differentiation of T and B cells, influencing the development of Th2 cells, and regulating IgE production, which is crucial for allergic responses and inflammation (Puri1995Structure; Idzerda1990Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL4R gene are associated with several diseases, particularly those involving immune dysregulation. In asthma and atopy, variations in the IL4R gene, such as the Q576R mutation, have been linked to increased susceptibility. This mutation enhances receptor signaling, leading to heightened immune responses to allergens, which is characteristic of atopic conditions (Hershey1997The; Ober2000Variation). 

In rheumatoid arthritis, the IL4R I50V polymorphism is associated with rapidly erosive forms of the disease. The V50 allele is linked to a more aggressive disease course and a higher likelihood of requiring intensive treatment. This allele affects IL-4 signaling in T cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of erosive rheumatoid arthritis (Prots2006Association).

In primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), somatic mutations in IL4R, particularly the I242N mutation, lead to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This mutation promotes tumor growth and alters cytokine expression, contributing to the pathogenesis of PMBCL by creating a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment (Viganò2018Somatic).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of IL4R mutations in various immune-related conditions, highlighting their role in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
The interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is involved in forming two main types of receptor complexes: Type I and Type II. In the Type I complex, IL-4 binds with high affinity to the IL-4Rα chain, followed by heterodimerization with the common gamma chain (γc), which is essential for signaling (LaPorte2008Molecular; Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4). The Type II complex involves IL-4 binding to IL-4Rα and then associating with IL-13Rα1 instead of γc (LaPorte2008Molecular; Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4).

IL4Rα is a critical component in both receptor types and is involved in signaling for both IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines. The IL-4/IL-4Rα interface involves charge complementarity and polar contacts between specific residues, such as Glu9 and Arg88 of IL-4 and Tyr13, Tyr183, Ser70, and Asp72 of IL-4Rα (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4). The receptor complexes lack intrinsic kinase activity and rely on associated kinases like JAK family members for signal transduction (Ul-Haq2016Interleukin-4).

Endocytosis plays a crucial role in IL-4R signaling, facilitating ligand-induced receptor dimerization by increasing local receptor concentrations within cortical endosomes (Kurgonaite2015Essential). This process is essential for the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is a key mechanism in IL-4R-mediated immune responses (Kurgonaite2015Essential).
