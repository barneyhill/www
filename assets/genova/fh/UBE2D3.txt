# UBE2D3

## Overview
UBE2D3 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3, a pivotal component in the ubiquitination pathway, which is essential for protein regulation within cells. As a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, UBE2D3 plays a crucial role in transferring ubiquitin to target substrates, thereby influencing processes such as protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair (RomanTrufero2022The). The enzyme is involved in the ubiquitination of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and interacts with various E3 ligases, such as CBL and MDM2, to mediate the ubiquitination of key proteins like EGFR and p53, respectively (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D3's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its stability and function (RomanTrufero2022The). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer, where it can influence tumor growth and response to therapy (Hattori2007RNAi; Pan2021UBE2D3).

## Structure
UBE2D3 is a member of the UBE2D family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain. This domain features an α/β-fold with an N-terminal helix (α1), a four-stranded β-meander, a short 3_10-helix, and two C-terminal helices (α3-α4) (Gundogdu2019Structural). The UBE2D3 protein contains four α-helical and four β-sheet regions, which are integral to its structure (RomanTrufero2022The).

The active-site cysteine, crucial for catalysis, is located in a shallow groove surrounded by conserved residues that facilitate thioester and isopeptide bond formation (Gundogdu2019Structural). UBE2D3 can form a conjugate with ubiquitin, adopting an extended 'inactive' configuration that transitions to a closed 'active' configuration upon binding to an E3 enzyme, positioning the active site cysteine for catalysis (RomanTrufero2022The).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Serine 138, which is specific to amniotes and affects the protein's stability and function. This phosphorylation is mediated by the cell cycle kinase Aurora B and leads to destabilization and proteasomal degradation of UBE2D3 (RomanTrufero2022The). The structural data for UBE2D3 is available in the Protein Data Bank, with PDB IDs 2FUH and 5EGG providing insights into its three-dimensional structure (RomanTrufero2022The; Gundogdu2019Structural).

## Function
UBE2D3 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein regulation in cells. It functions as a ubiquitin donor, transferring ubiquitin to substrates, a process vital for protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and other cellular processes (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D3 is involved in the ubiquitination of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, PDGFR, and FGFRs, which are crucial for mammalian development and cancer regulation. The E3 ligase CBL uses UBE2D3 to mediate the ubiquitination of these RTKs, promoting their degradation and reducing their levels at the cell surface, thus attenuating signaling (RomanTrufero2022The).

In the context of DNA repair, UBE2D3 is part of a complex that facilitates homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair by promoting the ubiquitination of CtIP, a protein involved in DNA end resection (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D3 also contributes to the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis by acting as a ubiquitin donor in the MDM2/MDM4 E3 ligase complex, which ubiquitinates the p53 tumor suppressor protein, crucial for controlling p53-mediated stress responses (RomanTrufero2022The). UBE2D3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular and organismal functions (RomanTrufero2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the UBE2D3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), UBE2D3 is overexpressed, promoting tumor growth by enhancing glycolysis and cell proliferation through the regulation of SHP-2 ubiquitination and STAT3 signaling pathways. Knockdown of UBE2D3 in glioma cells reduces proliferation and glycolysis, indicating its oncogenic role in GBM (Pan2021UBE2D3).

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), UBE2D3 is crucial for the degradation of cyclin D1, a process necessary for all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cell growth arrest and differentiation. ATRA treatment upregulates UBE2D3 expression, facilitating cyclin D1 breakdown. Inhibition of UBE2D3 expression prevents this degradation, suggesting that UBE2D3 is essential for the therapeutic effects of ATRA in APL (Hattori2007RNAi).

UBE2D3 also plays a role in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, PDGFR, and FGFRs. Alterations in UBE2D3 expression can impact RTK signaling pathways, which are critical in cancer development and progression (RomanTrufero2022The). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of UBE2D3 in cancer therapy and resistance mechanisms.

## Interactions
UBE2D3, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes. It interacts with the E3 ligase Riplet to facilitate the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I, a key step in the activation of the antiviral innate immune response (Shi2017Ube2D3). UBE2D3 also interacts with the E3 ligase MDM2, playing a role in the ubiquitination of p53, which is important for regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (RomanTrufero2022The).

In the context of glioblastoma multiforme, UBE2D3 interacts with SHP-2, promoting its ubiquitination and activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is associated with increased glycolysis and proliferation of glioma cells (Pan2021UBE2D3). UBE2D3 also interacts with OTUB1, a deubiquitinase, which enhances its activity by binding to unconjugated UBE2D3, specifically for K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (RomanTrufero2022The).

Additionally, UBE2D3 is involved in the ubiquitination of receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through its role as a ubiquitin donor for E3 ligases like CBL, impacting the regulation of RTKs such as EGFR, PDGFR, and FGFRs (RomanTrufero2022The). These interactions highlight UBE2D3's significant role in cellular signaling and protein regulation.
