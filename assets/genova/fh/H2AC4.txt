# H2AC4

## Overview
The H2AC4 gene encodes a variant of the histone H2A protein, which is a critical component of the nucleosome structure in eukaryotic chromatin. This histone variant plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin dynamics. The protein encoded by H2AC4 is involved in various biological processes, including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are part of the immune response against pathogens (Ahlawat2023Exploring). Additionally, H2AC4 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with the progression of certain cancers, such as pancreatic and colorectal cancer (Jafari2022Screening; Li2023A). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific molecular interactions and pathways involving H2AC4 remain to be fully characterized.

## Clinical Significance
The H2AC4 gene, encoding a variant of the histone H2A, plays a significant role in cancer progression through its differential expression. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, H2AC4 is underexpressed, contrasting with the overexpression of other histone isoforms like H2AC6, which correlates with cancer cell aggressiveness (Espiritu2021Molecular). The expression levels of H2AC4 and related histone genes are also implicated in pancreatic cancer, where they have been identified as hub genes in bioinformatics analyses, suggesting their involvement in the disease's development (Jafari2022Screening).

Alterations in the expression of histone genes, including H2AC4, are linked to epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation. For instance, hypermethylation of the H2AC8 gene, a related histone variant, is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating that similar epigenetic modifications in H2AC4 could influence cancer outcomes (Espiritu2021Molecular). These findings underscore the importance of histone isoforms in cancer progression and highlight the potential of targeting histone gene expression as a therapeutic strategy. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in the H2AC4 gene itself are not detailed in the available literature.

## Interactions
H2AC4, a histone protein variant, is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are essential for chromatin structure and gene regulation. In the context of Theileria-infected cattle, H2AC4 is up-regulated in non-infected animals, suggesting a protective role against parasitic infection. It is involved in the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) pathway, a defense mechanism that traps and destroys pathogens. NETs are composed of DNA, proteinases, and histones, with histones like H2AC4 reported to have anti-parasitic activity (Ahlawat2023Exploring).

In cancer research, H2AC4 has been identified as a hub gene in pancreatic cancer, indicating its potential role in the disease's development and prognosis. However, specific interactions of H2AC4 with proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Jafari2022Screening). Similarly, in colorectal cancer co-infected with Schistosoma japonicum, H2AC4 is one of the proteins selected for further analysis, although specific interactions are not discussed (Li2023A).

Overall, while H2AC4 is implicated in various biological processes and diseases, detailed interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
