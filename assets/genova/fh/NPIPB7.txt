# NPIPB7

## Overview
The NPIPB7 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B7, which is a part of a larger family of proteins involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, a critical structure that facilitates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the specific functions of NPIPB7 are not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are generally implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and regulating gene expression by modulating the transport of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The NPIPB7 protein is categorized as a nuclear pore complex-associated protein, and its interactions and functional roles are subjects of ongoing research. Understanding the precise mechanisms of NPIPB7 could have implications for diseases linked to nuclear transport dysfunction.
