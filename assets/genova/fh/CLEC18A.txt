# CLEC18A

## Overview
CLEC18A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 18 member A, which is a member of the C-type lectin family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in immune modulation and lipid binding, facilitated by its distinct structural domains, including a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, and a cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain (Hsu2022Human; Chang2024Characterization). CLEC18A is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with notable expression in myeloid cells and the liver, and plays a significant role in enhancing the immune response to viral infections by acting as a co-receptor for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (Huang2021Endosomal). The protein's interactions with glycosaminoglycans and viral proteins further underscore its importance in immune signaling pathways and potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma and viral infections (Cheng2021Transgenic; Jonsson2024CLEC18A).

## Structure
The CLEC18A protein is a member of the C-type lectin domain family 18, characterized by a polypeptide chain of 446 amino acids. Its structure includes several distinct domains: a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), two epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF-like domains, and an N-terminal cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain, also known as the Sperm-coating protein (SCP) or Tpx antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1/Sc7 (TAPS) domain (Hsu2022Human; Chang2024Characterization). The CLEC18A protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels in myeloid cells and the liver (Huang2021Endosomal).

The CAP/SCP/TAPS domain is involved in binding and transporting sterols and acidic phospholipids, although a specific polymorphism (rs75776403) disrupts this function (Hsu2022Human). The CLEC18A protein also contains a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) at the C terminus, which is involved in binding to polysaccharides and allergens (Huang2021Endosomal). The tertiary structure of the SCP domain has been modeled using the SWISS-MODEL Server, suggesting that certain residues are located on the outer surface, potentially affecting interactions with other substrates (Hsu2022Human). The protein's role as a co-receptor for TLR3 in the endosome enhances the immune response to viral infections (Huang2021Endosomal).

## Function
CLEC18A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various molecular processes and cellular functions. It is part of the C-type lectin family and contains domains such as a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, and a cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain. These domains contribute to its role in lipid binding and transport, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secretion processes (Hsu2022Human).

CLEC18A is expressed in multiple tissues, including the liver and myeloid cells, and is involved in immune modulation. It acts as a co-receptor for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), enhancing the production of type I and type III interferons in response to viral infections, which is crucial for antiviral defense (Huang2021Endosomal). The protein's interaction with TLR3 and its ability to bind poly (I:C) suggest its significant role in innate immunity (Huang2021Endosomal).

The CLEC18A gene also influences metabolic processes and growth regulation. It is associated with thyroid hormone pathways, affecting growth phenotypes and potentially offering protective effects against conditions like cardiomyopathy (Hsu2022Human). The gene's polymorphisms, such as rs75776403, impact lipid-binding abilities and are linked to various human traits, including body height and kidney function (Hsu2022Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLEC18A gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. The rs75776403 polymorphism, a missense variant in CLEC18A, is linked to changes in metabolic and proliferative processes, immune deactivation, and human traits such as body height, kidney function, and hematological traits. This variant affects the protein's lipid-binding ability, potentially leading to metabolic imbalances and altered immune responses (Hsu2022Human). 

In cancer, CLEC18A expression is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression. High expression levels correlate with improved survival in ccRCC patients, while its expression is inversely correlated with survival in low-grade gliomas (Jonsson2024CLEC18A). The gene's interaction with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is significant in ccRCC, suggesting a role in tumor progression and patient survival (Jonsson2024CLEC18A).

CLEC18A also plays a role in immune responses to viral infections. The S339R variant enhances the host immune response by increasing interferon production, which is crucial for antiviral defense. This variant is associated with higher survival rates in mice infected with H5N1 influenza A virus (Huang2021Endosomal).

## Interactions
CLEC18A, a member of the C-type lectin family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CLEC18A interacts with sulfated GAGs such as heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. These interactions are significant as they are associated with the progression of ccRCC, where CLEC18A expression correlates with improved patient survival (Jonsson2024CLEC18A). The protein's interaction with GAGs is specific to their sulfated forms, as CLEC18A does not bind to unsulfated hyaluronan, indicating a requirement for disaccharide sulfation for binding (Jonsson2024CLEC18A).

CLEC18A also interacts with dengue virus proteins, specifically the prM-E proteins, in both the presence and absence of calcium. This interaction has been shown to reduce dengue virus type 2 infectivity in transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses to viral infections (Cheng2021Transgenic). The protein's interactions with viral proteins and its involvement in immune signaling pathways highlight its potential role in enhancing innate immune responses (Cheng2021Transgenic).
