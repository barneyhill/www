# PRKCG

## Overview
The PRKCG gene encodes protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), a member of the conventional protein kinase C family, which functions as a serine/threonine-specific kinase. PKCγ is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it plays a pivotal role in neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, and cerebellar development. The protein is activated by calcium ions and diacylglycerol, which facilitate its interaction with various substrates, thereby influencing processes such as apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synapse elimination (Winkler2020PKCγMediated; Shirafuji2019Spinocerebellar). Mutations in PRKCG are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration (Verbeek2008PKCγ; Wong2018Neurodegeneration). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various signaling pathways and its impact on neuronal health and disease.

## Structure
The PRKCG gene encodes the protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), a member of the conventional protein kinase C family. PKCγ is a serine/threonine-specific kinase involved in various cellular processes. The protein structure includes several key domains: a C1 domain, which is responsible for diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester binding, and a C2 domain, which binds calcium and phospholipids, facilitating calcium-dependent phospholipid interactions (Kofler2002Molecular; Verbeek2004Protein). The C1 domain is further divided into Cys1 and Cys2 subdomains, which are crucial for its membrane-targeting functions (Verbeek2004Protein).

PKCγ undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity and membrane affinity. The phosphorylation status of a motif in the C-terminal region, corresponding to T674, influences its affinity for calcium and phosphatidylserine (Verbeek2004Protein). The protein also exhibits alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity, although specific splice variants are not detailed in the context (Kofler2002Molecular).

Mutations in PKCγ, such as G118D and C150F, have been shown to increase kinase activity and alter membrane targeting, which are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) (Verbeek2004Protein).

## Function
The PRKCG gene encodes protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. PKCγ is primarily expressed in neurons, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it regulates dendritic development and synaptic function (Winkler2020PKCγMediated). In healthy cells, PKCγ is activated by calcium ions and diacylglycerol, which leads to the release of an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate region, allowing it to phosphorylate various substrates (Pilo2022Two). This activation is tightly regulated to ensure PKCγ is only active in response to appropriate stimuli, maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling (Pilo2022Two).

PKCγ is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and neuronal cell survival, contributing to the maintenance of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Shirafuji2019Spinocerebellar). It also plays a role in synapse elimination during cerebellar development, particularly in the transition from multiple to single climbing fiber innervation in Purkinje cells (Kano1995Impaired). The protein's proper function is essential for normal brain function, including processes such as memory formation and motor coordination (Wong2018Neurodegeneration).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKCG gene, which encodes protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, slurred speech, and abnormal eye movements. These mutations are primarily located in the C1 domain of PKCγ, affecting the protein's conformation and activity, leading to aberrant MAPK signaling and contributing to the disease pathology (Verbeek2008PKCγ). SCA14 is associated with cerebellar atrophy and Purkinje cell loss, with symptoms including gait disturbance, incoordination, mild dysarthria, and nystagmus (Wong2018Neurodegeneration).

The mutations in PRKCG result in a combination of loss-of-function at the plasma membrane and gain-of-function due to hyper-activated PKCγ, leading to mislocalization and aggregation of the protein in the cytoplasm (Wong2018Neurodegeneration). This mislocalization is associated with the formation of detergent-insoluble inclusions, a common feature in many neurodegenerative diseases (Wong2018Neurodegeneration). The altered PKCγ function due to these mutations affects Purkinje cell morphology and behavior, contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA14 (Verbeek2004Protein).

## Interactions
Protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), encoded by the PRKCG gene, is involved in various cellular interactions that influence synaptic plasticity and signal transduction. PKCγ interacts with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, specifically phosphorylating mTOR on serine residues 2448 and 2481, which affects neuron-specific autophagy processes (Kaleli2020Protein). This interaction is significant in the context of ischemic neural injury, where PKCγ is involved in the ERK-mTOR mediated autophagy pathway (Kaleli2020Protein).

PKCγ also interacts with ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), influencing autophagy processes in neurons (Kaleli2020Protein). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, PKCγ is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are critical in multiple sclerosis progression (Kaleli2020Protein).

Mutations in PKCγ, such as those found in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14 (SCA14), lead to increased kinase activity and mislocalization, resulting in aberrant phosphorylation of substrates like MARCKS (Wong2018Neurodegeneration). These mutations also impair PKCγ's ability to interact with membrane components, affecting its translocation to the plasma membrane (Wong2018Neurodegeneration).
