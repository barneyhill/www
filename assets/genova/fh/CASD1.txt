# CASD1

## Overview
The CASD1 gene encodes the CAS1 domain containing 1 protein, which is a multimembrane-spanning enzyme primarily functioning as a sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT). This protein is integral to the 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids, a modification that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including immune system regulation and cellular recognition (Baumann20159OAcetylation; Cavdarli2021Role). The CASD1 protein is characterized by a GDSL/SGNH-like alpha/beta-fold and a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity, which occurs in the Golgi apparatus (Baumann20159OAcetylation). Its activity is crucial for the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans, which are involved in neural precursor cell migration and peripheral nerve regeneration (Baumann20159OAcetylation). Additionally, CASD1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where its expression influences tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance (Baumann20159OAcetylation; Cavdarli2021Role).

## Structure
The CASD1 protein is a multimembrane-spanning protein composed of 797 amino acids. It features a GDSL/SGNH-like alpha/beta-fold for residues 83-290, forming a scaffold for a catalytic triad composed of serine (S94), aspartic acid (D270), and histidine (H273) (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The protein's topology includes a luminal catalytic domain flanked by one N-terminal and 12 C-terminal transmembrane domains, with the N-terminus being cytosolic and the C-terminus luminal (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The SGNH domain of CASD1 is responsible for transferring acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to position C9 of CMP-activated sialic acid, indicating its sialate-O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) activity (Cavdarli2021Role).

CASD1 is N-glycosylated, with five N-glycans identified, which is a common post-translational modification (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The protein's catalytic mechanism involves a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The C-terminal multi-transmembrane domain shares homology with bacterial multi-TM O-acetyltransferases, which are involved in modifying cell surface or periplasmic biopolymers (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The CASD1 protein is essential for the 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids, a modification important in various cellular processes (Baumann20159OAcetylation).

## Function
The CASD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids, which are terminal sugars on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification is essential for various cellular processes, including development, cellular recognition, and host-pathogen interactions (Baumann20159OAcetylation). CASD1 functions as a sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT), catalyzing the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to CMP-activated sialic acid, forming a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate (Baumann20159OAcetylation). This process is vital for the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans, which have significant roles in immune system function, such as regulating B-cell antigen receptor signaling through CD22 (Baumann20159OAcetylation; Mandal2012Functions).

CASD1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteins before they are transported to their final destinations (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The enzyme's activity is dependent on specific structural domains, including a catalytic triad composed of S94, D270, and H273, with S94 being part of a conserved GDS sequence motif (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The modification of sialic acids by CASD1 is developmentally regulated and implicated in neural precursor cell migration and peripheral nerve regeneration (Baumann20159OAcetylation).

## Clinical Significance
The CASD1 gene plays a significant role in the O-acetylation of gangliosides, which is crucial in various cancer types, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in CASD1 expression have been linked to changes in cancer cell behavior. In breast cancer cells, high CASD1 expression is associated with increased levels of O-acetylated gangliosides like OAcGD2, which are implicated in enhanced migrative and invasive capacities of cancer cells, although they do not affect proliferation rates (Cavdarli2021Role). This suggests that CASD1 may contribute to tumor aggressiveness and metastasis in breast cancer (Cavdarli2021Role).

In addition to breast cancer, CASD1's role in the 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids is crucial for the survival and drug resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Targeting CASD1 could potentially disrupt these processes, offering a therapeutic strategy against drug-resistant cancer cells (Baumann20159OAcetylation). The gene's involvement in the acetylation of sialic acids also has implications for immune system regulation and cellular recognition, although specific diseases directly linked to CASD1 mutations are not explicitly detailed in the available studies (Baumann20159OAcetylation).
