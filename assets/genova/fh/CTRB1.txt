# CTRB1

## Overview
CTRB1 (chymotrypsinogen B1) is a gene that encodes the precursor to the serine protease enzyme chymotrypsin, specifically chymotrypsinogen B1. This enzyme is categorized as a digestive enzyme and plays a pivotal role in the breakdown of proteins within the small intestine. Synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cells, chymotrypsinogen B1 is secreted into the digestive tract, where it is activated to chymotrypsin, facilitating the cleavage of peptide bonds at aromatic amino acids, thus aiding in protein digestion and nutrient absorption (Mosztbacher2020Loss). The CTRB1 gene is also involved in the regulation of trypsin activity by degrading trypsinogen, thereby preventing premature trypsin activation that could lead to pancreatic damage (Unknownauthors2021Mousemodelsoftrypsindependentpancreatitis). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining pancreatic health and preventing disorders such as pancreatitis. Additionally, genetic variations in CTRB1 have been linked to pancreatic diseases and metabolic conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (’t2013The; Rosendahl2017Genomewide).

## Structure


## Function
CTRB1 (chymotrypsinogen B1) encodes a precursor to the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin, which is secreted by the pancreas and activated in the small intestine. In healthy human cells, CTRB1 plays a crucial role in protein digestion by cleaving peptide bonds, particularly at aromatic amino acids, contributing to nutrient absorption and overall digestive efficiency (Mosztbacher2020Loss).

CTRB1 is involved in the degradation of trypsinogen, a precursor to the enzyme trypsin, which is essential for the digestive process. By degrading trypsinogen, CTRB1 helps regulate trypsin activity, preventing premature activation that could lead to pancreatic damage (Unknownauthors2021Mousemodelsoftrypsindependentpancreatitis). This protective mechanism is vital in maintaining pancreatic health and preventing conditions such as pancreatitis.

The CTRB1 protein is synthesized in pancreatic acinar cells, which are specialized for producing large amounts of digestive enzymes. These cells have a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, ensuring proper folding and function of the enzymes (Bodas2024A). Proper enzyme folding is crucial, as misfolding can lead to ER stress and is associated with pancreatic pathology (Bodas2024A). In healthy cells, CTRB1 ensures the proper processing and secretion of digestive enzymes, maintaining normal acinar cell function and protein synthesis (Bodas2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTRB1 gene have been linked to several pancreatic disorders and metabolic conditions. A misfolding variant of CTRB1 is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This variant causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation, leading to the activation of unfolded protein response pathways and increased susceptibility to pancreatic damage (Bodas2024A). In mouse models, this misfolding variant results in protein aggregation and ER stress, which may sensitize the pancreas to oncogenic signals, such as those from mutant Kras, thereby increasing cancer risk (Bodas2024A).

The CTRB1-CTRB2 locus is also implicated in chronic pancreatitis (CP), with a specific 16.6 kb inversion in this region linked to both alcoholic and non-alcoholic forms of the disease. This genetic rearrangement affects the expression levels of CTRB1 and CTRB2, altering chymotrypsin activity and influencing trypsinogen activation, a key factor in CP development (Rosendahl2017Genomewide).

In the context of diabetes, the CTRB1/2 locus affects susceptibility and treatment response through the incretin pathway. The rs7202877 SNP near CTRB1 is associated with increased GLP-1-stimulated insulin secretion and a differential response to diabetes treatments, such as DPP-4 inhibitors (’t2013The).
