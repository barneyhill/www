# ZSWIM7

## Overview
ZSWIM7 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger SWIM-type containing 7, which is integral to the process of meiotic homologous recombination, particularly during prophase I. This protein is categorized as a DNA repair protein due to its involvement in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. ZSWIM7 interacts with RAD51D, a key protein in DNA repair processes, underscoring its role in genomic maintenance. The expression of ZSWIM7 is notably high in reproductive tissues, such as the fetal ovary and adult testis, highlighting its critical function in gametogenesis and reproductive health. Mutations in ZSWIM7 have been linked to conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency and potentially colorectal adenomatous polyposis, indicating its clinical significance in human health (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is; Spier2016Exome; Xu2022Transcriptomewide).

## Function
The ZSWIM7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic homologous recombination during prophase I, a process essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. This function is particularly important in the formation of gametes, such as sperm and egg cells, which contain half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is). ZSWIM7 is part of a complex that interacts with RAD51D, a protein involved in DNA repair processes, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination (Spier2016Exome).

The expression of ZSWIM7 is notably higher in the fetal ovary during the peak onset of meiosis, suggesting its involvement in early developmental stages and its critical role in female meiosis (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is). In adult tissues, ZSWIM7 shows strong expression in the testis, where meiosis is actively occurring, indicating its ongoing role in reproductive biology (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is). The absence of ZSWIM7-associated phenotypes in public databases and the lack of reported homozygous loss-of-function variants further underscore its significance in human reproductive health (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZSWIM7 gene have been linked to familial primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by ovarian dysfunction leading to amenorrhea, estrogen deficiency, and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in women under 40. A study identified a homozygous stop-gain variant in ZSWIM7 (c.173C > G, p.(Ser58*)) in two sisters from a consanguineous family, which is predicted to cause nonsense-mediated decay of the gene product. This variant is classified as pathogenic and highlights the gene's role in ovarian development and its association with POI (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is).

ZSWIM7 has also been implicated in colorectal adenomatous polyposis. A frameshift deletion in ZSWIM7 was identified in a patient, suggesting a potential link to this condition. However, the specific role and impact of ZSWIM7 mutations in colorectal adenomatous polyposis require further investigation (Spier2016Exome).

Additionally, ZSWIM7 has been associated with child body mineral density (BMD) and lean body mass (LM), as it was one of the common genes identified across multiple tissue types in a transcriptome-wide association study (Xu2022Transcriptomewide).

## Interactions
ZSWIM7, also known as SWS1, is involved in the homologous recombination repair pathway and interacts specifically with RAD51D, a protein crucial for DNA repair processes. The interaction between ZSWIM7 and RAD51D is significant for the formation of RAD51 foci, which are essential for DNA repair through homologous recombination. Knockdown studies of SWS1 have demonstrated a reduction in cells with RAD51 foci, highlighting the importance of the SWIM domain in ZSWIM7 for its pro-recombinogenic function (Spier2016Exome).

In the context of meiosis, ZSWIM7 plays a role in meiotic homologous recombination during prophase I. This function is critical for germ cell development, as evidenced by studies linking ZSWIM7 to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in humans. A pathogenic variant in ZSWIM7 was identified in a consanguineous family with POI, suggesting that the gene's interaction with other meiotic proteins is vital for normal ovarian development and function (McGlackenByrne2021ZSWIM7Is).

While specific protein interactions beyond RAD51D are not detailed, the involvement of ZSWIM7 in these pathways underscores its role in DNA repair and meiotic processes.
