# FLRT3

## Overview
The FLRT3 gene encodes the fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3, a member of the fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane (FLRT) family. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. FLRT3 plays a crucial role in neural development, particularly in axon guidance and synapse formation, by interacting with other proteins such as latrophilins and netrin receptors. It is also implicated in endothelial cell function and embryonic development, where it influences morphogenesis and cell differentiation. The protein's structure, featuring leucine-rich repeats and a fibronectin type III domain, facilitates its interactions with multiple binding partners, underscoring its importance in cellular communication and tissue development (O’Sullivan2012FLRT; Jauhiainen2019Axon).

## Structure
FLRT3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its structure, which includes an N-terminal domain with 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a fibronectin type III domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Wang2024A; Jauhiainen2019Axon). The LRR domain is crucial for FLRT3's role in repulsive and adhesive signaling, facilitating interactions with various binding partners such as netrin receptors UNC5A-D, fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), ROBO1, latrophilin, and other FLRT3 molecules on adjacent cells (Jauhiainen2019Axon). 

The fibronectin-like domain and the transmembrane domain are connected by a juxtamembrane linker region that contains a proteolytic cleavage site, which can lead to the formation of a soluble FLRT3 (Jauhiainen2019Axon). FLRT3 can form homodimers or heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications may include glycosylation, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature (Wang2024A). 

FLRT3's interaction with latrophilin-3 (LPHN3) involves the LRR domain, where specific residues form hydrogen bonds, highlighting the importance of this domain in protein-protein interactions (Matsushima2019Leucine).

## Function
FLRT3 (fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3) is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. It plays a significant role in axon guidance and synapse formation during neural development. FLRT3 interacts with latrophilin receptors, specifically LPHN1 and LPHN3, forming a trans-synaptic complex crucial for excitatory synapse development and function. Disruption of this interaction leads to reduced synapse density and decreased synaptic input strength, highlighting its importance in synaptic organization and maturation (O’Sullivan2012FLRT).

In endothelial cells, FLRT3 is rapidly upregulated following stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), indicating its involvement in VEGF signaling. It regulates endothelial cell survival, migration, and tube formation, essential for angiogenesis. FLRT3 interacts with UNC5B, mediating repulsive signaling that affects cell migration and survival, while FLRT3-FLRT3 interactions between adjacent cells promote cell-cell adhesion and attractive signaling (Jauhiainen2019Axon).

FLRT3 is also crucial for embryonic development, as its absence leads to severe developmental malformations and embryonic lethality. It is involved in morphogenesis and the suppression of mesoderm differentiation, particularly affecting the anterior visceral endoderm and head formation (Egea2008Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FLRT3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In prostate cancer, FLRT3 is significantly downregulated in tumor samples compared to normal samples. Higher FLRT3 mRNA levels are associated with lower Gleason scores, indicating a better prognosis. The expression of FLRT3 is lowest in metastatic samples, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Wang2024A).

FLRT3 is also involved in the development of cortical interneurons, where it acts as a chemorepellent and adhesion molecule. Disruptions in FLRT3 function can lead to abnormal distribution of interneurons, which is linked to psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Fleitas2021FLRT2). Additionally, FLRT3 interacts with latrophilin 3 (LPHN3) in synaptic development. Alterations in this interaction, particularly in ADHD-related LPHN3 variants, can impair synaptic function, potentially contributing to neurological conditions (MorenoSalinas2022Convergent; O’Sullivan2012FLRT).

Despite these associations, a study found no pathogenic mutations in FLRT3 among patients with Kabuki syndrome, suggesting that its role in this condition remains unclear (Kuniba2008Lack).

## Interactions
FLRT3 (fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cell adhesion, synapse development, and axon guidance. FLRT3 interacts with latrophilins (LPHN1 and LPHN3), forming a trans-synaptic complex crucial for excitatory synapse development. This interaction is mediated by the extracellular domains of FLRT3 and the N-terminal fragment of LPHNs, with a high affinity binding characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd) of 14.7 nM (O’Sullivan2012FLRT).

FLRT3 also interacts with the Netrin receptor Unc5B, which is involved in repulsive signaling and cell deadhesion. This interaction is facilitated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FLRT3 and the Ig1 domain of Unc5B, contributing to axon guidance and neuronal migration (Peregrina2020FLRTing; Karaulanov2009Unc5B).

In addition, FLRT3 forms complexes with paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) and E-cadherin, influencing cell adhesion and morphogenesis. PAPC modulates FLRT3's activity by inhibiting its recruitment of the small GTPase Rnd1, which is necessary for FLRT3-mediated inhibition of cell adhesion (Chen2009A). These interactions highlight FLRT3's multifaceted role in cellular communication and tissue development.
