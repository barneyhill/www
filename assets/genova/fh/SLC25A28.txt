# SLC25A28

## Overview
SLC25A28 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 28, commonly referred to as mitoferrin-2. This protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family and functions as a transmembrane transporter located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitoferrin-2 is primarily responsible for the import of iron into the mitochondrial matrix, a critical process for the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and heme, which are essential for various cellular functions, including the electron transport chain and metabolic pathways (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The gene is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels in tissues such as striated muscle and the liver, highlighting its importance in energy metabolism and iron homeostasis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). SLC25A28's interactions with other proteins, such as p53 and its paralog SLC25A37, underscore its role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular iron balance (Girardi2020A; Zhang2020The). Alterations in the expression or function of SLC25A28 have significant clinical implications, including potential contributions to sideroblastic anemia and ferroptosis-related conditions (Zhang2020The).

## Structure
The SLC25A28 protein, also known as mitoferrin-2, is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices are arranged in a counter-clockwise order, forming a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol, which is a common structural feature of the mitochondrial carrier family (Palmieri2013The). The protein is involved in the transport of iron into the mitochondrial matrix, which is essential for the formation of iron-sulfur clusters and heme biosynthesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

SLC25A28 is ubiquitously expressed, with higher expression levels in striated muscle and the liver. It plays a critical role in iron incorporation into heme, with its function being more pronounced in heme synthesis compared to its homolog SLC25A37, which is more involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein's structure includes conserved motifs that form salt bridges, facilitating conformational changes necessary for its transport function (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variants of SLC25A28 are not detailed in the available context, such modifications are common in the solute carrier family and can influence protein function and localization.

## Function
SLC25A28, also known as mitoferrin-2, is a mitochondrial iron transporter located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. It plays a critical role in importing iron into the mitochondrial matrix, which is essential for the synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and heme, both of which are vital for various cellular processes. Iron-sulfur clusters are incorporated into mitochondrial enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase, which are crucial for the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Cunningham202020; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

SLC25A28 is ubiquitously expressed across all tissues, with higher expression levels in striated muscle and the liver. Its function is enhanced by interaction with the ABC transporter Abcb10, facilitating efficient coupling of iron import and heme biosynthesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis within mitochondria, supporting cellular energy production and metabolism (Palmieri2013The).

In healthy human cells, SLC25A28's role in iron transport is vital for the proper functioning of the electron transport chain and the synthesis of iron-containing cofactors, which are necessary for lipid biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways (Cunningham202020).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A28 gene encodes a mitochondrial iron carrier known as mitoferrin-2, which is crucial for iron import into the mitochondrial matrix. Alterations in the expression or function of SLC25A28 can have significant clinical implications. Knockdown studies have shown that reducing SLC25A28 expression decreases iron incorporation into haem and iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, with a more pronounced effect on haem synthesis (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). This disruption in iron metabolism can potentially contribute to conditions such as sideroblastic anemia, where iron accumulates in mitochondria but is not effectively utilized for haem synthesis.

The BRD7-P53-SLC25A28 axis plays a role in regulating ferroptosis, a form of cell death associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. In hepatic stellate cells, this axis is crucial for mitochondrial iron overload and the hyperfunction of the electron transport chain, leading to ferroptosis. Disruption of this axis impairs ferroptotic cell death, which has implications for liver fibrosis treatment (Zhang2020The). The clinical significance of SLC25A28 in these processes suggests it could be a potential therapeutic target for diseases involving iron dysregulation and ferroptosis, such as liver fibrosis and possibly other iron-related disorders.

## Interactions
SLC25A28, a mitochondrial iron transporter, interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 to regulate iron homeostasis and ferroptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). This interaction is part of the BRD7-p53-SLC25A28 axis, where p53 binds to SLC25A28, enhancing its stability and activity, which is crucial for mitochondrial iron accumulation. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and confocal imaging, showing colocalization in mitochondria (Zhang2020The). The binding of p53 to SLC25A28 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial iron levels, as evidenced by reduced iron accumulation when p53 is knocked down or mutated (Zhang2020The).

SLC25A28 also exhibits interactions with its paralog SLC25A37, another mitochondrial iron transporter. These interactions are characterized as reciprocal negative interactions, suggesting functional redundancy between the two proteins (Girardi2020A). Additionally, SLC25A28 and SLC25A37 show strong synthetic sick interactions, indicating their critical role in mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis (Shi2022Combinatorial). These interactions underscore the complex network of mitochondrial transporters in maintaining cellular iron balance and oxidative stress responses.
