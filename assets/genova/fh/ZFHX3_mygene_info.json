The encoded protein suppresses expression of the alpha-fetoprotein gene by binding to an AT-rich enhancer motif.

This gene is reported to function as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, and sequence variants of this gene are also associated with atrial fibrillation. Multiple transcript variants expressed from alternate promoters and encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
