# MAGEA10

## Overview
MAGEA10 is a gene that encodes the MAGE family member A10 protein, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, specifically categorized as a cancer/testis antigen. This protein is predominantly expressed in germ cells within the testis and various cancer cells, but not in most normal tissues, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Schultz‐Thater2011MAGE‐A10). The MAGEA10 protein is characterized by an intrinsically disordered N-terminal region and a MAGE homology domain (MHD) in its C-terminal region, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and incorporation into extracellular vesicles (Samel2023How; Alsalloum2023The). Functionally, MAGEA10 interacts with RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and modulates the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing apoptosis and cell growth (Samel2023How). Its expression is associated with several malignancies, including lung and skin cancers, and it has been explored as a therapeutic target in clinical trials (Schultz‐Thater2011MAGE‐A10; Blumenschein2022Phase).

## Structure
The MAGEA10 protein, encoded by the MAGEA10 gene, is a member of the MAGE family of cancer/testis antigens. It is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 369 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 42.3 kDa, although it migrates as a 68-70 kDa protein in SDS-PAGE due to its intrinsically disordered N-terminal region (Samel2023How). This N-terminal region contains a linear motif, 2-PRAPKR-7, which is enriched in prolines and positively charged amino acids, contributing to its unique migration pattern and nuclear localization (Samel2023How).

The MAGEA10 protein includes a MAGE homology domain (MHD) in its C-terminal region, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and the incorporation of the protein into extracellular vesicles (Samel2023How; Alsalloum2023The). The N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDPR) is crucial for the protein's expression and stability, potentially protecting it from proteasomal degradation (Samel2023How). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various partners, performing multiple functions in cancerous and normal cells (Samel2023How). The presence of positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal region is essential for its nuclear localization and aberrant migration (Samel2023How).

## Function
MAGEA10 is a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, primarily expressed in germ cells and various cancer cells. In healthy human cells, MAGEA10 is expressed in the nuclei of spermatogonia and spermatocyte cells within the testis, but not in other normal tissues (Schultz‐Thater2011MAGE‐A10). The protein is characterized by an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its expression, nuclear localization, and unique migration behavior in SDS-PAGE (Samel2023How). This N-terminal region contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that is similar to the SV40 Large T antigen, facilitating its nuclear localization (Samel2023How).

MAGEA10 interacts with RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and modulates the function of the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing apoptosis, cell growth, and transcription regulation (Samel2023How). The protein's role in cellular homeostasis is highlighted by its ability to enhance cell survival under stress conditions, such as exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, although it does not promote increased proliferation or anchorage-independent growth (Colemon2020DNA). Despite its involvement in these molecular processes, the precise biological functions of MAGEA10 in healthy cells remain poorly understood (Samel2023How).

## Clinical Significance
MAGEA10 is a member of the melanoma antigen gene family, known for its expression in various cancers and its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Altered expression of MAGEA10 is associated with several malignancies, including lung, skin, and urothelial cancers. In lung cancer, MAGEA10 is expressed in over 50% of tumor cells in a significant percentage of squamous cell carcinomas and other subtypes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Schultz‐Thater2011MAGE‐A10). In skin malignancies, such as melanoma, MAGEA10 is also highly expressed, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Schultz‐Thater2011MAGE‐A10).

In advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), MAGEA10 expression is linked to resistance to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, predicting poorer progression-free and overall survival. This suggests that MAGEA10 could serve as a biomarker for aggressive cancer phenotypes and guide treatment strategies (Lisica2023MAGEA10). Additionally, MAGEA10 has been targeted in clinical trials using genetically engineered T cells for non-small cell lung cancer, although challenges in patient enrollment and overlapping antigen expression have been noted (Blumenschein2022Phase). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAGEA10 in cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Interactions
MAGEA10, a member of the melanoma-associated antigen family, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in cancer biology. MAGEA10 interacts with RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are crucial for modulating protein degradation pathways. This interaction influences the regulation of p53 function, apoptosis, and cell growth, as well as transcriptional regulation (Samel2023How). MAGEA10 is also incorporated into extracellular vesicles (EVs), a process mediated by the C-terminal part of MAGEA4, although the specific role of MAGEA10 in this incorporation is not fully understood (Samel2023How).

The MAGEA family, including MAGEA10, interacts with MDM2, a key regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor. MAGEA proteins inhibit MDM2's ubiquitylation function, which affects the stability and activity of MDM2 and its interaction with MDM4. This interaction can disrupt the MDM2/MDM4 complex, influencing the degradation of these proteins and potentially altering p53 activity (Marcar2015MAGEA). These interactions highlight the role of MAGEA10 in modulating critical pathways involved in tumorigenesis and suggest its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
