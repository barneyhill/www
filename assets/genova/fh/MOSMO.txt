# MOSMO

## Overview
The MOSMO gene encodes the protein known as the Modulator of Smoothened, which is a membrane tetraspan protein involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for various developmental and homeostatic processes, including cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation. The MOSMO protein plays a significant role in regulating the internalization and degradation of the Smoothened (Smo) receptor, thereby modulating the activation of the Hh pathway (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). It is active at the plasma membrane, endosomes, and primary cilia, facilitating Smo translocation to the cilia, which is essential for signaling activation (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). The protein's function is conserved across vertebrates, as evidenced by studies in model organisms where its inactivation leads to developmental anomalies (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). MOSMO is also part of the MGRN1-MEGF8-MOSMO complex, which attenuates Hedgehog signaling by promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of Smo (Lebensohn2022Receptor).

## Function
The MOSMO gene, known as the Modulator of Smoothened, plays a critical role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental and homeostatic processes. MOSMO encodes a membrane tetraspan protein that facilitates the internalization and degradation of the Hh signaling transducer Smoothened (Smo), thereby modulating the activation of the pathway (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). This modulation is crucial for proper vertebrate embryonic development, as it helps regulate cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and axon guidance, as well as the maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo).

In cellular biology, MOSMO is active at the plasma membrane, endosomes, and primary cilia, suggesting its involvement in facilitating Smo translocation to the cilia, which is important for signaling activation (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). The protein's role in promoting Smo endocytosis indicates that it helps control Smo levels at the cell membrane, ensuring proper signaling and preventing developmental anomalies (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo). The function of MOSMO in healthy human cells is inferred from studies in model organisms, where its inactivation leads to craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, highlighting its conserved role in vertebrate development (CamachoMacorra2021Mosmo).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MOSMO, a modulator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, participates in several protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It is a component of the MGRN1-MEGF8-MOSMO (MMM) complex, which acts as an attenuator of Hedgehog signaling. Within this complex, MOSMO interacts with MGRN1, a RING family E3 ubiquitin ligase, and MEGF8, a protein with multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains. This complex regulates the abundance of the Hedgehog signal transducer Smoothened (SMO) at the cell surface by promoting its ubiquitylation, thereby controlling its endocytosis and degradation (Lebensohn2022Receptor).

MOSMO is also involved in interactions with other genes, such as SETD5, in the context of neurodevelopmental defects. The simultaneous knockdown of MOSMO and SETD5 in model organisms like Xenopus laevis has been shown to result in novel neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting a synergistic interaction between these genes (Pizzo2021Functional). These interactions highlight MOSMO's role in modulating phenotypes associated with genetic deletions and its involvement in complex genetic networks that influence development and cellular processes.
