# GABARAPL1

## Overview
GABARAPL1, or Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the GABARAP family, which is part of the Atg8 family of proteins. The protein encoded by GABARAPL1 is involved in various cellular processes, most notably autophagy and intracellular trafficking. It plays a crucial role in the maturation of autophagosomes and is distinct from the LC3 family proteins, which are involved in the elongation of the autophagic membrane (BoyerGuittaut2014The; Weidberg2010LC3). Structurally, GABARAPL1 features a ubiquitin-like domain that is essential for its function in autophagy and intracellular trafficking (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). The protein is highly expressed in the brain and other tissues, indicating its potential role in neuronal function and development (Xin2001Cloning). GABARAPL1's involvement in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Structure
The GABARAPL1 protein is a member of the Atg8 family and exhibits a typical architecture for an Atg8 ortholog. Its structure includes two N-terminal α-helices and a ubiquitin-like core, forming a compact globular shape (Jatana2019Human; Ye2021Structural). The protein's secondary structure is characterized by a four-stranded central β-sheet core and two α-helices, which are common features among human Atg8 orthologs (Jatana2019Human).

GABARAPL1 contains specific domains and structural features that contribute to its function. It has a ubiquitin-like domain, which is crucial for its role in autophagy and intracellular trafficking (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as lipidation, which are essential for its activity, particularly in membrane tethering and fusion processes (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP).

The protein's interaction with other molecules is facilitated by its structural features. For instance, the GABARAPL1-γ2-GIM complex involves the insertion of aromatic side chains into hydrophobic pockets formed by specific residues, highlighting the importance of its tertiary structure in binding interactions (Ye2021Structural). These structural characteristics enable GABARAPL1 to play a significant role in autophagosome formation and receptor trafficking.

## Function
GABARAPL1, a member of the GABARAP family, is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily autophagy and intracellular trafficking. It plays a significant role in the autophagic process by associating with autophagic vesicles and is crucial for the late maturation of autophagosomes, distinct from the LC3 family proteins that are involved in the elongation of the autophagic membrane (BoyerGuittaut2014The; Weidberg2010LC3). GABARAPL1 is also involved in the trafficking of proteins, such as enhancing the cell surface expression of the human kappa opioid receptor by facilitating its transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (Chen2011Effects).

In healthy human cells, GABARAPL1 interacts with tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and bundling, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport (BoyerGuittaut2014The). It is highly expressed in the brain and other tissues, suggesting a role in neuronal function and development (Xin2001Cloning). GABARAPL1 also participates in glycophagy, a process of glycogen degradation by autophagy, and inhibits Wnt-CTNNB1/β-catenin signaling by degrading DVL2, an activator of this pathway (BoyerGuittaut2014The). These functions highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
GABARAPL1 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, GABARAPL1 is often downregulated, particularly in high-grade tumors and those with lymph node-positive status. This downregulation is associated with poor prognostic factors, such as larger tumor size and a higher risk of metastasis. High expression of GABARAPL1 is linked to better outcomes and longer metastasis-free survival, especially in lymph node-positive patients (Hervouet2015The; Berthier2010High). The gene's expression is regulated by epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, which can lead to its silencing in cancer cells (Hervouet2015The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GABARAPL1 is significantly downregulated, with low expression levels correlating with poor differentiation and prognosis. Overexpression of GABARAPL1 in HCC cell lines inhibits cell growth, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (LIU2014Low).

GABARAPL1 also interacts with HSP90, a molecular chaperone. Disruption of this interaction can lead to GABARAPL1 degradation, affecting its stability and function, which may have implications for cancer progression (SeguinPy2012Identification). These findings highlight the potential of GABARAPL1 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
GABARAPL1, a member of the GABARAP protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in intracellular transport, autophagy, and cell proliferation. It interacts with tubulin, promoting tubulin assembly and microtubule bundling, and is involved in the trafficking of neuronal receptors by interacting with NSF (SeguinPy2012Identification). GABARAPL1 also interacts with the γ2 subunit of GABA A receptors, which is crucial for the stability and trafficking of these receptors to the synaptic membrane (Ye2021Structural). This interaction is mediated through a specific region in the γ2 subunit, termed γ2-GIM, which binds to GABARAPL1 with a similar affinity as GABARAP (Ye2021Structural).

GABARAPL1 interacts with HSP90, a chaperone protein that protects it from proteasome degradation. This interaction is disrupted by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, leading to GABARAPL1 degradation (SeguinPy2012Identification). GABARAPL1 also interacts with other heat shock proteins such as HSP70, HSP60, and HSP105 (SeguinPy2012Identification). In the context of autophagy, GABARAPL1 interacts with several autophagy-related proteins, including ATG3, ATG4A-D, ATG5, ATG7, ATG12, BECN1, and PIK3C3, which are involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes (Lu2020Autophagic).
