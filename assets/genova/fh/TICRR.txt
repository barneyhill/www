# TICRR

## Overview
The TICRR gene, also known as TRESLIN, encodes the protein TOPBP1 Interacting Checkpoint and Replication Regulator, which plays a pivotal role in the initiation of DNA replication and cell cycle regulation in human cells. This protein is integral to the formation of the pre-initiation complex, a critical step in DNA replication, and functions as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which phosphorylate TICRR to facilitate its interaction with TopBP1, a key replication and checkpoint regulator (Sansam2015Cyclindependent). TICRR is a chromatin-associated protein that operates within the nucleus, coordinating the replication machinery and ensuring genomic stability (Sansam2010A). Its interactions with other proteins, such as MTBP and CDC45, are crucial for regulating DNA replication initiation and maintaining proper cell cycle progression (Wittig2021The). Dysregulation of TICRR has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Zheng2023TICRR; Yu2019TICRR).

## Structure
The TICRR protein, also known as Treslin, is essential for DNA replication initiation in human cells. Its structure includes several key domains that are crucial for its function. The core of TICRR consists of the M domain, the Sld3-Treslin domain (STD), and the TopBP1/Dpb11 interaction domain (TDIN), which are homologous to the yeast protein Sld3 (Ferreira2021Refining). The M domain features a Ku70/Ku80-like β-barrel structure, which is important for dimerization and interaction with MTBP, similar to the Sld3-Sld7 dimer in yeast (Ferreira2021Refining). The TDIN domain is essential for replication through interactions with Dpb11 and TopBP1, while the STD domain binds Cdc45, a component of the CMG helicase (Ferreira2021Refining).

TICRR also contains non-conserved terminal regions, the CIT and C-terminal regions, which are specific to higher eukaryotes. These regions, although not essential individually, cooperate to promote DNA replication origin firing (Ferreira2021Refining). The CIT domain includes a von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain, suggesting an evolutionary link to Ku70/Ku80 (Ferreira2021Refining). The C-terminal region is largely unstructured and binds Chk1 and BRD2/4, though these activities are not essential for DNA synthesis in human cells (Ferreira2021Refining).

## Function
The TICRR gene, also known as TRESLIN, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. TICRR is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, functioning as a key substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Phosphorylation of TICRR by CDKs is crucial for the formation of TICRR-TopBP1 complexes, which are necessary for DNA replication initiation (Sansam2015Cyclindependent). This phosphorylation event is a limiting factor for S-phase progression, as it stimulates the interaction with TopBP1, a known replication and checkpoint regulator (Sansam2015Cyclindependent).

TICRR is a chromatin-associated protein, active in the nucleus, where it helps coordinate the replication machinery. It interacts with TopBP1 independently of chromatin binding, facilitating the transition from the pre-replicative complex to the pre-initiation complex (Sansam2010A). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Sansam2010A). TICRR's role in DNA replication and checkpoint regulation is vital for preventing DNA damage and ensuring normal cellular function and organismal development (Sansam2015Cyclindependent).

## Clinical Significance
The TICRR gene is clinically significant due to its role in various cancers. High expression of TICRR is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Zheng2023TICRR; Chen2023Comprehensive; Yu2019TICRR). In breast cancer, particularly aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer, elevated TICRR levels correlate with poorer overall survival (Yu2019TICRR). In LUAD, TICRR is highly expressed in tumor tissues and is linked to poor clinical outcomes, advanced tumor stages, and immune escape mechanisms (Zheng2023TICRR). 

In HCC, TICRR overexpression is associated with worse overall survival and progression-free survival, and it is considered a more sensitive and specific diagnostic marker than AFP, a classical marker for HCC (Chen2023Comprehensive). TICRR's role in tumorigenesis is attributed to its involvement in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation, where its dysregulation leads to genomic instability and cancer progression (Chen2023Comprehensive; Yu2019TICRR). The gene's interactions with proteins like TOPBP1 are crucial for maintaining DNA integrity, and disruptions in these interactions can contribute to malignancies (Sansam2010A).

## Interactions
TICRR, also known as TRESLIN, is a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and checkpoint regulation. It physically interacts with TopBP1, a key player in DNA replication and checkpoint signaling. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal BRCT domains of TopBP1 and is essential for the formation of the pre-initiation complex (pre-IC), a critical step in DNA replication (Sansam2010A). The interaction between TICRR and TopBP1 is conserved across species and occurs independently of chromatin binding, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Sansam2010A).

TICRR also interacts with MTBP, forming a complex that is involved in DNA replication initiation. This complex is present throughout the cell cycle, and its association with chromatin is regulated by the CRL4 DTL E3 ligase, which reduces the complex's chromatin association during the S phase (Wittig2021The). The degradation of TICRR, facilitated by the CRL4 DTL complex, is crucial for moderating TICRR levels and ensuring proper replication origin firing (Wittig2021The).

Additionally, TICRR interacts with CDC45, a DNA replication factor necessary for TICRR degradation during the S phase. Knockdown of CDC45 results in increased TICRR levels, indicating its role in TICRR regulation (Wittig2021The).
