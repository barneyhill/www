# AMOT

## Overview
The AMOT gene encodes the angiomotin protein, which is a key player in cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Angiomotin is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its ability to interact with various signaling molecules and structural proteins. It exists in multiple isoforms, including Amot-p80 and Amot-p130, which differ in their molecular mass and functional roles. The protein is integral to the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, where it regulates the localization and activity of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator, thereby influencing cell proliferation and contact inhibition (Moleirinho2014The). Angiomotin's interactions with other proteins, such as RhoA GTPase exchange factors, underscore its role in endothelial cell migration and stabilization, which are crucial for angiogenesis (Ernkvist2009The). Additionally, angiomotin is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels and mutations can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Moleirinho2014The; Hall2019Identification).

## Structure
The angiomotin (AMOT) protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function. It is encoded by the AMOT gene and exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the most studied being Amot-p80 and Amot-p130. Amot-p80 is a 675 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 80 kDa, while Amot-p130 is a 1084 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa. The primary structure of AMOT includes conserved domains such as glutamine-rich regions, PPxY motifs, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which is crucial for oligomerization, allowing the formation of homo- or hetero-oligomers (Wang2024Role; Moleirinho2014The).

The secondary and tertiary structures are influenced by the presence of a coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways. The N-terminal domain of Amot-p130 is associated with actin fibers, stabilizing them and influencing cell shape (Ernkvist2006p130‐Angiomotin). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination play regulatory roles, affecting the protein's interactions and functions (Moleirinho2014The). These structural elements and modifications are integral to AMOT's role in cellular processes like migration and angiogenesis.

## Function
The AMOT (angiomotin) gene encodes proteins that play a significant role in regulating cell shape, movement, and proliferation, particularly through their involvement in the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway. In healthy cells, AMOT proteins, such as Amot-p130, interact with YAP, a transcriptional co-activator, to control its subcellular localization and activity. This interaction prevents YAP from entering the nucleus and activating genes that promote cell proliferation, thereby maintaining cell contact inhibition and epithelial cell polarity (Moleirinho2014The).

AMOT proteins are also crucial in endothelial cell migration and stabilization. The p80-Amot isoform is associated with a migratory phenotype, while p130-Amot localizes to cell-cell contacts, contributing to cell stabilization (Ernkvist2008Differential). In the context of angiogenesis, AMOT proteins regulate the directional migration of endothelial cells by interacting with the RhoA GTPase exchange factor and forming complexes that control RhoA activity, essential for cell polarization and migration (Ernkvist2009The).

In the central nervous system, AMOT-130 is involved in dendritic spine maturation by stabilizing actin filaments and maintaining the integrity of the postsynaptic density, which is crucial for synaptic function and memory formation (Wigerius2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the AMOT gene, which encodes the angiomotin protein, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Mutations in specific residues, such as Arg153, are linked to gastric signet ring cell carcinoma, suggesting a role in cancer progression due to disrupted lipid binding and membrane association (Hall2019Identification). Increased expression of AMOT is observed in breast tumors, correlating with higher tumor grade, decreased survival, and metastatic disease, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Moleirinho2014The). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), AMOT is downregulated, and its decreased expression is associated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Sang2021AMOT).

AMOT also plays a role in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it can influence the activity of YAP, a transcriptional coactivator involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Depending on the context, AMOT can either promote or inhibit YAP's activity, affecting cancer progression (Lv2017Angiomotin). In gastric cancer, AMOTL1, a related protein, enhances YAP1 stability, promoting oncogenesis, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Zhou2020AMOTL1). These findings highlight the complex role of AMOT in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Angiomotin (AMOT) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cell migration and signaling pathways. AMOT interacts with the RhoA GTPase exchange factor (Rho-GEF) protein Syx, forming a ternary complex with Patj (or its paralogue Mupp1) and Syx, which regulates RhoA activity in lamellipodia. This complex is crucial for controlling local GTPase activity and directional migration of capillaries in embryos (Ernkvist2009The).

AMOT also interacts with NEDD4L through its PPxY motifs and NEDD4L's WW domains, which is essential for the release of HIV-1. The AMOT p130 isoform is specifically required for this interaction, as it can bind NEDD4L, unlike shorter isoforms like AMOT p80 (Rheinemann2021Interactions).

The PDZ-binding motif of AMOT is critical for its interactions with other proteins, such as Patj, Mupp1, and Syx. These interactions are important for endothelial cell migration and the formation of protein complexes that regulate cell motility (Ernkvist2009The; Levchenko2003Loss). AMOT's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in organizing higher-order protein complexes and influencing cell polarization and migration.
