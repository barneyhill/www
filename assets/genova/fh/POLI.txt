# POLI

## Overview
The POLI gene encodes DNA polymerase iota (Polι), a member of the Y-family of DNA polymerases, which are characterized by their ability to perform translesion synthesis, allowing DNA replication to proceed past damaged sites. Polι is distinguished by its unique structural features, including a narrower active site that facilitates non-canonical nucleotide interactions, such as Hoogsteen base-pairing, and the absence of a 3′→5′ exonuclease domain, which contributes to its low fidelity and error-prone nature (McIntyre2020Polymerase; Nair2004Replication). Despite its propensity for introducing mutations, Polι plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA repair processes, particularly base excision repair (BER) (Petta2008Human). The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence its function and localization (Plosky2006Controlling; Ashton2021DNA). Polι's involvement in DNA repair and its interactions with cellular pathways underscore its significance in cellular health and its potential implications in cancer biology (Xu2022Predicting; Gao2024DNA).

## Structure
DNA polymerase iota (Polι), encoded by the POLI gene, is a member of the Y-family of DNA polymerases. Its molecular structure is characterized by a resemblance to a right hand, comprising distinct subdomains: fingers, thumb, and palm, which form the catalytic active site (McIntyre2020Polymerase). The palm domain contains catalytic residues Asp 34, Asp 126, and Glu 127, essential for the nucleotide-transfer reaction (Nair2004Replication). The fingers domain interacts with the template base and incoming nucleotide, while the thumb domain contacts the DNA's minor groove (McIntyre2020Polymerase).

Polι's active site is narrower than other Y-family polymerases, promoting non-canonical nucleotide interactions, specifically Hoogsteen base-pairing, which involves the templating base adopting a syn conformation (McIntyre2020Polymerase; Nair2004Replication). This conformation is stabilized by interactions with the sugar-phosphate backbone and specific hydrogen bonds (Nair2004Replication).

Polι lacks a 3′→5′ exonuclease domain and includes a 'little finger' or 'wrist' domain at the C-terminus, contributing to its low processivity (McIntyre2020Polymerase). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (McIntyre2020Polymerase). Splice variant isoforms, such as those missing exon 2, result in structural and functional diversity (Aoufouchi2015129Derived).

## Function
DNA polymerase iota (POLI) is a specialized enzyme involved in translesion synthesis, a process that allows DNA replication to continue past damaged sites. POLI is characterized by its low fidelity and error-prone nature, which can introduce mutations. Despite this, it plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA repair processes. POLI is particularly involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it helps repair oxidative DNA damage. It is recruited to sites of DNA damage, interacting with the scaffold protein XRCC1, which is essential for its role in BER (Petta2008Human).

POLI is active in the nucleus and is known for its ability to incorporate guanine opposite thymine, a unique feature that contributes to its error-prone activity. This property is thought to be beneficial in certain contexts, such as somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes, which enhances immune diversity (Tissier2000polι). POLI's activity is regulated through interactions with ubiquitin, which helps control its access to DNA and prevent excessive mutagenesis (Plosky2006Controlling). Overall, POLI's functions in DNA repair and response to oxidative stress are vital for cellular health and genomic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the POLI gene, which encodes DNA polymerase iota, have significant clinical implications. In humans, eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) result in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in Pol ι, affecting its catalytic efficiency and fidelity. Notably, the R71G allele, although rare, is located within the polymerase active site and may compromise dNTP binding, potentially impacting DNA repair processes (Sweasy2006DNA).

Altered POLI expression is associated with varying prognostic outcomes in different cancers. Increased POLI expression has been linked to poorer survival in certain cancers, such as breast, stomach, and uterine cancers, while in others like pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it correlates with improved survival. This suggests that POLI's role as a prognostic factor is highly context-dependent, influenced by the tumor's transcriptomic environment (Xu2022Predicting).

In mice, a single nucleotide change in the Poli gene results in a truncated protein, leading to Pol ι deficiency. This deficiency is associated with increased sensitivity to urethane-induced lung adenomas, indicating a potential link between POLI and tumor susceptibility (Sweasy2006DNA). These findings underscore the importance of POLI in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
DNA polymerase iota (Polι) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in DNA repair and replication. Polι interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through a PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP box), which is essential for its recruitment to replication forks. This interaction is enhanced by the monoubiquitination of PCNA, facilitating translesion synthesis (TLS) during DNA damage (Bienko2005Ubiquitin-Binding; McIntyre2020Polymerase).

Polι also interacts with other Y-family polymerases, such as Rev1 and Polη. The interaction with Polη is mediated by ubiquitin-binding domains (UBMs) and is necessary for their association, while the interaction with Rev1 is weaker and its role in Polι localization is debated (McIntyre2020Polymerase).

Additionally, Polι is a substrate for the ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), interacting with both the TRAF-like and UBL1-2 domains of USP7. This interaction is crucial for the deubiquitination of Polι, which is monoubiquitinated at several lysine residues. The bipartite binding with USP7 is essential for maintaining replication fidelity (Ashton2021DNA).

In the context of cancer, Polι interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Polι stabilizes HIF-1α by recruiting USP7 to mediate its deubiquitination, highlighting a novel molecular axis involving HIF-1α, Polι, and USP7 (Gao2024DNA).
