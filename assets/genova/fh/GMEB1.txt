# GMEB1

## Overview
GMEB1, or glucocorticoid modulatory element binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis inhibition. The GMEB1 protein is a member of the KDWK family, characterized by a conserved KDWK motif that facilitates DNA binding (JimenezLara2000Cloning). It plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by acting as an endogenous inhibitor of caspase activation, thereby preventing apoptosis in human cells (Nakagawa2008GMEB1). The protein is known to interact with various cellular components, including procaspases and transcription factors, to modulate apoptotic pathways and glucocorticoid receptor activity (An2019Glucocorticoid; Tsuruma2006Glucocorticoid). GMEB1's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, underscores its significance in oncogenic processes and potential as a therapeutic target (An2019Glucocorticoid; Chen2023Transcription).

## Structure
The GMEB1 protein is a member of the KDWK family and is involved in transcriptional regulation. It is a 563-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 61 kDa, although it migrates as an 88 kDa protein on SDS-PAGE, suggesting post-translational modifications or specific amino acid regions affecting gel mobility (Kaul2000Properties). GMEB1 contains S/T-rich regions and potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase and protein kinase, as well as cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase sites, indicating possible phosphorylation as a post-translational modification (Kaul2000Properties).

The protein includes a conserved KDWK motif, which is shared with other members of the KDWK family and is involved in DNA binding (JimenezLara2000Cloning). GMEB1 can form both homo- and heterooligomers, particularly with its partner GMEB2, and these interactions are important for its function in modulating glucocorticoid receptor activity (Kaul2000Properties). A splice variant isoform of GMEB1 includes a 10-amino acid insert not present in the original rat GMEB1 or the human clone discussed (Kaul2000Properties).

## Function
GMEB1 (glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein 1) functions as an endogenous inhibitor of caspase activation and apoptosis in human cells. It interacts with the prodomains of initiator procaspases such as procaspase-2, -8, and -9, preventing their oligomerization and maturation into active caspases, which are key mediators of apoptosis (Nakagawa2008GMEB1; Tsuruma2006Glucocorticoid). This interaction disrupts the autoactivation of these caspases, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Tsuruma2006Glucocorticoid).

GMEB1 is active in both the nucleus and cytosol, where it binds to initiator procaspases, inhibiting their activation and preventing the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Tsuruma2006Glucocorticoid). This protein is crucial in protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by its ability to reduce apoptosis in response to Fas ligand in HeLa K cells and its protective role against ischemia-induced neuronal injury in transgenic mice (Tsuruma2006Glucocorticoid). GMEB1's role in modulating apoptosis highlights its importance in cellular survival and stress response mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of GMEB1 have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GMEB1 is upregulated and correlates with advanced tumor stages, larger tumor sizes, and shorter overall survival times. GMEB1 promotes HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while suppressing apoptosis. It achieves these effects by binding to the promoter region of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key effector in the Hippo signaling pathway, thereby enhancing YAP1 transcription. This interaction suggests that GMEB1 plays a significant role in the malignant progression of HCC by regulating YAP1 expression (Chen2023Transcription).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GMEB1 interacts with CFLAR L and USP40 to inhibit apoptosis. GMEB1 stabilizes CFLAR L, an apoptotic inhibitor, by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation, thus promoting cancer cell survival. Knockdown of GMEB1 in NSCLC cells leads to increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer progression by modulating apoptotic pathways (An2019Glucocorticoid).

GMEB1 also acts as an endogenous caspase inhibitor, preventing apoptosis in neuronal cells under stress conditions such as hypoxia and oxidative stress. This protective role against apoptosis suggests potential implications for conditions involving oxidative stress and hypoxia (Nakagawa2008GMEB1).

## Interactions
GMEB1 (glucocorticoid modulatory element binding protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the context of apoptosis and transcriptional regulation. GMEB1 interacts with USP40, a de-ubiquitinase, and CFLAR L, a protein involved in apoptosis regulation, to form a complex that stabilizes CFLAR L and inhibits apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. GMEB1 acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the interaction between USP40 and CFLAR L, thereby reducing CFLAR L's ubiquitination and degradation (An2019Glucocorticoid).

GMEB1 also binds to the promoter region of the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene, modulating glucocorticoid receptor transactivation. It can form a complex with GMEB-2, although no cooperative DNA binding is observed when both proteins are present (JimenezLara2000Cloning).

In addition, GMEB1 interacts with procaspase-2 through its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), inhibiting its activation and thus attenuating caspase-2-dependent apoptosis (Tsuruma2004Regulation). GMEB1's interaction with TRAF3, a member of the TNF Receptor-Associated Factors family, enhances its anti-apoptotic function, with TRAF3 modulating GMEB1's activity in a RING domain-dependent manner (Kotsaris2020TRAF3).
