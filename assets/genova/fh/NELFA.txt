# NELFA

## Overview
NELFA is a gene that encodes the protein negative elongation factor complex member A, which is a crucial component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. This protein plays a significant role in the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in human cells. As part of the NELF complex, NELFA is involved in transcriptional pausing, a regulatory mechanism that ensures precise timing and coordination of gene expression. The protein interacts with other NELF subunits and the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) to induce pausing at promoter-proximal regions, which is essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (Narita2003Human). Additionally, NELFA is implicated in the DNA damage response, contributing to genomic stability and cellular health (Xu2020The). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with various diseases, including Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome and cardiac hypertrophy, underscoring its importance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Corrêa2018Cytogenomic; Alikunju2020Acute).

## Function
NELFA, a component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, plays a critical role in regulating transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in human cells. It is involved in transcriptional pausing, a process that allows for the precise timing and coordination of gene expression. NELFA, along with other NELF subunits, binds to RNAPII and the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) to induce pausing at promoter-proximal regions, which is essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (Narita2003Human).

The NELF complex, including NELFA, is active in the nucleus and is crucial for maintaining transcriptional regulation during development and differentiation. It ensures that transcriptional elongation is paused until the appropriate signals are received, allowing for the correct expression of genes involved in various cellular processes (Narita2003Human; Liu2017Dynamic).

In addition to its role in transcriptional pausing, NELFA is implicated in the DNA damage response. It facilitates the formation of the Rad17-RFC2-5 complex, which is important for DNA repair, thereby contributing to genomic stability and cellular health (Xu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NELFA gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. NELFA is located in the critical region associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome (WHS), a genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphia, growth retardation, intellectual disability, and seizures. The haploinsufficiency of NELFA is linked to delayed cell cycle progression and altered chromatin assembly, contributing to WHS phenotypes, particularly microcephaly (Corrêa2018Cytogenomic).

In the context of cardiac health, NELFA plays a crucial role in regulating gene transcription during cardiac hypertrophy. Knockdown of NELFA in hypertrophied hearts results in ventricular dysfunction and decreased expression of essential cardiac genes, highlighting its importance in maintaining compensatory gene expression during cardiac stress (Alikunju2020Acute).

Alterations in NELFA expression have also been observed in neurodegenerative diseases. In familial Parkinson's disease, 3'UTR lengthening of the NELFA gene is noted, potentially influenced by miR-133 family miRNAs, suggesting a role in the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions (Patel2019Alternative). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NELFA in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NELFA, a component of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex, plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. Within the NELF complex, NELFA interacts with other subunits, including NELFB, NELFC/D, and NELFE, to form a stable multiprotein assembly essential for its function (Narita2003Human). NELFA is directly involved in binding to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), which are critical for pausing transcription elongation (Vos2018Structure; Narita2003Human).

The NELFA subunit contains a region necessary for interaction with RNAPII, specifically between amino acids 189 to 248, which is crucial for transcriptional repression and complex stability (Narita2003Human). NELFA also forms a flexible tentacle that stabilizes transcriptional pausing by interacting with the DSIF DNA clamp, particularly the SPT4 and SPT5 NGN domain (Vos2018Structure). This interaction is important for maintaining the paused state of RNAPII and overlaps with the binding region of TFIIF on Pol II (Vos2018Structure).

NELFA's interactions extend to nucleic acids, as it can bind nascent RNA, which may help recruit NELF to pause sites (Vos2018Structure). These interactions are essential for the regulatory functions of NELFA in transcription elongation and pausing.
