# PTGIR

## Overview
The PTGIR gene encodes the prostaglandin I2 receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular physiology. This receptor, also known as the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP), is primarily involved in mediating the effects of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. The receptor's structure is characterized by a seven-transmembrane alpha-helical configuration, typical of GPCRs, and is crucial for its function in signal transduction pathways that regulate vascular tone and platelet function (Stitham2007Arginine; Bill2014High). PTGIR's interactions with various proteins and its involvement in critical signaling pathways underscore its significance in maintaining vascular integrity and its potential as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases (Reid2015Prostacyclin).

## Structure
The PTGIR gene encodes the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) primarily involved in cardiovascular protection. The hIP receptor is composed of 386 amino acids and is characterized by a seven-transmembrane alpha-helical structure, typical of GPCRs (Stitham2007Arginine; Bill2014High). It features an extracellular N-terminus, three extracellular loops, and three intracellular loops, with a fourth cytoplasmic loop formed by palmitoylation of the intracellular C-terminal tail (Stitham2007Arginine). The receptor is stabilized by two disulfide bonds and has a molecular mass of 37-41 kDa, depending on its glycosylation state (Stitham2011Comprehensive; Bill2014High).

The hIP receptor's structure includes specific charged residues within the transmembrane domains, which are crucial for ligand binding and receptor stabilization. These residues form a charged structural core essential for the receptor's function (Stitham2007New). Mutations in these residues can lead to significant defects in receptor binding and activation, highlighting their importance in maintaining the receptor's structural integrity (Stitham2007New). The receptor's cytoplasmic domain, particularly the third intracellular loop, is vital for interactions with G-proteins and other signal transduction components (Stitham2007Arginine).

## Function
The PTGIR gene encodes the prostacyclin receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular homeostasis. This receptor is primarily expressed on platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), where it mediates vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation (Stitham2007Arginine; Martin2009Chapter). Upon activation by its ligand, prostacyclin (PGI2), the receptor couples with the Gαs subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (Reid2015Prostacyclin; Stitham2011Comprehensive). This signaling cascade results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which promotes VSMC relaxation and inhibits platelet aggregation, contributing to the maintenance of vascular integrity and blood flow (Reid2015Prostacyclin; Martin2009Chapter).

The receptor also plays a role in inhibiting VSMC proliferation and migration by affecting the cell cycle and disrupting focal adhesion formation, processes that are essential for preventing atherosclerosis and restenosis (Martin2009Chapter). Additionally, prostacyclin signaling through PTGIR is involved in pain perception and inflammatory responses, with the receptor being localized on sensory neurons (Martin2009Chapter).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTGIR gene, which encodes the prostacyclin receptor, have been implicated in several cardiovascular conditions. Rare loss-of-function mutations in PTGIR are enriched in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. These mutations can impair receptor function, leading to decreased sensitivity to prostacyclin analogues and impaired receptor maturation, which may contribute to arterial remodeling and dissection characteristic of FMD and SCAD (Georges2020Rare).

The R212C mutation in PTGIR is associated with defective receptor function, resulting in reduced cAMP production and impaired receptor activation. This mutation has been linked to an increased risk of atherothrombosis, characterized by enhanced platelet aggregation and cardiovascular events, particularly in individuals with high cardiovascular risk factors (Arehart2008Acceleration). The R212C variant is also associated with increased intima-media thickness, suggesting a potential role in vascular changes and venous thrombosis (Patrignani2008Differential).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PTGIR mutations in cardiovascular diseases, emphasizing the importance of prostacyclin signaling in maintaining vascular health and preventing thrombosis (Georges2020Rare; Arehart2008Acceleration).

## Interactions
The prostaglandin I2 receptor (PTGIR) engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function and signaling pathways. PTGIR interacts with Rab11a, a protein involved in receptor trafficking, through a Rab11 binding domain (RBD) located in its C-tail. This interaction is regulated by agonist-dependent palmitoylation, which affects the receptor's intracellular signaling and trafficking (Reid2015Prostacyclin).

PTGIR also interacts with multi-PDZ domain proteins such as PDZK1 and IKEPP. PDZK1 binds to PTGIR through a Class I PDZ ligand at the receptor's C-terminus, enhancing its expression at the plasma membrane and promoting cAMP generation. This interaction is crucial for cardiovascular health, particularly in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Reid2015Prostacyclin). IKEPP binds to PTGIR's C-terminal PDZ ligand, with the interaction increasing upon agonist activation, which may play a role in renal and vascular systems (Reid2015Prostacyclin).

These interactions highlight PTGIR's role in coordinating signaling systems and maintaining vascular integrity, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases. The receptor's ability to bind with various proteins underscores its involvement in complex cellular processes.
