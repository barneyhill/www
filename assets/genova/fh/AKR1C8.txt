# AKR1C8

## Overview
AKR1C8 is a gene that encodes the protein aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C8, which belongs to the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an oxidoreductase, catalyzing the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. The enzymatic activity of AKR1C8 is integral to various metabolic pathways, including steroid metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis, where it plays a role in modulating hormonal activity and inflammatory responses. AKR1C8 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it also contributes to cellular detoxification processes by reducing toxic aldehydes and ketones, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage. This multifaceted role underscores the importance of AKR1C8 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
AKR1C8, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, is involved in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols. This enzymatic activity is crucial for several metabolic processes, including steroid metabolism and prostaglandin synthesis. In the context of steroid metabolism, AKR1C8 contributes to the conversion of active steroids into their inactive forms, thereby regulating hormonal activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis. This regulation is essential for controlling the levels of hormones within the body, which can impact various physiological processes.

In prostaglandin synthesis, AKR1C8 plays a role in the conversion of prostaglandin intermediates, which are important for inflammatory responses and other signaling pathways. The protein's activity in these pathways highlights its significance in modulating inflammation and other cellular responses to external stimuli.

AKR1C8 is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in detoxification processes by reducing toxic aldehydes and ketones, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage. This detoxification role is vital for maintaining cellular integrity and function, especially in tissues exposed to high levels of oxidative agents. Through these molecular activities, AKR1C8 contributes to the overall health and stability of human cells.
