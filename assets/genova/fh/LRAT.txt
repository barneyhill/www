# LRAT

## Overview
The LRAT gene encodes the enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase, which is integral to retinoid metabolism, particularly in the esterification of vitamin A. This enzyme is categorized as a tail-anchored membrane protein and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of retinal pigment epithelial cells. LRAT facilitates the conversion of all-trans-retinol into retinyl esters, a crucial step for vitamin A storage and the production of 11-cis-retinal, essential for vision (Chelstowska2017Impact; Haaker2020Retinoids). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining retinoid homeostasis, supporting continuous vision, and ensuring the health of photoreceptor cells. Mutations in the LRAT gene are linked to various retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its clinical significance (Koster2021The; Dharmaraj2018Leber). Additionally, LRAT's role extends beyond ocular tissues, influencing retinoid metabolism in other areas, such as the liver and intestines, and impacting conditions like retinoid-resistant melanomas (Amann2014Knockdown; Ramkumar2021LRAT).

## Structure
The human LRAT (lecithin retinol acyltransferase) enzyme is crucial for retinoid metabolism, specifically the esterification of vitamin A. The primary structure of LRAT consists of 230 amino acids, forming a protein with a molecular weight of 25.8 kDa (Koster2021The). The secondary structure of LRAT includes an N-terminal α-helix, which is amphiphilic and interacts with lipid membranes. This α-helix is significant for the protein's stability and membrane interaction, although its exact functional role is not fully understood (Chelstowska2017Impact).

The tertiary structure of LRAT has been modeled using the crystal structure of a chimeric enzyme, which includes a catalytic subunit of HRASLS3 and LRAT's specific domain. This model aids in understanding how mutations affect the enzyme's function (Chelstowska2017Impact). The enzyme is a tail-anchored membrane protein, relying on the Get3-mediated pathway for endoplasmic reticulum insertion (Chelstowska2017Impact).

LRAT is part of the N1pC/P60 multigene family of integral membrane proteins, performing catalysis at the lipid membrane-water interface using phospholipids as substrates (Ramkumar2021LRAT). The protein's structure and function are highly conserved between species, as indicated by the similarity between mouse and human LRAT enzymes (Chelstowska2017Impact).

## Function
Lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in retinoid metabolism, particularly in the esterification of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) into retinyl esters. This process is essential for the storage of vitamin A in the liver and its conversion to 11-cis-retinal in the retina, which is vital for vision (Chelstowska2017Impact; Haaker2020Retinoids). LRAT is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, where it helps build a retinoid storage pool necessary for the production of the visual chromophore (Chelstowska2017Impact).

The enzyme's activity involves transferring an acyl moiety from phosphatidylcholine to retinol, facilitating the uptake of vitamin A from the systemic circulation into RPE cells (Chelstowska2017Impact). LRAT's function is crucial for maintaining retinoid homeostasis, supporting continuous vision, and ensuring the health of photoreceptor cells (Chelstowska2017Impact). In the intestine, LRAT regulates retinoid biosynthesis from β-carotene, coordinating a negative-feedback loop that controls retinoid levels to prevent both deficiency and excess, which can impair vision, immunity, and metabolism (Ramkumar2021LRAT). The enzyme's activity is also significant in hepatic stellate cells, where it contributes to the storage of retinyl esters in lipid droplets (Haaker2020Retinoids).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRAT gene are associated with several retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and retinitis punctata albescens (RPA). These conditions are characterized by severe visual impairments, such as night blindness, decreased visual acuity, and progressive retinal degeneration (Koster2021The; Littink2012A; Dharmaraj2018Leber). The E14L mutation in LRAT, for example, leads to accelerated proteasomal degradation of the enzyme, disrupting retinoid homeostasis and contributing to retinal degeneration (Chelstowska2017Impact).

LRAT mutations can also result in fundus albipunctatus, a condition marked by night blindness and delayed dark adaptation. This is due to biallelic mutations in the LRAT gene, which affect the visual cycle (Tan2023Fundus). In animal models, such as Lrat-deficient rats, these mutations lead to early-onset blindness and retinal thinning, providing insights into the pathophysiology of LRAT-related retinal dystrophies (Koster2021The).

Alterations in LRAT expression can also impact retinoid metabolism in non-ocular tissues. In melanoma cells, high LRAT expression is linked to retinoid resistance, while its knockdown increases sensitivity to retinoid treatment, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for retinoid-resistant melanomas (Amann2014Knockdown).

## Interactions
Lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is involved in several interactions critical for its function in vitamin A metabolism. LRAT forms a domain-swapped dimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This dimerization involves structural rearrangements that create a domain-swapped dimer with two independent catalytic domains. The active site is hydrophobically shielded by residues contributed by the dimeric partner, enhancing the stability and function of the enzyme (Golczak2014LRATspecific).

LRAT interacts with lipid membranes through a hydrophobic patch, allowing substrate accessibility without lipid extraction. This interaction is facilitated by a hydrophobic plateau domain formed by Leu- and Ile-rich fragments, which supports bilayer binding and concurrent catalytic activity (Golczak2014LRATspecific).

The E14L mutation in LRAT affects its interaction with lipid membranes by altering the N-terminal α-helix from amphiphilic to hydrophobic, potentially leading to accelerated proteasomal degradation. This mutation does not affect the enzyme's ability to esterify vitamin A but impacts its stability and concentration in cells (Chelstowska2017Impact).

LRAT also interacts with cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs), which are crucial for retinoid homeostasis, facilitating the conversion of retinol to retinyl esters (Chelstowska2017Impact).
