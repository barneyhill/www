# DAPK1

## Overview
Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The DAPK1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including a kinase domain, calcium-calmodulin binding region, ankyrin repeats, and a death domain, which collectively facilitate its diverse functional roles (Singh2016Death; Nair2013Death). As a kinase, DAPK1 is integral to signaling pathways that regulate cell death and survival, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Singh2016Death; Makgoo2023The). The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, which influence its involvement in disease mechanisms and its potential as a therapeutic target (Cohen1997DAPkinase; Shiloh2013The).

## Structure
Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of DAPK1 consists of 1430 amino acids, featuring a kinase domain, a calcium-calmodulin (CaM) binding region, 10 ankyrin repeats, two putative P loops, a cytoskeletal binding region, and a death domain (Singh2016Death; Nair2013Death).

The secondary structure of DAPK1 includes a canonical kinase fold with a small β-stranded N-terminal domain and a larger helix-rich C-terminal domain, connected by a hinge region (Singh2016Death; Shiloh2013The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the kinase domain in a 'closed', active conformation that does not require phosphorylation of an activation loop (Singh2016Death).

DAPK1's quaternary structure involves homodimerization, facilitated by a 'basic loop' of positively charged residues (Singh2016Death; Shiloh2013The). Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at Ser308, which regulates its interaction with CaM and affects its catalytic activity (Nair2013Death; Shiloh2013The). An alternatively spliced product, s-DAPK-1, lacks the kinase domain and regulates the steady-state levels of full-length DAPK1 (Singh2016Death).

## Function
Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, autophagy, and cell survival in healthy human cells. It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by promoting apoptosis, a process essential for eliminating damaged or unnecessary cells, thereby preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and potential cancer development (Makgoo2023The). DAPK1 is also a key regulator of autophagy, facilitating the degradation and recycling of cellular components, which is vital for cellular health and function (Singh2016Death).

DAPK1 is active in the cytoplasm and associated with the cytoskeleton, where it influences cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion (Cohen1997DAPkinase). Its activity is regulated by calcium/calmodulin binding, which modulates its catalytic functions and interactions with other proteins (Cohen1997DAPkinase). The kinase interacts with several proteins, including p53, to modulate its pro-apoptotic activities (Makgoo2023The). Through these interactions and regulatory mechanisms, DAPK1 plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways that control cell death and survival, contributing to organismal homeostasis (Singh2016Death).

## Clinical Significance
Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is implicated in several diseases due to its role in apoptosis and autophagy. In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), DAPK1 is overexpressed, contributing to disease pathology. In AD, it increases tau protein stability and phosphorylation, affecting tau-microtubule interactions and promoting neurofibrillary tangles. DAPK1 also enhances amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, leading to increased amyloid-beta production, a hallmark of AD (Kim2019DeathAssociated; Farag2018Death‐associated). In PD, DAPK1 overexpression is linked to synucleinopathy and dopaminergic neuron death (Kim2019DeathAssociated).

In cancer, DAPK1 often functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is frequently reduced or silenced through promoter hypermethylation, facilitating cancer progression. This silencing is observed in various tumors, making DAPK1 a potential biomarker for cancer detection and management (Huang2013Evaluating; Farag2018Death‐associated). DAPK1's role in cancer includes activating apoptotic pathways and inhibiting cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion. However, in p53-mutant cancers, DAPK1 is essential for growth, and its inhibition can suppress tumor progression (Farag2018Death‐associated).

DAPK1 is also involved in ischemic stroke, where its activation leads to neuronal cell death. Inhibition of DAPK1 has shown protective effects in stroke models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2019DeathAssociated).

## Interactions
DAPK1 (death-associated protein kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in apoptosis and autophagy. DAPK1 interacts with the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, particularly during cerebral ischemia, enhancing the conductance of NR1/NR2B receptor channels through phosphorylation of NR2B at Ser-1303. This interaction is significant in mediating brain damage during stroke (Tu2010DAPK1). DAPK1 also binds to MAP1B, a microtubule-associated protein, through a linear peptide motif. This interaction stimulates autophagy and membrane blebbing, processes that are caspase-independent and distinct from apoptosis (Harrison2008DAPK1).

The death domain of DAPK1 mediates interactions with several proteins, including ERK, which enhances DAPK1's catalytic activity, and KLHL20, which promotes DAPK1 degradation via the proteasome. It also interacts with MARK1/2, promoting microtubule destabilization, and with PKM2, enhancing glycolytic activity (Singh2016Death). In conditions of oxygen and glucose deprivation, DAPK1's interactions are dynamic, with changes in its interactome, including increased interactions with NR2B and other proteins, which exacerbate excitotoxicity by increasing calcium influx into neurons (DeGregorioRocasolano2020Comparative).
