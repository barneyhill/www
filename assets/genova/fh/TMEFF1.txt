# TMEFF1

## Overview
TMEFF1, or transmembrane protein with EGF-like and two follistatin-like domains 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as tomoregulin-1. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, and a short intracellular tail. The extracellular domain features two Kazal-like domains and an EGF-like domain, which are involved in signaling pathways, as well as two follistatin-like domains that contribute to the protein's stability and function (Chan2024Human; Harms2003Tomoregulin1). TMEFF1 is predominantly expressed in brain cortical neurons, where it plays a critical role in restricting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection by interacting with the cell-surface receptor NECTIN-1 (Chan2024Human). Additionally, TMEFF1 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Nie2019TMEFF1). The protein's interactions and functional roles in both viral defense and oncogenesis make it a significant subject of study in biomedical research.

## Structure
The TMEFF1 protein, also known as tomoregulin-1, is a transmembrane protein characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular segment, a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal intracellular segment (Chan2024Human). The extracellular region contains two Kazal-like domains and an EGF-like domain, which is homologous to growth factors in the EGF family, except for a substitution of arginine at site 39 with histidine (Nie2019TMEFF1). This EGF-like domain can weakly stimulate the phosphorylation of erbB4, indicating its functional role in signaling pathways (Nie2019TMEFF1).

The protein also includes two follistatin-like domains, which are conserved regions that may contribute to its structural stability and function (Harms2003Tomoregulin1). The cytoplasmic tail of TMEFF1 is short and conserved, but it is dispensable for its nodal inhibitory activity, suggesting that the protein's functional interactions occur primarily at the extracellular level (Harms2003Tomoregulin1).

TMEFF1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including potential glycosylation, which may influence its stability and interactions with other proteins (Nie2024ST14). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various receptors and signaling molecules, playing roles in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Function
The TMEFF1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in brain cortical neurons, where it plays a crucial role in restricting herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. TMEFF1 functions as a restriction factor by interacting with the cell-surface HSV-1 receptor NECTIN-1, impairing the fusion of HSV-1 glycoprotein D with NECTIN-1, and thereby blocking viral entry into the cell (Chan2024Human). This interaction is specific to the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to the brain's intrinsic immunity against HSV-1 (Chan2024Human).

The protein's extracellular domain is responsible for this interaction, and its presence on the cell surface is essential for its function. In cases of TMEFF1 deficiency, HSV-1 can rapidly enter cortical neurons, leading to increased viral replication (Chan2024Human). The ectopic expression of full-length TMEFF1 or its amino-terminal extracellular domain can enhance resistance to HSV-1 infection in NECTIN-1-expressing cells (Chan2024Human).

TMEFF1's role is specific to the CNS, and its deficiency does not affect viral diseases outside this system. The protein's function is contrasted with other genetic deficiencies affecting antiviral mechanisms in the brain, such as TLR3-IFN and RIPK3 (Chan2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEFF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of viral infections and cancer. TMEFF1 acts as a restriction factor for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the brain. Deficiencies or mutations in TMEFF1 can lead to increased susceptibility to HSV-1 infection, contributing to conditions such as herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Studies have identified rare homozygous variants in TMEFF1 in patients with severe HSE, suggesting that these mutations may disrupt the protein's ability to interfere with viral entry into neurons (Chan2024Human). TMEFF1 interacts with NECTIN-1, a receptor for HSV-1, and its deficiency enhances viral fusion and entry, increasing viral replication in cortical neurons (Chan2024Human).

In the context of cancer, TMEFF1 has been associated with tumor promotion in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). It is highly expressed in EOC tissues and is linked to advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. TMEFF1 promotes tumor proliferation, invasion, and migration while inhibiting apoptosis. It is involved in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth and survival, and is regulated by mutant p53, a common mutation in various cancers (Nie2019TMEFF1). These findings suggest that TMEFF1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in both viral infections and cancer.

## Interactions
TMEFF1, a transmembrane protein, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function in various biological processes. One significant interaction is with NECTIN-1, a cell-surface receptor for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). TMEFF1 interacts with NECTIN-1 to impair the fusion of HSV-1 glycoprotein D with NECTIN-1, thereby blocking viral entry into cortical neurons and acting as a restriction factor against HSV-1 infection in the brain (Chan2024Human).

TMEFF1 also interacts with the Cripto coreceptor, a member of the EGF-CFC family, which is crucial for nodal signaling. TMEFF1 binds directly to Cripto, inhibiting nodal signaling by preventing the formation of a functional receptor complex necessary for this pathway. This interaction is specific, as TMEFF1 does not bind directly to nodal or the ALK4 receptor (Harms2003Tomoregulin1).

In the context of ovarian cancer, TMEFF1 interacts with ST14, a transmembrane serine protease. This interaction is associated with increased tumor malignancy and poor prognosis, as it promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The interaction between TMEFF1 and ST14 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization studies (Nie2024ST14).
