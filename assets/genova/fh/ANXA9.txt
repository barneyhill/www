# ANXA9

## Overview
Annexin A9 (ANXA9) is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A9, a member of the annexin family known for its role in phospholipid binding and membrane-cytoskeleton interactions. Unlike other annexins, annexin A9 has evolved to function independently of calcium, due to the loss of its calcium-binding sites (Fernandez2017Novel; Moss2004Theannexins). This protein is predominantly involved in cellular processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and membrane organization, contributing to the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Boczonadi2012Annexin). Annexin A9 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, where it influences pathways related to cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhou2024ANXA9; Salom2019Frequent). The gene's expression and interactions with other proteins, such as periplakin and S100A4, underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Boczonadi2012Annexin; Zhou2024ANXA9).

## Structure
Annexin A9 (ANXA9) is a member of the annexin family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal core domain consisting of four homologous annexin (ANX) domains, each approximately 68-70 amino acids long (Salom2019Frequent; Moss2004Theannexins). These domains typically contain calcium-binding motifs, although ANXA9 has lost these sites due to evolutionary divergence, resulting in calcium-independent interactions (Fernandez2017Novel; Moss2004Theannexins). 

The primary structure of ANXA9 includes a unique N-terminal region that contributes to its functional specificity and interactions with other proteins (Salom2019Frequent). The secondary structure of ANXA9 is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, which fold into a compact, globular form in the tertiary structure (Moss2004Theannexins). 

ANXA9 does not typically form quaternary structures but can interact with other proteins, such as periplakin, a cytoskeletal linker protein, indicating its role in membrane-targeted cytoskeletal complexes (Boczonadi2012Annexin). The presence of a conserved KGD motif in the D-E loop suggests potential calcium-independent binding interactions with various cellular components (Fernandez2017Novel). These structural features contribute to ANXA9's functional roles in cellular processes and its involvement in cancer progression (Zhou2024ANXA9).

## Function
Annexin A9 (ANXA9) is a member of the annexin family, which is characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. In healthy human cells, ANXA9 is involved in membrane-cytoskeleton interactions and plays a role in keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to the formation of the epidermal barrier. It co-localizes with periplakin in membrane-targeted cytoskeletal linker protein complexes, particularly in epithelial cells and differentiating keratinocytes (Boczonadi2012Annexin). ANXA9 is up-regulated during keratinocyte differentiation, becoming more associated with the Triton-insoluble membrane and cytoskeletal fraction, although its expression does not depend on periplakin (Boczonadi2012Annexin).

Structurally, ANXA9 is an ancient duplicated relative of annexin A2, with all four calcium-binding sites eradicated by evolutionary selection, indicating significant divergence from other annexins (Moss2004Theannexins). Despite this divergence, ANXA9 maintains its role in membrane organization and cellular processes such as endocytosis and vesicle transport, typically requiring calcium ions (Boczonadi2012Annexin). These functions suggest that ANXA9 is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating membrane-related processes in epithelial tissues.

## Clinical Significance
ANXA9 (annexin A9) is implicated in various cancers, notably breast cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). In breast cancer, ANXA9 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, motility, and invasion, while its downregulation increases apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth and metastasis (Zhou2024ANXA9). ANXA9 interacts with S100A4, influencing the AKT/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation (Zhou2024ANXA9). The miR-186-5p/ANXA9 signaling pathway also plays a role in breast cancer, where miR-186-5p acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting ANXA9, leading to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth (Wang2023miR186ANXA9).

In HNSCC, ANXA9 expression is altered, with downregulation observed in 42% of cases. Its expression is associated with the degree of tumor differentiation, being more prevalent in well-differentiated tumors and oropharyngeal locations (Salom2019Frequent). These findings suggest that ANXA9's expression and interactions are significant in the pathogenesis and progression of these cancers.

## Interactions
Annexin A9 (ANXA9) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with periplakin, a member of the plakin family of cytoskeletal linker proteins. This interaction is particularly evident in membrane-targeted cytoskeletal linker protein complexes. ANXA9 co-localizes with periplakin at cell borders in MCF-7 cells, and this association persists even after the disruption of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by Okadaic acid, which leads to the formation of keratin8/18 clusters containing both proteins (Boczonadi2012Annexin).

In the context of breast cancer, ANXA9 interacts with the protein S100A4, influencing the AKT/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating apoptosis and promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. ANXA9 acts as an upstream regulator of S100A4, affecting its expression and facilitating its transfer into the tumor microenvironment, which in turn promotes angiogenesis and metastasis (Zhou2024ANXA9).

ANXA9 is also a target of miR-186-5p, a microRNA that suppresses its expression. This interaction is significant in breast cancer, where miR-186-5p downregulation of ANXA9 is associated with increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation (Wang2023miR186ANXA9).
