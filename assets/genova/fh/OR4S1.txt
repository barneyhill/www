# OR4S1

## Overview
The OR4S1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily S member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules within the olfactory epithelium, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. Beyond its olfactory functions, OR4S1 is expressed in the male reproductive system, where it is implicated in processes such as sperm maturation and chemotaxis, potentially influencing fertilization (Milardi2018Olfactory). Despite its established roles in olfaction and reproduction, the full spectrum of OR4S1's physiological functions and its clinical significance in human health and disease remain areas of active research (Vogrinc2021Genetic; Olaniyan2021Ovarian).

## Function
The OR4S1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in detecting odor molecules. In healthy human cells, OR4S1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory responses. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4S1 is also expressed in the male reproductive tract, including seminal plasma, sperm cells, testis, and epididymis. Proteomic analysis has identified OR4S1 on the surface of sperm cells, particularly in the acrosome, midpiece, and flagellum, suggesting a role in sperm maturation and migration (Milardi2018Olfactory).

The expression of OR4S1 in testicular tissue is mainly localized in spermatocytes and spermatids, and its presence is reduced in cases of spermatocyte maturation arrest, indicating a potential involvement in sperm development (Milardi2018Olfactory). OR4S1 may also play a role in sperm chemotaxis during fertilization, as olfactory receptors are known to mediate chemotactic signals that guide spermatozoa towards the egg (Olaniyan2021Ovarian). However, the exact physiological function of OR4S1 in healthy human cells remains not fully elucidated (Milardi2018Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4S1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1483121, in OR4S1 has been linked to an increased risk of AD, although the precise clinical implications of this association remain unclear (Vogrinc2021Genetic). 

In a study on non-familial cardiomyopathies, a deletion in the OR4S1 gene was identified in a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricle dysplasia. However, the study concluded that there was no evidence supporting a clinical role for OR4S1 in the patient's condition, as the probabilities of loss of intolerance (pLI) did not support its involvement (Refaat2019Nonfamilial).

Additionally, a genome-wide association study on cervical dystonia identified potential associations involving OR4S1, but no definitive conclusions about its clinical significance were drawn (Mok2013Genomewide). Overall, while OR4S1 has been implicated in various studies, its direct clinical significance in disease remains to be fully elucidated.
