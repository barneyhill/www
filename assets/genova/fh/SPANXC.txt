# SPANXC

## Overview
SPANXC is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SPANX family, specifically SPANX family member C. This protein is primarily expressed in testicular tissue and is involved in chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. As a cancer-testis antigen, SPANXC exhibits a restricted expression pattern, predominantly in the testis, suggesting specialized roles in reproductive biology and potential implications in immune privilege within the testicular environment (Westbrook2004Genomic). The protein's interactions with nucleocytoskeletal components, such as Lamin A/C, underscore its importance in maintaining nuclear structure and function, particularly in the context of cancer cell invasion (Maine2016The). Additionally, SPANXC has been implicated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and metastasis (Kouprina2005Dynamic; Wang2019Hypomethylation‐activated). The gene's clinical significance extends to reproductive health, as deletions involving SPANXC are linked to conditions such as premature ovarian failure (Vitek2011Xq; autosome).

## Function
SPANXC is a member of the SPANX gene family, which is primarily expressed in testicular tissue and plays a role in spermatogenesis. The protein is associated with chromatin remodeling, contributing to sperm maturation and motility. In healthy human cells, SPANXC is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it is involved in processes related to reproductive biology (Westbrook2004Genomic). The SPANX proteins, including SPANXC, share consensus nuclear localization signals, indicating their involvement in nuclear functions, although the specific molecular activities within the nucleus are not fully understood (Westbrook2004Genomic).

SPANXC's expression is typically restricted to the testis, which is characteristic of cancer-testis antigens. This restricted expression pattern suggests that SPANXC may have specialized roles in testicular function, potentially related to the immune-privileged environment of the testis (Westbrook2004Genomic). The protein's involvement in chromatin remodeling and its presence in the nucleus suggest a role in regulating gene expression during spermatogenesis, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The localization and function of SPANXC in healthy cells underscore its importance in reproductive processes, particularly in the context of sperm development and function (Westbrook2004Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
SPANXC, a member of the SPANX gene family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SPANXC is frequently activated, which is linked to promoter hypomethylation. This activation correlates with poorer prognosis in patients. Functional studies have shown that SPANXC promotes cell migration and invasion, and its overexpression in cell lines enhances metastatic potential. The mechanism involves interaction with the ROCK1 protein, which is associated with tumor metastasis (Wang2019Hypomethylation‐activated).

In prostate cancer, the SPANX gene cluster, including SPANXC, is located at a susceptibility locus. Although no direct mutations in SPANXC have been linked to prostate cancer, its deregulated expression may contribute to the disease. Genomic rearrangements at the SPANX locus could release SPANXC from transcriptional control, potentially leading to malignancy (Kouprina2007Mutational; Kouprina2005Dynamic).

SPANXC is also associated with premature ovarian failure (POF) due to a deletion at Xq27.2, which includes the SPANX gene family. This deletion may result in haploinsufficiency, contributing to reproductive issues (Vitek2011Xq; autosome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SPANXC in cancer and reproductive health.

## Interactions
SPANX-C, a member of the SPANX gene family, is known to interact with nucleocytoskeletal proteins, particularly Lamin A/C. This interaction is crucial for the structural stability of the nucleus and is necessary for the proper localization of SPANX-C within the nucleus of breast cancer cells. The interaction between SPANX-C and Lamin A/C has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques. In the context of breast cancer, SPANX-C's interaction with Lamin A/C is essential for promoting cell invasion, as depletion of Lamin A/C results in reduced invasion into the extracellular matrix (Maine2016The).

SPANX-C is also involved in the formation of long cellular protrusions (LCPs) during collective invasion, which are necessary for reorganizing the extracellular matrix to facilitate cell movement. The interaction with Lamin A/C is required for the induction of these protrusions, although it is not necessary for the formation and severing of F-actin or small transient actin-rich protrusions (Maine2016The). These interactions suggest that SPANX-C plays a significant role in modulating nuclear functions and cellular structures that are critical for invasive behavior in cancer cells.
