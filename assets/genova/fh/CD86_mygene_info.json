superfamily. This protein is expressed by antigen-presenting cells, and it is the ligand for two proteins at the cell surface of T cells, CD28 antigen and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4. Binding of this protein with CD28 antigen is a costimulatory signal for activation of the T-cell. Binding of this protein with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 negatively regulates T-cell activation and diminishes the immune response. Alternative splicing results in several transcript variants encoding different isoforms.[provided by RefSeq, May 2011].", "symbol": "CD86", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1413243"}, "unigene": "Hs.171182", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P42081", "TrEMBL": ["A8K632", "A0A0X9R4E0", "C9JXS1", "H7C4F8"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "CD86"}}
