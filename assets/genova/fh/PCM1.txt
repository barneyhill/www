# PCM1

## Overview
The PCM1 gene encodes the pericentriolar material 1 protein, a crucial component of the centrosome involved in the organization and function of centriolar satellites. This protein plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed, by facilitating the assembly and retention of proteins within centriolar satellites. PCM1 is characterized by its multiple coiled-coil regions, which enable interactions with various proteins, and it is essential for anchoring microtubules to the centrosome, thereby maintaining the radial microtubule network. The protein's interactions with other centrosomal proteins, such as Mib1 and CEP290, underscore its importance in cellular processes and its potential involvement in ciliopathies and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Mutations in the PCM1 gene have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance in brain morphology and function (Datta2008A; Balczon1994PCM1; Chakravarthy2013A; Wang2016Tethering).

## Structure
The PCM1 protein is a centrosome autoantigen with a molecular mass of approximately 228 kDa, encoded by an open reading frame of 6,072 nucleotides, translating into 2,024 amino acids (Balczon1994PCM1). The primary structure of PCM1 includes a consensus nucleotide-binding site from amino acids 1,167-1,174, corresponding to the ATP/GTP-binding motif (Balczon1994PCM1). The protein sequence is rich in glutamic acid, comprising 11.4% of the residues, and features acidic domains separated by a basic region, with a slightly basic isoelectric point (pI) of 8.09 (Balczon1994PCM1).

PCM1 contains multiple coiled-coil regions, which facilitate self-aggregation and interaction with other proteins (Kubo2003Nonmembranous). The C-terminal region of PCM1 is suggested to suppress self-aggregation, potentially influencing the size of PCM-1 granules (Kubo2003Nonmembranous). During the cell cycle, PCM1 undergoes changes in cellular distribution, dispersing throughout the cytoplasm during telophase and re-aggregating in the perinuclear region in early G1 phase (Balczon1994PCM1).

PCM1 is involved in forming non-membranous granular organelles known as PCM-1 granules, which are associated with centriolar satellites and fibrous granules (Kubo2003Nonmembranous). These granules disassemble during mitosis, possibly due to mitotic phase-specific phosphorylation (Kubo2003Nonmembranous).

## Function
PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of centriolar satellites, which are essential for ciliogenesis in human cells. PCM1 is involved in the assembly and retention of proteins within centriolar satellites, facilitating the proper formation of cilia. In the absence of PCM1, centriolar satellites are disrupted, leading to defects in ciliogenesis due to the mislocalization of proteins from satellites to centrioles (Wang2016Tethering).

PCM1 also plays a role in microtubule organization by anchoring microtubules to the centrosome, which is crucial for maintaining the radial microtubule network. This function is separate from microtubule nucleation, as PCM1 does not directly participate in this process. Instead, it facilitates the correct assembly and localization of other centrosomal proteins, such as centrin, pericentrin, and ninein, which are necessary for centrosome integrity and function (Dammermann2002Assembly).

PCM1's interaction with proteins like Mib1 is vital for regulating the abundance of centrosomal proteins and promoting ciliogenesis. By tethering Mib1 to centriolar satellites, PCM1 prevents the destabilization of proteins essential for cilium assembly (Wang2016Tethering).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PCM1 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. A specific threonine to isoleucine missense mutation in PCM1 is strongly associated with schizophrenia, suggesting that this mutation may alter the gene's structure and function, contributing to the disorder (Datta2008A). PCM1 interacts with proteins such as DISC1, which are crucial for neuronal cell growth, and disruptions in these interactions may lead to abnormal cell division and regeneration in the central nervous system, potentially contributing to schizophrenia (Datta2008A).

The PCM1 gene is also involved in maintaining ciliary integrity, and its dysfunction can lead to structural ciliary defects, which are associated with behavioral abnormalities and resistance to antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia (Monroe2020PCM1). Studies have shown that PCM1 variants, particularly loss of function and hypomorphic variants, are significantly associated with schizophrenia, especially in individuals with minimal responsiveness to antipsychotic treatments (Monroe2020PCM1).

Additionally, PCM1-associated schizophrenia patients exhibit specific brain volumetric changes, such as reduced orbitofrontal cortex grey matter, compared to non-PCM1-associated patients, indicating a potential link between PCM1 mutations and brain morphology in schizophrenia (Datta2008A).

## Interactions
PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1) is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in ciliogenesis and centrosome function. PCM1 interacts with several centriolar satellite proteins, including Mib1, Cep290, Cep131, Cep72, and OFD1, serving as a platform for assembling centriolar satellites (Wang2016Tethering). It specifically interacts with Cep90 and C2CD3 through domains overlapping with Cep131 and OFD1-binding regions (Wang2016Tethering). PCM1 also tethers the E3 ligase Mib1 to centriolar satellites, preventing its accumulation at centrioles, which is essential for maintaining centriolar satellite integrity and promoting ciliogenesis (Wang2016Tethering).

PCM1's interaction with CEP290 is significant in the context of ciliopathies. CEP290 binds to PCM1 and affects its distribution, suggesting a role in a specific molecular pathway involving PCM1 and BBS4 (Kim2008CEP290). PCM1 is also involved in the regulation of a membrane-trafficking pathway mediated by Rab8, which is coordinated with ciliary axoneme assembly (Kim2008CEP290).

In Alzheimer's disease research, PCM1 has been shown to interact with β-amyloid (Aβ1-42) oligomers, suggesting a potential role in modulating Aβ1-42 aggregation (Chakravarthy2013A). This interaction was observed in transgenic mouse models, indicating PCM1's involvement in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Chakravarthy2013A).
