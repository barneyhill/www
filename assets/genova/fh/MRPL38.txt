# MRPL38

## Overview
The MRPL38 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L38, which is a vital component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (39S). This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation, facilitating the synthesis of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy production. As a structural protein, MRPL38 contributes to the core architecture of the ribosome's central protuberance, ensuring proper interaction with the small subunit and mitochondrial transfer RNAs. While its function is not conserved in lower organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MRPL38 is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis in higher organisms, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Jian2018Exome; Key2023Translation). Variants in the MRPL38 gene have been implicated in neurological conditions and cancer, underscoring its clinical relevance (Jian2018Exome; Bacon2024Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MRPL38 gene encodes the mitochondrial 39S ribosomal protein L38, a critical component of the large subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes. This protein is essential for the assembly of mitochondrial DNA-coded proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation, a process crucial for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Jian2018Exome). MRPL38 maintains the core architecture of the large subunit's central protuberance, which interacts with the small subunit and mitochondrial transfer RNAs bound to the ribosome, playing a vital role in mitochondrial translation (Jian2018Exome).

In healthy human cells, MRPL38 is involved in mitochondrial translation processes, where it is part of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and interacts with translation factors like GFM1. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial protein synthesis and assembly, especially under conditions where normal proteolytic processes are disrupted (Key2023Translation). MRPL38 is also part of a protein cluster that serves as a docking site for tRNA Val or tRNA Phe in mitochondria, indicating its role in tRNA integration and translation fidelity (Key2023Translation). The protein's function is not phylogenetically conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting a specific role in higher organisms (Key2023Translation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPL38 gene have been associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain magnetic resonance imaging, which are indicative of cerebral small vessel disease and linked to age-related neurological disorders such as stroke and dementia (Jian2018Exome). Specifically, low-frequency nonsynonymous variants in MRPL38, such as rs34136221 and rs9191, have been identified. These variants are predicted to be deleterious to protein function and are associated with changes in white matter, potentially contributing to neurological diseases (Jian2018Exome). The A allele of rs34136221 results in an arginine to tryptophan change, while the G allele of rs9191 changes aspartic acid to histidine, both of which are predicted to impact protein function (Jian2018Exome).

Additionally, a pathogenic 5'UTR deletion in MRPL38 has been linked to mitochondrial disease, characterized by a severe reduction in mitochondrial translation rate. This defect was shown to be reversible by re-expressing wild-type MRPL38, highlighting its clinical significance in mitochondrial function (Kopajtich2021Integration). These findings suggest that MRPL38 variants may play a role in the pathophysiological changes in white matter and mitochondrial disorders, providing insights into the genetic basis of related neurological conditions (Jian2018Exome; Kopajtich2021Integration).

## Interactions
MRPL38, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large 39S subunit, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. It is involved in maintaining the core architecture of the large subunit's central protuberance, interacting with the small subunit and mitochondrial transfer RNAs (Jian2018Exome). This interaction is essential for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, which are vital for mitochondrial function and energy production.

The MRPL38 gene has been associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the brain, with specific variants like rs34136221 and rs9191 being identified as potentially deleterious to protein function. These variants are in complete linkage disequilibrium and have been predicted to impact the protein's role in mitochondrial translation (Jian2018Exome). The study suggests that these variants may contribute to pathophysiological changes in white matter, indicating a broader role for MRPL38 in neurological health (Jian2018Exome).

In cancer research, MRPL38 has shown varying roles depending on the cancer type. In lung and colorectal cancers, it is associated with fewer metastatic lesions, while in ovarian cancer, higher MRPL38 expression correlates with increased metastatic capacity (Bacon2024Mitochondrial). These findings suggest that MRPL38's interactions and functions are complex and context-dependent.
