# C16orf74

## Overview
C16orf74 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein known as calcimembrin (CLMB). This protein is characterized by its association with cell membranes, facilitated by lipid modifications such as N-myristoylation and S-acylation, which are essential for its stability and function (Bradburn2024A). Calcimembrin is involved in cellular signaling processes, particularly through its interaction with calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+-calmodulin activated protein phosphatase. The protein contains specific motifs, PxIxIT and LxVP, which are crucial for binding to CN and modulating its activity (Bradburn2024A). C16orf74 is implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and bladder cancer, where it plays a role in cell proliferation and survival through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Sato2017Molecular; Lin2020A). The gene's expression and interaction with other proteins make it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Structure
The C16orf74 protein, also known as calcimembrin (CLMB), is a small, disordered protein that associates with cell membranes through lipid modifications, specifically N-myristoylation at glycine 2 (G2) and S-acylation at cysteines 7 and 14 (C7 and C14) (Bradburn2024A). These modifications are crucial for its membrane association and stability (Bradburn2024A). The protein does not have a predicted transmembrane domain (Nakamura2016Overexpression).

C16orf74 forms homodimers, as indicated by native PAGE analysis showing bands at 60 and 120 kDa, suggesting dimer formation (Kushibiki2020Role). The dimerization is facilitated by the S-S binding site at C7 and C14 (Kushibiki2020Role). The first 15 amino acids of the protein are considered a 'structural site' that regulates dimer formation and membrane localization (Kushibiki2020Role).

The protein contains a novel composite motif, LxVPxIxIT, which is crucial for binding to calcineurin (CN) and subsequent dephosphorylation (Bradburn2024A). Phosphorylation at threonine 44 (T44) enhances binding to CN and is necessary for maximal binding affinity (Bradburn2024A). The interaction with CN involves the PxIxIT and LxVP sequences, which are essential for the protein's function (Bradburn2024A). C16orf74 has three transcriptional variants, with the V1 variant being highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines (Nakamura2016Overexpression).

## Function
The C16orf74 gene encodes the protein calcimembrin (CLMB), which plays a significant role in cellular signaling processes, particularly in its interaction with calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+-calmodulin activated protein phosphatase. CLMB contains specific motifs, PxIxIT and LxVP, that facilitate its binding to CN, directing it to membranes and influencing CN signaling. The PxIxIT motif allows CLMB to bind CN independently of Ca2+ signals, while the LxVP motif associates with the active enzyme to promote catalysis (Bradburn2024A).

CLMB undergoes lipid modifications, including N-myristoylation and S-acylation, which are crucial for its stability and membrane association. These modifications enable CLMB to recruit CN to membranes, where it can engage in multimeric dephosphorylation processes. The phosphorylation state of CLMB, particularly at threonine 44, enhances its binding to CN, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that is sensitive to the relative levels of CN and CLMB (Bradburn2024A).

In healthy human cells, CLMB's function is linked to its ability to modulate CN signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes. The dynamic nature of its lipidation and phosphorylation suggests that CLMB plays a role in the spatial and temporal regulation of CN activity (Bradburn2024A).

## Clinical Significance
C16orf74 has been implicated in several cancers, notably pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and bladder cancer. In PDAC, C16orf74 is highly expressed and contributes to cancer cell proliferation and invasion through its interaction with calcineurin (CN). This interaction is crucial for activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which supports cancer cell survival and proliferation. Inhibition of the C16orf74/CN interaction using a cell-permeable dominant-negative peptide (DN-C16orf74) has shown promise in reducing tumor growth and proliferation in vitro and in animal models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for PDAC (Sato2017Molecular).

In bladder cancer, the expression level of C16orf74 has prognostic significance. Lower expression of C16orf74 is associated with a worse prognosis, and its expression is negatively correlated with DNA methylation levels. This suggests that hypermethylation of C16orf74 may lead to decreased expression and poorer outcomes for patients (Lin2020A). Additionally, C16orf74 is regulated by miRNAs, such as miR-296-5p, which may promote hepatocellular carcinoma development by decreasing C16orf74 levels (Lu2015Abnormal). These findings highlight the gene's potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
The C16orf74 protein, also known as calcimembrin (CLMB), is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It forms homodimers and interacts with integrin proteins, specifically integrin αVβ3, integrin αV, and integrin αIIb, which are crucial for controlling the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade. This interaction is essential for PDAC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration (Kushibiki2020Role).

C16orf74 also interacts with calcineurin (CN), a Ca2+-calmodulin activated protein phosphatase. This interaction is mediated by a composite motif, LxVPxIxIT, within C16orf74, which facilitates binding and dephosphorylation by CN. The PxIxIT motif provides high-affinity binding, while the LxVP motif is necessary for dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation at threonine 44 enhances this interaction (Bradburn2024A).

Inhibition of C16orf74 interactions with CN and integrin β3 using designed peptides, such as DN-C16orf74 and 11R-DB, has been shown to suppress PDAC cell proliferation and invasion by disrupting these interactions and reducing phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR (Sato2017Molecular; Kushibiki2020Role).
