# RTP3

## Overview
RTP3, or receptor transporter protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport and functional regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within human cells. The RTP3 protein is categorized as a receptor transporter, playing a crucial role in the trafficking of GPCRs to the cell surface, thereby facilitating their involvement in signal transduction processes. This protein is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it aids in cellular communication and response to external stimuli. RTP3 has been associated with the localization of bitter taste receptors, suggesting its importance in enhancing the expression of certain GPCRs on the plasma membrane (He2020RTP4). Additionally, RTP3 has been implicated in the progression of metabolic and liver diseases, such as metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where its expression levels are altered (Liao2021A). Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of RTP3's functions, particularly in antiviral defense and immune signaling, remains an area of active research (Boys2021Functionalgenomic).

## Function
RTP3 (receptor transporter protein 3) is involved in the transport and proper functioning of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human cells. It assists in the trafficking of these receptors to the cell surface, facilitating their role in signal transduction. RTP3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, contributing to cellular communication and response to external stimuli. While the specific function of RTP3 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, it is known to colocalize with bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) and improve their plasma membrane localization (He2020RTP4). This suggests a role in enhancing the cell-surface expression of certain GPCRs, which are crucial for various physiological processes, including taste perception and immune signaling.

In mammals, RTP3 has shown signatures of positive selection in certain species, such as bats, rodents, and primates, indicating a potential role in antiviral defense (Boys2021Functionalgenomic). However, the specific antiviral mechanisms or functions of RTP3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated. The protein's involvement in immune signaling and receptor regulation suggests it may play a part in broader cellular processes beyond its known roles in receptor trafficking.

## Clinical Significance
RTP3 (receptor transporter protein 3) has been implicated in the progression of metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Studies have shown that RTP3 is one of the hub genes with altered expression in these conditions. Specifically, RTP3 expression is higher in NASH and simple steatosis compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in disease states (Liao2021A). However, the expression of RTP3 does not significantly differ between NASH and simple steatosis, indicating that while it may be involved in the disease process, it is not a distinguishing factor between these two conditions (Liao2021A).

The role of RTP3 in MASH is further supported by its inclusion in a predictive model for the disease, which demonstrated good performance in distinguishing MASH from simple steatosis (Liao2021A). Despite its potential as a biomarker, the specific clinical utility of RTP3, in terms of mutations or interaction changes, requires further investigation (Liao2021A). The study highlights the need for noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosing MASH, as current methods are either invasive or not specific enough (Liao2021A).
