# TEX12

## Overview
TEX12 is a gene that encodes the testis-expressed 12 protein, which is a meiosis-specific protein integral to the formation and function of the synaptonemal complex (SC) during meiosis. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil structure, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, notably SYCE2, to form a fibrous assembly within the SC. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination, processes essential for successful meiotic division and fertility. TEX12 is expressed predominantly in germ cells and is absent in somatic tissues, underscoring its specialized role in meiosis. Disruptions in TEX12 function can lead to infertility due to synapsis failure and improper chromosome segregation. Additionally, TEX12 has been implicated in centrosome dysfunction in certain cancers, where it is classified as a cancer-testis antigen, suggesting potential roles beyond meiosis (Davies2012Structural; Dunce2022Coiledcoil; Bellil2021Human).

## Structure
TEX12 is a meiosis protein that plays a crucial role in the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil structure, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as SYCE2, to form a fibrous assembly within the SC (Dunce2022Coiledcoil; Dunce2020Structural). 

The core of TEX12, comprising amino acids 49-123, is responsible for its dimerization and interaction with SYCE2, forming a stable homodimer primarily due to its α-helical core (Dunce2022Coiledcoil). TEX12 can exist in different oligomeric states, including dimers and tetramers, with the wild-type forming a 17 kDa dimer and certain mutants forming tetramers (Dunce2022Coiledcoil). The dimeric form of TEX12 is described as a rod-like structure with a length of 90 Å, arranged in an antiparallel configuration (Dunce2022Coiledcoil).

The C-terminal tip (Ctip) of TEX12 is crucial for its structural configuration and oligomeric state, influencing the transition from a 2:2 complex to a 4:4 complex and further into fibrous structures (Dunce2022Coiledcoil). Mutations in the Ctip, such as ΔCtip and LFIL, affect the stability and conformation of TEX12, leading to changes in its oligomeric state (Dunce2022Coiledcoil). The structural diversity of TEX12 allows it to participate in various cellular functions, including its role in centrosome function during meiosis and in certain cancers (Dunce2022Coiledcoil).

## Function
TEX12 is a meiosis-specific protein that plays a critical role in the formation and stabilization of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein structure essential for chromosome synapsis and recombination during meiosis. In healthy human cells, TEX12 is localized to the central element of the SC, where it is involved in holding homologous chromosomes together, facilitating meiotic recombination and crossover formation (Davies2012Structural; Bellil2021Human). The protein forms a homodimer, and its interaction with SYCE2, another SC protein, is crucial for the assembly of the SC. This interaction leads to the formation of an octameric complex, which is significant for chromosome pairing and recombination (Davies2012Structural).

TEX12 is expressed specifically in germ cells and is not detectable in somatic tissues, highlighting its specialized role in meiosis (Boroujeni2018Expression). The absence of TEX12 results in synapsis failure, leading to infertility due to improper chromosome segregation (Davies2012Structural; Boroujeni2018Expression). This protein is essential for the structural integrity of the SC, ensuring successful meiotic division and fertility in humans (Bellil2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the TEX12 gene are associated with reproductive issues, particularly infertility. TEX12 is crucial for the proper assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a structure essential for meiosis. Disruption in TEX12 function can lead to synapsis failure, which impairs meiotic recombination and crossing-over, resulting in infertility (Davies2012Structural; Boroujeni2018Expression). In males, TEX12-null mice exhibit a failure of chromosomal synapsis, leading to infertility, while females experience the loss of ovarian follicles (Bellil2021Human).

In humans, significant down-regulation of TEX12 has been observed in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia, a condition characterized by a lack of sperm in the ejaculate due to impaired spermatogenesis (Boroujeni2018Expression). This suggests that normal TEX12 expression is essential for early stages of spermatogenesis. Although TEX12 expression was not significantly different in men with maturation arrest compared to controls, its critical role in meiosis implies that any disruption could contribute to spermatogenic failure (Boroujeni2018Expression).

TEX12 is also aberrantly expressed in certain cancers, where it is linked to centrosome dysfunction and poor prognosis, classifying it as a cancer-testis antigen (Dunce2022Coiledcoil).

## Interactions
TEX12 is a meiosis protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC) by interacting with SYCE2. This interaction is essential for the assembly and function of the SC, which facilitates homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis. The SYCE2-TEX12 complex forms a hetero-octameric assembly, where SYCE2 tetramers bind two TEX12 dimers through specific interactions between their N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively (Davies2012Structural). 

The interaction between SYCE2 and TEX12 is highly stable and constitutive, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses (Davies2012Structural). TEX12 also forms homodimers and can exist in tetrameric forms, with its structure influenced by its C-terminal tip, which is crucial for its conformational stability and interaction with SYCE2 (Dunce2022Coiledcoil). 

In addition to its role in the SC, TEX12 is recruited to meiotic centrosomes and has been implicated in centrosome dysfunction in certain cancers, suggesting potential SYCE2-independent roles (Dunce2022Coiledcoil).
