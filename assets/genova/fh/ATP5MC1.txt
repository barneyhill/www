# ATP5MC1

## Overview
ATP5MC1 is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 1, a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is integral to the F0 portion of ATP synthase, which is involved in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP synthase complex is responsible for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy carrier in cells, by facilitating the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This proton translocation is essential for generating the electrochemical gradient that drives ATP production. The ATP5MC1 gene, therefore, plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism, supporting various energy-dependent biological processes necessary for cell survival and function (GuerreroCastillo2021Multiplexed; Yao2020Split).

## Structure


## Function
ATP5MC1 encodes a subunit of ATP synthase, a critical enzyme located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is part of the F0 complex, which is essential for the process of oxidative phosphorylation. During this process, ATP5MC1 facilitates the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial membrane. This proton movement is crucial as it generates the electrochemical gradient necessary for ATP synthesis, the primary energy currency of the cell. By driving ATP production, ATP5MC1 plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism and contributes to maintaining energy homeostasis within the organism. The activity of ATP5MC1 in the mitochondria is fundamental to the energy needs of cells, supporting various biological functions and processes that require ATP. This includes muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and biosynthetic reactions, all of which are energy-dependent processes critical for the survival and proper functioning of human cells.

## Interactions
ATP5MC1 is involved in protein-protein interactions within the ATP synthase complex, specifically contributing to the formation of the F0 portion of the enzyme. This interaction is crucial for the proton translocation that drives ATP synthesis. The SIMPL system has demonstrated that ATP5MC1 can physically interact with itself, suggesting potential homodimerization or oligomerization, which may play a role in its function within the ATP synthase complex (Yao2020Split).

The ATP5MC1 subunit is part of a larger protein complex, ATP synthase, which is essential for ATP production in mitochondria. Although specific interactions of ATP5MC1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role within the ATP synthase complex implies interactions with other subunits necessary for the enzyme's assembly and function. The complexome profiling studies have identified challenges in detecting ATP5MC1, indicating potential difficulties in studying its interactions using certain methods (GuerreroCastillo2021Multiplexed).

Overall, ATP5MC1's interactions are primarily within the context of the ATP synthase complex, contributing to its structural and functional integrity, although detailed interaction partners outside this complex are not specified in the available data.
