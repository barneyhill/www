# GATD3

## Overview
The GATD3 gene encodes the protein glutamine amidotransferase class 1 domain containing 3, which is a mitochondrial deglycase enzyme. This enzyme is integral to cellular health, primarily by preventing the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that can lead to cellular dysfunction. The protein is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a role in mRNA maturation, stabilization, and protein translation, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial gene expression processes (Smith2022GATD3A). The enzyme's activity relies on conserved catalytic cysteine residues, which facilitate the removal of non-enzymatic chemical modifications from biomolecules, thus maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and protecting against oxidative damage (Smith2022GATD3A). The evolutionary conservation of GATD3 highlights its essential function in cellular metabolism and defense against glycation stress (Smith2022GATD3A).

## Structure


## Function
The GATD3 gene encodes a mitochondrial deglycase enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular health by preventing the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in human cells. This protein is primarily localized within the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with mitochondrial mRNA and translation machinery, suggesting its involvement in mRNA maturation and stabilization, as well as protein translation (Smith2022GATD3A). GATD3 functions by removing non-enzymatic chemical modifications, specifically AGEs, which are formed between amino groups of biomolecules and dicarbonyl byproducts from glucose and lipid oxidation (Smith2022GATD3A).

The enzyme's activity is dependent on conserved catalytic cysteine residues, which are crucial for its amidolytic function, allowing it to deglycate DNA and protein species chemically modified with reactive dicarbonyls like glyoxal and methylglyoxal (Smith2022GATD3A). This deglycase activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and preventing oxidative damage, particularly in tissues with high expression of the gene, such as heart tissue (Smith2022GATD3A). The evolutionary conservation of GATD3 from gammaproteobacteria underscores its fundamental role in cellular metabolism and protection against glycation stress (Smith2022GATD3A).
