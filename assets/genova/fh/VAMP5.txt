# VAMP5

## Overview
VAMP5, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein family, specifically categorized as an R-SNARE protein. The VAMP5 protein is integral to intracellular transport and membrane trafficking, particularly within muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in muscle fiber differentiation and regeneration. It is predominantly expressed in type IIa fast-twitch muscle fibers and is involved in processes such as exosome release and the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), which is vital for glucose uptake. VAMP5's unique interaction profile, which includes forming complexes with various Q-SNARE proteins, distinguishes it from other VAMPs by not mediating membrane fusion with certain plasma membrane t-SNAREs. This specificity underscores its role in cellular communication and molecular transport, with implications in both physiological and pathological contexts, such as muscle function and glioma prognosis (Matsui2023VAMP5; Takahashi2012The; Hasan2010Fusogenic).

## Structure
VAMP5 is a member of the synaptobrevin/VAMP protein family, consisting of 102 amino acids. It features a 23-residue hydrophobic domain near the carboxyl terminus, which likely functions as a membrane anchor (Zeng1998A). The N-terminal 70-residue sequence is predicted to be on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, while the carboxyl-terminal nine-residue sequence is oriented in the lumen of intracellular membrane compartments or exposed to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (Zeng1998A). The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain can potentially form coiled-coil structures (Zeng1998A).

VAMP5 is identified as an R-SNARE protein, containing a SNARE domain and a transmembrane region, but no other specific domains (Matsui2023VAMP5). It is involved in exosome release, interacting with various Q-SNARE proteins, including SNAP47, and Qa-SNAREs such as STX1A, STX1B, and STX4 (Matsui2023VAMP5). VAMP5 does not mediate membrane fusion with plasma membrane t-SNAREs syntaxin1/SNAP-25 or syntaxin4/SNAP-25, distinguishing it from other VAMPs in terms of fusogenic activity (Hasan2010Fusogenic). The protein is associated with the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicular structures, particularly in muscle cells (Hasan2010Fusogenic).

## Function
VAMP5, a member of the SNARE protein family, plays a significant role in intracellular transport and membrane trafficking, particularly in muscle cells. It is involved in the differentiation of muscle fibers and is preferentially expressed in type IIa fast-twitch muscle fibers, where its expression increases during muscle regeneration and myogenesis (Zeng1998A; Takahashi2012The). VAMP5 is associated with the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, suggesting its involvement in vesicle-mediated protein transport and membrane trafficking (Zeng1998A).

In skeletal muscle, VAMP5 partially colocalizes with glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), indicating a potential role in GLUT4 translocation, which is crucial for glucose uptake (Takahashi2012The). In cardiac muscle, VAMP5 is localized near intercalated discs, suggesting a role in cell-cell junctions (Takahashi2012The).

VAMP5 is also implicated in exosome release, a process essential for cell communication. It forms SNARE complexes with SNAP47 and either Syntaxin 1 or Syntaxin 4, facilitating the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane, thereby regulating exosome release (Matsui2023VAMP5). This function highlights VAMP5's role in cellular communication and molecular transport.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VAMP5 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In gliomas, VAMP5 is up-regulated and linked to poorer prognosis. A prognostic risk model incorporating VAMP5 expression levels has shown that patients with higher VAMP5 expression tend to have worse survival outcomes. This model also correlates high VAMP5 expression with older age, higher tumor grades, and specific genetic markers such as IDH wild-type status and 1p19q non-codeletion, suggesting its potential role in tumor biology and as a biomarker for glioma prognosis (Yin2023Construction).

In cardiac tissues, VAMP5 expression is elevated in diabetic mouse models, particularly those on a high-fat diet. This increase may be related to changes in the heart's contractile profile during early stages of diabetes, possibly as a compensatory mechanism for reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The exact role of VAMP5 in cardiac function remains unclear, but its altered expression suggests it may be involved in the trafficking of glucose or fatty acid transporters, which are relevant in the context of insulin resistance (Bowman2019Cardiac).

## Interactions
VAMP5 interacts with various SNARE proteins to mediate specific cellular processes. It forms a ternary complex with SNAP47 and Qa-SNAREs such as STX1A, STX1B, and STX4, which is crucial for exosome release from HeLa cells (Matsui2023VAMP5). VAMP5 also interacts with Qb-SNARE Vti1B and Qbc-SNAREs SNAP23, SNAP25, and SNAP47, with SNAP47 showing the strongest interaction. The knockdown of SNAP47 in HeLa cells results in reduced exosome markers and numbers, similar to the effects observed with VAMP5 knockout, indicating a collaborative role in exosome release (Matsui2023VAMP5).

Despite its interactions with these SNARE proteins, VAMP5 does not mediate membrane fusion with plasma membrane t-SNAREs such as syntaxin1/SNAP-25 or syntaxin4/SNAP-25, distinguishing it from other VAMPs (Hasan2010Fusogenic). This unique interaction property suggests that VAMP5 has specific biological roles that differ from other VAMPs, particularly in processes like exosome release rather than typical vesicle fusion events (Hasan2010Fusogenic). VAMP5's interactions are also implicated in the basal retention of GLUT4, suggesting a role in intracellular sorting and retention of substrate transporters (Schwenk2010Requirement).
