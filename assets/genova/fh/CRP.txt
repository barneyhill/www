# CRP

## Overview
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a gene that encodes the C-reactive protein, a pentameric protein belonging to the pentraxin family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system. The CRP gene is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is upregulated in response to inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Volanakis2001Human; Sproston2018Role). The protein product of the CRP gene functions as a pattern recognition molecule, binding to phosphocholine on the surface of dead or dying cells and certain pathogens, thereby facilitating their clearance through the activation of the classical complement pathway and interaction with immune cell receptors (Volanakis2001Human; Du2000Function). CRP's ability to modulate immune responses and its involvement in various inflammatory processes make it a significant biomarker for inflammatory diseases and cardiovascular conditions (Hage2007CReactive; Sproston2018Role).

## Structure
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric protein composed of five identical subunits, each consisting of 206 amino acids. The primary structure of CRP includes a single polypeptide chain with two methionine residues, resulting in three cyanogen bromide fragments (Oliveira1977Primary). The secondary structure is characterized by two antiparallel beta sheets forming a flattened jellyroll topology, with a long alpha-helix (residues 168-176) folded against one of the beta sheets (Volanakis2001Human; Szalai1997Creactive). 

The tertiary structure of CRP features a compact hydrophobic core and a deep cleft associated with ligand-binding sites, including the C1q-binding site and the PCh-binding site, which involves two calcium ions and a hydrophobic pocket (Volanakis2001Human; Szalai1997Creactive). The quaternary structure is a cyclic pentamer, with the subunits arranged symmetrically around a central pore, forming a disc-like shape (Volanakis2001Human; Oliveira1977Primary).

CRP lacks N-glycosylation sites and carbohydrates, and it contains a disulfide bond between positions 36 and 98 (Kilpatrick1991Molecular). The protein's structure allows it to bind phosphocholine in a calcium-dependent manner, crucial for its role in immune response (Volanakis2001Human).

## Function
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a key component of the innate immune system, primarily synthesized in the liver in response to inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Volanakis2001Human; Sproston2018Role). CRP is a member of the pentraxin family and functions as a pattern recognition molecule, binding to phosphocholine on damaged cell membranes and certain pathogens in a calcium-dependent manner (Volanakis2001Human; Du2000Function). This binding facilitates the activation of the classical complement pathway by interacting with C1q, leading to opsonization and enhanced phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Volanakis2001Human; Sproston2018Role).

CRP also interacts with Fc receptors on immune cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and TNF, which enhance the inflammatory response (Du2000Function; Sproston2018Role). In addition to its role in inflammation, CRP is involved in the clearance of nuclear antigens and damaged membranes, suggesting a scavenging function important for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Du2000Function). CRP's ability to recognize altered self and foreign molecules provides early defense and helps activate the adaptive immune system (Du2000Function).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CRP gene can significantly impact its expression levels and are associated with various diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CRP levels do not reliably indicate disease activity due to the inhibitory effects of Type I interferons, particularly IFN-α, which downregulate CRP transcription. This is compounded by specific CRP gene polymorphisms, such as rs1205, which are linked to lower CRP levels and an increased risk of SLE and cardiovascular events (Marnell2005Creactive; Enocsson2021The).

CRP gene polymorphisms also influence cardiovascular disease risk. Variants like the -717G>A and +1444C>T polymorphisms affect CRP levels, with the latter associated with higher CRP levels in response to stressors such as exercise and surgery, potentially impacting coronary heart disease pathogenesis (Brull2003Human). Elevated CRP levels, influenced by genetic predisposition, are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (Hage2007CReactive).

In addition, CRP interacts with immune system components, such as complement inhibitors and Fc receptors, which can modulate immune responses and influence disease outcomes in conditions like lupus nephritis, a severe manifestation of SLE (Enocsson2021The).

## Interactions
C-reactive protein (CRP) is known for its interactions with various proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in immune response modulation. CRP binds to Fcγ receptors on immune cells, such as monocytes and neutrophils, with a particular affinity for the FcγRIIa receptor. This interaction is allele-specific, with CRP showing higher binding affinity to the R-131 allele compared to the H-131 allele (Stein2000Creactive). CRP also binds to FcγRI with a higher affinity than IgG, and this binding is inhibited by IgG1 (Marnell2005Creactive).

CRP's interaction with Fcγ receptors triggers intracellular signaling pathways similar to those initiated by IgG, leading to cellular responses such as increased phagocytosis and cytokine production (Marnell2005Creactive). CRP also binds to the human type I IgA receptor FcαRI (CD89), inducing activation of ERK and cytokine production in transfected cells (lu2012pentraxins).

CRP interacts with nuclear antigens, including chromatin and snRNPs, which are major targets in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This binding may help prevent autoimmunity by masking autoantigens or enhancing their clearance (Marnell2005Creactive).
