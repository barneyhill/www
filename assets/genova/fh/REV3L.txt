# REV3L

## Overview
REV3L is a gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta (Pol ζ), a B-family DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis (TLS), a critical DNA damage tolerance process. The protein product of REV3L, known as the REV3-like, DNA-directed polymerase zeta catalytic subunit, plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and replication by allowing the bypass of DNA lesions that could otherwise stall replication forks, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Ræder2018APIMMediated; Martin2019DNA). This protein is characterized by several conserved motifs, including B-family DNA polymerase motifs and zinc-finger motifs, which are essential for its function (Gan2007DNA). REV3L interacts with other proteins, such as REV7 and PCNA, to form an active polymerase complex, highlighting its importance in DNA damage response and chromosomal stability (Ræder2018APIMMediated; Tomida2015REV7). Mutations in REV3L have been linked to various developmental disorders and cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (ZHU2016REV3L; Halas2021Developmental).

## Structure
The human REV3L gene encodes a protein that is significantly larger than its yeast homolog, Rev3, due to an additional exon encoding 1388 amino acids. The primary structure of mammalian REV3L includes regions of sequence similarity with yeast Rev3, such as the N-terminal region, the Rev7 binding region, and the DNA polymerase domain. The polymerase domain shares approximately 39% sequence identity with the yeast counterpart (Gan2007DNA).

REV3L contains six conserved B-family DNA polymerase motifs and two zinc-finger motifs in the C-terminal region, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair and replication (Gan2007DNA). The protein also features an AlkB homolog 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM), which is important for its interaction with PCNA, a key player in DNA replication and repair processes (Ræder2018APIMMediated).

REV3L exists in two isoforms, synthesized from the same gene via alternative translation initiation sites. The long isoform is 3130 amino acids long, while the short isoform is 3052 amino acids long, with the latter containing a mitochondrial localization signal at the N-terminus (Singh2015Human). This localization signal is crucial for the protein's mitochondrial functions (Singh2015Human).

## Function
The REV3L gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta (Pol ζ), which is crucial for translesion synthesis (TLS), a process that allows DNA replication to continue past damaged sites. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability by preventing replication fork stalling and allowing cells to bypass DNA lesions that would otherwise impede replication (Ræder2018APIMMediated; Martin2019DNA). REV3L is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in DNA repair and mutagenesis, impacting cell survival and development (Singh2015Human).

In healthy human cells, REV3L is involved in error-free TLS over UV-induced DNA lesions, interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to facilitate this process (Ræder2018APIMMediated). The interaction between REV3L and PCNA is crucial for the function and specificity of Pol ζ in TLS, helping to maintain genomic stability by repairing UV-induced DNA damage without introducing mutations (Ræder2018APIMMediated).

REV3L also plays a role in maintaining chromosomal stability, particularly at common fragile sites, and is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Bhat2013Rev3). Its activity is critical for cell viability, as its disruption can lead to genomic instability, cell death, or senescence (Martin2019DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the REV3L gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In developmental contexts, a homozygous mutation in REV3L has been associated with developmental delay and hypotrophy, potentially due to its impact on DNA repair mechanisms (Halas2021Developmental). In the context of Möbius syndrome, de novo mutations in REV3L have been linked to facial paralysis and limb abnormalities, with studies showing that these mutations can lead to significant neural structure hypoplasia and increased DNA damage responses (TomasRoca2015De).

In cancer, REV3L mutations have been associated with increased susceptibility to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Specific single nucleotide variants in REV3L have been linked to a higher risk of NSCLC in certain populations (Jamwal2020REV3L). In ESCC, REV3L is upregulated and associated with lymph node metastasis and chemoresistance, suggesting its role in cancer progression (ZHU2016REV3L). Additionally, REV3L mutations have been found in cisplatin-resistant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, where they may confer sensitivity to the drug dacomitinib (Huang2016Exome).

## Interactions
The REV3L protein, a catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that facilitate its role in DNA repair and replication. REV3L interacts with the accessory subunit REV7 (also known as MAD2L2), forming part of the active polymerase zeta complex. This interaction is crucial for DNA damage tolerance, as it helps prevent spontaneous chromosome breaks and confers resistance to UV radiation and cisplatin (Tomida2015REV7). REV3L also contains an AlkB homolog 2 PCNA interacting motif (APIM), which is essential for its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This interaction is important for the function and specificity of POLζ in translesion synthesis (TLS), allowing DNA replication over lesions (Ræder2018APIMMediated).

The APIM sequence in REV3L is vital for its affinity to PCNA, and mutations in this sequence can reduce colocalization with PCNA, although REV3L can still interact with PCNA through other subunits like POLD2 and POLD3 (Ræder2018APIMMediated). REV3L also interacts with proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair, DNA damage response, and TLS, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies (Ræder2018APIMMediated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of REV3L in maintaining genomic stability.
