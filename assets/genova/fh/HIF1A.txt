# HIF1A

## Overview
The HIF1A gene encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) protein, a crucial component of the HIF-1 transcription factor complex, which plays a significant role in cellular response to hypoxia. HIF-1α is a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) protein, characterized by its ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins, facilitating the transcription of genes that enable adaptation to low oxygen conditions (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS; Wang1995Hypoxia-inducible). The protein is regulated through oxygen-dependent degradation, allowing it to accumulate and activate target genes under hypoxic conditions (Kunej2021Integrative). HIF-1α is involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, metabolism, and erythropoiesis, and is implicated in several pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Semenza2000Expression; Gladek2017HIF1A).

## Structure
The HIF1A gene encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) protein, which is a key component of the HIF-1 transcription factor complex. HIF-1α is a basic-helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) protein, characterized by its bHLH domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, and its PAS domain that is crucial for protein-protein interactions and environmental signal sensing (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS; Wang1995Hypoxia-inducible). The protein is composed of 826 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 93 kDa, although it appears as a 120 kDa protein on denaturing gels, indicating post-translational modifications (Wang1995Hypoxia-inducible).

HIF-1α contains several functional domains, including N-terminal and C-terminal transactivation domains (N-TAD and C-TAD), which are essential for its transcriptional activity. The C-TAD interacts with co-activators like CBP/p300, while the N-TAD stabilizes the protein against degradation (Kunej2021Integrative). The protein also includes an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD), which overlaps with the N-TAD and regulates protein stability through hydroxylation and ubiquitination (Jamali2020Prediction; Kunej2021Integrative).

HIF-1α forms a heterodimer with HIF-1β (ARNT), a process mediated by the bHLH and PAS domains, creating a functional transcription factor complex that binds to hypoxia response elements in target genes (Semenza1997Structural; Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS). The tertiary structure of the PAS domains is conserved, featuring a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS). The protein's C-terminal region is intrinsically disordered, allowing interaction with multiple partners and contributing to its functional versatility (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS).

## Function
The HIF1A gene encodes the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) subunit, a critical component of the HIF-1 transcription factor complex. HIF-1α plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) by regulating the expression of genes involved in various physiological processes. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated and targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, preventing its accumulation and activity. However, in hypoxic conditions, this degradation is inhibited, allowing HIF-1α to stabilize, dimerize with the HIF-1β subunit, and translocate to the nucleus (Gladek2017HIF1A; Kunej2021Integrative).

In the nucleus, HIF-1α binds to hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) in the DNA, activating the transcription of target genes that facilitate adaptation to hypoxia. These genes are involved in processes such as angiogenesis, metabolism, and erythropoiesis, including the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) (Prior2003Sequence; Semenza2000Expression). HIF-1α is essential for maintaining oxygen and glucose homeostasis, and its activity is crucial for vascular development and integrity, as well as for the cellular response to hypoxic stress (Semenza2000Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HIF1A gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. In cancer, HIF1A is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and cell survival. This overexpression is linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor prognosis, as seen in multiple cancer types, including breast, lung, colorectal, and renal cell carcinoma (Chen2020HIF1A; Gladek2017HIF1A). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HIF1A, such as rs11549465 and rs11549467, have been associated with increased cancer risk and are frequently studied for their roles in these associations (Kunej2021Integrative).

Beyond cancer, HIF1A variability is linked to cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction. HIF1A expression is crucial for promoting reperfusion in ischemic conditions (Gladek2017HIF1A). In the context of maternal diabetes, HIF1A haploinsufficiency can lead to significant cardiac defects in offspring, including left ventricle dysfunction and structural remodeling of the myocardium (Cerychova2018Adverse). Additionally, HIF1A mutations and dysregulation are implicated in metabolic disorders, systemic sclerosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Kunej2021Integrative).

## Interactions
HIF1A, also known as hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It forms a heterodimer with ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) to create the active HIF-1 complex, which is essential for the transcriptional response to hypoxia (PerezPerri2016The). HIF1A interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), which targets it for degradation under normoxic conditions through a process involving proline hydroxylation (Ivan2001HIFα). This interaction is regulated by prolyl-4-hydroxylases, which hydroxylate specific proline residues on HIF1A, facilitating its recognition by pVHL (Ivan2001HIFα).

HIF1A also interacts with components of the TIP60 complex, including Reptin, Pontin, and TRRAP, which are recruited to chromatin under hypoxic conditions to facilitate the expression of HIF1A target genes (PerezPerri2016The). Additionally, HIF1A is known to interact with transcriptional coactivators such as p300/CBP, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Medina2012Searching). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein associations that enable HIF1A to regulate gene expression in response to oxygen levels.
