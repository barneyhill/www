# FBXO48

## Overview
FBXO48 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 48, a member of the F-box protein family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is responsible for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. F-box protein 48 functions as a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The protein has been implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways, particularly through its interaction with AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk), and has potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, as well as in cancer progression and resistance (Perez‐Añorve2019New; Manasa2024Investigating). Despite its involvement in these critical pathways, the full spectrum of FBXO48's biological functions and clinical significance remains an active area of research.

## Clinical Significance
The FBXO48 gene has been investigated for its potential role in various diseases, although its clinical significance remains under study. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a study involving Chinese Han patients found no mutations in the coding region of FBXO48, suggesting that mutations in this gene may play little or no role in the development of PD (Xiu2013Genetic). In the context of Huntington's disease (HD), FBXO48 is involved in the degradation of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (pAmpkα). Inhibiting FBXO48 can prevent this degradation, potentially offering neuroprotective effects by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and reducing gluconeogenesis, which may be beneficial in managing HD symptoms (Manasa2024Investigating).

FBXO48 has also been mentioned in studies on autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where it is located in a region associated with copy number variations (CNVs). However, its haploinsufficiency is not considered a major contributor to the clinical features observed in ASD cases (Oikonomakis2016Recurrent). In Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), FBXO48 is associated with insulin signaling and metabolism, but its specific role in the disease's clinical manifestations is not fully understood (van2022Clinical).

## Interactions
FBXO48 is a member of the F-box protein family, which functions as a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In the context of Huntington's disease, FBXO48 interacts with AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk), specifically targeting the active, phosphorylated form of Ampkα (pAmpkα) for polyubiquitylation and degradation. This interaction is significant because Ampk is a central regulator of metabolic pathways, and its activation has been shown to protect against neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (Manasa2024Investigating).

In breast cancer cells, FBXO48 is highlighted as an up-regulated gene associated with the loss-of-function of miR-122, a microRNA involved in maintaining survival networks in radioresistant cells. This suggests a potential role for FBXO48 in cellular processes related to cancer progression and resistance (Perez‐Añorve2019New).

While FBXO48 is mentioned in studies of the F-box gene family, specific interactions of FBXO48 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond those mentioned are not detailed in the available context (Fin2017The; Wang2014Evolution).
