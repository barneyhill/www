activation. The complement pathway plays an essential role in the innate and adaptive immune response. The encoded protein is synthesized as a zymogen and is activated when it complexes with the pathogen recognition molecules of lectin pathway, the mannose-binding lectin and the ficolins. This protein is not directly involved in complement activation but may play a role as an amplifier of complement activation by cleaving complement C2 or by activating another complement serine protease, MASP-2. The encoded protein is also able to cleave fibrinogen and factor XIII and may may be involved in coagulation. A splice variant of this gene which lacks the serine protease domain functions as an inhibitor of the complement pathway. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Apr 2010].", "symbol": "MASP1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1417036"}, "unigene": "Hs.89983", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P48740", "TrEMBL": ["F8W876", "C9JLU5", "C9J1C7", "C9JMA2"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "MASP1 (protein)"}}
