# KIF2B

## Overview
KIF2B is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 2B, which is part of the kinesin-13 family of motor proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to depolymerize microtubules, a critical function during mitosis for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability (Hirokawa2011From; Manning2007The). KIF2B is primarily localized to centrosomes, spindle microtubules, and kinetochores, where it plays a pivotal role in spindle assembly and chromosome movement (Manning2007The). The protein's activity is regulated through interactions with other proteins, such as Cep170 and SKAP, and through post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which are essential for its function in correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (Welburn2012The; Hood2012Plk1). Alterations in KIF2B expression or function have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Yang2021Identification).

## Structure
KIF2B is a member of the kinesin-13 family, characterized by a conserved motor domain that binds to microtubules and facilitates movement through ATP hydrolysis (Hirokawa2011From). The primary structure of KIF2B includes regions that are crucial for its function, such as the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, which show greater diversity compared to the conserved motor domain (Welburn2012The). The C-terminal region is particularly important for its interaction with the microtubule-binding protein Cep170, which aids in targeting KIF2B to the mitotic spindle (Welburn2012The).

KIF2B undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is significant for its regulation during mitosis. Phosphorylation sites are primarily located in regions N- and C-terminal to the motor domain, with one site within the motor domain itself (Hood2012Plk1). These modifications are crucial for KIF2B's role in correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (Hood2012Plk1).

The protein may also undergo conformational changes similar to KIF2C, which are associated with its depolymerization activity. The binding of SKAP to KIF2B's N-terminal may disrupt its 'closed' conformation, potentially converting it to an 'open' conformation, regulating its activity (Qin2016Phosphorylation).

## Function
KIF2B is a member of the kinesin-13 family of motor proteins, which are crucial for microtubule depolymerization during mitosis. This protein plays a significant role in regulating microtubule dynamics, particularly at the mitotic spindle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells (Manning2007The). KIF2B localizes to centrosomes, spindle microtubules, and kinetochores, where it contributes to spindle assembly and chromosome movement (Manning2007The).

KIF2B interacts with proteins such as Cep170, which enhances its localization to the mitotic spindle and activates its depolymerase activity, crucial for spindle assembly and chromosome movement (Welburn2012The). It also forms complexes with CLASP1 and astrin, acting as a molecular switch to regulate kinetochore-microtubule dynamics, which is essential for mitotic progression and fidelity (Manning2010CLASP1).

Phosphorylation of KIF2B by kinases such as Plk1 is vital for its function, influencing its microtubule depolymerization activity and localization to kinetochores, which is necessary for correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors (Hood2012Plk1). These activities ensure accurate chromosome segregation and prevent mitotic defects, contributing to the overall stability of the genome (Manning2007The).

## Clinical Significance
KIF2B is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in chromosome segregation and mitotic processes. Alterations in KIF2B expression have been observed in several cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), KIF2B is significantly upregulated, suggesting its potential as a molecular therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker (Yang2021Identification). In lung adenomas induced by oncogenic K-Ras in mice, increased expression of KIF2B enhances tumor growth, although it does not initiate tumorigenesis. This suggests that KIF2B influences tumor growth dynamics in the presence of oncogenic factors (Laucius2019Chromosomal).

KIF2B's role in maintaining chromosomal stability is crucial, as disruptions can lead to chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of many cancers. Proper regulation of KIF2B is essential for correcting kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors during mitosis. Mutations or altered phosphorylation of KIF2B can result in increased chromosomal missegregation, contributing to cancer progression (Hood2012Plk1). KIF2B's interaction with proteins like Cep170 is also vital for its localization and function during mitosis, and disruptions in these interactions could potentially lead to mitotic errors and associated diseases (Welburn2012The).

## Interactions
KIF2B interacts with several proteins that play crucial roles in mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. It forms mutually exclusive complexes with CLASP1 and astrin, which are essential for regulating kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) stability. KIF2B and astrin do not co-precipitate, indicating separate complexes with CLASP1. The presence of astrin affects KIF2B's localization at kinetochores, with KIF2B persisting on kinetochores in astrin-deficient cells during metaphase (Manning2010CLASP1). 

KIF2B also interacts with the microtubule-binding protein Cep170, which aids in targeting KIF2B to the mitotic spindle. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal domain of KIF2B and provides additional microtubule-binding activity (Welburn2012The). 

Additionally, KIF2B interacts with SKAP, a protein involved in mitotic chromosome segregation. SKAP specifically binds to KIF2B but not to KIF2C, and this interaction is crucial for regulating microtubule dynamics. The coiled-coil domain in SKAP is responsible for binding to the C-terminus of KIF2B, and phosphorylation of SKAP by GSK3β enhances this interaction, inhibiting KIF2B's depolymerase activity (Qin2016Phosphorylation).
