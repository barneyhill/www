# LSS

## Overview
The LSS gene encodes the enzyme lanosterol synthase, a crucial component of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Lanosterol synthase is a monotopic membrane protein that catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol, the first sterol in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. This enzyme is integral to maintaining cellular membrane integrity and is involved in the production of steroid hormones and vitamin D. The LSS gene is highly conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in various biological processes, including eye health, where it helps prevent cataract formation by maintaining lens transparency (Besnard2019Biallelic; Zhao2015Lanosterol). Mutations in the LSS gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, such as autosomal-recessive hypotrichosis simplex and congenital cataracts, underscoring its importance in human health (Zhao2021Defect; Romano2018Biallelic).

## Structure
Lanosterol synthase (LSS) is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the conversion of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol. The primary structure of LSS consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function (Romano2018Biallelic). The tertiary structure of LSS is a three-dimensional conformation that is crucial for its enzymatic activity, forming an active site cavity essential for ligand binding (Romano2018Biallelic). 

LSS contains specific domains, including the oxidosqualene cyclase domain, which is integral to its function in cholesterol biosynthesis (Besnard2019Biallelic). The protein is a monotopic membrane protein, meaning it is inserted into the membrane without spanning the lipid bilayer (Besnard2019Biallelic). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, potentially affecting the enzyme's activity and regulation. LSS may also form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on this aspect are limited. Splice variant isoforms of LSS can exist, which might influence its function and regulation (Wada2020Metabolic).

## Function
The LSS gene encodes lanosterol synthase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway, which is essential for the production of cholesterol and other sterols in the body (Wada2020Metabolic; Besnard2019Biallelic). This process occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is vital for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and producing steroid hormones and vitamin D (Romano2018Biallelic).

Lanosterol synthase is a membrane-bound enzyme, and its activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and transparency of the lens in the human eye. Lanosterol, the product of the LSS enzyme, is enriched in the lens and plays a significant role in preventing protein aggregation, a major factor in cataract formation (Zhao2015Lanosterol). The enzyme's function is also important for skin and hair health, as it contributes to cholesterol synthesis in these tissues, which is necessary for maintaining skin barrier integrity and normal hair growth (Wada2020Metabolic). The LSS gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in these biological processes (Besnard2019Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LSS gene, which encodes lanosterol synthase, are associated with several clinical conditions due to their impact on cholesterol biosynthesis. Biallelic mutations in LSS can lead to autosomal-recessive hypotrichosis simplex (HS), characterized by hair loss, as well as congenital cataracts, a leading cause of blindness in children (Zhao2021Defect; Romano2018Biallelic). These mutations disrupt the enzyme's ability to convert (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene to lanosterol, affecting cholesterol homeostasis and leading to clinical manifestations such as hypotrichosis and cataracts (Wada2020Metabolic; Romano2018Biallelic).

LSS mutations are also linked to a rare neuroectodermal syndrome known as alopecia with mental retardation (APMR) syndrome, characterized by congenital alopecia, intellectual disability, and sometimes early-onset epilepsy (Besnard2019Biallelic). The phenotypic variability of LSS-related conditions is influenced by the specific type and location of the mutations within the gene, with some mutations leading to more severe neurological symptoms (Kang2024Clinical; Hua2020Novel). These findings underscore the critical role of LSS in maintaining cholesterol biosynthesis and its broader implications for human health.
