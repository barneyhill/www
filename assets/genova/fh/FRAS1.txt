# FRAS1

## Overview
The FRAS1 gene encodes the Fraser extracellular matrix complex subunit 1, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix involved in embryonic development and tissue integrity. This protein is characterized as a large, multidomain transmembrane protein, playing a pivotal role in the structural cohesion of tissues by forming a ternary complex with FREM1 and FREM2 at the basement membrane. The FRAS1 protein is essential for maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal integrity, particularly at the dermal-epidermal junction, and is involved in cell adhesion and signaling processes. Mutations in the FRAS1 gene are linked to Fraser syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by multiple congenital anomalies, underscoring the gene's significance in normal developmental processes (Vrontou2003Fras1; Wang2022Comprehensive; Boussion2020Fraser).

## Structure
The FRAS1 protein is a large, multidomain protein consisting of approximately 4,010 amino acids. It features a signal peptide and a predicted transmembrane domain at the C-terminus, indicating its role in membrane association (Vrontou2003Fras1). The protein is characterized by several distinct domains, including five von Willebrand factor C-like (VWC) domains at the N-terminus, five furin-like domains, 15 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)-like domains, and five CALX-β domains. These domains contribute to its structural integrity and functional diversity (Esho2023The).

FRAS1 is involved in extracellular matrix interactions, particularly at the dermal-epidermal junction, where it plays a crucial role in mediating adhesion during embryonic development (Vrontou2003Fras1; Esho2023The). The protein's central domain is related to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein NG2, which interacts with collagen types V and VI, suggesting a potential interaction with collagen VI (Vrontou2003Fras1).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which influence its function and stability. Variants in FRAS1 are linked to Fraser syndrome, highlighting its importance in developmental processes (van2018A). The specific details of its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The FRAS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by forming a ternary complex with FREM1 and FREM2 at the basement membrane (BM) in healthy human cells. This complex is essential for maintaining epithelial-mesenchymal integrity during embryonic development, similar to the function of collagen VII (Wang2022Comprehensive). The FRAS1 protein is produced by epithelial cells as a membrane protein and is involved in the structural integrity of the basement membrane, which is crucial for maintaining the architecture and function of tissues (Wang2022Comprehensive).

The basement membrane, where FRAS1 is located, acts as a major barrier that cancer cells must overcome to metastasize, indicating its role in tissue integrity and potentially in modulating immune responses through interactions in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Wang2022Comprehensive). Mutations in FRAS1 can lead to Fraser syndrome, a rare hereditary disorder characterized by multiple developmental anomalies, highlighting its critical role in normal development (Wang2022Comprehensive). The FRAS1/FREM family shares common polypeptide repetitive motifs that may have interactive and organizing functions, further underscoring its importance in cellular and tissue structure (Wang2022Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FRAS1 gene are primarily associated with Fraser syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a range of congenital malformations. These include cryptophthalmos (fusion of the eyelids), syndactyly (fusion of fingers or toes), and renal anomalies such as renal agenesis (Bouaoud2020Fraser; Vrontou2003Fras1; Boussion2020Fraser). The FRAS1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during embryonic development. Disruptions in these interactions due to FRAS1 mutations lead to the characteristic features of Fraser syndrome (Vrontou2003Fras1; Tessier2016Fraser).

The clinical presentation of Fraser syndrome is highly variable, with some cases exhibiting severe malformations such as renal agenesis and respiratory tract anomalies, which can result in high mortality rates, particularly in the first year of life (Bouaoud2020Fraser). Genetic studies have identified various mutations in the FRAS1 gene, including missense mutations and frameshift variants, which lead to a loss of protein function and contribute to the syndrome's phenotypic diversity (Ng2012A; van2008Molecular).

## Interactions
The FRAS1 protein is a component of the Fraser protein complex (FPC), which includes Fras1 and Fras-Related ECM proteins Frem1 and Frem2. This complex is involved in cell adhesion and signaling, located in the sub-lamina densa of the epithelial basal lamina (Talbot2016Pharyngeal). FRAS1 interacts with Integrin alpha8 (Itga8), which binds to Frem1 in cell culture. Itga8 also binds to the RGD domain of Nephronectin (Npnt), suggesting a link between Itga8 and the FPC (Talbot2016Pharyngeal). The interaction between Fras1 and Itga8 is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during craniofacial development, particularly in zebrafish, where these proteins facilitate tissue adhesion and signaling mechanisms (Talbot2016Pharyngeal).

In addition to its role in craniofacial development, FRAS1 interacts with the intracellular scaffold protein Grip1 through its short cytoplasmic tail, mediating vesicular trafficking to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells (Kalpachidou2020Behavioural). These interactions are essential for maintaining structural cohesion between the epithelium and mesenchyme, and mutations in FRAS1 can lead to Fraser Syndrome, characterized by physical malformations (Kalpachidou2020Behavioural).
