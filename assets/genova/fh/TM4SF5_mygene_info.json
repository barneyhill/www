Most of these members are cell-surface proteins that are characterized by the presence of four hydrophobic domains.

This encoded protein is a cell surface glycoprotein and is highly similar in sequence and structure to transmembrane 4 superfamily member 1. It may play a role in cell proliferation, and overexpression of this protein may be associated with the uncontrolled growth of tumour cells.
