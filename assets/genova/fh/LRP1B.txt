# LRP1B

## Overview
The LRP1B gene encodes the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1B, a large transmembrane receptor that is part of the LDL receptor family. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple extracellular ligand-binding domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail. LRP1B is primarily expressed in the brain, skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, and testis, and it plays a role in various cellular processes, including cholesterol metabolism and tumor suppression (Príncipe2021LRP1B:; Beer2016Expression). The protein's involvement in cancer biology is significant, as mutations in the LRP1B gene are associated with increased tumor mutation burden and improved responses to immunotherapy in several cancers, such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (Zhu2022CoMutation; Chen2019Association). LRP1B's interactions with other proteins and its role in signaling pathways further underscore its importance in cellular regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Beer2016Expression; Peixoto2023Using).

## Structure
The LRP1B protein is a large member of the LDL receptor family, sharing significant structural similarity with LRP1. It is composed of 4599 amino acids and features a complex architecture with multiple domains. The protein includes four extracellular ligand-binding domains (I, II, III, and IV), which contain 2, 8, 10, and 12 LDLRA domains, respectively. These domains are interspersed with clusters of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and YWTD β-propeller domains, contributing to its ligand-binding capabilities (Liu2007γSecretasemediated; Príncipe2021LRP1B:).

LRP1B undergoes proteolytic processing, including cleavage at a furin site between the fourth ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane domain, resulting in a mature receptor composed of a large N-terminal subunit (520 kDa α-chain) and a smaller C-terminal subunit (90 kDa β-chain) (Príncipe2021LRP1B:). The intracellular domain (ICD) of LRP1B contains NPXY motifs, a YXXØ motif, and two dileucine motifs, with a unique 33 amino acid sequence between the NPXY motifs (Príncipe2021LRP1B:).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, and the protein is subject to regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), involving ectodomain shedding and γ-secretase-mediated release of the ICD (Liu2007γSecretasemediated). LRP1B also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Liu2007γSecretasemediated).

## Function
The LRP1B gene encodes a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerotic lesion formation (Beer2016Expression). LRP1B is one of the largest transmembrane receptors, consisting of 4599 amino acids, and is encoded by an mRNA of 13,800 base pairs. It contains four ligand-binding domain regions, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail with two NPxY motifs (Beer2016Expression). Unlike its homolog LRP1, LRP1B is not cleaved by furin and migrates as a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 600 kD (Beer2016Expression).

In healthy human cells, LRP1B expression is mostly restricted to the brain, skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, and testis, with additional expression in smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall (Beer2016Expression). The physiological role of LRP1B in these tissues remains largely unknown, but its expression pattern suggests it may have specialized functions (Beer2016Expression). A knockout mouse model indicated that LRP1B may not be critical for basic physiological functions in these tissues, although more proximal deletions of the gene resulted in no viable homozygous mutants, suggesting a crucial role for the extracellular domain in normal development (Beer2016Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRP1B gene have been associated with various cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and lung adenocarcinoma. In melanoma and NSCLC, LRP1B mutations are linked to a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden, which are indicators of genomic instability. These mutations are correlated with improved immune response and better survival outcomes in patients undergoing immunotherapy, suggesting that LRP1B mutations may serve as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response (Chen2019Association).

In lung adenocarcinoma, LRP1B mutations are frequently observed and are associated with higher TMB, which is a predictor of immunotherapy efficacy. These mutations are also linked to upregulated expression of immune markers, indicating enhanced cytotoxicity and a potentially improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Zhu2022CoMutation).

LRP1B mutations are also prevalent in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and are associated with high TMB. Patients with co-mutations in TP53 and LRP1B exhibit the highest TMB and favorable survival outcomes when treated with immunotherapy. The co-wild type status of TP53 and LRP1B is linked to a stable genome and higher immune infiltration, suggesting it could be a predictor of immunotherapy efficacy (Yu2022TP53).

## Interactions
LRP1B (Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1B) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a tumor suppressor. In glioblastoma, LRP1B silencing leads to the differential expression of several proteins, including the upregulation of Multiple Epidermal Growth Factor-like Domains 10 (MEGF10), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NSFL1 cofactor p47 (NSFL1C), and the downregulation of Limbic-System-Associated Membrane Protein (LSAMP) and Elastin Microfibril Interfacer 2 (EMILIN-2). These interactions suggest potential pathways influenced by LRP1B, although direct associations with these proteins have not been previously established (Peixoto2023Using).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LRP1B overexpression is associated with increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 CIP1 and reduced phosphorylation of Src, a proto-oncogene, indicating its role in inhibiting cellular proliferation. This suggests that LRP1B interacts with signaling pathways that regulate cell growth (Beer2016Expression).

In gastric cancer, LRP1B's cytoplasmic localization is linked to a favorable prognosis in diffuse-type gastric cancer, and it co-localizes with RAB11FIP1 in endocytic recycling compartments, indicating a role in endocytosis and ligand internalization (Yasufuku2021Prognostic).
