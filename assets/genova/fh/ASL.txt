# ASL

## Overview
The ASL gene encodes the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, a crucial component of the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide (NO) cycle. As a lyase, this enzyme catalyzes the breakdown of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate, playing a vital role in detoxifying ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic; Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate). Beyond its metabolic functions, argininosuccinate lyase is involved in the production of nitric oxide, a signaling molecule essential for various physiological processes, including vasodilation and neurotransmission (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic). The enzyme is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the liver and brain, underscoring its importance in maintaining nitrogen balance and preventing hyperammonemia (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic). Mutations in the ASL gene can lead to argininosuccinic aciduria, a disorder characterized by severe metabolic disturbances (Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate).

## Structure
The human argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) protein is a homotetramer, meaning it is composed of four identical subunits, each contributing to the formation of the enzyme's active sites (Erez2011Argininosuccinate). Each monomer of ASL consists of three principal domains, which are rich in alpha-helices (Hu2015Unstable). The active site of the enzyme is formed by residues from three different subunits, allowing for the catalysis of the breakdown of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate (Hu2015Unstable).

The ASL protein shares structural similarities with d crystallin, a protein found in the lens of birds and reptiles, with a significant amino acid identity (Erez2011Argininosuccinate). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a common protein fold that generates four active sites within each homotetramer (Erez2011Argininosuccinate). Specific conserved residues, such as aspartate 31, arginine 113, and arginine 236, are crucial for substrate interaction and catalytic function (Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate).

Mutations in these conserved residues can significantly impact the enzyme's structural integrity and catalytic efficiency, highlighting their importance in maintaining ASL's function (Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate).

## Function
The ASL gene encodes the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, which is crucial in the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide (NO) cycle. In the urea cycle, ASL catalyzes the conversion of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate, facilitating the detoxification of ammonia, a neurotoxic byproduct of protein metabolism (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic; Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate). This process is essential for maintaining nitrogen balance and preventing hyperammonemia (Baruteau2018Argininosuccinic).

In the citrulline-NO cycle, ASL plays a structural role in forming a multiprotein complex that channels arginine to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for NO production. NO is a critical signaling molecule involved in vasodilation, blood pressure regulation, and neurotransmission (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic). ASL is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, brain, and vascular system, highlighting its importance in multiple physiological processes (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic).

ASL's role extends to creatine metabolism, impacting energy metabolism, and it is involved in preventing oxidative and nitrosative stress in the brain, which can lead to neuronal damage (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic). Its deficiency can result in metabolic disturbances, including hyperammonemia and NO deficiency, affecting vascular health and neurological function (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASL gene lead to argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle. This condition results in the accumulation of argininosuccinic acid in body fluids, causing severe hyperammonemia and a range of clinical symptoms. ASA can present in two forms: a severe neonatal form characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, tachypnea, lethargy, and seizures, and a milder late-onset variant with symptoms such as vomiting, failure to thrive, irritability, and psychomotor retardation (Engel2011Bacterial; Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate).

The clinical manifestations of ASA are due to tissue-specific arginine deficiency and elevated argininosuccinic acid levels, leading to complications like mental and physical retardation, convulsions, liver enlargement, and skin lesions (Erez2011Argininosuccinate). The disorder is associated with systemic nitric oxide deficiency, affecting cerebral nitric oxide metabolism and leading to oxidative and nitrosative stress in neurons (Baruteau2018Argininosuccinic).

Gene therapy has shown promise in managing ASA by restoring ASL activity, normalizing ammonia levels, and reducing nitrosative stress in the brain, particularly when administered neonatally (Baruteau2018Argininosuccinic). Despite these advances, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation, complicating the prediction of clinical outcomes based on specific mutations (Trevisson2007Argininosuccinate).

## Interactions
Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is involved in several important protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. ASL is a part of a multiprotein complex that includes the cationic amino acid transporter CAT1, argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This complex is crucial for channeling arginine to NOS for nitric oxide production, highlighting ASL's structural role in maintaining this protein assembly (Baruteau2019Argininosuccinic).

In the context of cancer, ASL interacts with cyclin A2 in the cytoplasm of liver tumor cells. This interaction is significant for the proliferation of these cells, as ASL helps maintain cyclin A2 protein expression, which is essential for cell cycle progression. The interaction between ASL and cyclin A2 occurs independently of ASL's enzymatic activity, suggesting a non-catalytic role in promoting cell growth (Hung2016Argininosuccinate).

ASL's interaction with cyclin A2 has been confirmed through various experimental methods, including immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, which demonstrate their colocalization in the cytoplasm of liver cancer cells (Hung2016Argininosuccinate). These interactions underscore ASL's multifaceted role in both metabolic and proliferative pathways.
