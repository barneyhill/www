# CUTC

## Overview
The CUTC gene encodes the cutC copper transporter protein, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining copper homeostasis within human cells. This protein is categorized as a copper transporter and is primarily involved in the intracellular trafficking of copper ions, ensuring their proper distribution and preventing copper toxicity. The cutC protein is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential function in copper metabolism. It is predominantly located in the cytoplasm but can also be found in the nucleus of certain cell types, such as AD293 cells, indicating its role as a shuttle protein for copper ions (Li2005Identification). The gene's significance extends to clinical implications, particularly in heart failure, where its dysregulation has been linked to disease progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chazara2023Assessing). Despite its recognized importance, the precise molecular mechanisms of the cutC protein in human health and disease remain an active area of research (Lutsenko2010Human).

## Function
The CUTC gene encodes a protein involved in copper homeostasis, a critical process for maintaining cellular copper balance. The human CutC protein is a copper transporter that facilitates the movement of copper ions within cells, playing a significant role in intracellular copper trafficking. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and has been observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of certain cell types, such as AD293 cells, suggesting its function as a shuttle protein for copper ions (Li2005Identification).

The CutC protein consists of 273 amino acids and is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in copper metabolism. It contains a sequence similar to a potential copper-binding motif found in bacterial proteins, supporting its function as a cytoplasmic copper-binding protein (Li2005Identification). The protein's activity is crucial for preventing copper toxicity and ensuring proper cellular metabolism, as copper is a vital cofactor for various enzymatic activities (Li2005Identification).

Despite its recognized role in copper homeostasis, the exact molecular mechanisms and functions of CutC in healthy human cells remain partially understood, with ongoing research aimed at elucidating these processes (Lutsenko2010Human).

## Clinical Significance
The CUTC gene is implicated in heart failure progression due to its role in copper transport and homeostasis. Alterations in CUTC expression have been observed in various heart failure conditions, including heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The gene is significantly downregulated in diseased heart tissues compared to healthy ones, suggesting its dysregulation may contribute to heart failure (Chazara2023Assessing). CUTC is involved in cardiac conduction and ion channel transport pathways, and its dysfunction could affect muscle physiology and mitochondrial function, making it a potential therapeutic target for heart failure (Chazara2023Assessing).

While the CUTC gene's transcripts overlap with COX15, which encodes the Cytochrome C Oxidase Assembly Homolog, COX15 was not significantly associated with cardiovascular outcomes in the analysis, indicating that CUTC's role in heart failure is more pronounced (Chazara2023Assessing). The study highlights the potential for targeting CUTC in therapeutic interventions due to its predicted druggability, although further experimental validation is needed to confirm its clinical significance (Chazara2023Assessing).
