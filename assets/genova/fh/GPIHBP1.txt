# GPIHBP1

## Overview
GPIHBP1 is a gene that encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1, a crucial component in lipid metabolism. This protein is categorized as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein and is primarily expressed on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (Davies2010GPIHBP1; Beigneux2007GlycosylphosphatidylinositolAnchored). GPIHBP1 plays a vital role in the transport and localization of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within capillaries, facilitating the hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Beigneux2007GlycosylphosphatidylinositolAnchored). The protein's structure includes an N-terminal intrinsically disordered acidic domain and a C-terminal LU domain, which are essential for its interaction with LPL and the subsequent lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Mysling2016The; Birrane2018Structure). Mutations in the GPIHBP1 gene can lead to severe metabolic disorders, such as chylomicronemia, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal lipid homeostasis (Miyashita2020Chylomicronemia).

## Structure
GPIHBP1 is a protein characterized by a unique structure within the LU (Ly6/uPAR) protein family. It features an N-terminal intrinsically disordered acidic domain and a folded C-terminal LU domain. The acidic domain is enriched with acidic residues, including aspartic acid and glutamic acid, and contains a sulfated tyrosine, contributing to its negative charge (Mysling2016The; Young2019GPIHBP1). This domain is crucial for stabilizing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) by preventing the unfolding of its catalytic domain (Mysling2016The).

The LU domain of GPIHBP1 adopts a three-fingered fold stabilized by five disulfide bonds, involving eight conserved cysteines (Mysling2016The; Birrane2018Structure). This domain is responsible for binding to the C-terminal domain of LPL, primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Birrane2018Structure). The LU domain's structure is unaffected by the presence of the disordered acidic domain, indicating that the disordered region does not influence the LU domain's secondary structure (Mysling2016The).

Post-translational modifications of GPIHBP1 include N-linked glycosylation of Asn 58 and O-sulfation of Tyr 18 (Kristensen2021GPIHBP1). The protein is anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is facilitated by a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide (Young2019GPIHBP1).

## Function
GPIHBP1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the transport of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) into the capillaries. This protein is expressed on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells in tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, but is absent in the brain (Davies2010GPIHBP1; Beigneux2007GlycosylphosphatidylinositolAnchored). GPIHBP1 serves as a platform for the binding of LPL and chylomicrons, enabling the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Beigneux2007GlycosylphosphatidylinositolAnchored). 

The protein's amino-terminal acidic domain is crucial for binding LPL, which has positively charged heparin-binding domains. This interaction is essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), facilitating the uptake of fatty acids by tissues (Gin2011Binding). In Gpihbp1-deficient mice, LPL is mislocalized, leading to severe hypertriglyceridemia, highlighting the importance of GPIHBP1 in normal triglyceride metabolism (Davies2010GPIHBP1). The presence of GPIHBP1 on both the basolateral and apical surfaces of endothelial cells suggests its role in the transcytosis of LPL across these cells, ensuring its proper localization within capillaries (Davies2010GPIHBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPIHBP1 gene are associated with severe chylomicronemia, a condition characterized by extremely high levels of triglycerides in the blood, which can lead to pancreatitis and other complications. GPIHBP1 mutations disrupt the transport of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) into capillaries, impairing the processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and resulting in elevated triglyceride levels (Miyashita2020Chylomicronemia). Missense mutations, particularly those affecting conserved cysteines in the LU domain of GPIHBP1, such as C65Y and C68Y, abolish its ability to bind LPL, causing chylomicronemia (Rios2011Deletion; Franssen2010Chylomicronemia).

Complete deficiency of GPIHBP1 due to homozygous deletions also results in severe chylomicronemia, similar to the worst cases of LPL deficiency (Rios2011Deletion). Other mutations, such as p.Thr80Lys and p.Met1Ile, have been identified in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis and are associated with reduced LPL activity (Ariza2016Novel). The G56R mutation is linked to severe hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia, with affected individuals experiencing relapsing pancreatitis (Wang2007Homozygous).

GPIHBP1 autoantibodies can cause acquired forms of chylomicronemia by blocking GPIHBP1's ability to bind and transport LPL, further underscoring the critical role of GPIHBP1-LPL interactions in lipid metabolism (Miyashita2020Chylomicronemia).

## Interactions
GPIHBP1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by interacting with lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This interaction is essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins. GPIHBP1 binds LPL in the interstitial space and transports it to the capillary lumen, facilitating the margination and lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Mysling2016The). The binding interface between GPIHBP1 and LPL involves the entire concave surface of GPIHBP1's LU domain, with hydrophobic contacts playing a significant role (Birrane2018Structure). Specific residues in GPIHBP1, such as S107, W109, and T111, interact with LPL residues K464, H466, and D467, forming a complex that is crucial for plasma triglyceride hydrolysis (Birrane2018Structure).

The interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL is mediated by electrostatic interactions between GPIHBP1's acidic domain and LPL's basic patch, which stabilize LPL's structure and activity (Risti2024A; Kristensen2021GPIHBP1). Mutations in either GPIHBP1 or LPL can impair their interaction, leading to conditions such as familial chylomicronemia (Mysling2016The). GPIHBP1 also interacts with apolipoprotein A-V (apoAV), but not with other lipoproteins like HDL or LDL, highlighting its specificity in binding interactions (Gin2011Binding).
