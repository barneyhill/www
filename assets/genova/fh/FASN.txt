# FASN

## Overview
The FASN gene encodes the enzyme fatty acid synthase, a key player in lipid biosynthesis. Fatty acid synthase is a multifunctional enzyme complex that catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, primarily palmitate, from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, utilizing NADPH as a reducing agent. This enzyme is categorized as a multi-enzyme protein complex, featuring several catalytic domains that facilitate its role in fatty acid synthesis (Xiao2024The). FASN is predominantly active in lipogenic tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and energy storage (Xiao2024The). The regulation of FASN is tightly controlled by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which modulate its expression in response to cellular metabolic demands (Xiao2024The). Beyond its metabolic functions, FASN is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhou2020Fatty; Zhang2022Comprehensive). As such, FASN represents a potential therapeutic target, with ongoing research exploring its inhibition as a strategy for cancer treatment (Zhou2020Fatty).

## Structure
The human fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein is a complex multi-enzyme system involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. It is composed of multiple domains, including the acyl carrier protein (ACP) and ketoacyl synthase (KS) domains, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Swarbrick2020Structure). The FASN protein exhibits a dimeric quaternary structure, with each monomer containing several catalytic sites that facilitate the fatty acid synthesis process (Swarbrick2020Structure).

The thioesterase domain of FASN, which is part of the TE16 family, has been structurally characterized and includes a traditional α/β hydrolase domain. This domain features a lid region above the active site, containing a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, which regulates catalysis by controlling access to the active site (Swarbrick2020Structure). The quaternary structure of these thioesterases is monomeric, similar to other α/β hydrolases (Swarbrick2020Structure).

Common post-translational modifications of FASN include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and function (Hornbeck201815). These modifications are crucial for the regulation of FASN's enzymatic activity and its role in cellular metabolism. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of FASN are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, primarily producing palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the presence of NADPH. This process is crucial for energy storage, membrane biosynthesis, and signaling in cells (Xiao2024The). FASN functions as a multifunctional polymerase with seven catalytic domains and operates as a dimer in mammals (Xiao2024The). 

In healthy human cells, FASN is primarily active in lipogenic tissues such as the liver and adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in lipid metabolism. The enzyme's activity is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), particularly SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which promote FASN expression by binding to its promoter (Xiao2024The). 

FASN's role extends to various cellular processes, including the regulation of lipid homeostasis and the synthesis of essential fatty acids required for cell membrane formation and function. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting the structural integrity of cell membranes, which are vital for normal cellular function and organismal health (Xiao2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FASN gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. Overexpression of FASN is frequently observed in various tumors, including bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and several other cancer types, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced tumor grades (Xiong2022Fatty; Zhou2020Fatty; Zhang2022Comprehensive). In bladder cancer, high FASN expression correlates with metabolic pathways and is linked to a poorer response to immune checkpoint therapies, suggesting its role in immune evasion (Xiong2022Fatty). Similarly, in gastric cancer, FASN overexpression is associated with negative immune infiltration, affecting CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which may contribute to tumor immune escape (Zhou2020Fatty).

FASN's role in cancer progression is further highlighted by its involvement in lipid metabolism and its interactions with immune pathways. It is negatively correlated with immune infiltration in many tumors, indicating a potential mechanism for immune evasion (Zhang2022Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also linked to tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, which are important factors in tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy (Zhang2022Comprehensive). These findings underscore the potential of FASN as a therapeutic target, with inhibitors like TVB-2640 being explored in clinical trials (Zhou2020Fatty).

## Interactions
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression and metabolism. In liver cancer, FASN interacts with 79 proteins, including fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1), signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1), spectrin β, non-erythrocytic 1 (SPTBN1), and CD59. These interactions are crucial for regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) expression, which are associated with cancer cell migration and invasion (Huang2020Identification).

In breast cancer, FASN is protected from proteasomal degradation through SUMOylation, which is crucial for its stability and oncogenic activity. This process is influenced by transcription factors such as SREBP1c and AKT1, which regulate FASN expression (Floris2020SUMOylation).

FASN also interacts with the BCL-2 family of proteins, affecting mitochondrial priming and apoptosis in cancer cells. This interaction influences the sensitivity of cancer cells to FASN inhibitors, as it affects mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release (Schroeder2021Fatty).

In prostate cancer, FASN interacts with proteins involved in metabolic processes, such as ACACA and SREBF1, which are linked to increased metabolic activity and cancer progression (Chianese2023FASN).
