# H2AB2

## Overview
The H2AB2 gene encodes the H2A.B variant histone, a non-canonical histone protein that plays a significant role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Unlike the canonical H2A histone, the H2A.B variant is characterized by a shorter C-terminal tail and unique structural features, such as a more basic L2 loop and a continuous stretch of arginines in the N-terminal tail, which contribute to its distinct functional properties (Peng2020Molecular). These structural differences result in increased DNA flexibility and a more open chromatin configuration, facilitating dynamic nucleosome behavior and spontaneous histone exchange (Hirano2021Histone; Peng2020Molecular). The H2A.B variant is implicated in various biological processes, including transcriptional regulation and splicing, and its aberrant expression is associated with oncogenesis in several cancer types, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chew2021Short).

## Structure
The H2AB2 gene encodes the histone variant H2A.B, which is structurally distinct from the canonical H2A histone. H2A.B is characterized by a shorter C-terminal tail and a unique sequence identity of approximately 48% compared to H2A, which includes a more basic L2 loop and a continuous stretch of six arginines in the N-terminal tail (Peng2020Molecular). These structural differences contribute to the dynamic nature of the H2A.B nucleosome core particle (NCP), affecting its stability and interactions with DNA (Peng2020Molecular).

The absence of the C-terminal tail in H2A.B, which typically stabilizes DNA at entry/exit sites in canonical histones, leads to increased DNA flexibility and potential unwrapping (Peng2020Molecular). The L2 loop in H2A.B, which replaces the canonical Lys-Thr-Arg sequence with Glu-Arg-Asn, reduces the net charge and the ability to form stabilizing hydrogen bonds with DNA, resulting in increased DNA opening (Kohestani2021Effects).

H2A.B also lacks the acidic patch found in canonical H2A, which is crucial for chromatin fiber folding, leading to a more open chromatin structure (Peng2020Molecular). This structural configuration facilitates the spontaneous exchange of H2A.B-H2B dimers with canonical H2A-H2B dimers within the nucleosome, contributing to its dynamic behavior in chromatin (Hirano2021Histone).

## Clinical Significance
The H2AB2 gene, encoding the H2A.B variant histone, is implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression. Studies have shown that H2A.B is reactivated in several cancer types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas, urothelial bladder carcinomas, and cervical squamous cell carcinomas (Chew2021Short). This reactivation is associated with cancer-specific gene expression programs, suggesting a role in oncogenesis (Chew2021Short). The expression of H2A.B is linked to splicing dysfunction, which may contribute to cancer progression by altering RNA processing and transcriptional regulation (Chew2021Short).

H2A.B expression is also associated with nucleosome destabilization, potentially allowing oncogenic transcription factors to access regulatory elements, thereby promoting tumorigenesis (Chew2021Short). The gene's expression in Hodgkin's lymphoma correlates with faster cell growth, indicating its potential role in enhancing cancer cell proliferation (Chew2021Short). The presence of H2A.B in cancer cells may also lead to the generation of immunogenic neoantigens, which could be targeted in immunotherapy (Chew2021Short). Overall, the aberrant expression of H2AB2 in various cancers highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
