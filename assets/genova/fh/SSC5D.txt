# SSC5D

## Overview
The SSC5D gene encodes a protein that is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, which plays a significant role in the immune system. The protein, known as scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family member with 5 domains, is characterized by its five SRCR domains and a mucin-like C-terminal region, which is heavily glycosylated. SSC5D is primarily expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes, and is notably abundant in the placenta. Functioning as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), SSC5D is involved in binding pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on bacteria, thereby contributing to immune surveillance and pathogen recognition. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions suggest its involvement in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Clinically, SSC5D has been associated with conditions such as heart failure and immune responses to infections, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its role in disease pathophysiology (Gonçalves2009Molecular; Bessa2016The; Ge2023The).

## Structure
The SSC5D protein is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily and is characterized by its unique molecular structure. It consists of five SRCR domains located towards the N-terminus, each encoded by a single exon and containing eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bonds per domain (Gonçalves2009Molecular). These domains are highly conserved among non-marsupial mammals, with significant identity observed in orthologs from rats and mice (Gonçalves2009Molecular).

The C-terminal portion of SSC5D is mucin-like, featuring a series of proline and threonine-rich repeats, which are predicted to have numerous O-glycosylation sites, with 144 potential sites in a 476 amino acid stretch (Gonçalves2009Molecular). This region contributes to the protein's highly glycosylated structure and is estimated to be about 120 nm in length (Gonçalves2009Molecular).

SSC5D is a soluble protein, as no transmembrane region is predicted, and it is likely secreted (Gonçalves2009Molecular). The full-length protein is over 250 nm long, with the SRCR domains contributing minimally to this dimension (Gonçalves2009Molecular). The gene encoding SSC5D is located on chromosome 19q13.4 (Gonçalves2009Molecular).

## Function
The SSC5D gene encodes a protein that is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, which is involved in various immune functions. The SSC5D protein is primarily expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes, and is abundant in the placenta (Gonçalves2009Molecular). It features five SRCR domains at the N-terminus and a mucin-like domain at the C-terminus, which is heavily glycosylated (Gonçalves2009Molecular).

SSC5D functions as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), capable of binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, through its SRCR-containing N-terminal domain (Bessa2016The). This binding ability suggests a role in the immune response, potentially acting as a circulating PRR that helps in pathogen recognition and clearance (Bessa2016The). The protein's ability to distinguish between different bacterial strains indicates its specificity in immune surveillance (Bessa2016The).

The expression pattern and binding properties of SSC5D imply its involvement in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis in healthy human cells (Gonçalves2009Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The SSC5D gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its altered expression levels. Elevated serum levels of SSC5D have been associated with heart failure (HF), where it serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosis. Studies have shown that SSC5D levels are significantly higher in patients with HF, correlating with clinical risk factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (Ge2023The). The gene's expression is predominantly found in cardiac fibroblasts, and its upregulation is linked to heart failure pathophysiology (Ge2023The).

SSC5D is also involved in immune responses, particularly in monocytes and T lymphocytes. Its expression is upregulated in conditions like small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infection in goats, suggesting a role in regulating the innate immune response during lentiviral infections (PławińskaCzarnak2021Gene). Additionally, SSC5D has been identified in studies of low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma, although its specific role in this context remains unclear (Wong2022Integrated).

The gene's interaction with bacteria through its SRCR domains has been studied, indicating its potential role in immune responses to bacterial infections (Bessa2016The). However, direct clinical associations with specific diseases due to mutations in SSC5D are still under investigation.

## Interactions
The SSC5D protein, a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily, is known for its interactions with bacteria through its SRCR-containing N-terminal domain. This interaction is primarily studied using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays, which have demonstrated that SSC5D can bind to various bacterial strains, including Escherichia coli RS218 and Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e. The binding capacity of SSC5D is comparable to that of other SRCR proteins like Spα, but it shows a superior ability to bind certain E. coli strains compared to CD5 and CD6 (Bessa2016The).

The interaction of SSC5D with bacteria is influenced by the structural integrity of the bacterial surface, as heat-killed bacteria show minimal binding, indicating that the bacterial determinants recognized by SSC5D are heat-sensitive (Bessa2016The). SSC5D's ability to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains suggests a role in immune surveillance and pathogen recognition (Bessa2016The). While the specific protein-protein interactions involving SSC5D are not detailed, its role in binding bacteria highlights its potential involvement in immune response pathways (Gonçalves2009Molecular).
