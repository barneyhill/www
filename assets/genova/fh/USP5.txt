# USP5

## Overview
USP5, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 5, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis within cells. The protein product of USP5, also known as isopeptidase T, is a multidomain enzyme that plays a crucial role in the recycling of ubiquitin by cleaving isopeptide bonds in unanchored polyubiquitin chains. This enzyme is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is essential for maintaining the balance between protein degradation and stabilization, thereby ensuring cellular homeostasis (Ning2020Structure). USP5 is widely expressed across various tissues and is localized primarily in the cytosol and nucleoplasm, indicating its involvement in diverse physiological processes such as DNA repair, stress response, and immune function (Ning2020Structure). The enzyme's ability to interact with key proteins and pathways underscores its significance in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Gu2024Unraveling; Cheung2021A).

## Structure
USP5, also known as isopeptidase T, is a multidomain enzyme involved in the recycling of ubiquitin by cleaving isopeptide bonds in unanchored polyubiquitin substrates. The protein consists of several distinct domains, including a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, two zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domains (ZnF-UBP), and two ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains (Ning2020Structure; Avvakumov2012Two).

The USP domain contains the catalytic core, featuring a papain-like fold with a helical lobe and a torn β-sheet lobe, which forms the active site where the catalytic cysteine (Cys335) is located (Avvakumov2012Two). The ZnF-UBP domains, particularly the nUBP and cUBP, are crucial for substrate recognition and catalytic activity. The nUBP domain, although lacking a functional Zn2+ binding site, is tightly associated with the catalytic domain and enhances catalytic activity through allosteric effects (Ning2020Structure; Avvakumov2012Two).

The UBA domains, nUBA and cUBA, adopt a canonical fold and are involved in binding distal ubiquitin moieties, contributing to substrate specificity and regulation (Avvakumov2012Two). USP5 is primarily localized in the cytosol and nucleoplasm, and it is expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes (Ning2020Structure).

## Function
USP5, also known as ubiquitin specific peptidase 5, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis in cells. It is involved in the dynamic equilibrium of ubiquitination and deubiquitination, balancing protein degradation and stabilization to maintain cellular homeostasis (Ning2020Structure). USP5 specifically recognizes unanchored polyubiquitin chains and removes ubiquitin from the proximal end, which is vital for maintaining the free ubiquitin pool (Ning2020Structure). It cleaves five types of linkages, with a preference for unanchored Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains (Ning2020Structure).

USP5 is primarily localized in the cytosol and nucleoplasm and is widely expressed in various tissues, suggesting its involvement in numerous physiological processes, including development, DNA repair, stress response, and immune functions (Ning2020Structure). It is recruited to sites of DNA damage to cleave polyubiquitin chains, facilitating efficient DNA repair via the homologous recombination pathway (Ning2020Structure). USP5 also plays a role in the stress response by participating in the assembly and disassembly of stress granules, which are involved in cellular responses to stressors like heat and oxidative stress (Ning2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The USP5 gene is implicated in various cancers and pain conditions due to its role in protein stability and signaling pathways. In cancer, USP5 is overexpressed in several types, including breast, testis, prostate, urothelial, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It stabilizes proteins like SLUG and FoxM1, promoting tumor growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and inactivates p14 ARF-p53 signaling in HCC (Ning2020Structure; Gu2024Unraveling). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), USP5 activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and interacts with PD-L1, contributing to immune escape (Gu2024Unraveling). In multiple myeloma, USP5 stabilizes c-Maf, promoting cell proliferation (Wang2017Inhibition). USP5 is also involved in bladder cancer progression by stabilizing c-Jun, part of the JNK pathway (Zhang2024USP5).

In autoimmune diseases, USP5 affects the NF-κB signaling pathway, influencing inflammation and immune responses. It stabilizes TRAF6, promoting cytokine production in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and regulates TNFα-mediated responses in Kawasaki disease (Gu2024Unraveling). In neuroblastoma, USP5 interacts with MYCN, contributing to the malignant phenotype (Cheung2021A). These roles highlight USP5 as a potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
USP5, also known as ubiquitin-specific peptidase 5, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with c-Maf and MafB, key transcription factors in myeloma cells, to prevent their polyubiquitination and stabilize them. This interaction is crucial for the survival of myeloma cells, as it prevents the degradation of these transcription factors, thereby promoting cell proliferation and survival (Wang2017Inhibition).

USP5 also interacts with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It specifically recognizes unanchored polyubiquitin chains and removes ubiquitin from the proximal end, maintaining the homeostasis of the free ubiquitin pool (Ning2020Structure). This interaction is essential for regulating ubiquitin levels and preventing the accumulation of polyubiquitin chains that could overwhelm the proteasome (Mann2019Discovery).

In addition, USP5 has been shown to interact with the p53 protein. Suppression of USP5 leads to the accumulation of unanchored polyubiquitin and activation of the p53 pathway, indicating a regulatory interaction that affects p53 stability and activity (Dayal2009Suppression). These interactions highlight USP5's role in modulating protein stability and cellular stress responses.
