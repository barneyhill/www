# PODNL1

## Overview
PODNL1 is a gene that encodes the protein podocan like 1, which is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, specifically classified under Class V SLRPs. This extracellular protein is involved in the formation and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a crucial role in maintaining structural integrity and signaling within various tissues, such as tibial nerves, coronary arteries, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (Shergalis2018Current). Podocan like 1 is implicated in modulating cell signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, including the ErbB family, which are essential for cellular communication and function (Shergalis2018Current). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are significant in tissue development, repair, and various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it has been associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (dos2020Reboot:; Geng2020PODNL1).

## Structure


## Function
Podocan like 1 (PODNL1) is an extracellular protein that plays a significant role in the formation and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, specifically classified under Class V SLRPs. These proteins are known for their involvement in binding collagen I and regulating cell growth by inducing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (Shergalis2018Current). PODNL1 is expressed in various tissues, including tibial nerves, coronary arteries, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, indicating its role in maintaining structural integrity and signaling in these tissues (Shergalis2018Current).

In the context of cellular processes, PODNL1 is involved in upstream signaling cascades, such as those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the ErbB family. This suggests a role in modulating cell signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular communication and function (Shergalis2018Current). Although the specific function of PODNL1 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, its involvement in ECM organization and cell signaling highlights its importance in tissue development and repair. The protein's activity in the extracellular space underscores its role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
PODNL1 (podocan like 1) has been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In glioma, high expression of PODNL1 is associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and higher WHO grades. It is notably overexpressed in IDH wildtype gliomas, a known risk factor for the disease. Mechanistically, PODNL1 promotes glioma cell proliferation and migration through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and its knockdown results in increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth in xenograft models (Geng2020PODNL1).

In GBM, PODNL1 is part of a three-gene signature associated with poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression correlates with the poorest survival rates, suggesting a role in GBM tumorigenesis (dos2020Reboot:). Additionally, PODNL1 is linked to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and is associated with high-grade glioma (Shergalis2018Current).

PODNL1's expression has also been studied in colorectal cancer, where it was detected in left-sided colorectal cancer samples but not in healthy tissues, indicating a potential role in tumor biology specific to this region (SolisHernandez2021The). These findings suggest that PODNL1 could be significant in cancer progression and prognosis.
