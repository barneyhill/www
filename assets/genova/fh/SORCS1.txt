# SORCS1

## Overview
SORCS1 is a gene that encodes the sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1, a type I transmembrane protein that belongs to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain receptor family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in intracellular trafficking and signaling, with significant roles in neuronal and pancreatic functions. In neurons, it is essential for synaptic function by regulating the trafficking of neurexin, a presynaptic adhesion molecule. In pancreatic β cells, SORCS1 is crucial for the biogenesis of insulin secretory granules, impacting insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the amyloid precursor protein and the insulin receptor, highlight its involvement in the pathophysiology of diseases like Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (Yau2019Type; Kebede2014SORCS1; Ribeiro2019SorCS1mediated).

## Structure
The SORCS1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain receptor family. It features several distinct domains, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a propeptide cleaved by furin, a large VPS10 domain, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Clee2006Positional; Yau2019Type). The VPS10 domain is conserved among family members and contains a β-propeller structure that forms a tunnel for ligand interaction and transport between subcellular compartments (Yau2019Type).

SORCS1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which results in different cytoplasmic tails and affects its subcellular localization (Clee2006Positional). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is evident in the formation of a 90 kDa mutant form that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (Yau2019Type). This glycosylation profile suggests the presence of high-mannose N-linked glycans, indicating ER localization (Yau2019Type). The SORCS1 protein is part of the VPS10 family, which includes sortilin, SorLA, and SorCS1-3, characterized by a VPS10 domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain (Clee2006Positional).

## Function
SORCS1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and signaling, playing a significant role in both neuronal and pancreatic functions. In neurons, SORCS1 is crucial for maintaining the axonal surface polarization of neurexin, a presynaptic adhesion molecule essential for synaptic function. This process involves the sorting and trafficking of neurexin from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, facilitated by the interaction of SORCS1 with Rab11 family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11FIP5). The proper localization of neurexin is necessary for presynaptic differentiation and neurotransmitter release, highlighting SORCS1's role in synaptic plasticity and function (Ribeiro2019SorCS1mediated).

In pancreatic β cells, SORCS1 is involved in the biogenesis of insulin secretory granules (SGs). It plays a critical role in the regulated secretory pathway, which is essential for the maturation and replenishment of SGs. The absence of SORCS1 leads to a depletion of the readily recruitable pool of SGs, impairing insulin secretion and contributing to diabetes. Overexpression of SORCS1 increases the number of SGs, indicating its importance in maintaining a sufficient pool of SGs for normal insulin secretion (Kebede2014SORCS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SORCS1 gene are associated with several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In Alzheimer's disease, SORCS1 influences the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), a critical factor in the disease's pathogenesis. Variants in SORCS1 have been linked to increased AD risk by altering APP processing, leading to changes in amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels. Overexpression of SorCS1 reduces Aβ generation, while its suppression increases Aβ levels, suggesting that SORCS1 expression levels are crucial in modulating AD risk (Reitz2011SORCS1).

In type 2 diabetes, SORCS1 is involved in insulin secretion and β-cell function. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SORCS1 results in an alternative protein processing pathway, leading to impaired insulin secretion due to misfolding and mislocalization of the protein within β-cells. This misfolding is linked to reduced insulin content and secretion, contributing to the pathophysiology of T2DM (Yau2019Type). Additionally, SORCS1 is essential for the biogenesis of insulin secretory granules, and its dysfunction can lead to insulin insufficiency, particularly under metabolic stress (Kebede2014SORCS1). These findings underscore the gene's significant role in both AD and T2DM.

## Interactions
SORCS1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms complexes with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), SorL1, and the retromer component Vps35, which are involved in Alzheimer's amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism. Overexpression of SorCS1 in cells leads to a decrease in Aβ generation, suggesting that SorCS1 modulates APP metabolism and influences Aβ production (Reitz2011SORCS1; Lane2010DiabetesAssociated).

In neurons, SorCS1 interacts with Rab11FIP5/Rip11, a Rab11-interacting protein, to regulate the trafficking of neurexin (Nrxn) proteins. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the axonal surface polarization of Nrxn1α, which is necessary for synaptic function. SorCS1 facilitates the transition of internalized Nrxn1α from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, preventing its missorting to the dendritic surface (Ribeiro2019SorCS1mediated).

The soluble form of SorCS1 (sol-SorCS1) acts as a high-affinity binding partner for the insulin receptor, enhancing insulin sensitivity. This interaction stabilizes the receptor, increases insulin affinity, and activates protein kinase B, leading to improved glucose uptake in myocytes (Kjolby2020Soluble).
