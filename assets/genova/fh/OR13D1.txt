# OR13D1

## Overview
The OR13D1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily D member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific ligands and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transmits signals from the extracellular environment to the interior of the cell. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system. The study of OR13D1 and its related proteins contributes to a broader understanding of sensory perception and its genetic underpinnings (Qiu2020aarFDC).
