# CCT7

## Overview
CCT7 is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 7, which is a component of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT). This complex is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the folding of cytosolic proteins, particularly those with complex structures such as actin and tubulin. The CCT complex is composed of two stacked rings, each containing eight different subunits, including CCT7, which is located in the CCT6 hemisphere of the complex. This hemisphere is characterized by weaker ATP binding and hydrolysis compared to the CCT2 hemisphere (Cuéllar2019Structural). CCT7 is involved in the assembly of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex by facilitating the folding of mLST8, a component of mTOR complexes (Cuéllar2019Structural). The proper functioning of CCT7 is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (Huang2022Overexpression).

## Function
CCT7, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), plays a crucial role in the folding of proteins within the cytoplasm of healthy human cells. The CCT complex is composed of two rings, each containing eight different subunits, including CCT7, which is located in the CCT6 hemisphere of the complex. This hemisphere is characterized by weaker ATP binding and hydrolysis compared to the CCT2 hemisphere (Cuéllar2019Structural). CCT7 is involved in the assembly of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex by facilitating the folding of mLST8, a component of mTOR complexes. mLST8 is positioned between the two CCT rings, interacting with the CCT6 hemisphere, where CCT7 is located (Cuéllar2019Structural).

The CCT complex, including CCT7, assists in the folding of proteins with complex structures, such as those with β-propeller domains, which are essential for protein-protein interactions and enzymatic functions. This activity is critical for the assembly and stability of mTOR complexes, which regulate cell growth, metabolism, and survival (Cuéllar2019Structural). The proper functioning of CCT7 within the CCT complex is vital for maintaining cellular structure and function, contributing to overall cell viability.

## Clinical Significance
CCT7, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCT7 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced cancer stages, higher tumor grades, and poorer clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and recurrence-free survival. CCT7's expression correlates with the spliceosome signaling pathway, which is involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Huang2022Overexpression). Genetic alterations in CCT7, such as copy number changes and somatic mutations, are linked to poorer survival outcomes in HCC patients (Huang2022Overexpression). 

CCT7 expression is also associated with DNA methylation status, particularly hypomethylation of specific CpG sites, which correlates with worse survival outcomes in HCC (Huang2022Overexpression). The gene's expression is linked to various clinicopathological features, including vascular invasion and higher Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging (Huang2022Overexpression). These findings suggest that CCT7 may serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC, offering potential therapeutic targets for intervention (Huang2022Overexpression).

## Interactions
CCT7, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in protein folding. In humans, CCT7 interacts with other CCT subunits to form a complex that assists in the folding of proteins such as actin and tubulin (Dekker2008The). The CCT complex, including CCT7, is known to interact with proteins like APP and Htt, which are implicated in Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, respectively (Narayanan2016The).

CCT7 also participates in the assembly of the mTOR complex by interacting with mLST8. This interaction is facilitated by the N-and C-termini of CCT7, which extend into the space between the CCT rings, suggesting a specific binding mechanism (Cuéllar2019Structural). The CCT complex, including CCT7, is involved in the incorporation of mLST8 into mTORC1 and mTORC2, highlighting its role in mTOR signaling (Cuéllar2019Structural).

Additionally, CCT7 interacts with ubiquitin C (UBC) in yeast, indicating a potential role in protein degradation pathways (Narayanan2016The). These interactions underscore the importance of CCT7 in various cellular processes, including protein folding, complex assembly, and response to cellular stress.
