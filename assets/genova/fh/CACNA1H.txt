# CACNA1H

## Overview
The CACNA1H gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 H, which is a critical component of T-type calcium channels, specifically the Ca v 3.2 channel. These channels are categorized as transmembrane proteins and are characterized by their low-voltage activation, playing essential roles in various physiological processes, including neuronal excitability and muscle function. The Ca v 3.2 channel is involved in the regulation of calcium ion flow across cell membranes, influencing electrical signaling and cellular communication. It is particularly significant in the central nervous system, where it contributes to neuronal firing patterns and is implicated in conditions such as idiopathic generalized epilepsies and autism spectrum disorders. The gene's expression in diverse tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, underscores its broad physiological relevance and potential impact on health and disease (Li2020CACNA1H; Vitko2005Functional; Zhong2006A).

## Structure
The CACNA1H gene encodes the Ca v 3.2 T-type calcium channel, which is a low-voltage-activated channel involved in various physiological processes. The primary structure of the protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the α1H subunit, which is a large protein with a molecular weight exceeding 200 kDa (PEREZREYES2006Molecular). The secondary structure includes multiple transmembrane segments, with each repeat containing an S4 voltage sensor and an S6 segment lining the inner wall of the channel (PEREZREYES2006Molecular). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these segments to form the functional channel, which includes a pore-forming region and voltage-sensing domains. The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the context provided. The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can affect its function and expression in different tissues (Zhong2006A). These splice variants can lead to differences in gating parameters and sensitivity to neuromodulation (Zhong2006A). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are also noted, with specific exons containing conserved phosphorylation sites that mediate neuromodulation (Zhong2006A). The gene's complex splicing and structural features contribute to its role in various neurological disorders.

## Function
The CACNA1H gene encodes the Ca v 3.2 subunit of T-type calcium channels, which are low-voltage-activated channels involved in various cellular processes. These channels are crucial for regulating calcium ion flow across cell membranes, influencing electrical signaling and cellular communication in healthy human cells (Zhong2006A). In the central nervous system, particularly in the neocortex and thalamus, Ca v 3.2 channels play significant roles in neuronal excitability and firing patterns. They are involved in generating synchronous spike-wave discharges associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies, such as childhood absence epilepsy (Vitko2005Functional; Zhong2006A).

The channels activate at negative membrane potentials and exhibit slow gating kinetics, contributing to slow oscillations of neuronal firing threshold, low threshold spikes, and rhythmic burst firing of thalamic relay neurons (Zhong2006A). In skeletal muscle, CACNA1H is involved in maintaining muscle integrity and function by regulating calcium homeostasis and preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy flux blockade, which are crucial for muscle health (Li2020CACNA1H). The gene is also expressed in peripheral tissues like the liver, pancreas, heart, and kidney, indicating its broad physiological relevance (Zhong2006A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CACNA1H gene, which encodes the T-type calcium channel subunit alpha1 H, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Variants in CACNA1H are associated with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs), including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) (Heron2007Extended). These variants often result in altered channel function, such as increased calcium current, which can enhance neuronal excitability and contribute to epileptogenesis (Heron2007Extended). 

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), mutations in CACNA1H have been identified in individuals with ASD but not in control groups, suggesting a potential role in ASD susceptibility. These mutations can alter the functional properties of the channel, affecting neuronal calcium influx and potentially contributing to the development of ASD (Splawski2006CACNA1H; Viggiano2022Contribution).

The gene's extensive alternative splicing and the presence of missense mutations can also influence the biophysical properties of the channel, potentially affecting its function and contributing to disease states like IGEs and CAE (Zhong2006A).

## Interactions
The CACNA1H gene encodes the Ca v 3.2 T-type calcium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with calnexin, a chaperone protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Calnexin interacts with both the luminal and cytosolic regions of Ca v 3.2 channels, affecting their trafficking to the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the proper surface expression of the channels, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Proft2017The).

In the context of the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (GAERS) model, a mutation in the CACNA1H gene alters the interaction between Ca v 3.2 and calnexin, leading to increased surface expression and enhanced calcium influx. This mutation, located in the III-IV linker region of the channel, decreases the binding of calnexin, which is associated with increased T-type calcium currents and contributes to the pathophysiology of absence epilepsy (Proft2017The).

These interactions highlight the role of calnexin in modulating the surface expression and function of Ca v 3.2 channels, with implications for neurological disorders such as epilepsy (Proft2017The).
