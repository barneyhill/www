# FAM98C

## Overview
FAM98C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 98, member C. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA binding and interaction with paraspeckle components, which are nuclear bodies involved in the regulation of gene expression (Kim2021RNA-Binding). The FAM98C protein is implicated in neurological and ciliopathy-related disorders, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Bui2024Pathogeniclikely; Shaheen2016Characterizing). While the precise biological functions of FAM98C remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests it may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM98C gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a specific mutation in FAM98C classified as 'likely pathogenic' in Vietnamese children diagnosed with ASD, resulting in a 'stop gained' variant. This suggests a potential role for FAM98C in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurological conditions (Bui2024Pathogeniclikely).

FAM98C has also been identified as a novel candidate gene associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders related to the dysfunction of cilia, which are cellular structures involved in sensory and signaling functions. The gene harbors homozygous loss-of-function variants, indicating its potential involvement in these disorders. However, specific diseases or conditions directly linked to FAM98C mutations in ciliopathies have not been detailed (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion; Shaheen2016Characterizing).

While FAM98C is mentioned in the context of ALS and FTD due to its interaction with paraspeckle components, the excerpt does not specifically discuss mutations or alterations in the FAM98C gene itself in relation to these conditions (Kim2021RNA-Binding).
