# AKR7A2

## Overview
AKR7A2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 7 member A2, which belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular detoxification processes by reducing aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols, thereby mitigating oxidative stress and protecting cells from damage. AKR7A2 is notably active in the human brain, where it contributes to the metabolism of succinic semialdehyde to gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a neuromodulator involved in neurotransmission. Additionally, the enzyme is highly expressed in the myocardium, where it participates in the metabolism of anthracyclines, drugs used in cancer treatment, which can lead to cardiotoxicity. The expression of AKR7A2 is regulated by transcription factors such as NF-κB, and its interactions with proteins like cytoglobin suggest broader roles in cellular physiology. Alterations in AKR7A2 expression have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (QuiñonesLombraña2019Insights; Picklo2001Elevation; Habermann2011Genomic).

## Function
The AKR7A2 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, which plays a crucial role in detoxifying aldehydes and ketones by reducing them to alcohols. In healthy human cells, AKR7A2 is involved in cellular detoxification pathways, metabolizing a broad range of endogenous and exogenous carbonyl-containing compounds. This includes the reduction of toxic aldehydes, which are byproducts of lipid peroxidation, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress (Picklo2001Elevation).

AKR7A2 is particularly active in the human brain, where it is responsible for the reduction of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a neuromodulator that may affect GABA-ergic and dopaminergic signaling (QuiñonesLombraña2019Insights; Picklo2001Elevation). The enzyme is primarily localized in glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as well as in neuromelanin-containing neurons in the midbrain (Picklo2001Elevation).

In the human myocardium, AKR7A2 is the most abundant enzyme involved in the metabolism of anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin, contributing to the synthesis of cardiotoxic metabolites (QuiñonesLombraña2019Insights). Its expression and activity are subject to transcriptional regulation and can be influenced by factors such as NF-κB and DNA methylation (QuiñonesLombraña2019Insights; Hoefer2015Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AKR7A2 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), AKR7A2 expression is significantly elevated, particularly in the superior and middle temporal gyrus of AD patients. This elevation is associated with the presence of AKR7A2 in senile plaques and Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of these conditions (Picklo2001Elevation). The increased expression of AKR7A2 in reactive astrocytes and microglial cells suggests a response to injury and a potential role in modulating neuromodulatory pathways in these diseases (Picklo2001Elevation).

AKR7A2 is also involved in the detoxification of reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which are associated with oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders (Picklo2001Elevation). The enzyme's role in the metabolism of γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a neuromodulator affecting GABA-ergic and dopaminergic signaling, indicates that changes in AKR7A2 expression could impact neuromodulation in these diseases (Picklo2001Elevation).

In the context of cancer, AKR7A2 overexpression has been identified as a potential target for diagnosis and treatment in endometrial cancer, particularly in endometrioid endometrial cancer (Habermann2011Genomic).

## Interactions
AKR7A2, a member of the aldo-keto reductase family, has been identified to physically interact with cytoglobin (CYGB), a member of the globin family. This interaction was discovered through immunoprecipitation combined with two-dimensional electrophoresis-mass spectrometry assays and further validated using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The interaction suggests a potential role for CYGB in fibrotic organ disorders and its expression in various tissues, particularly in fibroblasts and fibroblast-related cell lineages. The specific functional implications of the AKR7A2-CYGB interaction remain to be further explored (Li2016The).

In addition to protein-protein interactions, AKR7A2 is involved in transcriptional regulation mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB binds to a conserved motif in the AKR7A2 promoter region, influencing its basal expression. This interaction was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated NF-κB's binding to the AKR7A2 promoter (QuiñonesLombraña2019Insights). These interactions highlight the role of AKR7A2 in cellular processes such as oxidative stress response and metabolism, although further research is needed to fully understand the breadth of its interactions and their implications.
