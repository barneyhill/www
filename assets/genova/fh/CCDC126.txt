# CCDC126

## Overview
CCDC126, or coiled-coil domain containing 126, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These domains are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC126 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC126 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in heart failure and lung function, as well as its downregulation in certain thyroid carcinomas, indicating a possible role in disease mechanisms (Morin2018Exploring; Moncla2022Mendelian; Shi2019Analysis). Additionally, the CCDC126 gene has been noted for its involvement in exon scrambling, a splicing phenomenon observed in both normal and cancerous cells (Salzman2012Circular). Further studies are required to clarify the precise functions and clinical implications of CCDC126.

## Clinical Significance
CCDC126 has been implicated in several health conditions through various studies. A Mendelian randomization analysis identified CCDC126 as one of the blood proteins significantly associated with heart failure, suggesting it as a causal molecular candidate for this condition (Moncla2022Mendelian). In the context of lung function, CCDC126 was marginally associated with the FEV1/FVC ratio, a measure related to lung function, in a study on the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean population, although the evidence was not strong enough to establish a definitive link to specific diseases (Morin2018Exploring).

In thyroid carcinomas associated with medical occupational radiation exposure, CCDC126 was among the top 20 downregulated mRNAs, indicating a potential role in the disease's molecular pathology (Shi2019Analysis). Additionally, CCDC126 was identified as having scrambled exon junctions in a study on exon scrambling, which occurs in both cancerous and normal cells, though no specific disease association was made beyond this splicing phenomenon (Salzman2012Circular).

These findings suggest that alterations in CCDC126 expression or function may contribute to various health conditions, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
