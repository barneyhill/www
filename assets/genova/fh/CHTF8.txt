# CHTF8

## Overview
The CHTF8 gene encodes the protein chromosome transmission fidelity factor 8, which plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. This protein is essential for the fidelity of chromosome transmission, acting as a safeguard against chromosomal instability, which can lead to various genetic disorders and contribute to oncogenesis. As a key player in cell cycle regulation, CHTF8 is involved in complex interactions that are vital for proper cellular function. Disruptions in the expression or function of CHTF8 can result in significant clinical implications, including an increased risk of cancer and other genetic abnormalities (CHTF8).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CHTF8 gene can lead to chromosomal instability, which is a significant factor in the development of cancer. This instability arises because CHTF8 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and disruptions in its function can result in improper chromosome segregation during cell division. Such errors can accumulate, potentially leading to oncogenesis. In addition to cancer, alterations in CHTF8 expression or its interactions may affect cell cycle regulation, increasing the risk of various genetic disorders. These disruptions can compromise the fidelity of chromosome transmission, making cells more susceptible to genetic abnormalities. The precise mechanisms by which CHTF8 mutations contribute to these conditions are still under investigation, but the gene's role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation highlights its importance in preventing disease (CHTF8).
