# CDK8

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 8, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of transcription. As a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family, CDK8 plays a pivotal role in modulating gene expression by interacting with the Mediator complex, which serves as a bridge between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Dannappel2019Molecular; Donner2010CDK8). The protein is characterized by a kinase domain and a unique αB-helix, which facilitates its specific interaction with cyclin C, forming a complex that is integral to the Mediator's function (Ziada2024Highlighting). CDK8 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immediate early genes and several signaling pathways, such as BMP/TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin (Donner2010CDK8; Wu2021Angel). Clinically, CDK8 is associated with oncogenic activities in cancers like colorectal and breast cancer, as well as developmental disorders characterized by autism spectrum disorder and congenital heart disease (Xu2011Dysregulation; Calpena2019De).

## Structure
CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. The primary structure of CDK8 includes a kinase domain, which is typical of the cyclin-dependent kinase family (Ziada2024Highlighting). The secondary structure of CDK8 features alpha helices and beta sheets, with a unique αB-helix that is not found in other CDKs (Ziada2024Highlighting). This αB-helix contributes to specific interactions with cyclin C, forming hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that are essential for the specificity and tight binding of CDK8 to CycC (Ziada2024Highlighting).

The tertiary structure of CDK8 involves a typical kinase fold, with the catalytic site located between its N- and C-terminal lobes (Ziada2024Highlighting). CDK8's quaternary structure includes its association with cyclin C, forming a complex that is part of the larger Mediator complex (Ziada2024Highlighting). This complex is stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal lobes of CDK8 and CycC, with the αC-helix playing a crucial role in maintaining the active conformation of CDK8 (Endicott2013Structural). CDK8 does not require phosphorylation for activation due to the absence of a conserved threonine residue, which is replaced by a DMG motif (Ziada2024Highlighting).

## Function
CDK8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation in healthy human cells. It is part of the Mediator complex, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression by facilitating communication between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Dannappel2019Molecular; Donner2010CDK8). CDK8 acts as a positive regulator of transcriptional elongation within the serum response network by influencing the phosphorylation of the RNAPII C-terminal domain (CTD) at Ser2 and Ser5, which is critical for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Donner2010CDK8).

CDK8 is involved in the regulation of immediate early genes (IEGs) that are rapidly transcribed following growth factor signaling, such as FOS and EGR family members. Its depletion leads to impaired RNAPII elongation and decreased expression of these genes (Donner2010CDK8). CDK8 also interacts with P-TEFb and the Mediator complex, suggesting a role in loading P-TEFb at promoters, which is essential for efficient transcriptional elongation (Donner2010CDK8). CDK8's kinase activity is regulated by its incorporation into different complexes, such as the Mediator, and by other factors like Med12 (Knuesel2009Thea).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the CDK8 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, CDK8 acts as an oncoprotein, with its overexpression linked to the progression of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. In colorectal cancer, CDK8 is frequently amplified, promoting tumorigenesis through pathways such as β-catenin activation (Xu2011Dysregulation; Xi2019CDK8). In breast cancer, CDK8 expression is associated with higher tumor stages and nodal metastasis, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapy response (Roninson2019Identifying; Broude2015Expression).

CDK8 mutations are also linked to a syndromic developmental disorder characterized by autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and congenital heart disease (CHD). These mutations, often de novo missense substitutions, affect the kinase domain of CDK8, leading to reduced kinase activity and developmental abnormalities (Calpena2019De). The mutations are not consistent with haploinsufficiency, indicating a dominant-negative mechanism of pathogenesis (Calpena2019De).

CDK8's role in cancer is complex, as it can also act as a tumor inhibitor in certain contexts, such as in the Apc Min murine intestinal tumor model, where its deletion increased tumor growth (Xi2019CDK8).

## Interactions
CDK8 is a component of the CDK8 subcomplex, which includes cyclin C, MED12, and MED13. This subcomplex interacts with the Mediator complex, specifically binding to the leg/tail domain of the core Mediator. This interaction is crucial for repressing the coactivator function of the Mediator, with MED13 playing a critical role in this binding (Knuesel2009The). The CDK8 subcomplex can bind to the core Mediator in a mutually exclusive manner with RNA polymerase II (pol II), preventing pol II from associating with the Mediator and thus repressing transcription (Elmlund2006The; Knuesel2009The).

CDK8 also interacts with various transcription factors and signaling pathways. It phosphorylates transcription factors, affecting their activity or leading to their degradation. In the BMP/TGF-β pathway, CDK8 enhances the trans-activation potential of R-Smad proteins. It also regulates the NOTCH signaling pathway by phosphorylating the NOTCH intracellular domain, influencing inter-cellular communication and T cell differentiation (Wu2021Angel). CDK8's interactions extend to the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, where it affects β-catenin's stability and transcriptional activity (Xi2019CDK8).
