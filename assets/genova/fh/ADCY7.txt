# ADCY7

## Overview
ADCY7 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 7, a member of the adenylyl cyclase family, which is integral to the plasma membrane and plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling. Adenylate cyclase 7 is an enzyme responsible for converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a crucial second messenger involved in regulating numerous physiological processes, including metabolism, gene transcription, and cell growth (Hellevuo1997Human). The protein is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum, thalamus, and hypothalamus, and is also significant in immune cells like T and B lymphocytes (Devasani2022Expression). ADCY7's involvement in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by G protein-coupled receptors and hypoxia-inducible factors, underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia and hypoxia-induced cellular responses (Li2015ADCY7; Simko2017Hypoxia).

## Function
ADCY7 encodes adenylate cyclase 7, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a vital second messenger involved in numerous cellular processes. This enzyme is part of the G-protein-regulated, plasma membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase family, which is responsible for catalyzing the formation of cAMP from ATP. cAMP is essential for the activation of protein kinase A and various cellular processes, including metabolism, gene transcription, and cell growth (Hellevuo1997Human).

ADCY7 is primarily expressed in the cerebellum and is the major adenylyl cyclase isoform in human platelets. It is involved in the sensitivity of cerebellar Purkinje cells to ethanol, which affects motor functions such as standing steadiness (Hellevuo1997Human). In the central nervous system, ADCY7 mRNA is predominantly found in the thalamus and hypothalamus, with protein expression mainly in the hippocampus, cerebellum, caudate-putamen, cerebral cortex, and nucleus accumbens (Devasani2022Expression).

ADCY7 is also a significant contributor to cAMP production in T and B lymphocytes, playing an essential role in immune responses. Its loss leads to fewer leukocytes and higher mortality upon bacterial infections (Devasani2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the ADCY7 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In a study investigating congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in a cohort from northeast Brazil, a missense variant c.1297G>A in the ADCY7 gene was identified. This variant was found to have a protective effect against CZS, with an odds ratio of 0.2, suggesting it may influence susceptibility or resistance to the syndrome. The variant was classified as functional and potentially pathogenic, indicating it could affect protein activity or structure (Rossi2018Variations).

In another study focusing on genetic variants associated with cancer mortality in pedigree dog breeds, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the intron region of the ADCY7 gene was identified. This SNP, rs22821286, was associated with cancer mortality residuals, although the correlations were relatively weak. The study highlights the complexity of identifying SNPs associated with cancer mortality, suggesting a potential role for ADCY7 in cancer-related pathways (Doherty2020A).

These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of ADCY7 in various conditions, warranting further research to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms.

## Interactions
ADCY7, or adenylate cyclase 7, is involved in various cellular signaling pathways through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to be an effector of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, specifically interacting with Gα12 and Gα13 subunits, which are part of the signaling pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Li2015ADCY7). In the context of insulin secretion, ADCY7 may interact with transcription factors such as Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1) and Forkhead Box Protein A2 (Foxa2), which are upregulated in the absence of ADCY7, suggesting potential regulatory interactions in the insulin secretion pathway (Alhaidan2021CRISPRCas9). 

ADCY7 is also implicated in hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, where its expression is upregulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), indicating a transcriptional interaction under low oxygen conditions (Simko2017Hypoxia). This upregulation is part of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular adaptation to hypoxia (Simko2017Hypoxia). However, specific physical interactions of ADCY7 with other proteins or nucleic acids, such as multiprotein complexes, are not detailed in the available context.
