# PTPRH

## Overview
PTPRH, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type H, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, which is part of the R3 subgroup of receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs). This protein is characterized by its extracellular fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and a single intracellular phosphatase domain, which collectively facilitate its role in dephosphorylating phospho-tyrosine residues (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine; El2024Analysis). PTPRH is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal immunity and regulating cell signaling pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway (Murata2015Protein; Ortiz2024Unraveling). The protein's involvement in cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis underscores its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, including its tumor suppressor role in colorectal cancer and its association with non-small cell lung cancer (Bujko2017Downregulation; Wang2023PTPRH).

## Structure
PTPRH, also known as SAP-1, is a member of the R3 subgroup of receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs). It is characterized by an extracellular domain composed of multiple fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a single intracellular phosphatase domain (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine; El2024Analysis). The number of FN3 domains in human R3 PTPs ranges from 9 to 17, and these domains are modified by N-linked glycosylation (El2024Analysis). 

PTPRH is involved in dephosphorylating phospho-tyrosine residues, a function shared by other R3 RPTPs except for PTPRQ, which targets phosphatidylinositides (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine). While alternative splicing is noted for some R3 PTPs, specific splice variants for PTPRH have not been documented (El2024Analysis). 

The structural information for the extracellular domain of PTPRH is limited, and its function in ligand interactions remains unclear, as no specific ligands have been identified for PTPRH (El2024Analysis). The evolutionary origin of R3 RPTPs, including PTPRH, is traced back to the common ancestor of animals, with diversification events in deuterostomes leading to the current vertebrate members (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine).

## Function
PTPRH, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type H, is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in regulating various cellular processes through dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues. In healthy human cells, PTPRH is primarily localized to the microvilli of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract, including the small intestine and colon (Murata2015Protein). It plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal immunity by regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 20 (CEACAM20), which is involved in cell signaling pathways that protect against colitis (Murata2015Protein).

PTPRH is also involved in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, which is essential for cell signaling related to growth and differentiation. It negatively regulates EGFR signaling by dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues, thereby influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Ortiz2024Unraveling). In the context of colorectal cancer, PTPRH acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis through the modulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways (Bujko2017Downregulation). Its expression is tissue-specific, with significant activity in the gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to cellular adhesion and communication (Bujko2017Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
PTPRH, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type H, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTPRH is often overexpressed, which is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor progression through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This overexpression correlates with increased glycolysis and tumor growth, suggesting that PTPRH plays a significant role in NSCLC pathogenesis (Wang2023PTPRH). Conversely, PTPRH mutations in NSCLC are rare and tend to be mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations, indicating a complex role in tumorigenesis (Ortiz2024Unraveling).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), PTPRH is significantly downregulated, primarily due to increased DNA methylation at its promoter region. This downregulation is linked to its potential tumor suppressor role, as it is involved in pathways that inhibit cell growth and motility (Bujko2017Downregulation). The epigenetic silencing of PTPRH in CRC suggests that it may contribute to cancer progression by allowing unchecked cellular proliferation (Bujko2017Downregulation).

Overall, PTPRH's role in cancer varies by tissue type, with its expression and regulatory mechanisms influencing cancer progression differently across various cancers.

## Interactions
PTPRH, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type H, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTPRH has been shown to interact with several proteins, including CDK5RAP3 and EIF2AK2, which are involved in regulating the NF-κB pathway, a downstream component of the EGFR pathway (Ortiz2024Unraveling). Although PTPRH does not directly interact with EGFR, it modulates EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting an indirect regulatory role possibly mediated through other proteins or pathways (Ortiz2024Unraveling).

PTPRH also interacts with proteins related to the actin cytoskeleton, such as THBS-1, MYO1C, and MYO1B, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal processes (Ortiz2024Unraveling). Additionally, PTPRH has been associated with BRAP, a negative regulator of MAP kinase activation, and several proteins involved in translation, RNA binding, and ATPase activity (Ortiz2024Unraveling). These interactions suggest that PTPRH may have non-canonical roles beyond its expected function in tyrosine kinase pathways, potentially influencing RNA processing and ribosomal protein pathways (Ortiz2024Unraveling).
