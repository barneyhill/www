# RAD23B

## Overview
RAD23B is a gene that encodes the RAD23 homolog B, a nucleotide excision repair protein that plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response. This protein is integral to the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, particularly in the global genome NER (GG-NER) sub-pathway, where it functions as a damage sensor in complex with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein. RAD23 homolog B is characterized by its ubiquitin-like domain, which facilitates interactions with the proteasome, linking DNA repair to protein degradation processes. This interaction underscores its regulatory role in maintaining protein stability and genomic integrity under genotoxic stress (Schauber1998Rad23; Ng2003A). The protein's ability to stabilize XPC and prevent its degradation is crucial for efficient DNA repair, highlighting its importance in cellular defense mechanisms against mutagenic agents (Ng2003A).

## Function
RAD23B is a crucial component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light and chemical mutagens. In healthy human cells, RAD23B forms a complex with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, acting as a primary damage sensor that initiates the global genome NER (GG-NER) process. This complex is essential for recognizing and binding to DNA lesions, facilitating the recruitment of other repair factors necessary for the excision and repair of damaged DNA (Mu2018Molecular; Ng2003A).

RAD23B stabilizes XPC by preventing its degradation via the 26S proteasome, ensuring adequate levels of XPC for efficient DNA repair. This stabilization is particularly important under conditions of high DNA damage, where RAD23B helps up-regulate XPC and the GG-NER pathway (Ng2003A). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer (Ng2003A).

RAD23B also interacts with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, linking DNA repair to protein degradation processes. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in modulating protein stability in response to genotoxic stress (Schauber1998Rad23).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the RAD23B gene have been associated with increased cancer risk, particularly in the context of environmental exposures. The RAD23B Ala249Val polymorphism has been linked to a higher risk of lung cancer in Xuan Wei, China, a region with high exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from smoky coal emissions. Individuals carrying the Val allele at codon 249 of RAD23B have shown a two-fold increased risk of lung cancer (Shen2005Polymorphisms). This polymorphism, when combined with other genetic variations such as the XPC Lys939Gln polymorphism, can further elevate lung cancer risk, suggesting a potential interaction between these genes in influencing susceptibility (Shen2005Polymorphisms).

In the context of laryngeal cancer, the RAD23B Ala249Val polymorphism has been associated with increased risk among heavy smokers and alcohol consumers. Heterozygous individuals and Val allele carriers exhibit a significantly enhanced risk, indicating that RAD23B polymorphisms may modify cancer risk in the presence of DNA-damaging agents like tobacco and alcohol (Abbasi2009Laryngeal). Despite these associations, a meta-analysis found no significant overall link between the RAD23B Ala249Val polymorphism and general cancer susceptibility, suggesting that its impact may be context-dependent (Li2014The).

## Interactions
RAD23B, a human homolog of yeast RAD23, plays a significant role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) by interacting with various proteins. It forms a complex with the XPC protein, which is crucial for the recognition of DNA damage in the NER pathway. This interaction enhances the repair synthesis activity of XPC, indicating that RAD23B is essential for effective DNA repair (Sugasawa1996HHR23B). 

RAD23B contains a ubiquitin-like domain that is involved in protein interactions and may function as a molecular chaperone. This domain is conserved across eukaryotes and is implicated in regulatory processes such as DNA repair and protein degradation (Masutani1994Purification). RAD23B's ubiquitin-like domain also interacts with the proteasome, linking DNA repair to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is important for the stabilization of repair complexes and may regulate the activity of XPC (Schauber1998Rad23).

RAD23B is also involved in the assembly of the XPCC-HHR23B complex, which has a high affinity for single-stranded DNA, although it is not clear which component is responsible for this property (Masutani1994Purification). The interaction of RAD23B with the proteasome and its role in regulating protein stability and DNA repair are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Ortolan2000The).
