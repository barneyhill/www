# ATP6V1G3

## Overview
ATP6V1G3 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit G3, a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This complex is a critical enzyme responsible for acidifying intracellular compartments, a process essential for various cellular functions such as protein degradation and neurotransmitter release. The ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit G3 is part of the peripheral V1 domain, which is involved in ATP hydrolysis, driving the proton translocation mechanism of the V-ATPase (Chu2021The). The protein is hydrophilic and lacks transmembrane segments, indicating its role in the peripheral catalytic sector of the enzyme complex (Smith2002Molecular). ATP6V1G3 is specifically expressed in the kidney, suggesting a specialized function in renal physiology, particularly in maintaining pH homeostasis in renal intercalated cells (Smith2002Molecular; SunWada2003Diversity).

## Structure
The ATP6V1G3 gene encodes the G3 protein, a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex. The G3 protein consists of 118 amino acids and has a predicted molecular weight of 13.9 kDa (Smith2002Molecular). It shares significant sequence identity with other G subunit isoforms, showing 53% identity with G1 and 54% with G2, and exhibits 75% and 74% similarity with these isoforms, respectively (Smith2002Molecular). The G3 protein is hydrophilic and lacks transmembrane segments, suggesting its location in the peripheral V1 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex (Smith2002Molecular).

The G3 protein is expressed specifically in the kidney and is not observed during embryonic stages (SunWada2003Diversity). An alternative transcript of ATP6V1G3 includes an additional 46 bp exon between exons 1 and 2, which disrupts the reading frame and introduces a premature termination codon, resulting in a truncated protein with the first 27 amino acids in common with G3, followed by 32 novel amino acids. The biological relevance of this splice variant remains unknown (Smith2002Molecular). The G3 isoform's inability to complement the yeast Dvma10 mutation suggests that its carboxyl-terminal region may be critical for assembly with other subunits or have a role in catalysis (SunWada2003Diversity).

## Function
ATP6V1G3 encodes a subunit of the V1 domain of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which is a crucial enzyme complex responsible for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The V-ATPase complex is composed of a peripheral catalytic sector (V1) and a membrane-bound proton channel sector (VO). The V1 sector, where ATP6V1G3 is located, is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, which drives the rotation of the proteolipid c-ring in the VO sector, facilitating proton translocation across membranes (Chu2021The).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1G3 is specifically expressed in the kidney, suggesting a tissue-specific role in renal function. It is involved in the stabilization and regulation of V1V0 interactions within the proton pump structure, potentially playing a role in the peripheral 'stator' of the proton pump, which connects the cytosolic V1 and membrane V0 sectors (Smith2002Molecular). This function is particularly important in specialized epithelial cells, such as renal intercalated cells, where V-ATPases are present in the plasma membrane and contribute to pH homeostasis (Smith2002Molecular).
