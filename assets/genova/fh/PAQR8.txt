# PAQR8

## Overview
PAQR8 is a gene that encodes the protein progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 8, also known as membrane progesterone receptor beta (mPRβ). This protein is categorized as a receptor and is part of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family, which is characterized by a unique structural motif that diverges from the classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) architecture. Unlike typical GPCRs, PAQR8 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains, which suggests an atypical signaling mechanism (Kasubuchi2017Membrane). The protein's structure and function are subjects of ongoing research, with studies indicating its involvement in various cellular processes and potential post-translational modifications (Chen2023PAQR8). PAQR8 has been implicated in significant clinical contexts, including breast cancer and actinic keratosis, highlighting its potential role in disease progression and therapy resistance (Zhong2017PigmentationIndependent; Chen2023PAQR8).

## Structure
PAQR8, also known as membrane progesterone receptor beta (mPRβ), is a member of the progestin and adipoQ receptor family. The protein is predicted to have an incomplete G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) topology, featuring six transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, which is atypical for GPCRs that usually have seven transmembrane domains (Kasubuchi2017Membrane). This structure suggests that PAQR8 does not exhibit typical GPCR signaling characteristics (Kasubuchi2017Membrane).

The PAQR8 protein is part of a family that includes receptors with varying numbers of transmembrane domains, and its structure and signaling pathways are still subjects of research (Kasubuchi2017Membrane). The protein is suggested to have a GPCR-like structure with an extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus, although its exact molecular structure remains debated (Chen2023PAQR8). The PAQR family, to which PAQR8 belongs, is characterized by an ancient 7-transmembrane structural motif found in various organisms, although PAQR8 itself is noted for its unique structure compared to traditional GPCRs (Si2023Structure). The protein's role in cellular processes and its potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are areas of ongoing research.

## Clinical Significance
PAQR8 is implicated in breast cancer, particularly in promoting recurrence and resistance to multiple therapies. Alterations in PAQR8 expression, such as copy number gain, are frequently observed in recurrent metastatic breast tumors. This gain is mutually exclusive with activating mutations in the ESR1 gene, suggesting a potential redundant role in therapy resistance. Patients with recurrent tumors exhibiting PAQR8 copy number gain have significantly poorer survival outcomes following clinical progression. PAQR8 promotes resistance to various therapies, including estrogen receptor pathway inhibitors, Her2 pathway blockers, and chemotherapeutic agents, by enhancing tumor cell survival through a G i protein-dependent reduction in cAMP levels. This pro-survival effect involves changes in ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate levels, indicating a possible ceramidase activity of PAQR8 (Chen2023PAQR8).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, PAQR8 has been associated with actinic keratosis (AK), a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma. Genetic studies have identified PAQR8 as a susceptibility locus for AK, suggesting its involvement in pathways contributing to AK development, although the exact mechanisms remain to be further explored (Zhong2017PigmentationIndependent).
