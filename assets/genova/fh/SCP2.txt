# SCP2

## Overview
Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) is a gene that encodes a non-specific lipid transfer protein involved in the intracellular transport and metabolism of lipids, particularly cholesterol and fatty acids. The SCP2 protein is categorized as a lipid-binding protein and plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis by facilitating the transfer of lipids between cellular membranes. It is predominantly localized in peroxisomes, where it is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain fatty acids and the modulation of lipid droplet composition. The protein's structure, characterized by a dome-shaped configuration with a large hydrophobic binding cavity, allows it to accommodate and transport bulky hydrophobic ligands. Mutations in the SCP2 gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal lipid metabolism and energy production (Galano2022SCP2; Atshaves2001Sterol; Seedorf1998Defective).

## Structure
The human sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) is involved in intracellular lipid transport and exhibits a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SCP2 consists of a sequence of amino acids, with specific regions critical for its function. The secondary structure is characterized by approximately 40% alpha-helix content, particularly within the first 30 amino-terminal residues, which includes an amphipathic alpha-helix crucial for activity (Seedorf1994Structureactivity). The tertiary structure of SCP2 features a dome-shaped configuration with a five-stranded, mixed β-sheet floor covered by four α-helices, forming a large inner binding cavity. This cavity is lined with aliphatic and aromatic side chains, allowing it to accommodate bulky hydrophobic ligands (Gianotti2018Binding; Gianotti2021The).

SCP2 does not have extended hydrophobic domains or stable associations with lipids, suggesting it facilitates lipid exchange by providing a hydrophobic bridge between membranes (Seedorf1994Structureactivity). The protein is synthesized as a 143-amino acid precursor and processed to a 123-amino acid mature form, with high conservation across species (Seedorf1994Structureactivity). SCP2 may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and have splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) is a key player in lipid metabolism, primarily involved in the intracellular transport and metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids. SCP2 is known for its high affinity for fatty acids, fatty acyl-CoAs, cholesterol, and phospholipids, facilitating their transfer within cells (Atshaves2001Sterol). It is predominantly localized in peroxisomes, where it plays a crucial role in the peroxisomal uptake and catabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, such as phytanic acid, by acting as a binding protein for phytanoyl-CoA (Seedorf1998Defective).

SCP2 is also involved in modulating the composition of lipid droplets, which are essential for energy storage and lipid metabolism. It influences the protein and lipid components of these droplets, affecting the distribution and mass of fatty acids and cholesterol (Atshaves2001Sterol). SCP2 expression alters the lipid composition of droplets by decreasing their cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and unesterified fatty acid content, enhancing cholesterol transfer to mitochondria for oxidation (Atshaves2001Sterol).

In healthy cells, SCP2 contributes to maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy production by facilitating the intracellular trafficking and metabolism of lipids, particularly in peroxisomal and mitochondrial pathways (Seedorf1998Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCP2 gene, which encodes the sterol carrier protein-x (SCPx), are associated with several metabolic and clinical disorders. These mutations can lead to SCPx deficiency, impacting lipid metabolism and resulting in conditions such as brainstem neurodegeneration, azoospermia, and testicular defects (Galano2022SCP2). Patients with SCP2 mutations may exhibit symptoms like progressive neurodegeneration, primary hypogonadism, and azoospermia, with some cases linked to leukoencephalopathy, dystonia, and motor neuropathy (Galano2022SCP2).

The SCP2 gene variant can cause alterations in lipid metabolism, including changes in fatty acid β-oxidation and cholesterol metabolism, which may contribute to low testosterone levels and hypogonadism (Galano2022SCP2). Altered cholesterol and phospholipid levels have been observed, potentially affecting steroid biosynthesis and contributing to neurodegenerative conditions (Galano2022SCP2).

A novel splicing mutation in SCP2 has been associated with a rare disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation dysfunction, leading to episodic psychosis and neurological symptoms (Tang2023Case). These findings highlight the critical role of SCP2 in maintaining normal lipid metabolism and the potential consequences of its disruption.

## Interactions
Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) is known to interact directly with caveolin-1, a protein involved in the formation of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. This interaction has been demonstrated through various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. The yeast two-hybrid assay confirmed the interaction by showing specific growth patterns on selective media and the induction of reporter genes (Zhou2004Sterol). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments further supported this interaction, indicating that SCP2 and caveolin-1 can be coimmunoprecipitated, while SCP2 does not coimmunoprecipitate with phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP), highlighting the specificity of the interaction (Zhou2004Sterol).

FRET analysis revealed that SCP2 and caveolin-1 are in close proximity, with an intermolecular distance of approximately 48 Å, suggesting a direct interaction at the plasma membrane (Zhou2004Sterol). This interaction is significant for SCP2's role in cholesterol trafficking, as it may influence cholesterol transport to caveolae/lipid rafts and potentially regulate cholesterol efflux and signaling pathways (Zhou2004Sterol).
