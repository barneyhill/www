# HCAR1

## Overview
HCAR1, or hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1, is a gene that encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in lactate signaling. The receptor, also known as GPR81, is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a structural feature typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane. HCAR1 is primarily activated by lactate, a key metabolic substrate and signaling molecule, and plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes and neuronal activity in the brain. The receptor's interactions with monocarboxylate transporters and its involvement in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications underscore its importance in cellular metabolism and gene expression. HCAR1's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in cancer progression, where alterations in its expression and function are linked to tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to cell death mechanisms (Morland2015The; Zhao2020HCAR1MCT1; Nezhady2022Nuclear).

## Structure
HCAR1, also known as GPR81, is a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in lactate signaling. The protein structure of HCAR1 is characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs. These helices contribute to the receptor's ability to traverse the cell membrane and facilitate signal transduction. The primary structure of HCAR1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its functional properties.

The secondary structure of HCAR1 includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, allowing the receptor to maintain its functional shape and interact with other molecules. In terms of quaternary structure, HCAR1 may undergo dimerization, which can influence its signaling capabilities and receptor activity.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are known to occur in HCAR1. These modifications can affect the receptor's function and localization within the cell, potentially altering its responsiveness to ligands and its role in cellular signaling pathways. These structural features and modifications are crucial for the receptor's role in mediating lactate signaling.

## Function
HCAR1, also known as hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1, is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and signaling. It is primarily activated by lactate, which acts as both a metabolic substrate and a signaling molecule. In adipocytes, HCAR1 activation leads to the inhibition of lipolysis through a Gi protein-dependent pathway, reducing cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and thus influencing lipid storage and breakdown (WellbourneWood2022Evaluation; Morland2015The).

In the brain, HCAR1 is involved in regulating neuronal activity and energy metabolism. It is localized in regions such as the hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum, particularly in principal neurons and astrocytes. Activation of HCAR1 by lactate can downregulate neuronal activity, recorded as reduced calcium spiking, and is implicated in linking synaptic function, energy metabolism, and cerebral blood flow (Ma2020Lactate; Morland2015The). HCAR1 also plays a role in neurogenesis, particularly in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), where it mediates lactate-induced neurogenesis, potentially influencing cognitive functions and neuroprotection (Lambertus2020L‐lactate).

HCAR1's activation can lead to the recruitment of β-arrestins, which may activate downstream signaling pathways such as MAPKs, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes (Ma2020Lactate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the HCAR1 gene, also known as hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, HCAR1 is involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Several missense variants in HCAR1 have been identified, with some predicted to be pathogenic, particularly affecting HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes (McGuire2021Rare). 

In ovarian cancer, elevated HCAR1 expression is associated with increased glycolysis and lactate production, supporting tumor growth and metastasis. This receptor's activation influences DNA repair mechanisms, potentially affecting BRCA1 levels, which are critical in DNA repair pathways (Kerslake2022Elevated).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCAR1 is upregulated and linked to resistance against ferroptosis, a form of cell death. This resistance is mediated through the HCAR1/MCT1 pathway, which regulates lactate uptake and impacts the AMPK-SCD1 activity, contributing to poor treatment outcomes (Zhao2020HCAR1MCT1).

The nuclear form of HCAR1 (N-HCAR1) is also significant in cancer malignancy, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and migration by regulating gene expression and interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes (Nezhady2022Nuclear).

## Interactions
HCAR1, also known as hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), which are crucial for lactate uptake and its intracellular activity. This interaction is significant for chromatin rearrangement and enhanced DNA repair in cervical carcinoma cells (Wagner2015L-). HCAR1 also engages in signaling pathways involving the dissociation of the G βγ subunit from the G i protein, leading to Erk activation through PKC-dependent and IGF-1R transactivation-dependent pathways. This suggests a potential HCAR1/IGF-1R/EGFR axis in DNA repair (Wagner2015L-).

In the nucleus, HCAR1 interacts with chromatin remodeling factors and epigenetic modifiers, influencing gene expression and cell migration. It binds to gene complexes and regulates cellular migration, as shown by ChIP-sequencing data (Nezhady2022Nuclear). HCAR1 also interacts with transcriptional factors from chromatin remodeling complexes like INO80, SWI/SNF, and ISWI, modulating their activity (Nezhady2022Nuclear). Additionally, HCAR1 interacts with NSD1, a histone methyltransferase, indicating potential epigenomic alterations that favor cancer malignancy (Nezhady2022Nuclear). These interactions highlight HCAR1's role in cancer progression and cellular response to metabolic changes.
