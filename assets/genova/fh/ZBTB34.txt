# ZBTB34

## Overview
ZBTB34 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 34 protein, which is primarily involved in transcriptional repression. The protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain and three C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor by enabling protein-protein interactions and DNA binding, respectively. The BTB/POZ domain is crucial for dimerization and recruitment of corepressor proteins, while the zinc finger motifs are essential for binding to specific DNA sequences. ZBTB34 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular processes such as telomere length regulation. The protein's interactions with importin proteins and histone deacetylases further underscore its functional significance in cellular regulation and its potential implications in cancer biology (Liu2023ZBTB34; Qi2006ZBTB34).

## Structure
The ZBTB34 protein is characterized by a BTB/POZ domain and three C2H2 zinc finger motifs. The BTB/POZ domain is located at the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 26 to 129, and is known for its role in protein-protein interactions. This domain features a hydrophobic core and a charged pocket, with conserved residues such as His 46, Leu 50, Tyr 88, and Leu 109 contributing to its stabilization. Asp 33 and Lys 47 are critical for the charged pocket, essential for the protein's function as a transcriptional repressor (Qi2006ZBTB34).

The C2H2 zinc finger motifs are located at the C-terminus and are involved in DNA binding, characterized by two cysteine and two histidine residues coordinating a zinc ion (Qi2006ZBTB34). ZBTB34 also contains a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) between amino acids 320 and 329, crucial for its nuclear import, mediated by importin proteins. Key residues Lys 327 and Arg 328 are essential for this process (Liu2023ZBTB34).

ZBTB34 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleus, suggesting its role in transcriptional repression (Qi2006ZBTB34).

## Function
ZBTB34 is a human gene encoding a protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain and zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. The BTB/POZ domain facilitates dimerization and the recruitment of corepressor proteins, contributing to the repression of transcriptional activities of downstream genes (Qi2006ZBTB34). ZBTB34 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, including the heart, brain, and liver, and is localized in the nucleus, where it exerts its repressive functions (Qi2006ZBTB34).

Functional assays have demonstrated that ZBTB34 can significantly reduce the transcriptional activity of a reporter gene, indicating its role in gene silencing. This repression is mediated through the BTB/POZ domain and is dose-dependent. The involvement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) as corepressors in this process is suggested by the attenuation of repression by trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor (Qi2006ZBTB34). ZBTB34's role in transcriptional repression is further supported by its ability to bind to telomere DNA, potentially influencing telomere length and cellular processes related to cell differentiation and apoptosis (Liu2023ZBTB34).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB34 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels serving as a potential prognostic marker. High expression of ZBTB34 is associated with poor prognosis in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), breast cancer (BRAC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Liu2023ZBTB34). In contrast, low expression of ZBTB34 correlates with poor prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Liu2023ZBTB34). In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZBTB34 is expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor tissues compared to normal controls, suggesting its role as a putative oncogene (Liu2023ZBTB34).

The regulation of ZBTB34 expression is influenced by miR-125b-5p, which modulates its levels and affects the expression of other genes such as ZBTB10, POLR1B, and AUH in HepG2 cells (Liu2023ZBTB34). ZBTB34's nuclear localization, facilitated by a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), is crucial for its function, and mutations in the NLS can disrupt its nuclear import, potentially affecting its role in cancer progression (Liu2023ZBTB34). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZBTB34 in cancer prognosis and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ZBTB34 is known to interact with several importin proteins, specifically importin α1, α3, α4, and β1, which are crucial for its nuclear import. This interaction is mediated by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within ZBTB34, identified as RGGRARQKRA, with Lys 327 and Arg 328 being critical residues for this process (Liu2023ZBTB34). The importin α/β1 transport pathway facilitates the nuclear import of ZBTB34, where it binds to importin α proteins in the cytoplasm, which then recruit importin β1 to form a complex that is transported into the nucleus (Liu2023ZBTB34).

ZBTB34 also interacts with nucleic acids, specifically binding to telomere DNA through its zinc finger motifs. This binding is significant in the context of telomere length regulation and cellular stress responses, particularly in liver cancer (Liu2023ZBTB34). The protein's involvement in transcriptional repression is suggested by its potential interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs), as the HDAC inhibitor TSA can attenuate ZBTB34's repressive activity (Qi2006ZBTB34). However, ZBTB34 does not appear to interact directly with the transcriptional corepressor SMRT (Qi2006ZBTB34).
