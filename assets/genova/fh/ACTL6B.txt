# ACTL6B

## Overview
ACTL6B is a gene that encodes the protein actin-like 6B, which is a neural-specific component of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) chromatin remodeling complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression within neurons, particularly in processes such as neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and the maintenance of chromatin structure. Actin-like 6B is primarily active in the nucleus, where it facilitates chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing the transcriptional responses necessary for neuronal development and function (Ahn2020An; Wenderski2020Loss). Mutations in the ACTL6B gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and intellectual developmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in brain development and function (Ahn2020An; Fichera2019Mutations).

## Function
ACTL6B is a neural-specific subunit of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in neurons. In healthy neurons, ACTL6B is part of the neural-specific BAF (nBAF) complex, essential for activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth and long-term potentiation, processes vital for learning and memory (Wenderski2020Loss). ACTL6B suppresses the activity-responsive transcriptional program in resting neurons, maintaining a baseline state of gene expression when neurons are not actively firing (Wenderski2020Loss). It is involved in repressing early response genes, which are typically activated in response to neural activity, thereby maintaining proper gene expression regulation and chromatin structure (Wenderski2020Loss).

ACTL6B is expressed in postmitotic neurons after lineage determination and is required for neurogenesis (Ahn2020An). It coordinates activities to change cellular gene expression patterns, enabling transcription factors and signaling pathways to generate different transcriptional responses to common signals, which is crucial for the proper development and function of neurons (Ahn2020An). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is involved in chromatin remodeling, facilitating access to DNA and influencing processes like neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Ahn2020An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTL6B gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE-76). This condition is characterized by intractable seizures, severe intellectual disability, and autistic features. Patients with EIEE-76 often present with severe global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination (Ahn2020An). Biallelic pathogenic variants in ACTL6B have been identified in individuals with these symptoms, indicating a significant role of the gene in brain development and function (Fichera2019Mutations).

ACTL6B mutations are also linked to Intellectual Developmental Disorder with Severe Speech and Ambulation Defects (IDDSSAD) and autism, highlighting its importance in cognitive processes (Ahn2020An). In addition, ACTL6B is implicated in early onset severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by brain hypomyelination and cerebellar atrophy. Affected individuals often exhibit severe psychomotor delay, spastic tetraplegia, and microcephaly (Fichera2019Mutations).

Research using human induced pluripotent stem cell models has shown that specific ACTL6B variants can lead to impaired protein stability and dysregulated gene expression, contributing to neuronal hyperexcitability and epilepsy (Ahn2020An). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining normal neuronal function and development.

## Interactions
ACTL6B, also known as BAF53B, is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm-associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is essential for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. This complex plays a crucial role in the transition of neural progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons by replacing ACTL6A in the npBAF complex to form the neuron-specific nBAF complex (Ahn2020An). The nBAF complex includes other subunits such as BAF45B, BAF45C, and BAF53B, highlighting the importance of ACTL6B in cell fate determination and the sequential assembly of BAF subunits for specific biological functions in nervous system development (Cenik2020COMPASS).

Mutations in ACTL6B can lead to the recruitment of the non-neuronal isoform ACTL6A in the mutant nBAF complex, impairing chromatin complex interactions (D’Souza2021Chromatin). The ACTL6B protein is also involved in the expression of nBAF target genes such as KCNJ12, MAP2K3, ESPNP, and SOX8, which are crucial for neuronal development (Ahn2020An). However, specific details on the physical interactions of ACTL6B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available context.
