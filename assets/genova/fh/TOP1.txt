# TOP1

## Overview
The TOP1 gene encodes the enzyme DNA topoisomerase I, a critical nuclear enzyme involved in the regulation of DNA topology during essential cellular processes such as replication, transcription, and recombination. DNA topoisomerase I is classified as a type I topoisomerase, which functions by inducing transient single-strand breaks in the DNA to alleviate supercoiling and torsional stress, thereby facilitating the unwinding of DNA strands necessary for proper cellular function (Champoux2001DNA; Pommier2022Human). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining genomic stability and is implicated in various biological processes, including transcription regulation and replication origin function (Manzo2018DNA; Pommier2022Human). Alterations in TOP1 expression or function are associated with several diseases, notably cancer and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (King2013Topoisomerases; Smith2013Mechanisms).

## Structure
The human DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) enzyme is a monomeric protein crucial for DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids organized into several domains: the NH2-terminal, core, linker, and COOH-terminal domains. The core and COOH-terminal domains are essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, with the active-site nucleophile tyrosine-723 playing a critical role in forming a phosphoester bond with DNA (Redinbo1998Crystal).

The secondary structure of TOP1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of TOP1 forms a closed toroidal shape, allowing the enzyme to encircle DNA and facilitate its function in relieving superhelical tension (Takahashi2022Topoisomerase). The enzyme's structure is described as a 64.3-kD particle with dimensions of 70 Å by 60 Å by 60 Å, featuring a central pore with a high positive electrostatic potential due to numerous lysines and arginines (Redinbo1998Crystal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of TOP1. The enzyme is also a target for camptothecin family anticancer drugs, highlighting its biomedical importance (Redinbo1998Crystal). Splice variants of TOP1 may exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Takahashi2022Topoisomerase).

## Function
DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in managing DNA supercoiling during replication and transcription. It functions by inducing transient single-strand breaks in the DNA, allowing the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, which facilitates the unwinding necessary for replication and transcription processes (Champoux2001DNA; Pommier2022Human). TOP1 is active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing the accumulation of R-loops and alternative DNA structures that can lead to genomic instability (Manzo2018DNA; Pommier2022Human).

TOP1 is essential for proper transcription regulation, particularly in the activation of long genes, including neuronal and inflammatory genes. It interacts with RNA polymerase II, aiding in the transition from promoter-proximal pausing to productive transcript elongation (Pommier2022Human). The enzyme is also involved in the modulation of replication origin function, ensuring efficient DNA unwinding and strand separation during replication initiation (Manzo2018DNA).

In healthy human cells, TOP1 is indispensable for early development and viability, as its inactivation can lead to reduced transcription of long genes and neuronal degeneration (Pommier2022Human). Its activity is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TOP1 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In colorectal cancer, TOP1 gene copy number increases are frequently observed, especially in stage III cases. These increases can occur through mechanisms such as isochromosome formation or whole chromosome 20 gain, contributing to tumorigenesis and cellular proliferation (Smith2013Mechanisms). TOP1 is also linked to transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in cancer, where its activity can lead to the ID-TOP1 mutational signature characterized by 2-5 base pair deletions. These deletions are enriched in highly transcribed genes and are associated with RNase-H2-deficient cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Reijns2022Signatures).

In the context of neurological disorders, TOP1 is crucial for the transcription of long genes, many of which are involved in neuronal development. Inhibition of TOP1 can lead to reduced expression of these genes, which are linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (King2013Topoisomerases). Additionally, insufficient TOP1 activity can result in genome instability, affecting DNA and RNA metabolism, and leading to conditions such as neurodegeneration (Pommier2022Human). The trapping of TOP1 in cleavage complexes can also cause DNA breaks, contributing to genomic instability and potentially leading to cancer (Pommier2022Human).

## Interactions
DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. In the nucleolus, TOP1 is sequestered during replication and transcription, interacting with proteins like nucleolin, which may influence its mobility and function in ribosome biogenesis (Leppard2005Human). In the nucleoplasm, TOP1 resolves torsional strain during DNA replication and transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase II and other replication factors (Leppard2005Human). 

TOP1 also forms covalent complexes with DNA, which can lead to DNA damage if unresolved. Repair mechanisms involve interactions with tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) and other single-strand break repair factors (Leppard2005Human). The enzyme's activity is modulated by RNA, which can inhibit its DNA relaxation function, creating a feedback loop that regulates transcription-coupled supercoiling tension (Bhola2024RNA). 

TOP1 is identified as an RNA-binding protein, interacting with various RNA species, including mRNAs, snoRNAs, and ncRNAs, which suggests a role in RNA regulation and transcriptional control (Bhola2024RNA). These interactions are crucial for managing supercoiling during transcription and may impact gene regulation (Bhola2024RNA).
