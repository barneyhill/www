# HEXD

## Overview
The HEXD gene encodes the enzyme hexosaminidase D, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of N-acetylhexosamines, playing a crucial role in the degradation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Hexosaminidase D is categorized as a lysosomal enzyme, functioning within the lysosome to facilitate the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. The activity of hexosaminidase D is essential for normal cellular metabolism and turnover of biomolecules. Mutations or dysregulation of the HEXD gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health.
