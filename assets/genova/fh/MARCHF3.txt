# MARCHF3

## Overview
MARCHF3 is a gene that encodes the membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 3 protein, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitination process, a cellular mechanism that tags proteins for degradation, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. MARCHF3 is involved in the regulation of protein turnover, particularly influencing immune responses and the trafficking and degradation of membrane proteins within endosomal and lysosomal pathways. Its activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and immune response modulation. The gene has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting its involvement in disease pathophysiology through its regulatory functions in immune responses and protein degradation (Wang2022Identification; Palma2024Unveiling).

## Function
MARCHF3, a membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger protein, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating immune responses and influencing membrane protein trafficking and degradation. MARCHF3 is active in the endosomal and lysosomal pathways, where it affects the trafficking and degradation of membrane proteins, thereby contributing to the regulation of cellular processes such as signal transduction and immune response (Wang2022Identification; Palma2024Unveiling).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, MARCHF3 has been identified as part of a common gene signature across conditions like Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Parkinson's disease. This suggests its involvement in immune responses and possibly in the pathophysiology of these diseases (Palma2024Unveiling). Additionally, MARCHF3 has been predicted to regulate the expression and degradation of ALOX15, a gene involved in ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, indicating its potential role in cellular stress responses (Wang2022Identification). However, specific functions of MARCHF3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
MARCHF3 has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in immune responses and protein degradation. A study identified MARCHF3 as part of a common gene signature across neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), aging, Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD). This gene was among those most down-regulated in these conditions, suggesting its potential involvement in disease pathology through altered expression levels (Palma2024Unveiling).

In the context of the AP-1 pathway, MARCHF3 has been identified as a potential negative regulator. Alterations in its expression could impact this pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including immune responses and inflammation. This was demonstrated through a genome-wide CRISPR screening that highlighted MARCHF3 as a gene of interest in modulating the AP-1 pathway (Wong2021Engineering).

Additionally, MARCHF3 is predicted to be an E3 ligase for BMP-2, a protein involved in vascular smooth muscle calcification. Although specific details on its role in this process are not provided, changes in MARCHF3 interactions could potentially influence vascular calcification and related conditions (Zhu2024Nesfatin1).

## Interactions
MARCHF3, a member of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein ubiquitination. It has been identified as a potential negative regulator of the AP-1 pathway, a key signaling pathway involved in various cellular processes, including immune responses and cell proliferation. In a study using a digital reporter system in genome-wide CRISPR screening, MARCHF3 was highlighted as a negative regulator of the AP-1 pathway, although specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed (Wong2021Engineering).

MARCHF3 is also implicated in the regulation of the ALOX15 gene, which is associated with ferroptosis in diabetic nephropathy. It is predicted to be involved in the ubiquitination and regulation of ALOX15, alongside other E3 ligases such as MARCHF1 and MARCHF8 (Wang2022Identification). Additionally, MARCHF3 is suggested to play a role in the degradation of BMP-2, a protein involved in vascular smooth muscle calcification, although specific interactions were not detailed (Zhu2024Nesfatin1). Despite these associations, detailed physical interactions of MARCHF3 with specific proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
