# FATE1

## Overview
FATE1 (fetal and adult testis expressed 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptotic regulation, primarily expressed in the human testis. The FATE1 protein is characterized by its transmembrane and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its localization to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Maxfield2015Comprehensive). In healthy cells, FATE1 is implicated in testicular development and spermatogenesis, with expression in various testicular cell types such as spermatogonia and Sertoli cells (Djureinovic2014The). Beyond its physiological roles, FATE1 is clinically significant in oncology, particularly in adrenocortical carcinoma and Ewing sarcoma, where it contributes to cancer cell survival by modulating apoptotic pathways and interacting with proteins like BIK and RNF183 (Gallegos2019EWSR1FLI1; DoghmanBouguerra2020Cancertestis). These interactions underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Structure
The FATE1 protein is characterized by a largely disordered secondary structure, with notable exceptions being its C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) and transmembrane (TM) domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's mitochondrial localization, as their deletion results in FATE1 localizing to the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum instead (Maxfield2015Comprehensive). The CC and TM domains exhibit 29% identity and 55% similarity to the mitochondrial fission factor, suggesting a structural and functional resemblance (Maxfield2015Comprehensive).

FATE1's structure includes transmembrane domains, which suggest its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum, although specific details on its primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific sites or effects of these modifications are not detailed (Maxfield2015Comprehensive).

The interaction of FATE1 with other proteins, such as BIK and RNF183, indicates a role in complex regulatory mechanisms, although the structural basis for these interactions is not fully described (Maxfield2015Comprehensive). The presence of these domains and interactions underscores FATE1's role in apoptotic signaling pathways and its importance in cancer cell survival.

## Function
FATE1 (fetal and adult testis expressed 1) is a gene that encodes a protein primarily expressed in the human testis. In healthy human cells, FATE1 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. It is expressed in various cell types within the testis, including spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells, suggesting a role in testicular development and spermatogenesis (Djureinovic2014The). The protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it influences cellular stress responses and survival pathways. FATE1's localization to the mitochondria is crucial for its function, as it involves specific domains that facilitate this localization (Maxfield2015Comprehensive).

Although the specific molecular activities of FATE1 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its expression pattern in the testis and its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics suggest it plays a role in cellular processes such as apoptosis regulation. The gene's high expression levels in testicular tissues indicate its importance in maintaining the function and development of testicular cells (Djureinovic2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The FATE1 gene is clinically significant in various cancers, particularly adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and Ewing sarcoma. In adult ACC, high FATE1 expression is associated with malignancy and poor prognosis, correlating with reduced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. Patients with high FATE1 expression have a lower five-year DFS rate of 43% compared to 64% in those with low expression, and a five-year OS rate of 63% compared to 81% in the low expression group (DoghmanBouguerra2020Cancertestis). FATE1 expression is linked to increased steroid hormone secretion and MKI67 mRNA expression, but not with other clinical parameters such as age or tumor size (DoghmanBouguerra2020Cancertestis).

In Ewing sarcoma, FATE1 is activated by the EWSR1-FLI1 chimeric transcription factor, promoting tumor cell survival by reducing the accumulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BNIP3L (Gallegos2019EWSR1FLI1). FATE1's role in cancer extends to its involvement in apoptotic signaling pathways, where it interacts with the E3 ligase RNF183 to regulate BIK protein levels, preventing apoptosis in tumor cells (Maxfield2015Comprehensive). These findings suggest that FATE1 could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these cancers.

## Interactions
FATE1 (fetal and adult testis expressed 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in apoptosis regulation. It localizes to the mitochondria and interacts with the pro-apoptotic BH3-only family member BIK, which promotes cell death by mobilizing cytochrome c. The depletion of FATE1 stabilizes BIK protein levels, suggesting that FATE1 regulates BIK stability through its association with RNF183, an ER-localized E3 ligase. RNF183 negatively regulates BIK protein accumulation, and its E3 activity is essential for this regulation (Maxfield2015Comprehensive).

In Ewing sarcoma cells, FATE1 interacts with other BH3 proteins, specifically BNIP3 and BNIP3L (NIX). FATE1 destabilizes BNIP3L, which is associated with promoting cell death. This destabilization requires FATE1's localization to the mitochondria, and the presence of RNF183 enhances BNIP3L turnover, suggesting a collaborative role in regulating BNIP3L levels (Gallegos2019EWSR1FLI1).

FATE1 is also involved in modulating ER-mitochondria contact sites, which affects mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and apoptosis. This modulation helps cancer cells evade apoptotic death and resist chemotherapy (Zung2020New). These interactions highlight FATE1's role in apoptosis regulation and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
