# CENPF

## Overview
CENPF is a gene that encodes centromere protein F (CENP-F), a large coiled-coil protein that plays a pivotal role in cell division, particularly during mitosis. As a microtubule-associated protein, CENP-F is integral to chromosome segregation and kinetochore function, ensuring accurate alignment and separation of chromosomes. The protein is characterized by its structural features, including coiled-coil domains and a P-loop nucleotide binding motif, which contribute to its mechanochemical properties and regulatory functions during the cell cycle (Liao1995CENPF). CENP-F is involved in various protein interactions, such as with the nuclear pore protein Nup133 and the kinase Bub1, which are essential for its localization and function at kinetochores (Berto2018Disentangling). Clinically, mutations in CENPF are associated with developmental disorders like Stromme syndrome, while its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Filges2019CUGC; Huang2021Centromere).

## Structure
CENPF, also known as centromere protein F, is a large protein with a molecular mass of approximately 367 kD, consisting of 3,211 amino acids (Liao1995CENPF). The protein is characterized by two extended coil domains flanking a central flexible core, which suggests a fibrous structure typical of coiled-coil proteins (Liao1995CENPF). These coiled-coil domains are predicted to form a continuous coiled-coil region, characterized as a leucine zipper, which is crucial for its structural integrity and function (Berto2018Disentangling).

CENPF contains a P-loop nucleotide binding motif within its globular carboxy terminus, indicating a potential mechanochemical domain (Liao1995CENPF). The protein also features nuclear localization sequences and phosphorylation sites for MAP kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases, which are important for its regulation and function during the cell cycle (Liao1995CENPF). Phosphorylation by the cyclinB1/cdc2 kinase complex may regulate its distribution between the nuclear matrix and kinetochores (Liao1995CENPF).

CENPF is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms, which may be associated with different cellular structures and functions (Liao1995CENPF). These structural features and modifications suggest that CENPF plays a critical role in mitotic events, including kinetochore maturation and maintaining kinetochore integrity during mitosis (Liao1995CENPF).

## Function
Centromere protein F (CENP-F) is a crucial component in the process of mitosis, particularly in chromosome segregation and kinetochore function. It is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Liao1995CENPF; Volkov2015Centromere). CENP-F contains two microtubule-binding domains, with the N-terminal domain showing a preference for binding to curled tubulin oligomers, which are characteristic of shortening microtubule ends. This binding preference allows CENP-F to maintain strong attachments between kinetochores and dynamic microtubules, contributing to the fidelity of chromosome segregation (Volkov2015Centromere).

During the cell cycle, CENP-F is expressed in the G2 phase, localizes to the nuclear boundary, and associates with kinetochores from prophase through metaphase. It remains detectable at kinetochores during early anaphase and later concentrates in the intracellular bridge during cytokinesis (Liao1995CENPF). The protein is rapidly degraded after mitosis, highlighting its role in mitotic progression (Liao1995CENPF). CENP-F is also involved in the recruitment of other kinetochore proteins, such as CENP-E and dynein, and is essential for proper mitotic checkpoint signaling (Volkov2015Centromere; Bomont2005Unstable).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CENPF gene are linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. CENPF mutations are associated with Stromme syndrome, characterized by microcephaly, ocular anomalies, and intestinal atresia. The phenotypic spectrum includes isolated primary microcephaly, brain anomalies, cleft palate, polydactyly, renal dysplasia, and duodenal/intestinal atresia, with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (Filges2019CUGC). CENPF mutations also contribute to ciliopathy and microcephaly phenotypes, with features such as cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, corpus callosum agenesis, and renal hypoplasia (Waters2015The).

In cancer, CENPF is frequently overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It is significantly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prostate cancer, breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), where it is associated with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Huang2022CENPFCDK1; Huang2021Centromere). In ACC, CENPF overexpression correlates with pathological stage and overall survival, serving as a potential biomarker (Huang2022CENPFCDK1). In papillary thyroid cancer, high CENPF expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor growth (Han2021CENPF). CENPF's role in these cancers involves regulation of the cell cycle and interactions with proteins like CDK1, affecting pathways related to cell proliferation and apoptosis (Huang2022CENPFCDK1).

## Interactions
CENPF, also known as centromere protein F, is involved in various protein interactions critical for its function in cell division and other cellular processes. It interacts with the nuclear pore protein Nup133, particularly during prophase at nuclear pores and during mitosis at kinetochores. This interaction involves a conserved helix within the Nup133 b-propeller and a leucine zipper-containing segment of CENPF (Berto2018Disentangling). Mutations affecting the Nup133/CENPF interface can prevent CENPF localization to the nuclear envelope but not to kinetochores (Berto2018Disentangling).

CENPF also interacts with the kinase Bub1 at kinetochores, with the conserved cysteine in the KT-core region of CENPF being crucial for this interaction. The C2748S mutation in mCENPF-Ct2 inhibits its interaction with Bub1 but does not affect its interaction with Nup133, indicating distinct binding sites for these proteins (Berto2018Disentangling). CENPF's interaction with Bub1 is essential for its kinetochore localization, working redundantly with CENP-E, another kinetochore protein (Berto2018Disentangling).

Additionally, CENPF interacts with syntaxin 4, a component of the SNARE complex involved in vesicular transport, as demonstrated in murine models (Pooley2008Murine). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of CENPF and is crucial for regulating vesicular transport processes (Pooley2008Murine).
