# NOXA1

## Overview
NOXA1, or NADPH oxidase activator 1, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the activation of the NADPH oxidase complex, specifically NOX1. This protein plays a pivotal role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are crucial for various cellular processes, including host defense and signaling. NOXA1 is categorized as an activator protein and is integral to the assembly and regulation of the NOX1 complex. It interacts with other components such as NOXO1 and p22phox, and its activity is modulated through phosphorylation by kinases like PKC, PKA, and MAPK. These post-translational modifications are essential for controlling ROS production and preventing excessive oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and inflammatory diseases (Kim2007Regulation; Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation; Bánfi2003Two).

## Structure
The NOXA1 protein, encoded by the NOXA1 gene, is a crucial component of the NADPH oxidase complex, involved in generating reactive oxygen species. The primary structure of NOXA1 includes specific domains such as the SH3 domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions. This domain is characterized by a β-barrel structure formed by five β-strands and one α-helix, as revealed by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.88 Å (Attri2020Structural).

The secondary structure of NOXA1's SH3 domain predominantly consists of beta-sheets, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins, such as the proline-rich region of NOXO1 (Shrestha2017Cterminal). The tertiary structure of NOXA1 involves the overall folding of these domains, contributing to its functional conformation within the NADPH oxidase complex.

In terms of quaternary structure, NOXA1 interacts with other subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex, including NOXO1 and p22phox, to regulate the enzyme's activity (Dutta2010Regulation). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating NOXA1's activity. Specific serine residues, including Ser-172 and Ser-282, are phosphorylated by kinases like PKC, PKA, and MAPK, which modulate the protein's function and prevent NOX1 hyperactivation (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation).

## Function
NOXA1 (NADPH oxidase activator 1) is a critical component in the regulation of the NADPH oxidase complex, particularly NOX1, which is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human cells. NOXA1 functions as an activator subunit, facilitating the assembly and activation of the NOX1 complex, which is essential for generating superoxide, a type of ROS (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation; Bánfi2003Two). 

In healthy human cells, NOXA1 is phosphorylated on specific serine residues, Ser-172 and Ser-282, by MAP kinases and protein kinases such as PKC and PKA. This phosphorylation acts as a regulatory mechanism to prevent NOX1 hyperactivation by decreasing NOXA1's interaction with NOX1 and Rac1, thereby controlling ROS production and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation). 

NOXA1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the negative regulation of NOX1 activity, which is crucial for preventing excessive ROS production that could lead to cellular damage (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation). This regulation is important for maintaining normal inflammatory responses and preventing disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NOXA1 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of inflammatory and oxidative stress-related diseases. NOXA1 is a regulatory subunit of the NOX1 enzyme complex, which is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dysregulation of NOXA1 can lead to excessive ROS production, contributing to tissue damage and inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation; Schwerd2018NOX1). 

Phosphorylation of NOXA1 by protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) plays a crucial role in modulating its interaction with NOX1 and Rac1, thereby preventing NOX1 hyperactivation. This regulation is essential to avoid excessive ROS production, which can lead to inflammatory conditions (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation). Alterations in NOXA1's phosphorylation state, such as those mediated by PKA, can inhibit NOX1 activity by promoting the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which leads to the dissociation of NOXA1 from the NOX1 complex (Kim2007Regulation). 

These findings suggest that NOXA1 is a critical component in maintaining ROS homeostasis, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation.

## Interactions
NOXA1 (NADPH oxidase activator 1) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase complex. It interacts with NoxO1, a homologue of p47phox, to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase Nox1. This interaction is crucial for the activation of Nox1, which also requires the membrane subunit p22 phox and is influenced by Rac1 GTPase (Kim2007Regulation; Ueyama2006Involvement).

Phosphorylation of NOXA1 by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine residues 172 and 461 enhances its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction inhibits Nox1 activity by causing the dissociation of NOXA1 from the Nox1 complex at the plasma membrane, thereby reducing ROS production (Kim2007Regulation). The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated NOXA1 is a key regulatory mechanism, as it prevents NOXA1 from interacting with NoxO1 and Rac1, which are essential for Nox1 activation (Kim2007Regulation).

NOXA1 is also phosphorylated on Ser-282 by MAP kinases and on Ser-172 by protein kinase C (PKC), which further modulates its interactions with Nox1 and Rac1, preventing Nox1 hyperactivation (Kroviarski2010Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory role of NOXA1 in controlling ROS production through the NADPH oxidase complex.
