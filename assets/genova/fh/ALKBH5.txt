# ALKBH5

## Overview
ALKBH5 is a gene that encodes the protein alkB homolog 5, an RNA demethylase that belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenase family. This protein is primarily involved in the removal of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications from RNA molecules, a process crucial for the regulation of RNA metabolism, including mRNA export, splicing, and stability (Zheng2013ALKBH5). Structurally, ALKBH5 features a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) core, which is characteristic of its enzyme family, and functions as a monomer in solution (Aik2014Structure; Xu2014Structures). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining proper mRNA dynamics and has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the context (Chen2020ALKBH5; Jin2022The). ALKBH5's interactions with nuclear speckles and mRNA-processing factors underscore its significant role in RNA processing and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zheng2013ALKBH5).

## Structure
The ALKBH5 protein is characterized by a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) core fold, typical of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenase family. This core consists of eight anti-parallel β-strands forming two β-sheets, with the major sheet comprising strands b6, b8, b11, and b13, and the minor sheet including strands b7, b9, b10, and b12. Three additional β-strands (b1, b2, b3) extend the major β-sheet (Aik2014Structure). The DSBH is flanked by three helices (a1, a2, a3) and serves as a scaffold for three Fe(II)-ligating residues: His204, Asp206, and His266 (Aik2014Structure; Xu2014Structures).

The N-terminal region of ALKBH5 (residues 66-292) begins with a long α-helix and may form a helical bundle or coiled coil motif (Aik2014Structure). The protein also features a nucleotide recognition lid (NRL) with two β hairpin-like loops (NRL1 and NRL2) (Aik2014Structure). A unique disulfide bond between Cys230 and Cys267 constrains a loop that forms an outer wall of the active site (Xu2014Structures).

ALKBH5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation (Aik2014Structure). The C-terminal region (residues 293-394) is predicted to be disordered and is not essential for its demethylase activity (Aik2014Structure). The protein functions as a monomer in solution, despite forming a dimer in the crystal structure (Xu2014Structures).

## Function
The human gene ALKBH5 encodes an RNA demethylase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA metabolism by removing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications from RNA molecules. This reversible modification is significant for various biological processes, including mRNA export, splicing, and stability (Zheng2013ALKBH5). ALKBH5 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with nuclear speckles and mRNA-processing factors, influencing the phosphorylation status and localization of these factors, which are essential for mRNA splicing and export (Zheng2013ALKBH5).

In healthy cells, ALKBH5's demethylation activity is vital for maintaining proper mRNA dynamics, ensuring correct splicing and stability of mRNAs, particularly those with longer 3′-UTRs (Tang2017ALKBH5dependent). The absence of ALKBH5 leads to increased m6A levels, affecting gene expression and resulting in aberrant cellular processes, such as impaired spermatogenesis and increased apoptosis in mouse testes (Zheng2013ALKBH5). ALKBH5 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression at both the gene and isoform levels, impacting a significant number of differentially expressed genes (Zheng2013ALKBH5). This highlights its broad regulatory function in RNA metabolism and its essential role in maintaining cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ALKBH5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cancer type. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), down-regulation of ALKBH5 is associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and increased tumor growth. Its overexpression inhibits HCC cell proliferation and metastasis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Chen2020ALKBH5). Conversely, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ALKBH5 is upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages, acting as an oncogene by promoting tumor progression and immune escape (Jin2022The).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ALKBH5 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting tumorigenesis and reducing chemoresistance to gemcitabine, a common chemotherapy drug (Tang2020m6A). In glioblastoma, ALKBH5 is highly expressed in glioblastoma stem-like cells, maintaining their tumorigenicity and correlating with poor patient prognosis (Zhang2017m). The gene's expression is also linked to immune checkpoint modulation, influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy across multiple cancer types (Wei2022PanCancer). These findings highlight the complex and context-dependent role of ALKBH5 in cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
ALKBH5 is an RNA demethylase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. It colocalizes with nuclear speckles and interacts with mRNA-processing factors such as phosphorylated SC35, SM, and ASF/SF2. These interactions are sensitive to RNase A treatment, indicating a connection with nuclear RNA (Zheng2013ALKBH5). ALKBH5 also interacts with components of the exon-junction complex (EJC), including CWC22, eIF4A3, and the nuclear EJC auxiliary complex PSAP. It is associated with the TREX complex, interacting with proteins like ALYREF, DDX39B, and CHTOP, which are involved in mRNA export (Covelo-Molares2021The).

The protein's interaction with the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 is crucial for modulating mRNA demethylation, suggesting a regulatory role in m6A RNA modification (Shah2017The). ALKBH5's interactions with RNA substrates are characterized by a preference for the m6A consensus motif, and its activity is influenced by adjacent nucleobases (Kaur2022Mechanisms). The structural studies reveal that ALKBH5 binds to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in a unique orientation, which is essential for its demethylation activity (Kaur2022Mechanisms). These interactions highlight ALKBH5's role in RNA processing and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
