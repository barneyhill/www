# DHRS2

## Overview
DHRS2, or dehydrogenase/reductase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This family is characterized by its involvement in a wide range of metabolic processes, including the reduction of toxic compounds and the regulation of oxidative stress. The protein encoded by DHRS2 is a NADPH-dependent dicarbonylreductase, which plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by metabolizing steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics (Zhou2017DHRS2; Salman2021DHRS2). It is expressed in various tissues and is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, nucleus, and cytoplasm, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and peroxisomal transport (Salman2021DHRS2). Beyond its metabolic functions, DHRS2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis through its interaction with MDM2, leading to the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Zhou2017DHRS2; Salman2021DHRS2). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, where it may act as a tumor suppressor or, in some contexts, be associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2019DHRS2; Shimonosono2018Molecular).

## Structure
DHRS2 (dehydrogenase/reductase 2) is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a Rossmann fold that facilitates NAD(P)(H) binding. The primary structure of DHRS2 includes conserved motifs typical of the SDR family, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. These motifs are integral to the protein's ability to interact with coenzymes and substrates.

The secondary structure of DHRS2 predominantly consists of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation. These elements are arranged in a manner that supports the formation of the Rossmann fold, a common feature among SDR family members.

In terms of tertiary structure, the protein is stabilized by the conserved motifs and the arrangement of its secondary structural elements. This structural organization is essential for maintaining the protein's functional integrity and its interaction with other molecules.

DHRS2 may also form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that could be important for its biological function. Post-translational modifications and splice variants can influence the function and localization of DHRS2, potentially affecting its enzymatic activity and interaction with other cellular components. These modifications and variants add a layer of complexity to the regulation of DHRS2 activity and its role in cellular processes.

## Function
The DHRS2 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DHRS2 is involved in metabolic processes, including the breakdown of steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and xenobiotics (Zhou2017DHRS2). It functions as a NADPH-dependent dicarbonylreductase enzyme, acting on toxic α-dicarbonyl compounds, thereby reducing cellular oxidative stress damage (Zhou2017DHRS2; Salman2021DHRS2).

DHRS2 is expressed in several tissues, including the liver, parotid gland, placenta, ovary, breast, and testis, and is located in the mitochondrial matrix, nucleus, and cytoplasm (Salman2021DHRS2). It contributes to lipid metabolism and peroxisomal transport, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Salman2021DHRS2). The enzyme also plays a role in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis by inhibiting MDM2, which stabilizes the p53 protein, a key player in these processes (Zhou2017DHRS2; Salman2021DHRS2).

Through these functions, DHRS2 helps control normal cell functions and protect against oxidative stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining overall organismal health (Zhou2017DHRS2; Salman2021DHRS2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHRS2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), DHRS2 is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to suppress cell growth and proliferation, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Luo2019DHRS2). Similarly, in ovarian cancer (OC), DHRS2 inhibits cell growth and metastasis by downregulating choline kinase α (CHKα), disrupting choline metabolism, and impeding AKT signaling, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Li2022DHRS2).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), DHRS2 expression is upregulated in tumor tissues and is associated with shorter survival rates, indicating a complex role in cancer progression. The gene is negatively regulated by miR-145-3p, which suggests that miR-145-3p may have antitumor effects by targeting DHRS2 (Shimonosono2018Molecular).

DHRS2 is also involved in the regulation of the Mdm2-p53 stress response pathway, where it stabilizes p53 by inhibiting Mdm2, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis and malignant progression (Deisenroth2010Mitochondrial). These findings suggest that DHRS2 could be a target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
DHRS2 has been shown to interact with choline kinase alpha (CHKα) mRNA, suggesting a role as a potential RNA-binding protein. This interaction is significant in the context of ovarian cancer, where DHRS2 expression leads to the downregulation of CHKα, disrupting choline metabolism and inhibiting cancer cell growth and metastasis. The direct binding of DHRS2 to CHKα mRNA was confirmed through an RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, demonstrating its involvement in the post-transcriptional regulation of CHKα mRNA levels in ovarian cancer cells such as OVCAR3 and HO-8910 (Li2022DHRS2).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DHRS2 acts as a negative regulator of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), which promotes the stabilization and accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction suggests a pathway through which DHRS2 can influence cancer cell growth and response to therapy (Luo2019DHRS2). The role of DHRS2 in these interactions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, given its involvement in critical regulatory pathways affecting cell proliferation and survival.
