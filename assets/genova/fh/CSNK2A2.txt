# CSNK2A2

## Overview
The CSNK2A2 gene encodes the alpha' catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes. As a kinase, the protein encoded by CSNK2A2 is involved in the phosphorylation of various substrates, influencing pathways related to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and transcription. CK2 is a constitutively active enzyme that typically functions as a tetramer, comprising two catalytic subunits (either CSNK2A1 or CSNK2A2) and two regulatory beta subunits (CSNK2B). This structural configuration allows CK2 to participate in critical cellular functions, such as maintaining telomere length, modulating signal transduction pathways like Wnt signaling, and acting as an antiapoptotic agent, particularly in cancer cells (Pinna2002Protein; Merholz2022In; Venerando2014Casein). The CSNK2A2 gene and its encoded protein are thus integral to cellular homeostasis and have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Borgo2021Protein).

## Structure
The CSNK2A2 gene encodes the alpha' catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine protein kinase. The primary structure of the CSNK2A2 protein includes a conserved kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. The secondary structure of the protein features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of CSNK2A2 involves a bilobal kinase fold, a common feature among protein kinases, which facilitates substrate binding and catalysis.

CK2 functions as a tetramer, indicating its quaternary structure, typically forming a complex with two regulatory beta subunits (CSNK2B) and two catalytic subunits, which can be either CSNK2A1 or CSNK2A2. This tetrameric arrangement is crucial for the enzyme's regulatory and catalytic functions (Merholz2022In).

Common post-translational modifications of the CSNK2A2 protein include phosphorylation, which can modulate its activity and interactions with other proteins. However, specific details on splice variant isoforms of CSNK2A2 are not provided in the available context. The CK2 holoenzyme's structural configuration allows it to participate in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Merholz2022In).

## Function
The CSNK2A2 gene encodes the alpha' catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is constitutively active and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. CK2 is involved in the regulation of telomere length by phosphorylating the telomeric repeat binding factor 1, which is essential for its binding to telomeres and maintaining telomere length homeostasis (Saxena2014GenomeWide). This function is significant in the context of cellular aging and chronic diseases.

CK2 is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic subunits (α and/or α') and two regulatory β subunits, and it is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and transcription (Ackermann2005The; Venerando2014Casein). It phosphorylates a wide range of substrates, impacting signal transduction pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway, where it influences β-catenin stability and degradation (Pinna2002Protein). CK2's activity is crucial for cell survival and proliferation, and it acts as a global antiapoptotic agent, which is particularly relevant in cancer cells (Venerando2014Casein). CK2 is ubiquitously active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, affecting cell proliferation and survival (Pirrello2005Search).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSNK2A2 gene, which encodes the alpha' catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, CK2 is overexpressed in several types, contributing to oncogenic signaling pathways, enhancing multidrug resistance, and affecting tumor suppressor proteins like p53 and PTEN. The CSNK2A2 isoform is particularly important for the proliferation and survival of osteosarcoma cells, although its specific role may vary depending on the cancer type (Borgo2021Protein).

In neurodegenerative diseases, CK2, of which CSNK2A2 is a part, plays a role in modulating the phosphorylation of proteins involved in conditions such as Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. These interactions can either reduce cellular toxicity or promote the formation of harmful protein inclusions, depending on the disease (Borgo2021Protein).

CK2 is also involved in the regulation of insulin expression and secretion in pancreatic β-cells, with its inhibition potentially promoting insulin secretion and offering protection against glucolipotoxicity, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Borgo2021Protein). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CSNK2A2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CSNK2A2, a catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), participates in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. CK2, composed of catalytic subunits CSNK2A1 and/or CSNK2A2, often functions in complex with regulatory beta subunits (CSNK2B), although the catalytic subunits can operate independently (Gyenis2022Chemical).

CSNK2A2 is involved in the regulation of mitophagy through its interaction with the FUNDC1 protein. It phosphorylates FUNDC1 at Ser-13, inhibiting PGAM5/FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy. This phosphorylation reduces the interaction between FUNDC1 and LC3, which is crucial for mitophagy. Under stress conditions like hypoxia, CK2 dissociates from FUNDC1, enhancing the interaction between FUNDC1 and PGAM5, thereby promoting mitophagy (Chen2014A).

CSNK2A2 also plays a role in autophagy by phosphorylating ATG16L1 at Ser139, which is essential for its association with the ATG12-ATG5 complex. This interaction is crucial for autophagosome maturation and is regulated by the opposing action of PPP1, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates ATG16L1 (Song2015ATG16L1). These interactions highlight CSNK2A2's role in modulating key cellular pathways through phosphorylation events.
