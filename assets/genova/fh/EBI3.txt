# EBI3

## Overview
EBI3, or Epstein-Barr virus induced 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine family, playing a pivotal role in immune regulation. The EBI3 protein is a subunit that forms heterodimers with other cytokine subunits, such as IL-27 and IL-35, which are essential for modulating immune responses. As a chaperone-like protein, EBI3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathways, where it assists in the proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins, including the IL-23 receptor subunit IL-23Rα. This function is crucial for the differentiation of Th17 cells, which are involved in inflammatory processes (Mizoguchi2020EBVinduced; Watanabe2021A). EBI3's expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and is responsive to inflammatory signals, highlighting its role in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases (Wetzel2021Epigenetic; Wetzel2020Epigenetic).

## Function
EBI3 is a protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation by forming part of the interleukin-12 (IL-12) cytokine family. It is involved in the formation of heterodimers with other cytokine subunits, such as IL-27 and IL-35, which are crucial for modulating immune responses. In healthy human cells, EBI3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secretory pathways, where it assists in the proper folding and maturation of glycoproteins. This chaperone-like activity is essential for the stability and expression of proteins like IL-23Rα, a subunit of the IL-23 receptor, which is important for the differentiation of pathogenic Th17 cells (Mizoguchi2020EBVinduced; Watanabe2021A).

EBI3 expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, and is upregulated in response to inflammatory signals such as TNFα. This regulation is crucial for the formation of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-35, which helps control inflammation in conditions like ulcerative colitis (Wetzel2021Epigenetic; Wetzel2020Epigenetic). EBI3's role in immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases highlight its importance in maintaining immune balance (Wetzel2021Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
EBI3 (Epstein-Barr virus induced 3) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), EBI3 expression is inversely correlated with c-myc translocation. EBI3 positivity is generally associated with the absence of c-myc translocation, while its negativity correlates with the presence of c-myc translocation, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker in these cancers (Gonin2011EpsteinBarr).

In lung cancer, EBI3 expression is elevated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and is associated with poor prognosis. High serum levels of EBI3 in lung cancer patients suggest its utility as a biomarker for detection and monitoring of the disease (Nishino2011Identification).

EBI3 also plays a role in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses, and its deficiency can lead to altered immune responses and increased disease severity (Mizoguchi2020EBVinduced; Wetzel2020Epigenetic). EBI3's interaction with the chaperone calnexin is crucial for the expression of IL-23Rα, impacting immune cell function and inflammation (Watanabe2021A).

## Interactions
EBI3 (Epstein-Barr virus induced 3) is known to interact with several proteins, forming important complexes that influence immune responses. EBI3 associates with the p35 subunit of interleukin 12 (IL-12) to form a novel heterodimeric hematopoietin, which is secreted as a noncovalent heterodimer. This interaction is specific, as EBI3 does not coprecipitate with the IL-12 p40 subunit, indicating a selective association with p35 (Devergne1997Epstein–Barr). The EBI3/p35 complex, also known as IL-35, has immunosuppressive functions and is involved in modulating immune responses (Watanabe2021A).

EBI3 also plays a role in protein folding by interacting with calnexin, a chaperone protein. This interaction is crucial for the proper folding and expression of proteins such as IL-23Rα, enhancing its expression in a peptide-dependent manner (Mizoguchi2020EBVinduced). EBI3's interaction with calnexin is significant under inflammatory conditions, where it aids in the folding and maturation of cytokines like IL-27 and IL-35 (Watanabe2021A).

Additionally, EBI3 can bind to eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1α1 (eEF1A1), which reduces its ubiquitination and inhibits apoptosis, suggesting a role in cellular survival mechanisms (Mizoguchi2020EBVinduced). These interactions highlight EBI3's multifaceted role in immune regulation and protein processing.
