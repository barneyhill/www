# MZT2B

## Overview
MZT2B is a gene that encodes the mitotic spindle organizing protein 2B, a critical component involved in the organization and function of the mitotic spindle during cell division. This protein is categorized as a spindle organizing protein and plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The proper functioning of MZT2B is essential for normal mitosis, as it facilitates the correct distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells, preventing aneuploidy and its associated pathologies, such as cancer. MZT2B is predominantly active in the cytoplasm during the mitotic phase, highlighting its importance in the dynamic processes of cell division and its contribution to cellular and organismal health (Heitor2020Downregulated).

## Structure


## Function
MZT2B, or mitotic spindle organizing protein 2B, is a crucial component in the organization of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. This protein plays a significant role in ensuring proper spindle assembly and function, which is vital for accurate mitosis. MZT2B is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Its involvement in the mitotic spindle organization helps maintain genomic stability by facilitating the correct distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. This function is critical for normal cell division and the prevention of aneuploidy, a condition that can lead to various diseases, including cancer. The activity of MZT2B in the cytoplasm underscores its importance in the dynamic processes of cell division, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
MZT2B has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In meningiomas, MZT2B is identified as a key hub gene that can distinguish different m6A clusters, with its expression significantly related to WHO grades and patient age. It shows different expression levels between normal meningeal tissues and meningiomas, suggesting its role in tumor development and progression (Chen2021m6A). 

In gastric cancer, high levels of MZT2B are associated with advanced-stage tumors, particularly in older women, and are linked to worse clinical outcomes, including distant metastases and shorter survival. MZT2B is identified as a target for MYC, and its elevated expression is suggested to be activated by MYC in gastric carcinogenesis, contributing to tumor progression (Heitor2020Downregulated). 

MZT2B is also mentioned in the context of uveal melanoma, where it is involved in SF3B1-independent alternative splicing isoforms, which are potential antitumor candidates due to their ability to increase IFN-γ production and induce cell death in UM cells (FuentesRodriguez2024Recent). These findings suggest that MZT2B could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in various cancers.
