# OR10J1

## Overview
The OR10J1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily J member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. OR10J1 is primarily involved in olfactory processes, but it is also expressed in various human tissues, including the testis and developing brain, suggesting additional roles in physiological processes such as cytokinesis and chemotaxis (Ignatieva2019Exomewide; Flegel2016Characterization). The receptor is implicated in odorant-induced calcium signaling, which is crucial for sperm function and potentially other cellular activities (Flegel2016Characterization). While its specific molecular functions in healthy cells remain largely unexplored, OR10J1 has been associated with severe tick-borne encephalitis and inflammation regulation, indicating its broader significance beyond olfaction (Ignatieva2019Exomewide; Oh2024A).

## Structure
The OR10J1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which typically features a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is characteristic of GPCRs, facilitating their role in signal transduction across cell membranes. The primary structure of OR10J1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific ligands and initiate intracellular signaling pathways. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs and may occur in OR10J1, influencing its stability, localization, and function. These modifications can affect the receptor's ability to bind ligands and interact with G-proteins. The context does not provide specific details on splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure, as GPCRs like OR10J1 typically function as monomers without forming multimeric complexes (Flegel2016Characterization; McGowen2008The).

## Function
OR10J1 is an olfactory receptor expressed in various human tissues, including the testis and developing brain, particularly in the choroid plexus during early development. This suggests potential roles in processes such as cytokinesis, muscle regeneration, cell adhesion and migration, chemotaxis, chemokinesis, and odorant-mediated serotonin release (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). In human spermatozoa, OR10J1 is localized to the midpiece and the beginning of the flagella, indicating a possible role in sperm function, such as detecting chemical cues that may guide sperm towards the egg (Flegel2016Characterization). The receptor is involved in odorant-induced calcium signaling, which is crucial for various physiological processes in spermatozoa (Flegel2016Characterization).

OR10J1 is also expressed in granulocytes, suggesting a broader role beyond olfaction (Concas2021The). In the context of breast cancer, OR10J1 has been identified as part of the olfactory transduction pathway, with potential epigenetic alterations observed in cancer tissues (Fessahaye2021Breast). Despite these findings, the specific molecular functions of OR10J1 in healthy cells remain largely unexplored.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR10J1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not extensively documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations. However, some studies have suggested potential roles in various physiological and pathological processes. In the context of severe tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), genetic variants in OR10J1 have been associated with severe forms of the disease in a Russian population, indicating a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of TBE (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). The gene is also implicated in the process of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) penetration via the olfactory bulb, suggesting a role in viral entry into the central nervous system (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

Additionally, OR10J1 has been identified as one of the most significant genes associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, which are linked to inflammation and cholesterol metabolism. This association suggests that OR10J1 may play a role in immune regulation and metabolic processes that contribute to inflammation control (Oh2024A). Despite these associations, no specific diseases or conditions have been conclusively linked to OR10J1 mutations or expression changes, and further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
