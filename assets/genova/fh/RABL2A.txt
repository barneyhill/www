# RABL2A

## Overview
RABL2A is a gene that encodes the RAB, member of RAS oncogene family like 2A protein, which is a small GTPase belonging to the Ras superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of flagella and cilia, structures essential for cellular motility and signaling. RABL2A is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and is involved in critical protein-protein interactions, particularly with components of the intraflagellar transport machinery, which are vital for sperm tail assembly and ciliary processes (Lo2012RABLike; Dateyama2019RABL2). The protein's function is crucial for male fertility and the regulation of ciliary signaling pathways, impacting developmental and homeostatic processes (Dateyama2019RABL2; Ding2020Variants). Mutations in the RABL2A gene are linked to clinical conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Ding2020Variants).

## Structure
The RABL2A protein is characterized by a conserved GTPase domain and an additional C-terminal helix. The central GTPase domain is highly conserved and contains regions known as G1 to G5, which are crucial for its function. The G2 region includes a conserved threonine or serine residue that forms a hydrogen bond with an Mg2+ cation necessary for GTP hydrolysis (Eliáš2016A). RABL2A lacks a C-terminal prenylation motif, a feature shared with other Rab-like GTPases and RAN (Eliáš2016A). The protein typically features a 'T(Y/F)A' motif, distinguishing it from other GTPases (Eliáš2016A).

Although no three-dimensional structure has been solved for RABL2A, its similarity to other small GTPases suggests that its tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism are likely similar. Predictions of secondary structure indicate the presence of a helix distal to the C-terminal helix of the canonical small GTPase structure, which may be homologous to a similar structure in RAN GTPases (Eliáš2016A). RABL2A is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with components of the intraflagellar transport machinery, which is crucial for its function in sperm tail assembly and ciliary processes (Lo2012RABLike; Dateyama2019RABL2).

## Function
RABL2A is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in the function of flagella and cilia in healthy human cells. It is part of the Ras superfamily and is essential for the proper assembly and function of sperm tails and cilia. In sperm cells, RABL2A localizes to the mid-piece region of the flagella, where it facilitates the delivery of specific effector proteins, including key members of the glycolytic pathway, into the growing sperm tails. This process is crucial for normal sperm motility and male fertility (Lo2012RABLike; Ding2020Variants).

In cilia, RABL2A is recruited to the mother centriole by centrosomal protein 19 (CEP19), where it binds to the intraflagellar transport-B (IFT-B) complex and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This interaction is vital for the entry of RABL2A into the cilium, facilitating ciliary traffic necessary for cilium formation and function. Disruptions in RABL2A function can lead to conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and Bardet-Biedl syndrome, which are associated with male infertility and other developmental disorders (Ding2020Variants). RABL2A's role in ciliary signaling is also linked to the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within primary cilia, impacting signaling pathways crucial for development and homeostasis (Dateyama2019RABL2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RABL2A gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting male fertility and ciliary function. Approximately 7% of men worldwide experience infertility, often linked to genetic defects, including those in RABL2A. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RABL2A, such as rs80006029 and rs200121688, destabilize the protein and are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). These conditions are characterized by male infertility, early growth retardation, excessive weight gain, heterotaxia, pre-axial polydactyly, neural tube defects, and hydrocephalus (Ding2020Variants).

RABL2A mutations can lead to defective sperm motility, contributing to infertility. Variants like p.L119F and p.V158F result in significantly reduced sperm motility and progressive movement, although energy metabolism remains unaffected (Ding2020Variants). These mutations also cause phenotypic hallmarks of PCD and BBS, such as polydactyly and heterotaxia, and are linked to partially penetrant embryonic lethality and neural defects (Ding2020Variants).

Alterations in RABL2A expression or function can also impact ciliary signaling, potentially leading to developmental disorders and conditions like obesity and diabetes, due to its role in ciliary function and signaling pathways (Ding2020Variants).

## Interactions
RABL2A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in ciliary processes. It interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, specifically binding to the IFT-B complex through the IFT74-IFT81 heterodimer. This interaction is essential for the anterograde transport of proteins within cilia and is dependent on the GTP-bound state of RABL2A (Dateyama2019RABL2; Duan2020Rabl2). RABL2A also associates with the centriolar protein CEP19, which recruits it to the basal body of cilia. This interaction is crucial for the localization and function of RABL2A in ciliary processes (Boegholm2022The).

RABL2A interacts with ARL3, acting as an ARL3-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This interaction facilitates the transition of ARL3 to its GTP-bound state, which is important for BBSome-mediated ciliary retrieval (Zhang2022RABL2). RABL2A's interaction with the BBSome, particularly in its GDP-bound form, is involved in the outward transition zone passage of the BBSome, highlighting its role in ciliary signaling and retrieval processes (Zhang2022RABL2). These interactions underscore RABL2A's critical role in maintaining ciliary function and signaling.
