# OAT

## Overview
The OAT gene encodes the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase, a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in amino acid metabolism. This enzyme is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in the conversion of ornithine and α-ketoglutarate to glutamate-5-semialdehyde and glutamate, thus participating in the synthesis of key molecules such as citrulline, arginine, GABA, and proline (Montioli2021Deficit; Ginguay2017Ornithine). The OAT gene is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance, particularly in the liver and brain, where it contributes to nitrogen elimination and neurotransmitter precursor synthesis, respectively (Ginguay2017Ornithine). Mutations in the OAT gene are linked to gyrate atrophy, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive vision loss due to chorioretinal degeneration (Montioli2021Deficit). The enzyme's structure, function, and interactions underscore its significance in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in metabolic disorders.

## Structure
The human ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) protein is a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism. The primary structure of OAT consists of 416 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain (Shen1998Crystal). The secondary structure includes 12 alpha-helices and 14 beta-strands, organized into two distinct domains and an N-terminal segment (Shen1998Crystal).

The tertiary structure of OAT reveals a large domain characterized by a central seven-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices, typical of the PLP-binding domain of B6 enzymes (Shen1998Crystal). The small domain comprises a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with three alpha-helices (Shen1998Crystal). The PLP cofactor is covalently linked to Lys292 through a Schiff base linkage, playing a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic function (Shen1998Crystal).

OAT exhibits a quaternary structure as a hexamer, formed by three dimers creating a right-handed superhelix. The dimers are related by a pseudo 3-fold screw axis, with the active sites located at the junction of the subunits (Shen1998Crystal). The hexameric structure is stabilized by contact surfaces between the dimers, although these areas are relatively small for an oligomeric protein (Shen1998Crystal).

## Function
Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in glutamate and ornithine metabolism, operating at the intersection of multiple metabolic pathways. It catalyzes the transfer of the δ-amino group from ornithine to α-ketoglutarate, resulting in the production of glutamate-5-semialdehyde and glutamate (Montioli2021Deficit; Ginguay2017Ornithine). This reaction is essential for the synthesis of several important molecules, including citrulline, arginine, GABA, and proline, and is part of the 'glutamate crossway' in metabolism (Ginguay2017Ornithine).

In healthy human cells, OAT is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix, aligning with its role in pathways involving mitochondrial enzymes (Ginguay2017Ornithine). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various post-translational modifications, which may influence its degradation rate and half-life in different organs (Ginguay2017Ornithine). OAT is involved in the degradation of ornithine, particularly in the liver, where it helps generate glutamate for glutamine synthesis and eliminate excess nitrogen (Ginguay2017Ornithine). In the brain, the glutamate produced by OAT serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters (Ginguay2017Ornithine). OAT's function extends beyond glutamate-related energy metabolism, as it is involved in various metabolic pathways and the regulation of cell fate (Ginguay2017Ornithine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OAT gene, which encodes the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase, are primarily associated with gyrate atrophy (GA) of the choroid and retina, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by progressive vision loss due to chorioretinal degeneration, night blindness, and myopia, often leading to complete blindness between the ages of 20 and 40 (Montioli2021Deficit; Inana1989Point). The disease is marked by hyperornithinemia, resulting from the deficiency of the OAT enzyme, which is crucial for the catabolism of ornithine (Montioli2021Deficit).

Various mutations in the OAT gene have been identified, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, as well as mutations affecting the ATG initiation codon (Montioli2021Deficit). These mutations can lead to reduced enzyme activity or stability, affecting the processing and transport of the OAT protein within mitochondria (Inana1989Point). Some mutations result in B-6-responsive or nonresponsive forms of GA, depending on their impact on the enzyme's ability to bind pyridoxal phosphate, a cofactor necessary for its activity (Ramesh1988Molecular).

The clinical manifestations of GA can vary, with some patients experiencing additional systemic symptoms such as muscle atrophy and peripheral neuropathy (Montioli2021Deficit). Despite the identification of numerous mutations, genotype-phenotype correlations remain complex, and the response to vitamin B6 treatment is not consistently linked to specific mutations (Doimo2012Functional).

## Interactions
Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, although the biological relevance of many of these interactions is not fully understood. Some of the proteins predicted to interact with OAT include NME2, EZR, GOT1/GOT2, ESD, AKR1B1, ALDH1B1, CBS, SOD1, SOD2, PDXK, UAP1L1, UQCRFS1, PREP, PGM1, PITPNB, PPID, and ADSS. These interactions have been identified through in silico methods or large-scale studies, but lack experimental confirmation under physiological conditions (Ginguay2017Ornithine).

A notable interaction involves c-MYC, a transcription factor that increases OAT mRNA levels, suggesting a potential negative feedback mechanism, although its precise role remains unclear (Ginguay2017Ornithine). OAT is primarily located in the mitochondrial matrix, aligning with its metabolic functions, but there are reports of its presence in the cell nucleus, potentially linked to cell division and function, though its nuclear role is not well understood (Ginguay2017Ornithine). These interactions and localizations suggest that OAT may have broader roles in cellular metabolism and regulation beyond its enzymatic activity in amino acid metabolism.
