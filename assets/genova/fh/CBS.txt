# CBS

## Overview
The CBS gene encodes cystathionine beta-synthase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the transsulfuration pathway, facilitating the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. This enzyme is categorized as a lyase, specifically a beta-synthase, and is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance and producing cysteine, a precursor for the antioxidant glutathione (Renga2011Hydrogen; Kraus1993Human). Cystathionine beta-synthase is primarily active in the liver and brain, where it also contributes to the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes (Renga2011Hydrogen). Mutations in the CBS gene can lead to homocystinuria, a disorder characterized by elevated homocysteine levels, which are associated with cardiovascular diseases and other health issues (Bao1998Identification). The enzyme's activity is regulated through complex protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications, highlighting its significance in metabolic and cellular health (Portillo2020Proteinprotein; Kabil2006Human).

## Structure
Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme with a complex multidomain architecture. The primary structure of human CBS consists of 551 amino acids, forming a polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 63 kDa (Majtan2016Targeting; Mendes2014Insights). The secondary structure includes distinct folds within its domains, such as the ααββα and αβαββα folds in the CBS1 and CBS2 domains, respectively (Majtan2016Targeting).

The tertiary structure of CBS is organized into three main domains: the N-terminal domain, which binds a heme cofactor; the central catalytic domain, which binds the PLP cofactor; and the C-terminal regulatory domain, which contains the Bateman module with two CBS domains (Majtan2016Targeting; Mendes2014Insights). The quaternary structure of CBS is a homotetramer, where each subunit interacts to form a functional enzyme (Casique2013Characterization).

CBS undergoes post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation at K211, which inhibits activity, and S-glutathionylation at C346, which activates the enzyme (Majtan2016Targeting). Alternative splicing of the CBS gene results in different isoforms, contributing to the enzyme's functional diversity (Swaroop1992Rat). These structural features are crucial for CBS's role in sulfur amino acid metabolism and its regulation by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Majtan2016Targeting).

## Function
The CBS gene encodes the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase, which plays a critical role in the transsulfuration pathway, a metabolic process essential for the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine. This reaction is the first irreversible step in the pathway and is dependent on the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (Renga2011Hydrogen; Kraus1993Human). CBS is allosterically activated by S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which enhances its affinity for homocysteine (Kraus1993Human). The enzyme is primarily active in the liver and brain, where it contributes to maintaining homocysteine levels and producing cysteine, a precursor for the antioxidant glutathione (Renga2011Hydrogen).

CBS also plays a role in the synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the brain and heart tissues (Renga2011Hydrogen). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular redox balance and detoxification processes, impacting cellular health and preventing vascular diseases (Albertini2012Cystathionine). CBS deficiency can lead to elevated homocysteine levels, which are associated with cardiovascular diseases and other health issues (Bao1998Identification). The enzyme's function is also linked to the regulation of cellular senescence and mitochondrial function, particularly in endothelial cells (Albertini2012Cystathionine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBS gene lead to homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated levels of homocysteine and methionine in the plasma and urine, resulting in severe hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. This condition affects multiple systems, including the eyes, skeleton, vascular system, and central nervous system, with symptoms such as ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, scoliosis, Marfanoid features, premature arteriosclerosis, thromboembolism, and mental retardation (Mendes2013Reduced; Cozar2011Identification). The severity and age of onset of homocystinuria vary widely, from severely affected children to asymptomatic adults (Cozar2011Identification).

The CBS gene mutations can lead to a reduced response to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), affecting enzyme activity and regulation. This impaired activation is a common mechanism in CBS deficiency, contributing to the disease's biochemical basis (Mendes2013Reduced). The most common mutation, p.I278T, is associated with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria and a milder clinical phenotype (Vyletal2007Diversity; Kluijtmans1999The).

Alterations in CBS expression can also impact cardiovascular health, as elevated homocysteine levels are toxic to the vasculature and can promote thromboembolic disease (Maclean2002High).

## Interactions
Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. CBS undergoes post-translational modifications such as sumoylation, which involves interactions with the sumoylation machinery, including the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and E3 SUMO ligases PIAS1, PIAS3, and hPc2. These interactions facilitate the sumoylation of CBS, particularly at the K211 residue, which affects its localization and activity (Portillo2020Proteinprotein; Kabil2006Human).

CBS also interacts with the polycomb protein hPc2, which acts as a SUMO-E3 ligase, enhancing the sumoylation process and decreasing CBS enzyme activity (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The C-terminal regulatory domain of CBS is crucial for these interactions, as its absence prevents binding with Ubc9 and PIAS1 (Kabil2006Human).

In addition to sumoylation, CBS interacts with the Huntingtin protein, although the significance of this interaction remains unclear (Renga2011Hydrogen). CBS domains also bind adenine nucleotides and metal ions, which play a role in the regulation of enzyme activity (Baykov2011The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing CBS function.
