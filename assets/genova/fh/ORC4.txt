# ORC4

## Overview
The ORC4 gene encodes the origin recognition complex subunit 4, a crucial component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) involved in the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. The ORC4 protein is part of the AAA+ superfamily, characterized by ATPase activity, which is essential for its role in DNA replication. It participates in the formation of noncanonical DNA structures and interacts with other ORC subunits to facilitate the loading of the Mcm2-7 helicase onto replication origins, ensuring precise DNA replication and genomic stability (Stefanovic2008Formation; Duncker2009The). Beyond its replication functions, ORC4 is implicated in neuronal development, particularly in dendritic growth and branching (Shen2013The). Mutations in ORC4 are linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in growth and developmental disorders (de2015MeierGorlin; Guernsey2011Mutations).

## Structure
The human ORC4 protein, a component of the origin recognition complex, is encoded by a gene that produces a protein of 436 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa (Quintana1997Identification). The primary structure of ORC4 includes a putative nucleotide triphosphate binding motif, specifically a Walker-type ATP/GTP binding consensus sequence, which is significant for its function in DNA replication (Springer1999Identification). This motif is located within amino acids 67-73 and is characterized by the sequence GXXGXGKT (Quintana1997Identification).

The ORC4 protein is part of the AAA+ superfamily, which are ATPases associated with various cellular activities, suggesting that ATP binding and hydrolysis are crucial for its function (Stefanovic2008Formation). The protein's tertiary structure likely involves the formation of noncanonical DNA structures, such as triplexes, which are stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and require ATP and Mg2+ ions for their formation (Stefanovic2008Formation).

In terms of quaternary structure, ORC4 interacts with other subunits of the origin recognition complex, such as ORC2, but not with ORC1, indicating specific protein-protein interactions within the complex (Springer1999Identification). The expression of ORC4 remains constant throughout the cell cycle, similar to other ORC subunits (Springer1999Identification).

## Function
The ORC4 gene encodes a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. ORC4, along with other ORC subunits, binds to replication origins, marking the sites where DNA replication begins. This complex is crucial for ensuring that DNA replication occurs once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Bell2002The; Duncker2009The).

In healthy human cells, ORC4 plays a critical role in the loading of the Mcm2-7 DNA helicase onto replication origins, a key step in the initiation of DNA replication (Duncker2009The). The ORC4 protein contains conserved AAA+ domains involved in ATP binding, which are characteristic of ATP-dependent clamp-loading proteins. These domains enable the ORC complex to encircle DNA, facilitating the initiation of replication (Duncker2009The). ORC4 also contains a winged-helix domain that mediates DNA binding, highlighting its role in the structural integrity and function of the ORC complex (Duncker2009The).

Beyond its role in DNA replication, ORC4 is associated with neuronal membranes and is required for proper dendritic growth and branching, indicating its involvement in the development and maintenance of neuronal structures (Shen2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ORC4 gene are associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a classical triad of microtia, patellar anomalies, and growth retardation (de2015MeierGorlin; Guernsey2011Mutations). The most commonly reported mutation in ORC4 is p.Tyr174Cys, which affects the AAA+ ATPase domain, crucial for ATPase activity and DNA replication initiation (NielsenDandoroff2023The; Shen2013The). This mutation impairs ATP hydrolysis, leading to defects in DNA replication and cell-cycle progression, contributing to the clinical features of MGS (Shen2013The).

Patients with ORC4 mutations often exhibit severe short stature and microcephaly, with more pronounced phenotypes observed in those with compound heterozygous missense and loss-of-function mutations (de2015MeierGorlin). The mutations result in partial loss of pre-replication complex function, as no homozygous or compound heterozygous null mutations have been detected, suggesting that such mutations may be lethal (de2012Meier–Gorlin).

In Drosophila models, the ORC4 mutation analogous to the human Y174C mutation causes tissue-specific developmental defects, such as sterility and replication issues in high-demand tissues, highlighting the mutation's impact on DNA replication (McDaniel2020Tissue-Specific). These findings underscore the critical role of ORC4 in maintaining genomic stability and normal growth.

## Interactions
The human ORC4 protein, a component of the origin recognition complex (ORC), plays a significant role in DNA replication and interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids. ORC4 is involved in the formation of noncanonical DNA structures, such as T • A • T triplexes and homoadenine duplexes, by binding to A+T rich sequences. This binding is sequence-unspecific and cooperative, with a preference for long alternating or homogeneous AT copolymers (Stefanovic2008Formation). ORC4 also facilitates the self-association of homoadenine oligonucleotides into larger structures, a process that requires Mg²⁺ ions and is inhibited by EDTA (Stefanovic2008Formation).

In the context of DNA replication, ORC4 interacts with the ori-β sequence of the hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) replicator, inducing reversible modifications in the AT-rich region. This interaction suggests that ORC4 can recognize and alter non-canonical DNA structures, which may be crucial for DNA replication processes (Tomic2015HsOrc4dependent).

In murine meiosis, ORC4 is involved in polar body extrusion (PBE) by forming a cage-like structure around chromosomes. This higher-order oligomerization is essential for PBE, and specific sequences within ORC4 are critical for its oligomerization and cage formation (Nguyen2017Higher).
