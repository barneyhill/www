# OR2J3

## Overview
The OR2J3 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily J member 3, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their function in signal transduction across cell membranes (Adhikari2019In; Jimenez2021The). The OR2J3 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in the detection of specific odorants, contributing to the sense of smell (McRae2012Genetic). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2J3 is also expressed in non-sensory tissues, suggesting potential roles in other physiological processes (Dalesio2018Olfactory). Variations in the OR2J3 gene can affect odor perception and have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its significance in both sensory and non-sensory contexts (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional; Lee2018Therapeutic).

## Structure
The OR2J3 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) structure. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to traverse the cell membrane and are composed of hydrophobic alpha helices, which are a key feature of the secondary structure (Adhikari2019In; Jimenez2021The). The primary structure of OR2J3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these helices, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure by folding into a specific three-dimensional shape necessary for its function. 

The tertiary structure is crucial for the receptor's ability to bind odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction through G-protein coupling. Although the quaternary structure is not typically a feature of olfactory receptors, the tertiary structure's integrity is essential for proper receptor function (Jimenez2021The). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability and activity. These modifications are common in GPCRs and play a role in the receptor's localization and function within the olfactory system (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

## Function
The OR2J3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is primarily involved in the detection of specific odorants, such as cis-3-hexen-1-ol, which has a 'grassy' smell. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory signal transduction by binding odor molecules and initiating a cascade of intracellular events that lead to the perception of smell (McRae2012Genetic). 

In healthy human cells, OR2J3 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to its ligands and activates downstream signaling pathways. The receptor's function is influenced by genetic variations, such as the T113A and R226Q substitutions, which can significantly reduce sensitivity to its ligands by affecting odor binding and signal transduction, respectively (McRae2012Genetic). These variations can alter the detection thresholds for specific odors, impacting olfactory perception (McRae2012Genetic).

Beyond the olfactory system, OR2J3 has been identified in non-sensory tissues, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it may modulate cellular signaling pathways, although its specific role in healthy human cells outside the olfactory system is not fully understood (Dalesio2018Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2J3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In cancer research, OR2J3 is expressed in human lung carcinoma tissues and the non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A549. Activation of OR2J3 with the agonist helional can induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Lee2018Therapeutic). OR2J3 is also considered a potential biomarker for non-small-cell lung cancer (Lee2018Therapeutic).

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), OR2J3 is one of the olfactory receptors found to be downregulated in the frontal cortex of PD patients. This downregulation is observed in both premotor and parkinsonian stages, indicating a possible role in the sensory deficits associated with PD (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional).

Additionally, genetic studies on familial hypospadias have identified de novo copy number variants (CNVs) involving OR2J3, suggesting a potential role in the development of this congenital condition. These findings highlight the importance of CNVs in understanding the genetic basis of hypospadias (Kumar2024Exploring).
