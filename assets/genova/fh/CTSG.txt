# CTSG

## Overview
The CTSG gene encodes cathepsin G, a serine protease predominantly expressed in neutrophils, where it plays a pivotal role in the immune response. As a member of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases, cathepsin G is characterized by its chymotrypsin-like fold and catalytic triad, which are essential for its proteolytic activity (Kosikowska2013Inhibitors). The protein is stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and is released upon activation to participate in the degradation of pathogens and modulation of inflammatory processes (DOUKA2024Investigation). Cathepsin G also interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its function in microbial defense and tissue remodeling (Thomas2014Leukocyte). The gene is located on chromosome 14q11.2, within a cluster of hematopoietic serine protease genes, and its expression and activity are implicated in several clinical conditions, including lung cancer and osteomyelitis (Yan2024CTSG; PérezIs2019The).

## Structure
Cathepsin G (CTSG) is a serine protease encoded by the CTSG gene, primarily found in neutrophils. The protein exhibits a typical chymotrypsin fold, which is a common structural motif among serine proteases (Kosikowska2013Inhibitors). The catalytic triad of CTSG consists of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid, which are essential for its proteolytic activity (Kosikowska2013Inhibitors). 

CTSG is part of a cluster of genes encoding hematopoietic serine proteases located on chromosome 14q11.2 (Kosikowska2013Inhibitors). The protein is expressed in neutrophils, mastocytes, and monocytes, and is stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils (Kosikowska2013Inhibitors). 

Post-translational modifications of CTSG include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common among proteins of this family. These modifications can influence the protein's stability, activity, and interactions with other molecules. The tertiary structure of CTSG is stabilized by disulfide bonds, contributing to its functional conformation. 

The protein's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context. The structural features of CTSG enable its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and immune response.

## Function
Cathepsin G (CTSG) is a serine protease primarily stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, where it plays a crucial role in the immune response. It is involved in the degradation of pathogens and modulation of inflammation. Upon activation by cytokines and platelet-activating factors, CTSG is released into the extracellular space, where it contributes to the destruction of ingested pathogens and remodeling of connective tissue at inflammatory sites (DOUKA2024Investigation; PérezIs2019The). 

CTSG exhibits antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, functioning in the endo-lysosomal compartment, cytosol, and on the cell surface (Canive2022The). It activates several extracellular matrix metalloproteinases, aiding in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, which is essential for tissue remodeling and inflammation resolution (PérezIs2019The). 

CTSG also plays a role in platelet aggregation and the synthesis of receptor activator for nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL), which is critical for bone remodeling by activating osteoclast precursors (DOUKA2024Investigation; PérezIs2019The). Its activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as lactoferrin, which enhances its catalytic activity (PérezIs2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Cathepsin G (CTSG) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or function. In the context of HIV-related lung cancer, CTSG expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This reduced expression is associated with the clinical stage and pathological type of lung cancer, suggesting a potential role in disease progression. Although no significant difference in overall survival was observed between high and low CTSG expression groups, a trend towards longer survival was noted in patients with higher CTSG expression. This suggests that CTSG may have a protective role by delaying immune damage and lung cancer development, making it a potential biomarker for prognosis in lung cancer, particularly in HIV-related cases (Yan2024CTSG).

In osteomyelitis, a bacterial infection of the bone, the N125S polymorphism in the CTSG gene is associated with increased susceptibility. This polymorphism leads to higher serum CTSG activity and is more frequent in osteomyelitis patients compared to healthy controls. The increased activity of CTSG may contribute to bone inflammation and remodeling, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis (PérezIs2019The).

## Interactions
Cathepsin G (CTSG) is a serine protease that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune responses and cellular processes. CTSG binds to DNA and RNA with high affinity, which influences its localization and activity within cells. This binding is crucial for its function in microbial defense and cellular processes, as it enhances the cleavage of nucleic acid-binding protein targets (Thomas2014Leukocyte). CTSG, along with neutrophil elastase (NE), localizes to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) through DNA binding, a process important for immune responses (Thomas2014Leukocyte).

CTSG also forms complexes with other proteases, such as elastase and proteinase 3, and interacts with inhibitors like alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). ACT inhibits CTSG by forming a covalent complex, while SLPI inhibits CTSG in a reversible manner, with its inhibition accelerated by heparin binding (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil). These interactions modulate CTSG's proteolytic activity and contribute to its role in inflammatory processes (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil). Additionally, CTSG processes the N-terminal end of the chemokine SDF-1α, affecting its activity and modulating immune responses (Korkmaz2010Neutrophil).
