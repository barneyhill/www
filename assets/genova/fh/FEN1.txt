# FEN1

## Overview
Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a gene that encodes a structure-specific nuclease protein involved in critical DNA metabolic processes, including DNA replication and repair. The FEN1 protein, a metallonuclease, plays a pivotal role in the maturation of Okazaki fragments during lagging strand synthesis and in the long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) pathway, where it cleaves 5' flap structures to maintain genomic stability (Kucherlapati2002Haploinsufficiency; Liu2008Removal). FEN1 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, underscoring its importance in maintaining the integrity of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Liu2008Removal). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), are crucial for its function and are regulated by post-translational modifications (Zheng2011Fen1; Liu2006The). Mutations and polymorphisms in the FEN1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, due to its essential role in DNA repair and replication (Lv2014Association; Zheng2011Fen1).

## Structure
The FEN1 protein, also known as flap structure-specific endonuclease 1, is a metallonuclease composed of 380 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a sequence that forms a nuclease core domain with N-terminal, intermediate, and C-terminal sections, and an extended C-terminal region (Balakrishnan2013Flap; Finger2011FEN1). The secondary structure features a SAM-like or PIN-like fold, characterized by a mixed beta-sheet supported by alpha-helical structures (Finger2011FEN1). 

The tertiary structure of FEN1 is described as a left-handed boxing glove-like shape, with a dual Mg2+ active site located at the base of the flap, sharply bent at 100 degrees (Balakrishnan2013Flap). The protein contains a helical arch and a hydrophobic wedge, which are crucial for its function in cleaving flap DNA structures (Balakrishnan2013Flap; Finger2011FEN1). 

In terms of quaternary structure, FEN1 interacts with other proteins such as PCNA and the Werner protein (WRN), facilitated by its extended C-terminal region (Balakrishnan2013Flap). Post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, regulate FEN1's activity and interactions (Balakrishnan2013Flap; Finger2011FEN1).

## Function
Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a critical enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair processes in healthy human cells. It plays a key role in processing the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments during lagging strand synthesis, ensuring the proper maturation of these fragments by cleaving 5' flap structures (Kucherlapati2002Haploinsufficiency; Harrington1994The). FEN1 is also essential in the long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) pathway, where it removes displaced 5' DNA flaps, allowing DNA ligases to complete the repair process (Liu2008Removal). This activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer (Kucherlapati2002Haploinsufficiency).

FEN1 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, contributing to the repair of oxidative DNA damage in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through its role in LP-BER (Liu2008Removal). Its presence in mitochondria is vital for maintaining mtDNA integrity, which is crucial for preventing mutations and dysfunctions associated with various diseases (Liu2008Removal). The enzyme's dual localization underscores its importance in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA processes (Liu2008Removal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FEN1 gene are associated with various diseases, primarily due to its critical role in DNA replication and repair. In cancer, FEN1 is considered a tumor suppressor, and its dysfunction can lead to genomic instability, increasing the risk of tumorigenesis. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FEN1, such as -69G>A and 4150G>T, have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, as these variants are associated with decreased FEN1 expression in breast tissues (Lv2014Association). Similar associations have been observed in other cancers, including lung, liver, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and glioma cancers (Lv2014Association).

FEN1 mutations can also lead to aneuploidy-associated cancers. The FFAA mutation, which disrupts FEN1's interaction with the proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), results in defects in Okazaki fragment maturation and long-patch base excision repair, causing DNA damage and aneuploidy (Zheng2011Fen1). This mutation has been shown to increase the transformation frequency and susceptibility to cancer (Zheng2011Fen1).

In addition to cancer, FEN1 polymorphisms have been linked to other conditions, such as keratoconus and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy, where they may contribute to increased DNA damage and disease pathogenesis (Wojcik2014Polymorphism).

## Interactions
FEN1, a structure-specific nuclease, is involved in various DNA metabolic pathways through its interactions with multiple proteins and nucleic acids. A key interaction is with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which recruits FEN1 to replication foci and repair sites, enhancing its activity in RNA primer removal and long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) (Zheng2011Fen1; Guo2010Methylation). This interaction is mediated by the PIP box at the C-terminal end of FEN1, specifically involving residues Phe343 and Phe344 (Zheng2011Fen1).

FEN1 also interacts with DNA polymerase δ and DNA ligase I during Okazaki fragment maturation, coordinating the processing of these fragments (Guo2010Methylation). It forms complexes with Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) and Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), which stimulate its nuclease activity, particularly in resolving aberrant DNA structures like hairpin-flap and internal loop substrates (Liu2006The).

FEN1's interactions are regulated by post-translational modifications. Methylation at arginine residues, particularly R192, enhances its binding to PCNA by suppressing nearby phosphorylation, which would otherwise disrupt this interaction (Guo2010Methylation). These interactions and modifications are crucial for FEN1's role in maintaining genomic stability.
