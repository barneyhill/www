# OR2T29

## Overview
OR2T29 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 29, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding specific molecules. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR2T29 and other olfactory receptors are also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where they may influence cellular processes like proliferation and regeneration. The expression patterns and functional roles of OR2T29 in various tissues suggest its involvement in broader physiological processes, including epidermal homeostasis, although its precise functions outside olfaction are still under investigation (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
OR2T29 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odorants in the nasal epithelium, where they bind specific odor molecules and initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of G-proteins, which subsequently trigger a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal signaling and ultimately, the sensation of smell.

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors, including OR2T29, are expressed in other tissues such as the skin. In the skin, these receptors are involved in various cellular functions, including the proliferation, migration, and regeneration of epidermal cells, as well as cytokine production. The expression of OR2T29 and other olfactory receptor genes in the skin suggests a potential role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis. However, in individuals with sensitive skin, OR2T29 is downregulated, which may be associated with disturbances in skin homeostasis and contribute to skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The specific function of OR2T29 in healthy human cells, beyond its role in olfaction, remains an area of ongoing research.
