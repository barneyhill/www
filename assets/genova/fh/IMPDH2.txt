# IMPDH2

## Overview
IMPDH2, or inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2, is a gene that encodes the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2, a critical component in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP), a rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. The IMPDH2 protein is predominantly expressed in rapidly proliferating cells and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA and RNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and immune response. Its activity is regulated through complex interactions and post-translational modifications, and it can form filamentous structures known as cytoophidia, which are implicated in maintaining nucleotide homeostasis. Due to its essential role in cell growth and proliferation, IMPDH2 is a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and immunosuppressive treatments (Keppeke2018IMPGTP; Bremer2007RealTime).

## Structure
The human gene IMPDH2 encodes the enzyme inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2, which plays a crucial role in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. The IMPDH2 protein is a tetramer composed of four monomers, each featuring a catalytic domain and a regulatory Bateman domain (Shi2021Assembly; Johnson2020CryoEM). The catalytic domain is structured as a (β/α)8-barrel, also known as a TIM barrel, which is a common fold in enzymes (Shi2021Assembly). The Bateman domain contains cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) domains, which are involved in the regulation of nucleotide pools and filamentation (Shi2021Assembly; Keppeke2018IMPGTP).

The active site of IMPDH2 is located at Cys319 on the β-folded C-terminal loop (Shi2021Assembly). The enzyme can assemble into filamentous structures known as cytoophidia, which are regulated by the binding of adenine and guanine nucleotides to the Bateman domain (Shi2021Assembly; Johnson2020CryoEM). These assemblies do not directly affect the enzyme's catalytic activity but are involved in its allosteric regulation (Johnson2020CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity and regulation of IMPDH2, although specific details are not provided in the context (Keppeke2018IMPGTP). The N-terminal tail of IMPDH2, which is involved in filament contacts, shows variation in length and sequence across different species, but the residues involved in filament assembly are conserved among chordates (Johnson2020CryoEM).

## Function
IMPDH2 (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2) is a crucial enzyme in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, catalyzing the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP). This reaction is a rate-limiting step in the production of guanine nucleotides, which are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and immune response (Keppeke2018IMPGTP; Bremer2007RealTime). IMPDH2 is the predominant isoform in most tissues and plays a significant role in cell metabolism and proliferation (Keppeke2018IMPGTP).

In healthy human cells, IMPDH2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is upregulated in rapidly dividing cells, making it a target for immunosuppressive and anticancer therapies (Bremer2007RealTime). The enzyme can aggregate into a macrostructure known as the cytoophidium, which is important for maintaining the GTP pool and normal cell proliferation, especially when higher IMPDH activity is required (Keppeke2018IMPGTP). The assembly of cytoophidia is promoted by intracellular IMP accumulation and disassembled by elevated GTP levels, playing a role in guanine nucleotide homeostasis (Keppeke2018IMPGTP). This structure is essential for regular cell metabolism and supports rapid cell proliferation, such as in HeLa cells (Keppeke2018IMPGTP).

## Clinical Significance
IMPDH2 is implicated in the progression of several cancers due to its overexpression, which is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high levels of IMPDH2 correlate with advanced disease stages, lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, and shorter survival times. The overexpression of IMPDH2 in CRC cells enhances proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis, partly through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathways (Duan2018IMPDH2). In glioblastoma (GBM), IMPDH2 is significantly upregulated, contributing to increased malignancy and decreased patient survival. It plays a crucial role in GTP biosynthesis, which is essential for tumor growth and nucleolar transformation in GBM cells (Kofuji2019IMP).

In pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB), elevated IMPDH2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Silencing IMPDH2 in HB cells results in reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024IMPDH2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of IMPDH2 in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
IMPDH2 interacts with several proteins, influencing its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the ANKRD9 protein, which regulates IMPDH2 abundance and assembly. ANKRD9 facilitates the degradation of IMPDH2 by promoting interactions with the ubiquitin-ligase complex, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction is influenced by the metabolic state of the cell, with nutrient limitation causing ANKRD9 to stabilize IMPDH2 in rod-like filaments, a process reversible by guanosine (Hayward2019ANKRD9).

IMPDH2 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 protein, which activates NF-kB signaling, contributing to the inflammatory response during COVID-19. This interaction supports viral replication and cytokine induction, such as IL-6 and IL-8. Inhibitors of IMPDH2, like ribavirin and mycophenolic acid, can reduce NF-kB activation and viral replication, although they do not disrupt the physical interaction between Nsp14 and IMPDH2 (Li2022SARSCoV2).

Additionally, IMPDH2 is a target of the small molecule Inauhzin (INZ), which inhibits its activity, leading to ribosomal stress and activation of the p53 pathway. This interaction highlights IMPDH2's role in cancer cell growth and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2014The).
