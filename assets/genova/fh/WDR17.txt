# WDR17

## Overview
WDR17 is a human gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 17 protein, which is characterized by the presence of multiple WD repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, often forming a beta-propeller structure that is crucial for the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The WD repeat domain 17 protein is predominantly expressed in the retina and testis, indicating its potential roles in sensory perception and reproductive functions. Although the precise biological functions of WDR17 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features suggest involvement in cellular signaling pathways and regulatory processes. The gene's expression patterns and structural characteristics imply a significant role in cellular processes, with potential implications in disease contexts such as retinitis pigmentosa and colorectal cancer, where epigenetic modifications of WDR17 have been observed (Stöhr2002Cloning; Iwaizumi2022Methylation; Li2001Human).

## Structure
The WDR17 gene encodes a protein consisting of 1322 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 147.7 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.0 (Stöhr2002Cloning). The protein features a prominent N-terminal region containing at least 12 conserved WD repeats, which are structural motifs typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Stöhr2002Cloning). These WD repeats are predicted to form a beta-propeller-like structure, a common tertiary structure in WD repeat proteins, characterized by a circularized arrangement of beta sheets (Li2001Human). The C-terminal region of WDR17 does not show significant similarity to known proteins, suggesting it may represent a unique subtype of WD repeat proteins (Stöhr2002Cloning).

Alternative splicing of WDR17 results in different isoforms, including one lacking exon 2, producing a truncated protein of 1298 amino acids, and another involving exon 13, resulting in a protein of 1270 amino acids (Stöhr2002Cloning). The C-terminal region contains several phosphorylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications that could influence the protein's function and interactions (Stöhr2002Cloning). The expression of WDR17 is predominant in the retina and testis, with lower levels in other tissues (Stöhr2002Cloning).

## Function
The WDR17 gene encodes a protein characterized by WD repeats, which are motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats form a beta propeller structure that facilitates the assembly of multiprotein complexes, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Stöhr2002Cloning; Li2001Human). In healthy human cells, WDR17 is predominantly expressed in the retina and testis, suggesting a role in sensory perception and reproductive functions (Stöhr2002Cloning).

The protein's structure includes a significant portion with WD repeats, which are essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways. The C-terminal region of WDR17 contains several phosphorylation sites, indicating potential regulatory roles in these pathways (Stöhr2002Cloning). Although the exact molecular function of WDR17 in healthy cells is not fully elucidated, its involvement in protein interactions and signaling is evident from its structural characteristics and expression patterns (Stöhr2002Cloning).

WDR17's activity in the cytoplasm and its potential role in ciliary function further highlight its importance in cellular processes, although specific organismal outcomes of these processes remain to be fully understood (Li2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR17 gene has been investigated for its potential role in various diseases, although conclusive evidence linking it to specific conditions remains limited. In the context of retinitis pigmentosa (RP29), a study analyzed the WDR17 gene in a consanguineous Pakistani family but did not find any homozygous mutations in the exonic sequences or splice sites of the affected patient. This suggests that WDR17 is likely not the causative gene for RP29, despite its location within a disease-associated region on chromosome 4q34 (Stöhr2002Cloning).

In cancer research, WDR17 has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis through epigenetic modifications. A case report identified hypermethylation of the CpG island promoters of WDR17 in both laterally spreading tumors and colorectal cancer samples. This methylation pattern suggests that WDR17, along with other genes, may contribute to the progression from benign lesions to malignant cancer, highlighting the potential role of epigenetic alterations in cancer development (Iwaizumi2022Methylation).

Overall, while WDR17's involvement in specific diseases is not fully established, its expression and epigenetic modifications suggest it may play a role in certain pathological conditions.
