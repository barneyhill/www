# MEP1B

## Overview
The MEP1B gene encodes the meprin A subunit beta, a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that belongs to the astacin family and the metzincin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed on the cell surface as a glycosylated, disulfide-linked dimer and plays a significant role in the extracellular proteolytic processing of various proteins. Meprin β is involved in critical physiological processes, including the regulation of epithelial integrity and tissue architecture, by cleaving substrates such as MUC2 mucin and E-cadherin. Its activity is modulated by factors like pH, calcium concentration, and glucocorticoid levels. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as human fetuin-A and amyloid precursor protein, highlight its involvement in diverse biological pathways, including inflammatory responses and Alzheimer's disease pathology (Huguenin2008The; Red2005Meprin; Schütte2014Microbialinduced; Norman2003Expression).

## Structure
The MEP1B gene encodes the meprin β protein, a Zn-dependent protease that is part of the astacin family and metzincin superfamily. The primary structure of meprin β consists of 706 amino acids, and the protein is expressed as a glycosylated, disulfide-linked dimer on the cell surface (Red2005Meprin). The secondary structure includes a twisted β-sheet and α-helices in the N-terminal subdomain (NTS), while the C-terminal subdomain (CTS) is characterized by short helices and turns (Linnert2021Structure).

The tertiary structure of meprin β involves a deep and narrow active site cleft with a catalytic zinc ion, coordinated by a conserved zinc-binding motif HExxHxxGxxH (Linnert2021Structure). The quaternary structure is a homodimeric complex, with monomers linked by an intermolecular disulfide bridge (Linnert2021Structure). Meprin β contains several domains, including a signal peptide, pro-peptide, astacin-like protease domain, MAM domain, TRAF domain, EGF-like domain, transmembrane domain, and cytosolic tail (Red2005Meprin; Linnert2021Structure).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is removed during crystallization to reduce heterogeneity (Linnert2021Structure). Two mRNA variants, b and b', have been identified, differing in their 5' untranslated regions (Red2005Meprin).

## Function
The MEP1B gene encodes the beta subunit of meprin A, a metalloprotease enzyme involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. Meprin β is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it plays a crucial role in the proteolytic processing of proteins such as MUC2 mucin and E-cadherin. In the small intestine, meprin β cleaves MUC2 mucin, facilitating the release of anchored mucus, which is essential for maintaining a healthy intestinal environment by preventing bacterial overgrowth and aiding in nutrient absorption (Schütte2014Microbialinduced). 

Meprin β also processes E-cadherin, a key component of cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. This cleavage results in a reduction of intercellular adhesive strength, which can influence epithelial barrier function and potentially contribute to processes like tissue remodeling and cellular interactions (Huguenin2008The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by factors such as pH and calcium concentration, and its expression is influenced by glucocorticoid levels during development (Norman2003Expression). Through these activities, meprin β contributes to the regulation of epithelial integrity and the maintenance of tissue architecture.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MEP1B gene, which encodes the meprin β subunit, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of diabetic nephropathy, particularly among the Pima Indian population, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MEP1B have been associated with the condition. These SNPs may influence the transcription of the gene, affecting its expression and potentially contributing to renal pathology (Red2005Meprin).

In Alzheimer's disease, meprin β acts as an alternative β-secretase, contributing to the generation of amyloid-beta peptides, which are central to the disease's pathology. Knockout studies in mouse models have shown that the absence of meprin β reduces brain amyloid-beta levels and improves cognitive functions, suggesting its role in the disease's progression (Marengo2022Meprin).

Meprin β is also involved in cancer, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) observed in various tumors, including melanoma, uterine cancer, and lung cancer. These SNVs can alter the protease's catalytic activity, potentially affecting tumor growth and metastasis (Peters2019Role). The gene's dysregulation may lead to the cleavage of adhesion molecules, promoting cancer cell detachment and proliferation (Peters2019Role).

## Interactions
Meprin β (MEP1B) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its activity and function. It interacts with human fetuin-A, an endogenous inhibitor, which strongly inhibits meprin β compared to meprin α. This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues in meprin β such as Ser122, Glu137, His186, Asn189, and Tyr191 forming hydrogen bonds with fetuin-A (Dholey2019An).

Meprin β also interacts with a group of disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs), specifically ADAM9, 10, and 17. It cleaves these ADAM proteins at specific sites, activating them by removing their inhibitory prodomains. This activation is significant for regulating protease activity at the cell surface and can influence inflammatory responses (Wichert2019Meprin).

Additionally, meprin β interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), cleaving it at the cell surface to generate amyloid β peptides independently of BACE-1 activity. This interaction is important in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as it affects the generation of aggregation-prone peptides (Schönherr2016Generation).
