# PIK3C2B

## Overview
PIK3C2B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 beta, which is a member of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including endosomal trafficking, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. As a kinase, it is involved in the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides, which are critical for intracellular signaling pathways. PIK3C2B is particularly significant in the context of insulin signaling and cancer cell migration, where it influences processes such as cell motility and metastasis. The protein's interactions with growth factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), further underscore its importance in cellular signaling networks (Margaria2019Class; Arcaro2000Class). Alterations in PIK3C2B expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and muscle disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2020&lt).

## Structure
PIK3C2B encodes a protein that is part of the class II phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and is involved in various cellular processes. The protein structure includes a well-conserved PI3K core domain, which comprises a central C2 domain, a helical domain, and a kinase domain (Margaria2019Class). At the C-terminal, PIK3C2B features C2 and phosphoinositide-binding PX domains, which facilitate its interaction with phospholipids and recruitment to the plasma membrane (Margaria2019Class). The PX-C2 module can inhibit enzymatic activity in the cytoplasm by folding back onto the kinase domain, but it is crucial for activation on PI(4,5)P2-positive membranes (Margaria2019Class).

The N-terminal region of PIK3C2B contains a clathrin-binding domain and regions that interact with Raptor in the mTOR complex 1, as well as a Ras-binding domain, although no direct interaction with Ras has been observed (Margaria2019Class). PIK3C2B is also known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization within the cell (Falasca2016Class).

## Function
PIK3C2B encodes a class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in endosomal trafficking by converting APPL1-positive endosomes into EEA1-positive endosomes, which is essential in metabolically active tissues. This function is selective for endosomal trafficking and does not affect autophagic vesicles (Margaria2019Class). PIK3C2B is also involved in clathrin-dependent pinocytosis, where it interacts with the scaffold protein Intersectin 1 to facilitate actin polymerization (Margaria2019Class).

In terms of cell signaling, PIK3C2B contributes to insulin receptor trafficking and AKT activation, influencing insulin signaling pathways. It generates a localized pool of PI(3)P on early endosomes during insulin signaling and on the nuclear envelope, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Margaria2019Class). PIK3C2B also plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration through Rac-dependent mechanisms. It forms a complex with Eps8, Abi1, and Sos1, which regulates Rac activity, impacting membrane ruffling and cell motility (Katso2006Phosphoinositide).

PIK3C2B's activity is significant in cancer cell migration and invasion, particularly in prostate and ovarian cancers, where it promotes the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, facilitating metastasis (Margaria2019Class).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIK3C2B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and muscle disorders. In colon cancer, the IQGAP3-PIK3C2B axis is associated with increased tumor invasion and progression. Overexpression of IQGAP3 leads to elevated PIK3C2B levels, enhancing the invasive capabilities of colorectal cancer cells. This relationship is linked to worse pathological parameters and prognosis, including shorter survival times and lower 5-year survival rates in patients (p&gt; Integrative; Liu2020&lt).

In neuroblastoma, PIK3C2B is highly expressed and contributes to tumorigenesis by stabilizing MYCN, a factor associated with poor prognosis. Silencing PIK3C2B reduces tumor growth and AKT activation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Russo2015Phosphatidylinositol).

In the context of myotubular myopathy, PIK3C2B acts as a genetic modifier of the MTM1 mutation. Inhibition of PIK3C2B in animal models improves muscle structure and function, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for this muscle disorder (Sabha2016PIK3C2B).

## Interactions
PIK3C2B, a class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase, interacts with several growth factor receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Upon stimulation with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF, PIK3C2B is recruited to phosphotyrosine signaling complexes containing these receptors. This recruitment is mediated by specific phosphotyrosine residues on EGFR, particularly (p)Y992, (p)Y1068, and (p)Y1173, which are part of the consensus sequence E(p)YL/I (Arcaro2000Class).

The N-terminal region of PIK3C2B is crucial for its interaction with EGFR, and this interaction is enhanced in EGF-stimulated conditions. The presence of phosphopeptides containing the E(p)YL sequence significantly increases the interaction with PIK3C2B, indicating the importance of these motifs in binding (Arcaro2000Class). PIK3C2B does not coimmunoprecipitate with other molecules known to interact with EGFR, such as p85α, c-Src, Shc, and Grb2, suggesting a unique interaction pathway (Arcaro2000Class).

PIK3C2B also interacts with ErbB-2 in both quiescent and EGF-stimulated cells, highlighting its role in EGF-mediated signaling pathways (Arcaro2000Class). These interactions underscore PIK3C2B's involvement in cellular signaling processes related to growth factor receptor activation.
