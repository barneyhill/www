# REX1BD

## Overview
The REX1BD gene encodes a protein known as the Required for Excision 1-B Domain Containing protein, which is implicated in various biological processes, including DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. This protein is categorized as a putative DNA repair protein, suggesting its involvement in maintaining genomic stability. REX1BD has garnered attention in medical research due to its role in disease mechanisms, particularly in leprosy and cancer. Its expression and interactions are critical in the early detection of leprosy and in the regulatory pathways of prostate and colorectal cancers. The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in clinical diagnostics and treatment strategies (Jiang2021Transcriptional; Ahamad2022Using; Stodolna2020Clinicalgrade; Stodolna2021Clinicalgrade; Gil2022Perfect).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The REX1BD gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In the context of leprosy, REX1BD is part of the RISK4LEP signature, a set of blood transcriptomic biomarkers that can predict the onset of leprosy years before clinical symptoms appear. This early detection capability suggests a significant role for REX1BD in the progression of leprosy (Ahamad2022Using).

In cancer research, REX1BD has been identified as a target gene influenced by interactions between the transcription factor MYC and the long noncoding RNA AL590617.2 in prostate cancer. This interaction suggests a regulatory loop that affects the expression of REX1BD, potentially impacting cancer progression (Jiang2021Transcriptional). Additionally, REX1BD is included in gene panels used to classify tumor samples, indicating its involvement in cancer diagnostics (Gil2022Perfect).

In colorectal cancer, REX1BD has been noted for copy number gains, suggesting its potential role as a putative DNA repair gene. Although specific diseases directly linked to REX1BD mutations are not detailed, its involvement in DNA repair implies a possible connection to cancer biology (Stodolna2021Clinicalgrade; Stodolna2020Clinicalgrade).
