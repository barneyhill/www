# RDH14

## Overview
RDH14 is a gene that encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 14, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, specifically categorized under the SDR7C subfamily. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of retinoids, catalyzing the interconversion of retinaldehyde and retinol, with a preference for all-trans-retinaldehyde as a substrate. Unlike other members of its family, retinol dehydrogenase 14 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues but is notably absent in the eye, suggesting a unique functional role (Belyaeva2019Generation; Pastore2021Biallelic). The protein is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, which is atypical for enzymes involved in retinoic acid synthesis, indicating potential novel functions in cellular processes (Pastore2021Biallelic). RDH14 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, with mutations in the gene associated with intellectual disability and cerebellar atrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Pastore2021Biallelic).

## Function
RDH14 (retinol dehydrogenase 14) is a member of the SDR7C family of short-chain dehydrogenase reductase enzymes, which play a crucial role in retinoic acid catabolism and homeostasis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of retinaldehyde to retinol and vice versa, with a preference for all-trans-retinaldehyde as a substrate (Pastore2021Biallelic). RDH14 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, including the brain, but notably not in the eye, distinguishing it from other members of the SDR7C family (Belyaeva2019Generation; Pastore2021Biallelic).

In cellular biology, RDH14 is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, which is unexpected given that retinoic acid synthesis is typically cytoplasmic (Pastore2021Biallelic). It has been shown to interact with proton-activated chloride channel 1 (PACC1), which is highly expressed in the brain and forms an acid-sensitive anion channel. This interaction suggests a potential role in neurodevelopmental processes, as disruption of retinoic acid signaling is linked with intellectual disability disorders (Pastore2021Biallelic).

The exact in vivo role of RDH14 remains to be fully elucidated, as animal knockout models have not been characterized (Belyaeva2019Generation). However, its enzymatic activity and interactions suggest it may influence neuronal differentiation and maturation (Pastore2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RDH14 gene have been implicated in intellectual disability and cerebellar atrophy. A study on a Pakistani family identified a biallelic frameshifting variant in RDH14, which is associated with intellectual disability and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a potential novel association with these conditions (Pastore2021Biallelic). The mutation leads to early protein truncation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which may disrupt normal protein interactions and alter neuronal marker expression (Pastore2021Biallelic). 

RDH14 is involved in retinoic acid homeostasis, and its disruption may affect retinoic acid signaling, which is linked to various intellectual disability disorders such as Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome (Pastore2021Biallelic). The gene's interaction with proton-activated chloride channel 1 (PACC1) is also significant, as disruption of this interaction is associated with protection against acid-induced neuronal apoptosis (Pastore2021Biallelic). Despite these findings, there is currently no supporting evidence from other families or animal studies to confirm the association of RDH14 mutations with intellectual disability, indicating the need for further research (Pastore2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
RDH14 (retinol dehydrogenase 14) is known to participate in protein-protein interactions, particularly with TMEM206, also known as proton-activated chloride channel 1 (PACC1). This interaction was identified through affinity capture-mass spectrometry and GST pull-down assays, which demonstrated that RDH14 binds to PACC1, a channel highly expressed in the brain and involved in acid-sensitive anion channel formation (Pastore2021Biallelic). The interaction between RDH14 and PACC1 is significant because disruption of PACC1 is known to protect against acid-induced neuronal apoptosis, suggesting a potential role for RDH14 in neuronal survival and function (Pastore2021Biallelic).

A truncating mutation in RDH14 has been shown to reduce its interaction with PACC1, indicating that the integrity of RDH14 is crucial for this interaction (Pastore2021Biallelic). Although BioGRID suggested BRINP2 (FAM5B) as another potential interactor, this was not confirmed by experimental assays such as GST pull-down (Pastore2021Biallelic). These findings suggest that RDH14 may have roles beyond its enzymatic function, potentially involving regulatory interactions in retinoic acid signaling and chloride ion homeostasis in the brain (Pastore2021Biallelic).
