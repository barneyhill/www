# ID1

## Overview
The ID1 gene encodes the protein inhibitor of DNA binding 1, a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins. This protein functions as a dominant-negative regulator of basic HLH transcription factors, lacking a DNA-binding domain and thus inhibiting transcription by forming non-functional heterodimers with other HLH proteins (Pesce1993The; Wong2004Id1). ID1 plays a critical role in cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and senescence by modulating cell cycle progression and maintaining proliferative capacity (Hara1994Idrelated). It is primarily located in the nucleus and is regulated by signaling pathways, including transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) (Ruzinova2003Id). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in both normal cellular activities and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where its altered expression is linked to tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes (Suh2008Id1; Perk2005Id).

## Structure
The ID1 protein is characterized by a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, which is crucial for its function. This domain allows ID1 to form dimers with other HLH proteins, inhibiting their ability to bind DNA and regulate transcription (Zhu1995Id; Roschger2017The). The HLH domain consists of two α-helices connected by a loop, forming a non-covalent, parallel, left-handed four-helix bundle (Roschger2017The). This structure is highly conserved and resistant to sequence modifications, which can alter its conformation and function (Roschger2017The).

The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of ID1 are mainly disordered and contain regulatory signals such as phosphorylation sites and destruction boxes (D-box) that trigger protein degradation (Roschger2017The). ID1, along with other Id proteins, is subject to post-translational modifications like ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which influence protein interactions (Roschger2017The). A splice variant of ID1 differs in the C-terminal domain and has a higher propensity to homodimerize (Roschger2017The). The protein is also involved in cell-cycle regulation and is degraded via the 26 S proteasome pathway (Roschger2017The).

## Function
The ID1 gene encodes a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein that functions as a dominant-negative regulator of basic HLH transcription factors. It lacks a DNA-binding domain, allowing it to inhibit the activity of other transcription factors by forming non-functional heterodimers. In healthy human cells, ID1 is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and senescence. It plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression by inhibiting differentiation and delaying replicative senescence, thereby maintaining the proliferation ability of normal cells (Wong2004Id1; Hara1994Idrelated). ID1 is transiently induced during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is essential for the transition from G0 to S phase, facilitating DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression (Hara1994Idrelated). The protein is primarily located in the nucleus, where it influences pathways related to cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Wong2004Id1). ID1's expression is regulated by signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP), which can upregulate its expression through Smad transcription factors (Ruzinova2003Id). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of transcriptional activities necessary for normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ID1 gene are implicated in various cancers and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), ID1 expression is upregulated and linked to chromosomal abnormalities such as 5q and/or 7q deletions and t(15;17) translocations. ID1 may contribute to a block in granulocyte differentiation and the pathogenesis of AML, suggesting its potential as a molecular target for therapy (Suh2008Id1). In breast cancer, ID1 overexpression is part of a metastasis signature and is associated with increased invasiveness and poor prognosis (Perk2005Id). 

In thyroid cancer, ID1 expression is significantly upregulated in hyperplastic and neoplastic tissues, with the highest levels observed in anaplastic thyroid cancer. This upregulation is linked to increased growth and reduced differentiation of thyroid cancer cells, indicating ID1's role in cancer progression (Kebebew2004Id1). 

ID1 also plays a role in immune response modulation in cancer. In melanoma, ID1 overexpression leads to the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which suppress T-cell function and promote tumor progression (Papaspyridonos2015Id1). Elevated ID1 levels are associated with centrosome abnormalities, contributing to genomic instability and tumor aggressiveness in various cancers (Manthey2010Elevated).

## Interactions
The ID1 protein, a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family, is known for its interactions with other proteins rather than directly binding to DNA due to its lack of a DNA-binding domain. ID1 primarily interacts with basic HLH (bHLH) transcription factors, such as E proteins and MyoD, forming heterodimeric complexes that inhibit these factors from binding DNA. This interaction prevents the formation of active transcription complexes, thereby inhibiting gene expression (Pesce1993The; Sun1991Id).

The HLH domain of ID1 is crucial for its interactions, as it allows ID1 to bind efficiently with E proteins like E47 and E12, inhibiting their DNA-binding capabilities. ID1 binds more effectively to E proteins than to MyoD, although it can weakly form heterodimers with MyoD (Pesce1993The). The loop region of ID1, particularly the proline and leucine residues, is critical for specifying dimerization partners and maintaining its inhibitory function (Pesce1993The).

ID1 also interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, stabilizing LMP1 by reducing its polyubiquitination and preventing degradation (Hau2011Id1). These interactions highlight ID1's role as a dominant negative regulator in various cellular processes.
