# TENM1

## Overview
TENM1, or teneurin transmembrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. The protein, characterized by its large extracellular region, single transmembrane helix, and short intracellular domain, plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment, including neuronal connectivity and synaptic specificity. It is expressed in several brain regions, such as the retina and cerebellum, and is implicated in processes like neuronal migration and synapse formation. The protein's structure includes domains such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and a YD-repeat domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. TENM1 is also involved in cell signaling pathways and has been linked to conditions such as congenital general anosmia and certain cancers, where it influences cell migration and invasion (Carcelen2022Signaling; Jackson2019Teneurin; Kenzelmann2008Teneurin1).

## Structure
TENM1, or teneurin transmembrane protein 1, is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a large extracellular region, a single transmembrane helix, and a short intracellular domain. The extracellular region of TENM1 includes several key structural features, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and a YD-repeat domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Jackson2019Teneurin). The YD-repeat domain forms a large, hollow shell-like structure known as the YD-shell, which is thought to bind negatively charged heparin glycans (Jackson2019Teneurin).

TENM1 also contains a fibronectin (FN) type-III domain, referred to as the FN-plug domain, and a six-bladed β-propeller domain known as the NHL domain. The NHL domain is essential for homophilic interactions, which are important for synaptic partner matching (Jackson2019Teneurin). The protein's structure is further supported by a transthyretin-like (TTR) domain and a cysteine-rich motif, which contribute to its stability and function (Jackson2019Teneurin).

Post-translational modifications of TENM1 may include glycosylation, which is common in large extracellular proteins and contributes to their structural integrity and function (Jackson2019Teneurin). TENM1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, which are important for its quaternary structure and functional interactions (Jackson2019Teneurin).

## Function
TENM1, or teneurin transmembrane protein 1, is a type II transmembrane protein involved in several critical processes in cell biology and neurodevelopment. It plays a significant role in the developing nervous system, particularly in establishing neuronal connectivity and synaptic specificity. TENM1 is expressed in interconnected regions of the brain, such as the retina, optic tectum, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum, suggesting its involvement in neuronal migration, axonal growth, and synapse formation and maintenance (Kenzelmann2008Teneurin1).

The protein contains an intracellular domain (ICD) with a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which allows it to translocate to the nucleus and potentially alter gene expression. This translocation is facilitated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis, resulting in a soluble ICD that may have a signaling function within the nucleus (Kenzelmann2008Teneurin1). TENM1 also interacts with the cytoskeleton, influencing cell signaling pathways and cellular structure (Cheung2019Expression).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopment, TENM1 is implicated in synaptic organization and partner matching, particularly in the olfactory system, where it contributes to synapse organization and connectivity (Alkelai2016A). These functions highlight TENM1's importance in maintaining neural circuit formation and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TENM1 gene have been implicated in congenital general anosmia (CGA), a condition characterized by a complete inability to sense odors from birth. A study identified a rare X-linked missense mutation in TENM1 in a family with multiple members affected by CGA. This mutation affects a highly conserved proline residue and is predicted to be damaging, suggesting a role in synaptic-partner-matching between axons of olfactory sensory neurons and target projection neurons (Alkelai2016A). The inheritance pattern appears to be X-linked dominant with incomplete penetrance, as the mutation was maternally inherited in the studied family (Alkelai2016A).

In cancer, alterations in TENM1 expression have been observed. TENM1 is upregulated in certain brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, where it promotes cell migration and invasion by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton through RhoA signaling. This upregulation is associated with poor outcomes in patients (Carcelen2022Signaling). In glioblastoma stem cells, TENM1 expression is increased under hypoxic conditions, contributing to the invasiveness of the cancer cells (Carcelen2022Signaling). These findings suggest that TENM1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma treatment.

## Interactions
TENM1, also known as teneurin transmembrane protein 1, participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and synaptic organization. TENM1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, affecting cell motility through its intracellular domain (ICD) and the Teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP-1). The TENM1 ICD induces RHOA gene expression, activating Rho-dependent kinase signaling, while TCAP-1 interacts with a dystroglycan receptor complex, activating MEK and ERK signaling pathways (RebolledoJaramillo2018Teneurins:).

TENM1 also forms cis-heterodimers with other teneurin paralogues, suggesting the potential for diverse molecular complexes that may engage in trans-interactions with other proteins (Cheung2022Teneurin). In synaptic contexts, TENM1 localizes to synaptic sites, forming discrete puncta along dendrites and axons, and partially co-localizes with synaptic markers such as synapsin I, vGLUT, and PSD-95, indicating its involvement in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic compartments (Cheung2022Teneurin).

In cancer, TENM1 is implicated in cell migration and invasion, particularly in glioblastoma stem cells, where it remodels the actin cytoskeleton through RhoA signaling (Carcelen2022Signaling). These interactions highlight TENM1's role in modulating integrin-mediated signaling, crucial for cell migration and invasion (RebolledoJaramillo2018Teneurins:).
