# TENT5C

## Overview
TENT5C, also known as FAM46C, is a gene that encodes the protein terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5C, a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase. This protein is categorized as a nucleotidyltransferase and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA polyadenylation, particularly in immunoglobulin mRNAs, which is crucial for B cell function and the humoral immune response (Bilska2020Immunoglobulin). TENT5C is highly expressed in activated B cells and is involved in maintaining the stability and translation of mRNAs, especially those encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted proteins (Liudkovska2020Functions; Bilska2020Immunoglobulin). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) and ribosomal proteins, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes, including tumor suppression and immune response regulation (Bilska2019B; Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C). Mutations in TENT5C have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2021Structural; Lai2024Dissecting).

## Structure
TENT5C, also known as FAM46C, is a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase with a nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The protein is composed of 391 amino acids and features a bilobal structure typical of NTase family enzymes, with a catalytic N-terminal domain and a central C-terminal domain (Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C; Chen2020Structural). The catalytic domain includes a seven-stranded beta sheet covered by six alpha helices, forming a substrate-binding pocket with a strong positive electrostatic potential, aiding RNA substrate binding (Chen2020Structural).

Key active-site residues, such as Gly73/Ser74, Asp90/Asp92, and Glu166, are conserved across FAM46 family members and are essential for its enzymatic function (Chen2020Structural). The protein's structure also includes a central cleft formed by an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal helical domain, with the latter characterized by five alpha helices assembled through hydrophobic interactions (Zhang2021Structural).

TENT5C is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in ER-related functions, particularly during B cell differentiation. It is membrane-bound and partially co-localizes with the ER, suggesting its role in ER functionality (Bilska2019B). The protein's interaction with Plk4, a kinase involved in centriole duplication, is independent of its nucleotidyl transferase activity (Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C).

## Function
TENT5C encodes a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of immunoglobulin (Ig) mRNA polyadenylation, which is essential for their stability and expression levels in B cells. This process is vital for the proper function of the humoral immune response, as it affects the production and secretion of antibodies (Bilska2020Immunoglobulin). TENT5C is highly expressed in activated B cells and is upregulated during B cell differentiation, particularly in plasma cells, through innate signaling pathways such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Bilska2020Immunoglobulin).

In healthy cells, TENT5C is involved in maintaining the poly(A) tail length of Ig mRNAs, which is crucial for their stability and translation. This activity is particularly important for mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted proteins, affecting the secretory capacity of B cells (Liudkovska2020Functions; Bilska2020Immunoglobulin). The absence of TENT5C leads to reduced ER volume and a diminished unfolded protein response, impairing the secretory pathway and antibody production (Bilska2020Immunoglobulin). TENT5C's role in cytoplasmic polyadenylation is linked to stimulating the humoral immune response and is critical for B cell proliferation, differentiation, and the unfolded protein response necessary for antibody-secreting cell development (Bilska2020Immunoglobulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TENT5C gene, also known as FAM46C, have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In multiple myeloma (MM), TENT5C is frequently mutated or deleted, with such genetic changes linked to disease progression, relapse, and poor survival outcomes (Zhang2021Structural). These mutations can also lead to resistance to treatments like panobinostat, dexamethasone, and lenalidomide (Zhang2021Structural). TENT5C acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) activity, which is crucial for preventing centriole overduplication and subsequent tumorigenesis. Loss of TENT5C function is associated with adverse prognosis in multiple myeloma and colorectal cancer (Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C).

In colorectal cancer, reduced expression of TENT5C correlates with cancer progression and poor prognosis (Lai2024Dissecting). TENT5C's tumor suppressor role extends to other cancers, including prostate, gastric, hepatocellular, and potentially lung cancer, where its expression levels are generally anti-correlated with disease severity (Lai2024Dissecting). In prostate cancer, high TENT5C expression is linked to better survival, and its overexpression inhibits tumor growth (Lai2024Dissecting). These findings suggest that TENT5C could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TENT5C, also known as FAM46C, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a tumor suppressor and its role in RNA processing. TENT5C physically interacts with Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4), a serine/threonine kinase crucial for centriole duplication. This interaction occurs predominantly within the kinase domain of Plk4 and inhibits its activity, thereby restraining centriole duplication and cancer cell invasion (Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C). The interaction between TENT5C and Plk4 is independent of Plk4's kinase activity and does not result in phosphorylation of TENT5C (Kazazian2020FAM46CTENT5C).

TENT5C also interacts with ribosomal proteins, suggesting a role in polyadenylating immunoglobulin mRNAs at the rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for B cell maturation (Bilska2019B). In multiple myeloma cells, TENT5C interacts with proteins such as FNDC3A and FNDC3B, affecting cell trafficking and secretion, and inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress (Zhang2021Structural). Additionally, TENT5C binds to polyadenylate-binding proteins like PABPC1, which is involved in mRNA regulation (Bilska2019B; Kuchta2016FAM46). These interactions highlight TENT5C's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression and immune response regulation.
