# ANKRD40

## Overview
ANKRD40, or ankyrin repeat domain 40, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ankyrin repeat protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and cellular structural organization. The protein encoded by ANKRD40 is implicated in cytoskeletal anchoring and cellular integrity, functioning as a cytoskeletal adaptor with binding capabilities to spectrin and other cytoskeletal components (Zhang2018Structure). It has been identified as a potential substrate for Protein Kinase A (PKA) in endothelial cells, suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways that may influence cellular responses (Zhao2019Endothelial). Additionally, ANKRD40 is associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential involvement in neurological processes (Lupo2019Molecular). Despite its emerging significance in various cellular and disease contexts, the precise functions and interactions of ANKRD40 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its biological roles.

## Function
ANKRD40, or ankyrin repeat domain 40, is a protein that plays a role in cellular structure and organization. It is predicted to be an ankyrin repeat protein, which is a class of proteins known for their involvement in cytoskeleton anchoring. The molecular functions of ANKRD40 include cytoskeletal protein binding, spectrin binding, and cytoskeletal adaptor activity, suggesting that it interacts with cytoskeletal components to maintain cellular structure (Zhang2018Structure).

ANKRD40 has been identified as a potential substrate for Protein Kinase A (PKA) in endothelial cells, indicating its involvement in PKA-related pathways. This suggests a role in signal transduction processes that may influence cellular responses and functions (Zhao2019Endothelial).

In the context of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, ANKRD40 has been associated with a module of co-expressed genes linked to cognitive impairment. This association suggests a potential role in neurological processes, although the specific functions in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Lupo2019Molecular).

Overall, ANKRD40 is implicated in maintaining cellular integrity and potentially participating in signaling pathways, although its precise functions in healthy human cells require further investigation.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD40 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In melanoma, reduced expression of ANKRD40 is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and a marker for prognosis (Mann2015Transposon). In HER2-positive breast cancer, ANKRD40 has been found to be amplified in a significant number of tumors with ERBB2 amplification, although it is located outside the ERBB2 amplicon. This amplification indicates that ANKRD40 may be involved in the pathology of these tumors, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Kalari2013An).

In pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), ANKRD40 is part of a gene signature associated with the hypodiploid subtype, which is predictive of minimal residual disease (MRD). This suggests that ANKRD40 may play a role in the risk stratification of MRD patients, although no single molecular signature, including ANKRD40, has been found to predict treatment response across all B-ALL subtypes (SitthiAmorn2015Transcriptome). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ANKRD40 in various cancers, although further research is needed to fully understand its role.

## Interactions
ANKRD40, or ankyrin repeat domain 40, is a protein that has been identified as a potential interaction partner of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) through various methods, including affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), yeast-two-hybrid, and proximity ligation-mass spectrometry (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). However, the functional relevance of this interaction has not been extensively studied, and specific details about the nature of the interaction remain unclear.

In the context of endothelial cells, ANKRD40 has been identified as a potential substrate of protein kinase A (PKA), specifically in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This was determined using a chemical genetics approach that identified ANKRD40 among 97 proteins as potential PKA substrates, with a significant log ratio indicating its enrichment in samples treated with analogue-specific PKACa compared to wild-type PKACa (Zhao2019Endothelial). This suggests a possible regulatory role for ANKRD40 in endothelial PKA activity, although the specific interactions and mechanisms involved have not been detailed.

Despite these findings, there is limited information on ANKRD40's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in cellular processes.
