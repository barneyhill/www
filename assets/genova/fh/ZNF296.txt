# ZNF296

## Overview
ZNF296 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 296, a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and interaction with other proteins. ZNF296 is notably associated with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, playing a crucial role in recruiting this complex to specific genomic loci, thereby influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Kloet2018NuRD-interacting). The protein is implicated in maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and regulating primordial germ cell development by modulating histone H3K9 methylation, a key epigenetic marker (Miyazaki2023Zfp296; Matsuura2017Zfp296). Additionally, ZNF296 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target in multiple myeloma due to its essential role in the survival of these cancer cells (de2023Genomescale).

## Function
ZNF296, a zinc finger protein, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and maintaining chromatin structure in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, binding to DNA near transcription start sites and influencing chromatin accessibility. This activity is associated with the modulation of histone H3K9 methylation, a key marker of heterochromatin, which is crucial for gene silencing and chromatin compaction (Miyazaki2023Zfp296; Matsuura2017Zfp296).

ZNF296 interacts with components of the NuRD complex, a chromatin remodeling complex, suggesting its involvement in recruiting this complex to specific genomic loci to regulate gene expression (Kloet2018NuRD-interacting). The protein's activity is linked to maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression, which is essential for proper cell differentiation and development (Miyazaki2023Zfp296).

ZNF296 is also implicated in the regulation of primordial germ cell development, where it negatively regulates H3K9 methylation, ensuring proper epigenetic reprogramming and gene expression during embryogenesis (Matsuura2017Zfp296). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF296 has been identified as having a significant role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). A study using genome-scale CRISPR gene-editing screens found that ZNF296 is preferentially essential for MM cells compared to other neoplastic cells. This suggests that ZNF296, along with other transcription factors and cofactors, may be critical in the development and progression of MM, highlighting potential therapeutic targeting opportunities (de2023Genomescale).

In the context of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), ZNF296 has been noted for acquiring mutations at relapse, indicating its involvement in the clonal evolution of the disease during chemotherapy. However, the specific clinical significance of these mutations in ZNF296 remains unclear, as the focus of the study was on the broader mutational landscape and clonal dynamics in BL (Wever2018The).

Despite its identification in these contexts, detailed information on the clinical implications of ZNF296 mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes is limited. The gene's role in transcriptional regulation suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to disease pathogenesis, but further research is needed to elucidate its precise clinical significance.

## Interactions
ZNF296, also known as ZFP296 in mice, is a zinc finger protein that participates in various protein interactions, influencing chromatin remodeling and gene expression. It is a known interactor of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. ZFP296 is identified as an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific interactor of the NuRD complex, and its knockout in ESCs results in decreased NuRD binding at target genes, indicating its role in recruiting NuRD to specific genomic loci (Miyazaki2023Zfp296; Kloet2018NuRD-interacting).

ZFP296 also interacts with the SIN3A complex, another transcriptional corepressor, although the levels of SIN3A at ZFP296 sites are not significantly altered in Zfp296 knockout cells (Kloet2018NuRD-interacting). Additionally, ZFP296 interacts with histone methyltransferases G9a and GLP, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation by potentially suppressing their methyltransferase activity (Miyazaki2023Zfp296). This interaction is dependent on specific zinc finger domains of ZFP296. The protein is also involved in regulating H3K9 methylation, a key process in heterochromatin formation, by interacting with heterochromatin components such as HP1, Dnmt1, and ATRX (Matsuura2017Zfp296).
