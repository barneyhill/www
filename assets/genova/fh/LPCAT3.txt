# LPCAT3

## Overview
LPCAT3 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3) is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in phospholipid metabolism, specifically in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholine by incorporating polyunsaturated fatty acids into membrane phospholipids. The protein encoded by LPCAT3 is a multi-pass membrane enzyme belonging to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, characterized by its complex transmembrane structure and acyltransferase activity (Zhang2021The). This enzyme plays a vital role in maintaining membrane fluidity and integrity, which are essential for various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, signaling, and protein transport (Zhang2021The; HashidateYoshida2015Fatty). LPCAT3 is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it influences lipid absorption and lipoprotein production, and its activity is regulated by lipid-activated nuclear receptors (Wang2024Research). The gene's expression and function have significant implications for metabolic health, with alterations linked to conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, lipid malabsorption, and certain cancers (Wang2024Research; Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

## Structure
LPCAT3 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3) is a multi-pass membrane protein that is part of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family. The protein's structure includes 11 transmembrane helices and 6 shorter helices within the membrane-embedded region, forming a bell-shaped architecture. These helices create two wing-shaped domains that enclose a large cavity, serving as a reaction chamber for its acyltransferase activity (Zhang2021The).

The tertiary structure of LPCAT3 features a T-shaped catalytic chamber with a vertical tunnel and a side pocket. The vertical tunnel accommodates the CoA moiety with a short acyl group, while the side pocket is designed to fit polyunsaturated acyl chains, such as 20:4 acyl, in a ring-shaped structure. This configuration influences LPCAT3's substrate preferences, favoring long polyunsaturated acyl-CoA as acyl donors (Zhang2021The).

LPCAT3 forms dimers in its membrane-bound state, exhibiting a unique dimerization architecture that differs from other related enzymes like DGAT1 and SOAT1. This dimerization is non-contact, possibly mediated by intermediary lipid molecules, and is suggested to be dynamic, with LPCAT3 existing in a balance between monomeric and dimeric states (Zhang2021The).

## Function
LPCAT3 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3) is a critical enzyme in phospholipid metabolism, primarily involved in the remodeling of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by incorporating polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, into membrane phospholipids. This activity is essential for maintaining membrane fluidity and integrity, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including signaling and protein transport (Zhang2021The; HashidateYoshida2015Fatty).

In healthy human cells, LPCAT3 is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, where it plays a significant role in lipid metabolism. It facilitates the efficient secretion of triglycerides (TG) by increasing membrane flexibility, which is vital for lipoprotein production and lipid transport (Wang2024Research; Rong2015Lpcat3dependent). LPCAT3's activity is regulated by lipid-activated nuclear receptors such as LXR, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ, which modulate its expression in response to dietary and metabolic demands (Wang2024Research).

The enzyme's function extends to the regulation of lipid absorption in the intestine, where it influences the levels of phosphatidylcholine, crucial for the absorption of dietary fats. LPCAT3 deficiency can lead to impaired lipid absorption and altered chylomicron secretion, highlighting its role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Wang2024Research).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LPCAT3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. LPCAT3 is crucial in lipid metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to significant metabolic disruptions. In the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), LPCAT3 plays a protective role by mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress and reducing liver lipid accumulation. Knockdown of LPCAT3 can exacerbate liver inflammation and stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining liver health (Wang2024Research). 

In the intestine, LPCAT3 deficiency results in lipid malabsorption and mucosal hypertrophy, which can lead to increased intestinal stem cell proliferation and potential tumorigenesis (Wang2019Phospholipid). LPCAT3 is also implicated in neurological diseases, where its interaction with ABHD12 affects lipid networks in the brain. Disruption of LPCAT3 can lead to altered lipid profiles and contribute to neurological dysfunctions (Ichu2020ABHD12).

In cancer, LPCAT3 expression varies, being upregulated in some cancers like acute myeloid leukemia and downregulated in others like renal clear cell carcinoma. Its role in cancer is complex, with potential protective effects against colon cancer (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). These findings suggest that LPCAT3 is a potential therapeutic target for various metabolic and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
LPCAT3 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3) is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism. It forms homodimers, a structural feature that may facilitate substrate and product exchange within its catalytic chamber (Zhang2021The). This dimerization is characterized by non-contact interactions, potentially mediated by intermediary lipid molecules, as observed in cryo-electron microscopy studies (Zhang2021The).

LPCAT3 is also implicated in the LXR-LPCAT3 signaling pathway, where it interacts with lipid-activated nuclear receptors such as LXR, PPAR-α, and PPAR-γ. These interactions regulate its expression and activity, influencing phospholipid remodeling and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion (Wang2024Research). LPCAT3's role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane involves the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids, affecting the expression of SREBP-1c, a key regulator of lipogenesis (Wang2024Research).

In the context of lipoprotein production, LPCAT3 is essential for incorporating arachidonic acid into membrane phospholipids, which is crucial for triglyceride secretion. This process is regulated by the sterol-activated nuclear receptor LXR, highlighting LPCAT3's role in systemic lipid homeostasis (Rong2015Lpcat3dependent).
