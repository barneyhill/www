# CDC20

## Overview
CDC20 is a gene that encodes the cell division cycle 20 protein, a crucial regulatory component in the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from metaphase to anaphase. The CDC20 protein functions as an activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Wang2013Cdc20:; Wu2013CDC20). Structurally, CDC20 is characterized by a WD40 domain, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure that is essential for protein-protein interactions, including those with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components (Tian2012Structural; Cosma2022Biochemical). The regulation of CDC20 is critical for maintaining genomic stability, as it ensures that all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle before anaphase onset (Gu2020CDC20). Dysregulation of CDC20 expression is associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhao2021CDC20; MDM2P53; Sun2020&lt; p&gt).

## Structure
The CDC20 protein is characterized by several structural features that are crucial for its function in cell cycle regulation. The primary structure of CDC20 includes a C-box motif at the N-terminus and C-terminal IR residues, which are necessary for binding to the APC/C core (Kevei2011Conserved). The secondary structure of CDC20 is rich in β-sheets, forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure typical of WD40 domains (Tian2012Structural). This β-propeller structure facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly with the KEN box and D box motifs, which are important for substrate recognition and degradation (Tian2012Structural).

The tertiary structure of CDC20 includes a WD40 domain, which is highly conserved across species and forms a stable β-propeller fold (Cosma2022Biochemical). This domain is involved in binding to other proteins such as MAD2, which is crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling (Cosma2022Biochemical). The quaternary structure of CDC20 involves its role as a cofactor in the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), where it interacts with various subunits to facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of cell cycle proteins (Kevei2011Conserved).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate CDC20's activity, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Kevei2011Conserved). The protein's interaction with the APC/C and its role in cell cycle progression highlight its importance in maintaining proper cell division.

## Function
The CDC20 gene encodes a regulatory protein that plays a critical role in the cell cycle, particularly during the transition from metaphase to anaphase. CDC20 is a key activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets specific proteins for degradation, facilitating proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Wang2013Cdc20:; Wu2013CDC20). In healthy human cells, CDC20 is involved in the degradation of securin and cyclin B, which are essential for the separation of sister chromatids and progression of the cell cycle (Li2017R383C). 

CDC20's activity is regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which ensures that all chromosomes are correctly attached to the mitotic spindle before anaphase onset. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) inhibits CDC20 to prevent premature activation of the APC/C, thus maintaining genomic stability (Wu2013CDC20; Gu2020CDC20). CDC20 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus during mitosis, where it interacts with specific motifs on APC/C substrates, such as the KEN-box, A-box, or D-Box, to facilitate their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Wu2013CDC20). This precise regulation of CDC20 is crucial for orderly mitotic progression and exit from mitosis (Wang2013Cdc20:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC20 gene are associated with various cancers and are often linked to poor prognosis. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), overexpression of CDC20 is correlated with adverse clinical features and significantly worse overall survival, suggesting its role in disease progression and poor prognosis (MDM2P53; Sun2020&lt; p&gt). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high CDC20 expression is associated with shorter overall and recurrence-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Kato2012Overexpression).

In breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CDC20 is significantly upregulated and associated with aggressive disease characteristics. Its expression is linked to various clinicopathological features, including race and cancer stage, highlighting its potential as a prognostic and therapeutic target (Messeha2024Prognostic). In gliomas, high CDC20 expression is associated with genomic instability and poor prognosis, with CDC20-M-high gliomas exhibiting significant chromosomal abnormalities and a high mutation burden (Zhang2019Elevated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CDC20 is highly expressed and serves as an unfavorable prognosis marker, correlating with poor overall, disease-free, and progression-free survival (Zhao2021CDC20). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CDC20 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CDC20 is a regulatory protein that interacts with several other proteins to play a crucial role in the cell cycle, particularly in the spindle assembly checkpoint and the activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). CDC20 interacts with the Mad2 protein, forming a complex that is essential for the spindle assembly checkpoint function. This interaction is mediated by multiple Mad2-binding domains within CDC20, including an N-terminal region and a domain within the WD40 repeat region (Mondal2006A). The binding of Mad2 to CDC20 is enhanced upon mitotic checkpoint activation, forming a ternary complex with the APC (Zhang2001Identification).

CDC20 also interacts with the APC, a process that is crucial for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. The binding regions for Mad2 and APC on CDC20 overlap but are distinct, with the Mad2 binding region being a 52-amino-acid fragment and the APC binding region spanning a longer stretch (Zhang2001Identification). The interaction with APC is facilitated by the WD40 repeat region of CDC20, which is also involved in interactions with other proteins such as Bub3 and BubR1 (Tian2012Structural; Kevei2011Conserved). These interactions are critical for the regulation of APC activity and the maintenance of genomic stability during cell division.
