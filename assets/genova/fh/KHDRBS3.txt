# KHDRBS3

## Overview
KHDRBS3 is a gene that encodes the protein KH RNA binding domain containing, signal transduction associated 3, also known as T-STAR. This protein is a member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family, which is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities and involvement in post-transcriptional regulation. KHDRBS3 plays a pivotal role in RNA splicing, stability, and transport, influencing various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and response to external signals (Okuda2022RNAbinding; Ukai2021KHDRBS3). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it participates in the alternative splicing of key genes, including CD44, which is significant in both normal cellular functions and cancer biology (Ukai2021KHDRBS3). Through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, KHDRBS3 is implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it contributes to drug resistance and tumor progression (Somrit2024KHDRBS3; Zhao2023KHDRBS3).

## Function
KHDRBS3, also known as T-STAR, is a member of the STAR (Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA) family of RNA-binding proteins. It plays a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation by influencing RNA splicing, stability, and transport. In healthy human cells, KHDRBS3 is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA splice site selection, impacting various cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Ukai2021KHDRBS3).

KHDRBS3 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in RNA processing activities. It is involved in the alternative splicing of CD44, a process that is significant in the context of cancer biology but also plays roles in normal cellular functions related to cell adhesion and migration (Ukai2021KHDRBS3). The protein's involvement in signal transduction pathways suggests it may have broader roles in cellular communication and response to external signals.

The molecular activities of KHDRBS3, including its RNA-binding capabilities, are essential for maintaining the proper expression and function of various genes. This regulation is critical for normal cellular function and organismal development, as it ensures that cells can adapt to changing conditions and maintain homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KHDRBS3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KHDRBS3 is associated with drug resistance, particularly to the chemotherapy drug 5-FU. High expression levels of KHDRBS3 in CRC cells correlate with resistance to treatment, while its knockout increases sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting its role in promoting drug resistance (Ukai2021KHDRBS3). In glioblastoma, KHDRBS3 is upregulated in stem-like cells, contributing to self-renewal and resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. Silencing KHDRBS3 reduces cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to temozolomide, indicating its involvement in chemoresistance (Somrit2024KHDRBS3).

KHDRBS3 also plays a role in the regulation of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) in gliomas. Its knockdown increases BTB permeability, which could enhance drug delivery to brain tumors, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for improving treatment efficacy (Wu2019KHDRBS3). In leukemia, KHDRBS3 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the MLL-AF4 fusion protein, affecting its oncogenic potential (Okuda2022RNAbinding). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KHDRBS3 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
KHDRBS3, a member of the STAR family of RNA-binding proteins, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, KHDRBS3 interacts with SerpinB5 and FBXO32. While KHDRBS3 primarily interacts with FBXO32 at the mRNA level, it does not directly bind to the FBXO32 protein, suggesting a regulatory role in gene expression (Zhu2011SerpinB5).

In glioma endothelial cells, KHDRBS3 binds to circular RNA DENND4C (cDENND4C), stabilizing it and affecting the permeability of the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). This interaction is crucial as cDENND4C acts as a molecular sponge for miR-577, which regulates tight junction proteins essential for BTB integrity (Wu2019KHDRBS3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, KHDRBS3 interacts with YWHAZ (14-3-3ζ), enhancing the expression of c-Myc, GLUT1, and LDHA, which are involved in glycolysis and chemoresistance. This interaction promotes malignant progression and chemoresistance in cancer cells (Zhao2023KHDRBS3).

KHDRBS3 also binds to AU-rich sites within the PTRS of human AF4, influencing the post-transcriptional regulation of the MLL-AF4 fusion gene, which is implicated in leukemia (Okuda2022RNAbinding).
