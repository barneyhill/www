# DCAF12L2

## Overview
DCAF12L2 is a gene that encodes the protein DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 12 like 2, which is a component of the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, typically forming a beta-propeller structure. This structural feature is crucial for the protein's role in the ubiquitin ligase complex, where it may influence the assembly and activity of the complex through versatile substrate binding. The DCAF12L2 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein turnover and cellular homeostasis, by participating in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Its involvement in these processes suggests a potential regulatory role in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and response to DNA damage (Liu2012Identification; Skare2017A).

## Structure
DCAF12L2 encodes a protein that is a component of the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which are common motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. These repeats typically form a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for the protein's role in the complex. The beta-propeller structure is a type of tertiary structure that allows for the versatile binding of various substrates and partners, enhancing the functional diversity of the protein.

The protein's function may be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific sites and effects of these modifications are not detailed in the available information. The presence of WD40 repeats suggests a role in mediating interactions with other proteins, potentially influencing the assembly and activity of the ubiquitin ligase complex.

Information on specific domains beyond the WD40 repeats, as well as details on any splice variant isoforms, is limited. The lack of detailed structural data on primary, secondary, and quaternary structures indicates that further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular architecture of the DCAF12L2 protein.

## Clinical Significance
DCAF12L2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its mutations and altered expression levels. In non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), DCAF12L2 is identified as one of the significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer (Liu2012Identification). The gene has also been associated with orofacial clefts in a study analyzing X-linked markers, although it was not previously linked to clefting syndromes. This association was identified in both Asian and European populations, indicating a possible genetic contribution to these conditions (Skare2017A).

In the context of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), DCAF12L2 was identified as a candidate gene associated with UCEC prognosis. However, it was not among the final prognostic markers highlighted for significant expression differences in these conditions (Wu2023Screening). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which DCAF12L2 mutations or expression changes contribute to these diseases remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its role in these and potentially other conditions.

## Interactions
DCAF12L2, or DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 12 like 2, is known to interact with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is particularly associated with the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex plays a crucial role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination, which marks them for degradation by the proteasome. The interaction of DCAF12L2 with this complex suggests its involvement in regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CUL4-DDB1 complex is known for its role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and response to DNA damage. By participating in this complex, DCAF12L2 may influence these processes through its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. The specific mechanisms by which DCAF12L2 interacts with other proteins within the complex or its potential interactions with nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated. However, its association with the CUL4-DDB1 complex highlights its potential importance in cellular regulatory mechanisms.
