# CD86

## Overview
CD86 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). The CD86 protein is predominantly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it plays a pivotal role in the immune system by providing essential costimulatory signals for T cell activation and survival. Functionally, CD86 interacts with CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors on T cells, facilitating both stimulatory and inhibitory immune responses. The protein's structure is characterized by two immunoglobulin-like domains, with the N-terminal domain being crucial for receptor binding. CD86's interactions are vital for immune regulation, influencing processes such as T cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune tolerance. Alterations in CD86 expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergic disorders, and cancer, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Bajorath1997A; Qureshi2011Trans-Endocytosis; Kennedy2022Differences).

## Structure
CD86 is a type I transmembrane protein expressed on antigen-presenting cells, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Its extracellular region contains two immunoglobulin-like domains, with the N-terminal domain being crucial for receptor binding (Bajorath1997A). The molecular structure of CD86 is characterized by an Ig fold, which includes two tightly packed curved β-sheets composed of four to six β-strands connected by loops with conserved topology (Bajorath1997A). 

The sequence analysis of CD86 reveals conserved residues, such as two cysteines separated by 60-70 residues and a tryptophan approximately 15 residues after the first cysteine, which are part of the B, F, and C strands, respectively (Bajorath1997A). The alignment of CD86 with representative Ig V-like structures shows characteristic IgSF sequence patterns, particularly in the B, C, E, and F strands (Bajorath1997A). 

The tertiary structure of CD86 was modeled using the first domain of CD4 as a structural template, highlighting the importance of IgSF consensus residues as anchor points for alignment (Bajorath1997A). The G-F-C-C' β-sheet surface is involved in binding to CD28/CD152, similar to CD80 (Bajorath1997A). The study does not provide detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of CD86 (Bajorath1997A).

## Function
CD86 is a protein expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and plays a crucial role in the immune response by providing costimulatory signals necessary for T cell activation and survival. It binds to CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells, influencing T cell proliferation and differentiation. CD86, along with CD80, serves as a ligand for both CD28 and CTLA-4, but it has distinct roles and biophysical characteristics. CD86 has weaker interactions with both CD28 and CTLA-4 compared to CD80, which allows it to dissociate more readily after internalization, facilitating CTLA-4 recycling and enabling further ligand capture (Kennedy2022Differences).

The interaction between CD86 and CTLA-4 is involved in a process called trans-endocytosis, where CTLA-4 captures and removes CD86 from opposing cells, leading to the degradation of these costimulatory ligands within CTLA-4-expressing cells. This removal impairs costimulation via CD28, thereby inhibiting T cell activation and playing a regulatory role in immune responses (Qureshi2011Trans-Endocytosis). CD86 expression is also linked with activation markers such as CTLA-4 and HLA-DR, indicating its role in T cell activation, particularly in regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Trzupek2020Discovery).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD86 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of allergic disorders, a specific polymorphism in the CD86 gene, Ile179Val, has been linked to asthma and atopy. The Ile179 variant is overtransmitted to affected offspring, suggesting increased susceptibility to these conditions, while the Val179 variant may act as a protective allele (Corydon2007A). 

In cancer, CD86 expression levels have prognostic significance. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), higher CD86 expression is associated with worse overall survival and disease-specific survival, indicating its role as an unfavorable prognostic factor (Qiu2021Integrated). Similarly, in high-grade glioma (HGG), CD86 is upregulated and linked to poor overall survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Wen2023Integrated).

Alterations in CD86 interactions, particularly with CTLA-4, are implicated in immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. Mutations in CTLA-4, such as Arg70Gln, affect the transendocytosis of CD86, leading to impaired immune regulation and contributing to autoimmune conditions (Kennedy2022Differences).

## Interactions
CD86, also known as B7-2, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in immune regulation. In B lymphocytes, CD86 associates with prohibitin-1 (Phb1) and prohibitin-2 (Phb2), which are essential for the activation of signaling intermediates like PLCγ2 and NF-κB. These interactions are critical for enhancing IgG1 production and are mediated through a transmembrane-specific interaction, independent of the CD86 cytoplasmic domain (Lucas2011155.).

CD86 also interacts with CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells. The interaction with CD28 provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation. Specific residues in CD86, such as Phe31, Val39, and Tyr44, are crucial for binding to CD28, forming a complex characterized by polar interactions (Krupa2021Prediction). In contrast, CD86's interaction with CTLA-4 is inhibitory. CTLA-4 captures CD86 through trans-endocytosis, leading to the internalization and degradation of CD86, which impairs costimulation via CD28 (Qureshi2011Trans-Endocytosis; Kennedy2022Differences). This interaction is characterized by rapid dissociation, allowing CTLA-4 to recycle and continue regulating immune responses (Kennedy2022Differences).
