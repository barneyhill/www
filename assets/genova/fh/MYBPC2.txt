# MYBPC2

## Overview
MYBPC2 is a gene that encodes the protein myosin binding protein C2 (MyBP-C2), which is predominantly expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscles. MyBP-C2 is a structural protein that plays a critical role in muscle contraction by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments within the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle fibers. This protein is characterized by a modular structure comprising immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which facilitate its interactions with myosin and actin filaments, contributing to sarcomere organization and muscle function (Lin2018Skeletal; Luther2011Myosin). Unlike other myosin-binding protein C isoforms, MyBP-C2 lacks known phosphorylation sites, which may influence its functional properties (Lin2018Skeletal). The gene's expression and the protein's function are essential for maintaining muscle integrity and performance, and alterations in MYBPC2 are associated with muscle-related disorders and certain cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (Song2023Etiology; Chen2021MYBPC2).

## Structure
MYBPC2 encodes the fast skeletal muscle isoform of myosin-binding protein C, which is a crucial component of the sarcomere, the basic contractile unit of muscle fibers. The protein is characterized by a modular structure consisting of seven immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and three fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, labeled C1 to C10 (Lin2018Skeletal; Luther2011Myosin). These domains contribute to the protein's structural stability and its interactions with myosin and actin filaments, playing a role in muscle contraction and sarcomere organization (Li2019Skeletal).

The N-terminal region of MYBPC2 is involved in interactions with the thin filament, while the C-terminal domains bind to the thick filament, specifically to the light meromyosin (LMM) region and titin (Luther2011Myosin). The protein lacks known phosphorylation sites, which distinguishes it from other MyBP-C isoforms (Lin2018Skeletal). MYBPC2 is expressed predominantly in fast-twitch skeletal muscles, and its absence or dysfunction can lead to altered myofilament structure and impaired muscle function (Hessel2024Fast).

Alternative splicing of MYBPC2 results in different isoforms, which may have distinct functional roles in muscle contractility (Li2019Skeletal). The protein's structure and function are essential for maintaining the balance between the ON and OFF states of myosin heads, affecting muscle contraction performance (Hessel2023Fast).

## Function
MYBPC2 encodes the fast skeletal myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by modulating the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. This protein is primarily active in skeletal muscle cells, where it is associated with the thick filament of the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of muscle fibers. MyBP-C is involved in stabilizing the myosin super-relaxed state, which is essential for efficient muscle contractility (McNamara2018Skeletal).

The protein's N-terminal domains interact with actin filaments, sensitizing them to calcium ions and acting as an internal brake to slow thin filament velocity. This modulation is crucial for fine-tuning muscle contractility and performance, allowing for precise control of muscle function based on physiological demands (Li2019Skeletal). MYBPC2's role in muscle function is further highlighted by its involvement in maintaining sarcomere structure and function, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish where knockdown of MyBP-C led to severe skeletal myopathy (Li2016Knockdown).

MYBPC2 is also implicated in the regulation of muscle filament sliding and cell adhesion, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical performance of muscle tissues (Chen2021MYBPC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MYBPC2 gene are associated with several muscle-related disorders. MYBPC2 is specifically expressed in fast twitch muscle fibers and is crucial for maximum force generation. Mutations such as T236I and S255T have been identified in individuals with unclassified distal arthrogryposis, a condition characterized by joint contractures (Song2023Etiology). Other mutations like V307A, F510fs, and A1065V have been reported, although their effects are not fully characterized (Song2023Etiology). A global Mybpc2 knockout mouse model demonstrated that the absence of MYBPC2 leads to elevated muscle damage, reduced calcium sensitivity, and disrupted sarcomere microstructure, indicating its critical role in muscle integrity and function (Song2023Etiology).

In addition to genetic mutations, MYBPC2 is implicated in rhabdomyosarcoma, a common soft tissue tumor in children. The gene is highly expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma patients, and this high expression correlates with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival rates (Chen2021MYBPC2). MYBPC2's involvement in this cancer may be due to its role in protein binding, muscle structure, and cell adhesion (Chen2021MYBPC2). These findings suggest that MYBPC2 could be a potential therapeutic target for muscle disorders and rhabdomyosarcoma.

## Interactions
MYBPC2, or myosin binding protein C2, is involved in several interactions crucial for muscle function. It interacts with myosin and actin within the sarcomere, playing a role in stabilizing the myosin heads in a docked position, which limits crossbridge formation and regulates muscle contraction (Hessel2024Fast). MYBPC2 is also implicated in the regulation of myosin head ON/OFF states, with its domains influencing sarcomere length-dependent and independent transitions (Hessel2024Fast).

In the context of myogenesis, MYBPC2 expression is modulated by the long non-coding RNA lncFAM, which recruits the RNA-binding protein HNRNPL to the MYBPC2 promoter. This interaction enhances MYBPC2 transcription, promoting muscle cell differentiation (Chang2022Enhanced). The lncFAM-HNRNPL complex forms a ribonucleoprotein complex that transcriptionally elevates MYBPC2 expression, highlighting a regulatory mechanism in muscle formation (Chang2022Enhanced).

In rhabdomyosarcoma, MYBPC2 is identified as a significant gene marker, with its high expression levels correlating with poor prognosis. It is involved in various cellular processes, including actin binding and muscle filament sliding, which may influence tumor progression (Chen2021MYBPC2). These interactions underscore MYBPC2's role in both normal muscle physiology and disease contexts.
