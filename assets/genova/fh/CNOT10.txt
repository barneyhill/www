# CNOT10

## Overview
CNOT10 is a gene that encodes the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 10, a protein integral to the CCR4-NOT complex, which is a pivotal regulator of mRNA metabolism. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA deadenylation, a critical step in mRNA degradation and stability regulation. The CNOT10 protein, characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, forms a stable heterodimer with CNOT11, another subunit of the complex, facilitating the structural assembly and functional regulation of the CCR4-NOT complex (Levdansky2023Structure; Bawankar2013NOT10). Although CNOT10 itself does not possess enzymatic activity, it plays a crucial role in stabilizing RNA substrates, thereby enhancing the deadenylation process (Chalabi2020The). The gene's importance is underscored by its essential role in development, as evidenced by embryonic lethality in mice deficient in CNOT10 (Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Structure
The human CNOT10 protein is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA regulation. CNOT10 is predicted to be primarily α-helical in its secondary structure (Bawankar2013NOT10). It forms a direct interaction with CNOT11, another subunit of the complex, suggesting a quaternary structure where these two proteins form a complex (Bawankar2013NOT10). This interaction is facilitated by the docking of the CNOT10-CNOT11 module onto the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, a scaffold protein within the complex (Xu2014Insights; Bawankar2013NOT10).

The interaction between CNOT10 and CNOT11 is conserved across species, including humans and Drosophila melanogaster, indicating its evolutionary significance (Bawankar2013NOT10). Although specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CNOT10 are not provided, the protein's role in enhancing the binding of CNOT11 to CNOT1 is noted, potentially involving the DUF2363 domain of CNOT11 (Bawankar2013NOT10). The functional significance of the CNOT10-CNOT11 module remains unclear, but it is proposed to be an optional module or a functional homolog of the yeast Caf130 protein (Xu2014Insights).

## Function
CNOT10 is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multi-subunit assembly involved in the regulation of mRNA metabolism in human cells. It plays a crucial role in mRNA deadenylation, a process that shortens the poly(A) tail of mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA stability and degradation. Although CNOT10 does not possess enzymatic activity, it is essential for stimulating deadenylation by stabilizing the RNA substrate, which enhances the deadenylation process (Chalabi2020The).

CNOT10, along with CNOT11, forms a module that interacts with the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, a scaffold protein within the CCR4-NOT complex. This interaction is crucial for the structural assembly and functional regulation of the complex, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for its regulatory functions (Bawankar2013NOT10). The presence of CNOT10 is vital for the stabilization of the RNA substrate, which is essential for the deadenylation process, and it can compensate for the absence of other subunits like Caf40 (CNOT9) (Chalabi2020The).

In terms of organismal outcomes, CNOT10 is critical for development, as its deficiency in mice results in embryonic lethality, indicating its essential role in development (Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Interactions
CNOT10 is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a key regulator of mRNA metabolism. Within this complex, CNOT10 forms a stable heterodimer with CNOT11, facilitated by the tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats of CNOT10 wrapping around the NOT11 linker. This interaction is stabilized by conserved hydrophobic contacts and specific residues, such as L50, N66, and F38 of CNOT10, which play crucial roles in anchoring the NOT11 linker (Levdansky2023Structure). The interaction between CNOT10 and CNOT11 is essential for the assembly of the NOT10:11 module, which docks onto the N-terminal domain of CNOT1, forming a hierarchical assembly within the CCR4-NOT complex (Levdansky2023Structure; Bawankar2013NOT10).

CNOT10 does not directly interact with nucleic acids but contributes to the complex's role in mRNA degradation and translational repression. The presence of CNOT10 enhances the binding of CNOT11 to CNOT1, possibly by stabilizing the interaction or directly contacting CNOT1 (Bawankar2013NOT10). In CD4+ T cells, CNOT10, along with CNOT11, specifically associates with the large isoform of CNOT1, influencing processes such as HIV infection and the suppression of the type 1 interferon response (Gordon2020A).
