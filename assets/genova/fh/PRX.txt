# PRX

## Overview
The PRX gene encodes the periaxin protein, a critical component in the peripheral nervous system, particularly involved in the myelination process of Schwann cells. Periaxin is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the myelin sheath and facilitating interactions with other proteins such as β4 integrin and dystroglycan. The protein exists in two major isoforms, L-PRX and S-PRX, which differ in their length and cellular localization, contributing to their distinct functional roles. Beyond its peripheral nervous system functions, periaxin is also expressed in cerebral endothelial cells, where it plays a role in enhancing blood-brain barrier integrity. Mutations in the PRX gene are linked to demyelinating neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy, highlighting its clinical significance in nerve health and disease (Wang2018Expression; Han2014Periaxin; Chen2019Novel).

## Structure
The PRX (periaxin) protein is characterized by its PDZ-like domain, which is crucial for its function in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in myelination. The PDZ domain forms a unique dimeric structure through domain swapping, involving extensive interchange of α2 and β6 between two monomers. This results in a highly intertwined homodimeric configuration, distinct from other known PDZ domain structures. The PRX PDZ domain consists of five major β strands and two α helices per monomer, forming a 6-stranded antiparallel β sheet with alternating strands from different chains (Han2014Periaxin).

PRX exists in two major isoforms, L-PRX and S-PRX, which are expressed by myelinating Schwann cells. L-PRX is 1461 residues long and contains additional domains, including a highly basic domain functioning as a nuclear localization signal, a long repeat domain, and an acidic domain. S-PRX is 147 residues long and primarily located in the cytoplasm. The interaction between L-PRX and S-PRX involves the formation of a PDZ heterodimer, which suppresses the formation of L-PRX homodimers (Yang2015Lperiaxin).

The C-terminal segment of L-PRX is highly flexible and intrinsically disordered, allowing it to mediate specific protein interactions, such as binding to β4 integrin (Raasakka2019Direct).

## Function
The PRX gene encodes the periaxin protein, which plays a crucial role in the peripheral nervous system and the human cerebrovascular system. In the peripheral nervous system, periaxin is essential for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath in Schwann cells, contributing to nerve signal transmission and overall nerve health. It interacts with proteins such as β4 integrin and dystroglycan, facilitating the structural organization of myelin and maintaining its integrity (Raasakka2019Direct).

In the human cerebrovascular system, periaxin is specifically expressed in cerebral endothelial cells, where it enhances the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. The protein contains a PDZ domain, which is necessary for its barrier-strengthening properties. This domain allows periaxin to interact with other proteins, leading to increased transendothelial electrical resistance and reduced permeability, thereby maintaining BBB integrity (Wang2018Expression). Periaxin also suppresses inflammatory markers, particularly those associated with the Type I interferon response, which helps modulate inflammatory responses and maintain endothelial homeostasis (Wang2018Expression). These functions highlight periaxin's role in both peripheral nerve health and cerebrovascular protection.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRX gene, which encodes the periaxin protein, are associated with several demyelinating neuropathies, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F (CMT4F) and Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (DSN). CMT4F is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss, often accompanied by skeletal deformities such as pes cavus and scoliosis. Patients with CMT4F typically exhibit early-onset symptoms, including distal limb weakness and atrophy, with more severe effects in the lower limbs (Chen2019Novel; Guilbot2001A). 

The PRX gene mutations lead to a deficiency in L-periaxin, a protein essential for myelin sheath formation and maintenance in peripheral nerves. This deficiency results in demyelination, as evidenced by the presence of 'onion bulb' structures and hypermyelinated outfoldings in nerve biopsies (Guilbot2001A). In DSN, PRX mutations cause severe demyelinating neuropathy, with patients often presenting with compound heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations (Boerkoel2001Periaxin).

PRX mutations can also lead to late-onset CMT4F, characterized by milder clinical phenotypes and symptoms appearing in adulthood. This variability in clinical presentation underscores the complexity of PRX-related neuropathies (Tokunaga2012Lateonset).

## Interactions
Periaxin (PRX) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the peripheral nervous system. PRX forms a complex with dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) and dystroglycan, which is essential for Schwann cell function and myelin sheath stability (Han2014Periaxin). The PDZ domain of PRX is involved in dimerization, forming intertwined homodimers through domain swapping, which is important for its scaffolding role in linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (Han2014Periaxin).

PRX interacts with β4 integrin, particularly through its C-terminal segment, which is crucial for myelin maturation and maintenance. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity and involves the β4-FNIII-3 domain of β4 integrin (Raasakka2019Direct). The interaction between PRX and β4 integrin is part of a larger protein scaffold at the Schwann cell abaxonal plasma membrane, potentially linking integrins and dystroglycans (Raasakka2019Direct).

L-periaxin (L-PRX) also interacts with ezrin in Schwann cells, influencing the localization of L-PRX and playing a role in myelin sheath maintenance. This interaction occurs in a 'head to head and tail to tail' mode, involving the NLS3 region of L-PRX and the F3 subdomain of ezrin (Guo2020Ezrin).
