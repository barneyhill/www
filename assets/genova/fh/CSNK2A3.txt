# CSNK2A3

## Overview
CSNK2A3 is a gene that encodes the protein casein kinase 2 alpha 3, a catalytic subunit of the serine/threonine kinase CK2. This kinase is involved in a wide array of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, due to its ability to phosphorylate numerous substrates without requiring a cofactor for activation (Trembley2022Protein). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell proliferation and survival (Zhou2021TMEM2). CSNK2A3 is distinct from the housekeeping gene CSNK2A1, as it has a regulated promoter and is implicated in the crosstalk between the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and development (Keyghobadi2020LongTerm; Sharma2022Ovarian). The gene's expression and interactions suggest its significant role in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, such as cancer and viral infections.

## Function
CSNK2A3 encodes a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase CK2, which is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. CK2 is constitutively active and does not require a cofactor for activation, allowing it to phosphorylate numerous substrates and influence signal transduction pathways (Trembley2022Protein). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell proliferation and survival (Zhou2021TMEM2).

In healthy human cells, CSNK2A3 plays a role in regulating cell growth and proliferation. It is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins that are critical for these processes, impacting cellular functions such as morphology, transformation, and angiogenesis (Sharma2022Ovarian). The gene is expressed in human cells and has a regulated promoter, distinguishing it from the housekeeping gene CSNK2A1 (Sharma2022Ovarian).

CSNK2A3 is also implicated in the crosstalk between the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating developmental processes. This involvement suggests that CSNK2A3 may play a role in balancing these pathways, potentially influencing cell fate decisions and organismal development (Keyghobadi2020LongTerm).

## Clinical Significance
CSNK2A3, a gene encoding a subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), plays a significant role in various cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases. Alterations in CSNK2A3 expression can influence hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and cell proliferation in liver cells. Overexpression of CSNK2A3 enhances HBV infection and inhibits cell proliferation, while its knockdown has the opposite effect. TMEM2, a transmembrane protein, can antagonize the effects of CSNK2A3 on HBV infection through the JAK-STAT pathway, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies targeting this interaction (Zhou2021TMEM2).

In cancer, CSNK2A3 expression is upregulated by the ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1), which inhibits lung cancer cell migration. This regulation involves the MAPK signaling pathway and suggests that CSNK2A3, along with neutral endopeptidase (NEP), could be potential therapeutic targets for inhibiting lung cancer progression (Sharma2022Ovarian). Additionally, CSNK2A3 shows more frequent copy number-independent allelic-specific expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors compared to normal tissue, indicating its potential role in tumor diversity and evolution (MartínezRuiz2023Genomic–transcriptomic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CSNK2A3 in viral infections and cancer.

## Interactions
CSNK2A3, a catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the transmembrane protein TMEM2. This interaction was identified through co-immunoprecipitation and confirmed by Western Blot analysis, suggesting that CSNK2A3 and TMEM2 are co-localized in the membrane and cytoplasm. The interaction between these proteins is hypothesized to play a role in inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by affecting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Overexpression of TMEM2 can antagonize the effects of CSNK2A3, reducing HBV infection markers in liver cancer cells (Zhou2021TMEM2).

CSNK2A3 is also involved in the regulation of cell migration in lung cancer cells. It is upregulated by the ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1), which inhibits A549 cell migration. This process involves the MAPK signaling pathway, where CSNK2A3 is upstream of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) expression. The inhibition of CK2α activity, which includes CSNK2A3, abrogates the OGR1-induced inhibition of cell migration, highlighting its role in cancer cell behavior (Sharma2022Ovarian).
