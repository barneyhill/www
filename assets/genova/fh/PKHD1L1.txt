# PKHD1L1

## Overview
The PKHD1L1 gene encodes the PKHD1-like 1 protein, a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the cochlear hair cells of the inner ear. This protein is integral to the formation and maintenance of the stereocilia coat, a structure essential for the mechanotransduction process that converts sound waves into electrical signals, thereby playing a critical role in hearing (Wu2019PKHD1L1; Redfield2023PKHD1L1). Structurally, PKHD1-like 1 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular C-terminus, with multiple Ig-like, plexin, transcription factor (IPT) domains that suggest its function as a cell surface receptor (Wu2019PKHD1L1). Mutations in the PKHD1L1 gene are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory function (Redfield2024PKHD1L1). Additionally, PKHD1L1 expression has been implicated in various cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker due to its association with immune cell infiltration and tumor progression (Zheng2019Original; Kang2023Systematic).

## Structure
The PKHD1L1 gene encodes a large protein consisting of 4249 amino acids, characterized by a single transmembrane domain and a small intracellular C-terminus of 8 amino acids (Wu2019PKHD1L1). The protein is predominantly extracellular, featuring a signal sequence that suggests its secretion outside the cell (Wu2019PKHD1L1). PKHD1L1 contains 13 Ig-like, plexin, transcription factor (IPT) domains, which have an immunoglobulin-like fold similar to cadherins, and are typically found in cell surface receptors (Wu2019PKHD1L1). These IPT domains are crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Redfield2024PKHD1L1).

The protein also includes 12 or more parallel beta helix repeats (PbH1), which often stack to form a large helix, and two G8 domains, each consisting of 10 beta strands and an alpha helix (Wu2019PKHD1L1). These structural features suggest a complex tertiary structure that may facilitate interactions with other proteins or polysaccharides. PKHD1L1 is highly enriched in hair cells, particularly at the tips of outer hair cell stereocilia, indicating its role in forming the stereocilia coat essential for hearing (Wu2019PKHD1L1; Redfield2024PKHD1L1).

## Function
The PKHD1L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the function of hair-cell stereocilia in the cochlea, which are essential for hearing. This protein is predominantly located at the tips of outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia and is involved in forming the stereocilia coat, a structure necessary for the mechanotransduction process that converts sound waves into electrical signals (Wu2019PKHD1L1; Redfield2023PKHD1L1). The PKHD1L1 protein is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain, and it is highly enriched in both inner and outer hair cells of the cochlea (Redfield2024PKHD1L1).

In healthy cells, PKHD1L1 is hypothesized to constitute the majority of the transient stereocilia coat, which is essential for the proper organization and function of stereocilia bundles (Redfield2023PKHD1L1). The absence of PKHD1L1 in animal models leads to hearing deficits, indicating its critical role in auditory function (Wu2019PKHD1L1). The protein's involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of stereocilia is crucial for normal hearing, particularly at high frequencies (Wu2019PKHD1L1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PKHD1L1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in humans. This condition is characterized by mutations that affect the cochlear hair-cell stereociliary coat, essential for hearing function. Biallelic variants, including compound heterozygous and homozygous missense and nonsense mutations, have been identified in families with bilateral congenital SNHL, ranging from mild-moderate to severe. These mutations lead to reduced protein stability and aberrant splicing, contributing to hearing loss (Redfield2023PKHD1L1; Redfield2024PKHD1L1).

In cancer, PKHD1L1 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Its expression correlates with the presence of immune cells like CD8+ T cells and NK cells, which are crucial for anti-tumor responses. Lower PKHD1L1 expression in these cancers is associated with unfavorable survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Kang2023Systematic).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), PKHD1L1 is significantly downregulated, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Low expression levels are associated with increased risk of lymph node metastasis and larger tumor size, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Zheng2019Original).

## Interactions
The PKHD1L1 protein is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of the stereocilia surface coat in cochlear hair cells, which is essential for normal hearing. While specific protein interactions of PKHD1L1 are not fully elucidated, its domain structure suggests potential interactions with other proteins. PKHD1L1 is hypothesized to interact with proteins such as STRC, NPTN, CEACAM16, and TECTA, which are involved in the structural integrity and function of the stereocilia (Wu2019PKHD1L1). The protein is predominantly localized at the tips of outer hair cell stereocilia, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the stereociliary coat (Wu2019PKHD1L1).

PKHD1L1 is also suggested to be involved in the development of attachment crowns at the stereocilia, although it is not required for the localization of STRC, a protein involved in attachment crown formation (Strelkova2024PKHD1L1). The potential proteolytic cleavage of PKHD1L1 may affect its interactions, as cleavage could hinder antibody labeling and detection of the remaining membrane-tethered portion of the protein (Strelkova2024PKHD1L1). Further research is needed to identify specific binding partners and elucidate the molecular interactions of PKHD1L1 in the context of hearing and deafness.
