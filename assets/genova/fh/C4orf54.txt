# C4orf54

## Overview
C4orf54 is a gene located on chromosome 4 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 4 open reading frame 54. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, studies have suggested potential involvement in various cellular pathways, although further research is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms and interactions. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of their potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
