# SARAF

## Overview
SARAF, or store-operated calcium entry associated regulatory factor, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis within human cells. The SARAF protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and plays a pivotal role in modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a critical pathway for calcium influx triggered by the depletion of intracellular calcium stores. By interacting with key proteins such as STIM1 and Orai1, SARAF facilitates the slow calcium-dependent inactivation of Orai1 channels, thereby preventing excessive cytosolic calcium levels that could lead to cytotoxicity. The protein's structure, featuring a unique 'SARAF fold,' suggests potential roles in redox sensing and calcium signaling modulation. SARAF's regulatory functions are crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis, with implications in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac and pancreatic diseases (Dagan2021Regulation; Albarran2016Dynamic; Palty2012SARAF).

## Structure
The SARAF protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, consisting of 339 amino acids. It features a cleavable signal peptide and a single transmembrane domain, which divides the protein into a cytoplasmic-facing domain and an ER-luminal-facing domain (Palty2012SARAF). The cytosolic segment is crucial for its activity, interacting with STIM1, a key protein in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), to modulate calcium signaling (Palty2012SARAF). The luminal domain forms dimers through a domain swap arrangement, with each monomer containing a 10-stranded β-sandwich fold stabilized by three disulfide bonds, known as the 'SARAF fold' (Dagan2021Regulation). This structure suggests a potential role as a redox sensor, as changes in ER calcium levels could affect the oligomeric state of SARAF through reversible disulfide bond formation (Dagan2021Regulation).

SARAF also has a splice isoform, SARAF-S, which lacks the second exon, resulting in a shorter open reading frame. This isoform shows similar cellular distribution and translocates to ER-plasma membrane regions after SOCE activation (Palty2012SARAF). The protein's C-terminal domain is rich in serine, proline, and arginine residues, which may facilitate interactions with plasma membrane phospholipids (Palty2012SARAF).

## Function
SARAF (store-operated calcium entry associated regulatory factor) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating calcium homeostasis in human cells. It primarily functions by modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a critical pathway for calcium influx initiated by the depletion of intracellular calcium stores, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Albarran2016Dynamic; Palty2012SARAF).

SARAF interacts with STIM1, a calcium sensor in the ER, and Orai1, a calcium channel in the plasma membrane, to facilitate the slow calcium-dependent inactivation (SCDI) of Orai1 channels. This interaction is essential for preventing prolonged elevation of cytosolic calcium, which can lead to cytotoxicity and cell death (Dagan2021Regulation; Albarran2016Dynamic). SARAF's regulatory role involves dynamic interactions with STIM1 and Orai1, modulating calcium entry and preventing calcium overload (Albarran2016Dynamic).

In the resting state, SARAF associates with STIM1 to keep it inactive. Upon calcium store depletion, SARAF dissociates from STIM1, allowing STIM1 activation and SOCE initiation. SARAF then re-associates with STIM1 to mediate SCDI, thus maintaining calcium homeostasis (Albarran2016Dynamic; Palty2012SARAF). SARAF is primarily localized in the ER membrane, with its activity crucial for maintaining proper intracellular calcium levels in both resting and stimulated cells (Palty2012SARAF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SARAF gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cardiac and pancreatic conditions. In cardiac pathology, elevated SARAF expression is observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), suggesting a potential role in cardiac hypertrophy. However, studies show conflicting results regarding whether SARAF overexpression is protective or contributes to pathological growth, possibly due to different experimental models and cell-type specific functions (Dagan2021Regulation; Sanlialp2020Sarafdependent). SARAF's involvement in cardiac hypertrophy is linked to its interaction with STIM1 and its role in calcium and mTORC1 signaling (Sanlialp2020Sarafdependent).

In the pancreas, SARAF plays a protective role in acute pancreatitis. Reduced SARAF expression is noted in pancreatitis patients, and its deletion leads to increased pancreatic enzyme activity and exacerbated acute pancreatitis. Conversely, SARAF overexpression offers protection by reducing pathological calcium influx and inflammation (Son2019Ca2+). The degradation of SARAF during pancreatitis suggests that its protective role is compromised, leading to increased pancreatic damage (Son2019Ca2+). These findings highlight SARAF's clinical significance in both cardiac and pancreatic diseases.

## Interactions
SARAF interacts with several key proteins involved in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). It primarily associates with STIM1, a calcium sensor located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Orai1, a calcium channel in the plasma membrane. SARAF modulates the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 by transiently dissociating from STIM1 during the initial activation of SOCE to associate with Orai1, facilitating calcium entry. Subsequently, SARAF reinteracts with STIM1 to mediate slow calcium-dependent inactivation (SCDI) of Orai1 channels (Albarran2016Dynamic).

SARAF's interaction with STIM1 is influenced by the C-terminal inhibitory domain (CTID) of STIM1, which regulates SARAF's access to the SOAR domain within STIM1. This interaction partially inhibits Orai1 currents, with the inhibition being dependent on calcium levels (Dagan2021Regulation). SARAF also interacts with STIM2, suggesting a role in modulating STIM2-dependent basal SOCE activity (Palty2012SARAF).

In breast cancer cells, SARAF interacts with Orai3 and STIM1, playing a crucial role in modulating SOCE, which is essential for cell proliferation, migration, and viability (Jardin2021SARAF). SARAF's interaction with Orai1 and STIM1 is also significant in endothelial cell activation and angiogenesis (GaleanoOtero2021SARAF).
