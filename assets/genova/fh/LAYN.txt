# LAYN

## Overview
LAYN is a gene that encodes the protein layilin, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell adhesion and motility. Layilin interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, such as hyaluronan, and plays a crucial role in cellular dynamics by binding to cytoskeletal elements like talin. This interaction is essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and facilitating processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial cells (Rovillain2011An; Pan2019LAYN). Layilin's involvement in immune cell interactions, particularly with integrins, underscores its significance in immune response regulation and its potential impact on cancer progression and metastasis (Mahuron2020Layilin). The expression of LAYN is associated with various cancers, where it serves as a marker for immune cell infiltration and is linked to poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Pan2019LAYN; Zheng2017Landscape).

## Function
LAYN, or layilin, is a transmembrane protein that functions as a receptor for hyaluronan, a component of the extracellular matrix. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion and motility by interacting with cytoskeletal elements, thereby influencing cellular dynamics and signaling pathways (Pan2019LAYN). Layilin is widely expressed in various cell types and organs, where it contributes to the regulation of cell spreading and migration. It is involved in processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal tubular epithelial cells and the maintenance of intestinal epithelial tight junctions in inflammatory bowel disease (Pan2019LAYN).

In the cellular context, layilin is located in the cell membrane and is known to bind to talin, a protein that helps maintain the cytoskeleton-membrane linkage. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the cell membrane (Rovillain2011An). Although the specific functions of LAYN in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its role in cellular adhesion and motility suggests it is important for normal tissue remodeling and immune response regulation (Pan2019LAYN).

## Clinical Significance
LAYN (layilin) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and immune evasion. In gastric and colon cancers, high LAYN expression correlates with increased infiltration of immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, B cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, suggesting a role in immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. This expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, potentially through the regulation of macrophage polarization and T cell exhaustion (Pan2019LAYN).

In liver cancer, LAYN is identified as a marker for exhausted CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), contributing to poor prognosis by reducing the production of IFN-g, a cytokine essential for tumor-killing activity (Zheng2017Landscape). Similarly, in ovarian cancer, high LAYN expression is associated with T cell exclusion and dysfunction, leading to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and poor patient outcomes (Li2022LAYN).

LAYN's expression is also linked to reduced survival rates in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers, where it is part of a tumor-Treg signature that increases with tumor staging (De2016Transcriptional). These findings highlight LAYN's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
Layilin, encoded by the LAYN gene, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cell adhesion and migration. It interacts with integrins, particularly LFA-1 (integrin αLβ2), enhancing the adhesion and cytotoxic capabilities of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Mahuron2020Layilin). This interaction is facilitated by layilin's binding to talin, an adapter protein that links integrins to the cytoskeleton, promoting stable cell-cell contacts (Mahuron2020Layilin). The talin-binding domain of layilin is crucial for this process, as its loss reduces LFA-1 activation, indicating layilin's role in talin-mediated signaling events (Mahuron2020Layilin).

Layilin also binds to hyaluronan (HYA) through its extracellular domains and to cytoskeleton-membrane linker proteins through its cytoplasmic domains, which are important for mediating cell adhesion and migration (Chen2008Down‐regulation). These interactions suggest that layilin plays a significant role in the regulation of cell motility and adhesion, contributing to its function in antitumor immunity and potentially influencing cancer progression and metastasis.
