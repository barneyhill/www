# DCUN1D1

## Overview
DCUN1D1, or defective in cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ligase within the neddylation pathway. This protein is integral to the post-translational modification process that involves the attachment of NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, to cullin proteins, thereby enhancing the activity of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Vava2023DCUN1D1). As a result, DCUN1D1 plays a critical role in regulating protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (Vava2023DCUN1D1). Dysregulation of DCUN1D1 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in oncogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Chatziandreou2021Evidence; Ocharoenrat2008SCCRO).

## Function
The DCUN1D1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ligase in the neddylation pathway, a post-translational modification process similar to ubiquitination. This process involves the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to cullin proteins, which are scaffolding components of Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) (Vava2023DCUN1D1). Neddylation enhances the activity of CRLs, which are crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, thereby regulating protein stability and function (Vava2023DCUN1D1).

DCUN1D1 is involved in the nuclear translocation of cullin-ROC1 complexes, facilitating the recruitment of E2~Nedd8 thioester to the complex and optimizing the orientation of proteins for efficient NEDD8 transfer (Huang2019Mouse). This activity is essential for maintaining cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and apoptosis, and is vital for cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (Vava2023DCUN1D1).

In healthy human cells, DCUN1D1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular functions and contributing to organismal development (Vava2023DCUN1D1). Its proper regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenesis (Vava2023DCUN1D1).

## Clinical Significance
DCUN1D1, also known as SCCRO, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor growth and progression. In squamous cell carcinomas, particularly of the head, neck, and lung, DCUN1D1 overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This is primarily due to its ability to activate matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which facilitates cancer cell invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix (Ocharoenrat2008SCCRO). DCUN1D1 does not directly bind to the MMP2 promoter but influences its transcription through the upregulation of activator protein-2 (AP2) and p53, leading to increased MMP2 levels and activity (Ocharoenrat2008SCCRO).

In squamous cell lung cancer, DCUN1D1 gene amplification is observed in a significant proportion of cases and is correlated with poorly differentiated tumors, suggesting a role in tumor aggressiveness. This amplification is often concurrent with other genes like FGFR1 and BCL9, indicating a potential cooperative effect in cancer pathogenesis (Chatziandreou2021Evidence).

In glioma, DCUN1D1 is targeted by microRNA-3148, which inhibits glioma growth by decreasing DCUN1D1 expression and blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway. This suggests that DCUN1D1 contributes to glioma progression and that its downregulation could be a therapeutic strategy (Xu2021MicroRNA‑3148).

## Interactions
DCUN1D1, also known as defective in cullin neddylation 1 domain containing 1, is an E3 ligase involved in the neddylation pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. DCUN1D1 interacts with several proteins, particularly within the context of prostate cancer. It has been shown to bind with cullin proteins such as CUL1, CUL3, and CUL4B, which are part of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes. These interactions facilitate the neddylation of cullins, a process that modifies and activates CRLs, thereby impacting protein turnover and cellular homeostasis (Vava2023DCUN1D1).

DCUN1D1 also interacts with RBX1, a core component of CRLs, and CAND1, a regulator of neddylation and assembly of cullin/RBX complexes. These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the neddylation pathway (Vava2023DCUN1D1). Additionally, DCUN1D1 has been identified to interact with ribosomal proteins such as RPS19, RPS6, RPS16, and RPL27, suggesting a novel role in ribosomal protein modification (Vava2023DCUN1D1). The protein also associates with the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1, linking it further to the neddylation pathway (Vava2023DCUN1D1). These interactions highlight DCUN1D1's role in regulating the WNT/β-catenin pathway, which is significant in cancer proliferation and tumor growth (Vava2023DCUN1D1).
