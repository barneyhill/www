# GLDC

## Overview
The GLDC gene encodes the enzyme glycine decarboxylase, a pivotal component of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) involved in mitochondrial glycine metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as a PLP-dependent enzyme, plays a crucial role in the breakdown of glycine, facilitating the transfer of one-carbon units to tetrahydrofolate, which is essential for cellular proliferation and growth (Leung2020Regulation; Pai2015Glycine). The glycine decarboxylase enzyme is integral to maintaining metabolic balance and neurological health, as its dysfunction can lead to disorders such as non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) (Leung2020Regulation). Beyond its metabolic functions, GLDC is involved in the regulation of pluripotency in stem cells, influencing histone methylation and the transcription of pluripotency genes (Tian2019Glycine). Mutations in the GLDC gene are linked to NKH, characterized by an accumulation of glycine and associated neurological symptoms (Coughlin2017The; Kanno2006Genomic). Additionally, alterations in GLDC expression have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and neurological contexts (Kambali2023A).

## Structure
The GLDC (glycine decarboxylase) protein is a crucial component of the glycine cleavage system, involved in glycine metabolism. It is a large enzyme that can form a homodimer, which is essential for its function (BravoAlonso2017Nonketotic). The protein belongs to the PLP-enzyme Fold Type I family and typically forms α2 homodimers, although it can also exist as an αβ heterodimer in some bacteria and archaea (Farris2020Large). The GLDC protein contains distinct N-terminal and C-terminal regions, with the C-terminal region housing the active site, Lys754, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Farris2020Large).

The N-terminal region, despite lacking an active site lysine, is predicted to non-covalently bind pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), which is necessary for proper protein folding (Farris2020Large). The interaction between GLDC and the H-protein is vital for its function, with a lipoyllysine group on the H-protein interacting with GLDC's active site (Farris2020Large). Mutations in the GLDC gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to structural instability and functional impairment, which are associated with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (BravoAlonso2017Nonketotic). The protein's structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures (BravoAlonso2017Nonketotic).

## Function
Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is a key enzyme in the glycine cleavage system (GCS), which is responsible for the breakdown of glycine in mitochondria. This process is crucial for transferring a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate (THF), generating 5,10-methylene THF, which is part of the mitochondrial folate one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) (Pai2015Glycine). The GCS, through GLDC, helps maintain normal levels of glycine and ensures proper folate metabolism, which is essential for cellular proliferation and growth (Leung2020Regulation). In healthy human cells, GLDC's function is vital for maintaining metabolic balance and supporting neurological health by preventing the accumulation of excess glycine, which can lead to disorders such as non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) (Leung2020Regulation).

GLDC is also involved in the regulation of pluripotency in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by influencing metabolic pathways. It plays a role in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells through the regulation of histone methylation, specifically H3K4me3, which is important for the transcription of pluripotency genes (Tian2019Glycine). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Tian2019Glycine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLDC gene are a primary cause of non-ketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an accumulation of glycine in body fluids, leading to neurological symptoms such as seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability (Coughlin2017The; Kanno2006Genomic). The majority of NKH cases are due to biallelic mutations in GLDC, with missense mutations being the most common type (Coughlin2017The). These mutations can lead to severe or attenuated forms of the disease, with the severe form often resulting in profound developmental delay and intractable seizures (BravoAlonso2017Nonketotic).

In addition to point mutations, large deletions within the GLDC gene have been identified as significant contributors to NKH, with a notable percentage of mutant alleles in affected individuals exhibiting such deletions (Kanno2006Genomic). These deletions are not typically detected by standard exon-sequencing methods, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic testing (Kanno2006Genomic).

Alterations in GLDC expression levels have also been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased GLDC expression, due to gene triplication, has been associated with psychosis and schizophrenia-like symptoms, including cognitive deficits and changes in synaptic function (Kambali2023A).

## Interactions
Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is a key enzyme in the glycine cleavage system, interacting with several proteins to facilitate glycine metabolism. GLDC forms a complex with the H-protein, which is crucial for its function in transferring the amino-methyl moiety produced during glycine decarboxylation (Farris2020Large). This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of the glycine cleavage system, as the H-protein plays a pivotal role in the transfer of reaction intermediates (Leung2021Glycine).

GLDC is also subject to post-translational modifications that regulate its activity and stability. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NF-X1, which mediates K33-linked polyubiquitination of GLDC, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is enhanced by acetylation at lysine 514, which is regulated by mTORC1 signaling (Liu2021mTORC1). The deacetylase SIRT3 interacts with GLDC to maintain its enzymatic activity by deacetylating it at K514, counteracting the effects of acetylation (Liu2021mTORC1).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing GLDC's role in glycine metabolism and its implications in tumorigenesis, as alterations in these interactions can significantly impact cellular processes and disease progression (Liu2021mTORC1).
