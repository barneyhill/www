# CFAP92

## Overview
CFAP92, or cilia and flagella associated protein 92, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. The protein, categorized as a putative ciliary protein, plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of these organelles, which are essential for cellular motility and signaling. CFAP92 is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to metabolic pathways and oxidative stress responses. Its expression levels have been associated with several pathological conditions, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and colorectal cancer, where it may influence disease progression and treatment efficacy (Singh2023Transcriptional; Amniouel2024Highaccuracy). Understanding the function and regulation of CFAP92 could provide insights into its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Clinical Significance
CFAP92 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), CFAP92 is significantly upregulated, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. This upregulation is associated with metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress, which are key features of PAH. The gene's expression is linked to deficiencies in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and the electron transport chain, indicating a potential role in the metabolic abnormalities observed in PAH patients (Singh2023Transcriptional).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), CFAP92 has been identified as a gene relevant to predicting chemotherapy efficacy. It was found to be downregulated in non-responders to FOLFOX chemotherapy, highlighting its potential role in drug response. This suggests that alterations in CFAP92 expression may influence the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatments in CRC patients (Amniouel2024Highaccuracy).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of CFAP92 in both pulmonary and oncological conditions, where its altered expression levels may contribute to disease progression and treatment outcomes. Understanding these associations could lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for conditions linked to CFAP92 dysregulation.
