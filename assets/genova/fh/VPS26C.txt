# VPS26C

## Overview
VPS26C is a gene that encodes the VPS26 endosomal protein sorting factor C, a critical component of the Retriever complex involved in endosomal protein sorting and trafficking. This protein plays a pivotal role in the recycling of integral membrane proteins, preventing their degradation in lysosomes and ensuring their return to the cell membrane. The VPS26C protein is categorized as a sorting factor and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and signaling. It interacts specifically with VPS35L and VPS29 within the Retriever complex, operating independently of the retromer complex, to facilitate the recycling of transmembrane cargos (Healy2023Structure; Beetz2019VPS26C). The gene's significance extends to clinical implications, as mutations in VPS26C have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital malformation syndromes, underscoring its importance in human health and development (Otsuji2022Clinical; Kato2024The).

## Function
The VPS26C gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the Retriever complex, which is involved in the recycling of integral membrane proteins from lysosomal degradation back to the cell membrane. This process is essential for maintaining the levels of various integral membrane proteins that are involved in cell migration, adhesion, signaling, and solute and nutrient transport (Beetz2019VPS26C). The Retriever complex, which includes VPS26C, VPS35L, and VPS29, operates independently of the retromer complex and is vital for endosomal protein sorting and trafficking (Healy2023Structure).

VPS26C interacts with VPS35L via its C-terminal b-sandwich subdomain, a critical interaction for the assembly of the Retriever complex. This interaction is essential for the trafficking of transmembrane cargos, highlighting the importance of VPS26C in endosomal recycling (Healy2023Structure). The Retriever complex, along with accessory proteins, regulates the sorting and recycling of numerous cell surface proteins, including integrins and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins, which are crucial for cellular functions such as signaling and cell adhesion (Otsuji2022Clinical). VPS26C is active in endosomal compartments within the cell, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and receptor signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS26C gene have been implicated in a novel syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental deficits, growth failure, skeletal abnormalities, and distinctive facial features. A study identified a homozygous nonsense variant c.178G>T (p.Glu60*) in VPS26C in two cousins with these symptoms, suggesting that VPS26C is associated with this previously unrecognized syndrome. The variant was shown to co-segregate with the phenotype in the affected individuals, and expression studies indicated reduced levels of the mutant transcript (Beetz2019VPS26C).

VPS26C has also been identified as a novel causative gene for Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (RSS), a congenital malformation syndrome. This condition is linked to dysfunctions in the SNX17-Retriever/CCC/WASH endosomal recycling pathway, which affects the presentation of cell surface integral membrane proteins. Mutations in VPS26C and other genes in this pathway lead to mis-sorting of these proteins, contributing to the clinical phenotypes of RSS, including skeletal malformations and neurological impairments (Kato2024The).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of VPS26C in human development and disease, emphasizing its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting.

## Interactions
VPS26C is a component of the retromer complex, which is crucial for endosomal protein sorting. In Arabidopsis thaliana, VPS26C forms a complex with VPS35A and VPS29, which is essential for root hair growth and endosomal trafficking pathways (Jha2018Vacuolar). This complex is involved in the recycling of membrane proteins and regulating polarized growth (Jha2018Vacuolar). VPS26C interacts specifically with VPS35A, but not with VPS35B or VPS35C, indicating specificity in its interactions (Jha2018Vacuolar).

In humans, VPS26C is part of the Retriever complex, a heterotrimer composed of VPS26C, VPS35L, and VPS29. This complex is involved in endosomal recycling processes and shares structural similarities with the retromer complex (Healy2023Structure). VPS26C interacts with VPS35L at specific sites, and this interaction is crucial for the stability of the Retriever complex (Healy2023Structure). The interaction between VPS26C and VPS35L is essential for the endosomal association and function of the Commander complex, which includes the Retriever and CCC complexes (Healy2023Structure). The absence of VPS35L leads to reduced VPS26C protein levels, highlighting their interdependence for stability (Healy2023Structure).
