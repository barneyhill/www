# STK36

## Overview
The STK36 gene encodes the serine/threonine kinase 36, a protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a kinase due to its enzymatic activity, which involves the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target proteins. The STK36 protein is integral to the regulation of GLI transcription factors, although its kinase domain is not essential for the activation of GLI2, indicating a multifaceted regulatory mechanism (Østerlund2004The). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Østerlund2004The). STK36 is involved in critical protein interactions, such as with Gli1 and Gli2, which are essential for the activation of the Hedgehog pathway and have implications in conditions like castration-resistant prostate cancer (He2024Serinethreonine). Additionally, mutations in STK36 have been linked to genetic disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and sporadic renal angiomyolipoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Anoshkin2019Germline; Unknownauthors2018Abstractsfromthe3rdBEATPCDConferenceand4thPCDTrainingSchool).

## Structure
The STK36 gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein structure includes a kinase domain encoded by exons 3 to 9, which is highly homologous to the Drosophila fu gene, indicating a conserved function across species (Østerlund2004The). The kinase domain is located at the N-terminal and consists of approximately 260 residues, showing 97% identity with the human FU protein (Maloveryan2007A). The C-terminal region, encoded by exons 10-28, is suggested to have regulatory functions and shows 80% identity to the human FU protein (Maloveryan2007A).

STK36 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. The long form (L-FU) consists of 1315 residues, while a shorter isoform (S-FU) of 474 residues arises from the inclusion of exon 13 (Østerlund2004The). Another variant, L-FU∆24, lacks part of exon 24, making it 21 residues shorter than L-FU (Østerlund2004The). These isoforms contribute to the functional diversity of the protein.

The STK36 protein is involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, where it regulates GLI transcription factors. However, the kinase domain is not required for the activation of GLI2, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Østerlund2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STK36 gene have been implicated in several genetic disorders and conditions. In primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic condition characterized by impaired ciliary function, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in STK36 have been identified. These mutations affect cilia orientation in human respiratory epithelial cells, which can lead to chronic respiratory infections and progressive lung failure (Unknownauthors2018Abstractsfromthe3rdBEATPCDConferenceand4thPCDTrainingSchool).

STK36 mutations have also been associated with sporadic renal angiomyolipoma (sAML), a benign kidney tumor. The gene is involved in the regulation of proliferation and angiogenesis through the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and mutations in STK36 have been identified in sAML samples, suggesting a role in tumor formation (Anoshkin2019Germline).

In the context of Temple-Baraitser syndrome (TMBTS) and Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS), STK36 mutations have been identified as genetic modifiers that may influence the disease phenotype. Although the primary mutations in these syndromes are in the KCNH1 gene, STK36 mutations are considered possibly damaging and may contribute to the phenotypic continuum between TMBTS and ZLS (Mégarbané2016TempleBaraitser).

## Interactions
Serine/threonine kinase 36 (STK36) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. STK36 interacts with glioma-associated oncogene proteins (Gli1 and Gli2) to activate the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (He2024Serinethreonine). This interaction is part of a broader mechanism where STK36 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to drug resistance in prostate cancer (He2024Serinethreonine).

STK36 also forms complexes with Ulk4 and Gli2-Sufu, as demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Although Ulk4 is not necessary for the activation of STK36 kinase activity, it acts as a scaffold that facilitates the formation of a protein complex between STK36 and Gli2, which is crucial for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Zhou2023Ulk4). This interaction highlights the role of STK36 in regulating ciliary localization and Gli2 phosphorylation, essential steps in the activation of the Hedgehog pathway (Zhou2023Ulk4).

Additionally, STK36 is part of the TNKS1 meta-interactome, which includes numerous protein-protein interactions supported by various enzymes and substrates, indicating its involvement in complex signaling networks (Mezghrani2024Detection).
