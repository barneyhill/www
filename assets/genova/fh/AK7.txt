# AK7

## Overview
Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the enzyme adenylate kinase 7, a member of the adenylate kinase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible conversion of ADP to ATP and AMP, a process crucial for maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides within cells (Lorès2018Homozygous). AK7 is predominantly expressed in ciliated tissues, such as the bronchial epithelium, where it is essential for ciliary motility and function (Milara2010Role). The protein is also involved in sperm flagella function, contributing to sperm motility and fertility (Lorès2018Homozygous). Structurally, the AK7 protein comprises several domains, including a WcaG motif, an ADK domain, and a DPY30 domain, which are integral to its function and interactions with other proteins (Lorès2018Homozygous). Mutations in the AK7 gene have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, and its expression levels have implications in cancer prognosis, particularly in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Mata2012New; Jin2024AK7deficiency).

## Structure
The human adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 14 and consists of 18 exons. The protein is composed of 723 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 74 kDa (Lorès2018Homozygous; Panayiotou2011The). The AK7 protein includes three principal domains: a WcaG motif near the N-terminus, a consensus ADK domain, and a DPY30 domain at the C-terminus (Lorès2018Homozygous). The ADK domain features a central CORE region with a p-loop domain, an NMP domain, and a LID domain, which are typical of adenylate kinases (Lorès2018Homozygous).

The C-terminal region of AK7, spanning amino acids 613-723, includes a linker region predicted to have a coiled-coil structure, which is important for the protein's oligomerization properties (Lorès2018Homozygous). The DPY30 domain is involved in protein oligomerization and docking, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of axonemal complexes in sperm (Lorès2018Homozygous). A specific mutation, c.2018T>G (p.Leu673Pro), affects this region, disrupting the coiled-coil structure and impacting protein-protein interactions (Lorès2018Homozygous). The AK7 protein is detected in human spermatozoa, localizing to the sperm flagellum, and is consistent with an axonemal component (Lorès2018Homozygous).

## Function
Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular energy homeostasis by catalyzing the reversible transphosphorylation of two molecules of ADP into one molecule each of ATP and AMP (Lorès2018Homozygous). This reaction is essential for maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides within cells, particularly in tissues with high energy demands, such as those containing motile cilia and flagella (Lorès2018Homozygous; Panayiotou2011The).

AK7 is predominantly expressed in ciliated tissues, including the bronchial epithelium, where it is involved in ciliary motility and function (Milara2010Role; Dzeja2009Adenylate). It is localized on the apical surface of differentiated nasal epithelial cells, indicating its role in maintaining normal ciliary beat frequency and motility (Milara2010Role). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of cilia, which are essential for processes such as mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract (Milara2010Role).

In addition to its role in cilia, AK7 is also involved in the function of sperm flagella, contributing to sperm motility and fertility (Lorès2018Homozygous). Its activity in these structures underscores its importance in cellular processes that require efficient energy transfer and utilization.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AK7 gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a congenital disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. Studies have identified specific mutations in the AK7 gene, such as c.1214insT, which introduce a stop codon leading to a truncated protein. This mutation is associated with reduced ciliary movement frequency, suggesting a direct impact on ciliary function (Mata2012New). AK7 expression is significantly down-regulated in PCD patients, correlating with decreased ciliary beat frequency and contributing to the disease's characteristic respiratory issues (Milara2010Role). 

In addition to its role in PCD, AK7 expression has been studied in the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Low AK7 expression in ccRCC tissues is associated with poor prognosis and reduced effectiveness of immunotherapy, such as anti-PD1 therapy. Increasing AK7 expression has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of these treatments, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in ccRCC (Jin2024AK7deficiency). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AK7 in both genetic disorders and cancer, underscoring its role in disease progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
Adenylate kinase 7 (AK7) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in sperm flagella. AK7 is suggested to participate in homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization, similar to the dimeric RSP2 protein, and interacts with structural proteins of the sperm fibrous sheath, such as AKAP3 and AKAP4. The presence of a homozygous missense mutation (p.Leu673Pro) in AK7 leads to an abnormal distribution of AKAP4 in sperm, indicating a disrupted interaction between AK7 and AKAP4 (Lorès2018Homozygous).

AK7 is also associated with axonemal components like dynein arms, which are essential for flagellar motility. In Tetrahymena, a molecular complex involving AK7, FAP251, and DNAH1 (an inner dynein arm heavy chain) has been identified, suggesting AK7's role in axonemal multiprotein complexes (Lorès2018Homozygous). The DPY30 domain of AK7, which shares homology with the RIIa domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), is crucial for targeting AK activity close to axonemal components, facilitating interactions necessary for flagellar beating (Lorès2018Homozygous). These interactions highlight AK7's specific functional properties in sperm cells, distinct from its role in other ciliated cells.
