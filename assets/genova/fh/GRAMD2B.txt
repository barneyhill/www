# GRAMD2B

## Overview
GRAMD2B is a gene that encodes the protein GRAM domain containing 2B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The GRAM domain is a protein module that is often associated with membrane-associated proteins, suggesting that GRAMD2B may play a role in membrane dynamics or signaling pathways. The protein encoded by GRAMD2B is implicated in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant for its potential regulatory functions in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise biological roles and interactions of GRAM domain containing 2B is crucial for elucidating its contribution to cellular physiology and its potential implications in disease states.
