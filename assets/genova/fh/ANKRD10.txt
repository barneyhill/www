# ANKRD10

## Overview
ANKRD10 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 10 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for their role in mediating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including signaling and structural organization. The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, lung, and eye, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene regulation. ANKRD10's ability to interact with other proteins highlights its potential influence on broader physiological processes and organismal health. The gene has been studied in the context of various diseases, including cruciate disease in dogs and VCP disease in humans, and is associated with certain genetic conditions and prognostic factors in cancer (Nalbandian2014Global; Allebrandt2011A; Tang2022A; Clements2009A).

## Structure
ANKRD10 (ankyrin repeat domain 10) is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs, which are common protein-protein interaction domains. These motifs typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure. The arrangement of these repeats often results in a solenoid shape, influencing the protein's tertiary structure. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, affecting the protein's function and interactions (AlSalam2017Evolution; Tan2021Integrative; Clements2009A).

The ANKRD10 gene is known to produce several proteins, primarily expressed in the brain, lung, and eye, although specific details about the molecular structure of these proteins are not provided in the available literature (Allebrandt2011A). Splice variant isoforms of ANKRD10 can lead to structural diversity, impacting the protein's role in cellular processes (Tan2021Integrative; Clements2009A). Despite these insights, detailed information on the quaternary structure of ANKRD10 is not available in the current context.

## Function
ANKRD10 (ankyrin repeat domain 10) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its involvement in protein-protein interactions. The ankyrin repeat domain within ANKRD10 is crucial for facilitating these interactions, which are essential for cellular signaling and maintaining structural integrity. This domain is known for its ability to mediate interactions with other proteins, thereby influencing cellular communication and function.

In healthy human cells, ANKRD10 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Its presence in these cellular compartments suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Within the cytoplasm, ANKRD10 may contribute to the structural organization of the cell, while in the nucleus, it could be involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein's activity in these areas underscores its importance in ensuring the proper functioning of cellular processes.

The molecular activities of ANKRD10, particularly its role in protein-protein interactions, highlight its potential involvement in broader organismal outcomes. By participating in cellular signaling pathways, ANKRD10 may influence various physiological processes, contributing to the overall health and stability of the organism.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD10 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In Golden Retrievers, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ANKRD10 gene, such as ANK_I2 and rs23039786, have been associated with cruciate disease (CCLR), although the statistical significance of these associations was not maintained after multiple permutation tests (Clements2009A). In humans, ANKRD10 has been identified as one of the common genes in both mouse and human studies related to VCP disease, a condition with similarities to human IBMPFD, although no consistent pattern of dysregulation was found across these studies (Nalbandian2014Global).

ANKRD10-IT1, a long non-coding RNA related to ANKRD10, has been identified as a protective factor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where it is correlated with overall survival and used in a risk score model for prognostic prediction (Tang2022A). Additionally, ANKRD10 has been noted in genetic studies related to severe mental illness, although specific diseases or conditions associated with its mutations or alterations were not detailed (Lori2024Genetic).
