# RFXANK

## Overview
RFXANK is a gene that encodes the regulatory factor X associated ankyrin containing protein, a crucial component of the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex. This protein plays a significant role in the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes, which are essential for the immune response. The RFXANK protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly and function of the RFX complex. These interactions are vital for the recruitment of coactivators and the regulation of MHC-II gene expression. Mutations in the RFXANK gene can lead to MHC-II deficiency, a severe immunodeficiency disorder, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Krawczyk2005New; Mousavi2023Clinical).

## Structure
The RFXANK protein is a 260-amino-acid subunit of the RFX complex, essential for the activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. It contains an ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) in its C-terminal region, composed of four ankyrin repeats, which are protein-protein interaction motifs (Krawczyk2005New). Each ankyrin repeat consists of two short antiparallel α-helices connected by a loop and a β-hairpin structure, forming a modular structure maintained by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Krawczyk2005New). 

The ARD is crucial for the function of RFXANK, as it is sufficient to restore MHC-II expression in cells lacking functional RFXANK (Krawczyk2005New). Specific surfaces of the ankyrin repeats mediate protein-protein interactions necessary for RFXANK's role in MHC-II expression, with the back surface of ankyrin repeats 2 and 3 being critical for interaction with RFX5, a component of the RFX complex (Krawczyk2005New). 

RFXANK also interacts with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically HDAC4 and HDAC5, through its ankyrin repeats, suggesting a role in regulating MHC-II gene transcription (McKinsey2006Class). The protein's interaction with HDACs may involve post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can regulate its function (McKinsey2006Class).

## Function
RFXANK is a critical component of the RFX complex, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) genes. This complex, which also includes RFX5 and RFXAP, binds to the X-box DNA in the promoter region of MHC-II genes, facilitating the recruitment of the coactivator CIITA, the master regulator of MHC-II gene expression (Chakraborty2010DNA; Krawczyk2005New). RFXANK contains an ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) that is crucial for protein-protein interactions necessary for the assembly of the RFX complex and the formation of the MHC-II enhanceosome (Krawczyk2005New).

In healthy human cells, RFXANK is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It interacts with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC4 and HDAC5, suggesting a role in linking these HDACs to transcriptional effectors that control MHC-II expression (McKinsey2006Class). This interaction can result in the repression of the HLA-DRA promoter activity, likely through deacetylation of local histones, which is a mechanism to control MHC-II expression in response to extracellular stimuli (McKinsey2006Class).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFXANK gene are primarily associated with Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) deficiency, also known as bare lymphocyte syndrome type II. This condition is characterized by a lack of MHC class II expression on antigen-presenting cells, leading to severe immunodeficiency. Patients with MHC-II deficiency often experience recurrent and severe infections, developmental delays, and autoimmune disorders (Cai2020A; Mousavi2023Clinical).

The RFXANK gene mutations disrupt the ankyrin repeat domain, which is crucial for the gene's function. Various mutations have been identified, including frameshift deletions, nonsense mutations, missense mutations, and splice-site mutations. A specific frameshift deletion, c.162delG, has been identified as a founder mutation in the Iranian population (Mousavi2023Clinical).

MHC-II deficiency due to RFXANK mutations is more prevalent in regions with high consanguinity, such as North Africa and the Mediterranean. The condition is associated with a poor prognosis, with a life expectancy of only a few years without treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment, although its success is limited by residual adaptive immunity and significant comorbidities (Cai2020A; Mousavi2023Clinical).

## Interactions
RFXANK is a component of the RFX complex, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of MHC class II genes. It interacts with other proteins such as RFX5 and RFXAP to form this complex, which binds to the X-box motif in the promoter region of MHC class II genes (Krawczyk2005New; Masternak1998A). The ankyrin repeat domain of RFXANK, consisting of four ankyrin repeats, is crucial for mediating these protein-protein interactions (Krawczyk2005New).

RFXANK also interacts with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically HDAC4 and HDAC5. These interactions suggest that RFXANK functions as an adaptor linking HDACs to transcriptional effectors controlling MHC II gene expression. This interaction results in the repression of the HLA-DRA promoter, likely through histone deacetylation (McKinsey2006Class). The phosphorylation of class II HDACs by CaMK leads to the nuclear export of HDAC/RFXANK complexes, indicating a signal-responsive regulation of antigen presentation (McKinsey2006Class).

Additionally, RFXANK has been shown to interact with caspase-2, a member of the caspase family involved in cell death and inflammation. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and is facilitated by the ankyrin repeat domain of RFXANK (Forsberg2018A).
