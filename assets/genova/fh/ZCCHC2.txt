# ZCCHC2

## Overview
ZCCHC2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 2 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and protein interactions. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are typically involved in binding nucleic acids and proteins, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. ZCCHC2 has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation through its interaction with the c-Myc protein, as well as in the stabilization and translation of viral RNA. It is also associated with serum protein concentrations, indicating a broader role in protein metabolism. Clinically, ZCCHC2 is of interest due to its involvement in diseases such as retinoblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target (Wen2023The; Franceschini2012Discovery; Dai2020The).

## Clinical Significance
ZCCHC2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating RNA metabolism and interactions with other proteins. In retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer, ZCCHC2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. It inhibits the activity of c-Myc, a protein involved in cell growth, by suppressing its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectH9, thereby preventing K63-linked polyubiquitination of c-Myc. Alterations in ZCCHC2 expression can lead to increased retinoblastoma cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dai2020The).

In thyroid carcinoma, ZCCHC2 is overexpressed and shows potential as a diagnostic marker, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.81. Its expression correlates with various immune cells, indicating a role in tumor immunity (Yin2023Differential).

ZCCHC2 has also been associated with colorectal cancer, where zinc finger proteins, including ZCCHC2, may influence microsatellite instability (MSI) status, affecting drug reactivity and cancer progression (Chen2018Gene). Additionally, genetic studies have linked ZCCHC2 to serum protein concentrations, which are associated with various diseases, though the specific clinical implications remain unclear (Franceschini2012Discovery).

## Interactions
ZCCHC2 is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with the c-Myc protein, a key regulator of cell proliferation, by inhibiting its K63-linked polyubiquitination. This process is typically mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HectH9. ZCCHC2 associates with HectH9 and inhibits the interaction between c-Myc and HectH9, thereby suppressing c-Myc activation and negatively regulating cell proliferation (Dai2020The).

In the context of viral RNA replication, ZCCHC2 interacts with the K5 RNA element in the 3' UTR and the TENT4 protein, contributing to the formation of mixed tails that enhance mRNA stability and translation (Wen2023The). This interaction highlights its role in RNA processing and regulation.

ZCCHC2 is also implicated in the regulation of serum protein concentrations, as identified in a transethnic meta-analysis. The TNFRSF11A-ZCCHC2 locus was associated with serum albumin levels, suggesting a potential interaction with genetic elements influencing protein translation and degradation (Franceschini2012Discovery).
