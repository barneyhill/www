# ST14

## Overview
The ST14 gene encodes the transmembrane serine protease known as matriptase, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, particularly in epithelial cell function and integrity. Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease characterized by its modular domain structure, including a serine protease domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Tanimoto2004Transmembrane; Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). This protease is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and undergoes activation through proteolytic cleavage, a process that is tightly regulated by its interaction with inhibitors such as hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) (list2006matriptase). Matriptase is involved in maintaining epithelial barrier function, regulating proteolytic pathways, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where its dysregulation can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Kim2019Targeting; Zuo2019Specifically). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with disorders like ichthyosis-hypotrichosis syndrome and its potential as a prognostic biomarker in various cancers (Nie2024ST14; Youssefian2017A).

## Structure
The ST14 gene encodes the transmembrane serine protease matriptase, which is a protein composed of 855 amino acids (Tanimoto2004Transmembrane; Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The primary structure of matriptase includes a sequence that forms a polypeptide chain, which is synthesized as an inactive zymogen. The secondary structure features modular domains, including the SEA domain, which undergoes cleavage during activation (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The tertiary structure of matriptase is characterized by a multidomain organization, including two CUB repeats, four LDL receptor class A domains, and a serine protease domain located in the extracellular space (Tanimoto2004Transmembrane). 

Matriptase is a type II transmembrane serine protease, with a transmembrane domain anchoring it to the cell membrane, and a longer extracellular domain that contains the catalytic serine protease domain (Nie2024ST14). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are involved in its activation and function (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The protein is part of a proteolytic cascade and is involved in various physiological processes, including skin formation and cancer progression (Kim2019Targeting; Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

## Function
The ST14 gene encodes matriptase, a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a crucial role in epithelial cell function. Matriptase is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of epithelial development, homeostasis, and regeneration. It is unique among trypsin-like serine proteases because its zymogen form exhibits measurable enzymatic activity, which is essential for its conversion to the active form necessary for executing its biological functions (Friis2017Matriptase). Matriptase is active on the cell surface, where it regulates proteolytic pathways essential for maintaining epithelial integrity, including tight junction formation and fluid secretion (Friis2017Matriptase).

In the intestinal epithelium, matriptase is crucial for maintaining barrier integrity and is involved in cellular turnover. It is regulated by the transcription factor CDX2, which can influence its expression and activity (Danielsen2018Intestinal). Matriptase also plays a role in suppressing colitis and colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis, highlighting its importance in gastrointestinal health (Danielsen2018Intestinal). The balance between matriptase and its inhibitors, such as HAI-1, is vital for preventing its oncogenic potential (Danielsen2018Intestinal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the ST14 gene, which encodes the serine protease matriptase, have significant clinical implications. Mutations in ST14 are associated with ichthyosis-hypotrichosis syndrome (IHS), a Mendelian disorder characterized by skin and hair abnormalities. A novel homozygous p.Asp482Asn mutation in ST14 has been identified in patients with IHS, affecting a critical site within a ligand-binding domain of matriptase, which expands the spectrum of pathology associated with this syndrome (Youssefian2017A). 

In cancer, alterations in ST14 expression are linked to tumor progression. Overexpression of ST14 is observed in various cancers, including ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancers, where it enhances cancer cell invasion and migration. In ovarian cancer, high ST14 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor malignancy, partly due to its interaction with TMEFF1, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Nie2024ST14). In breast cancer, the methylation status of ST14 is associated with survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Dai2021Geneassociated).

## Interactions
Matriptase, encoded by the ST14 gene, is a transmembrane serine protease that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in physiological and pathological processes. One of its primary interactions is with hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1), which regulates matriptase activity by inhibiting it post-activation. This interaction is crucial for controlling matriptase's proteolytic activity and preventing uncontrolled activation, which is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing tumorigenesis (list2006matriptase; Kauppinen2010ST14Gene).

Matriptase also interacts with prostasin, a GPI-anchored serine protease, forming a reciprocal zymogen activation complex. This interaction is important for activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various signaling pathways. The activation of PAR-2 by matriptase requires the presence of catalytically active prostasin, highlighting the complexity of their interaction (Friis2017Matriptase).

In cancer biology, matriptase is known to activate several oncogenic proteins, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which contribute to extracellular matrix degradation and cancer metastasis (Zuo2019Specifically). These interactions underscore matriptase's role in both normal physiological processes and disease states.
