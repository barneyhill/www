# GAB1

## Overview
GAB1 (GRB2 associated binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein involved in critical intracellular signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as GRB2-associated binding protein 1, plays a pivotal role in mediating signals from receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), to downstream signaling cascades. These pathways include the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, which are essential for regulating cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Rodrigues2000A; Shioyama2011Docking). GAB1 is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitates its recruitment to the plasma membrane and interaction with other signaling molecules (Bongartz2019The; Kiyatkin2006Scaffolding). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, primarily tyrosine phosphorylation, which create docking sites for various effectors, amplifying receptor-derived signals (Rajala2013Protein). GAB1's involvement in diverse biological processes underscores its importance in normal development and its implication in various diseases, including cancer and sensorineural deafness (Itoh2000Role; Yousaf2018Modifier).

## Structure
GAB1 (GRB2 associated binding protein 1) is a scaffolding protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. Its primary structure includes multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for its role in signal transduction (Rajala2013Protein). The secondary structure of GAB1 features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitates its recruitment to the plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3) (Bongartz2019The; Kiyatkin2006Scaffolding). This domain is essential for its interaction with other signaling molecules and for membrane localization (Rajala2013Protein).

GAB1's tertiary structure involves interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb2 and SHP2, which are critical for its function in signaling pathways like PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK (Bongartz2019The; Kiyatkin2006Scaffolding). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, which create docking sites for various signaling effectors, including PI3K, SHP2, and RasGAP (Rajala2013Protein; Kiyatkin2006Scaffolding).

While the context does not provide detailed information on the quaternary structure or specific splice variant isoforms of GAB1, it is known that these aspects contribute to the protein's functional diversity and regulatory mechanisms in cellular signaling (Rajala2013Protein).

## Function
GAB1 (GRB2 associated binding protein 1) is a scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR). It is involved in the activation of key signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, which are essential for cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Rodrigues2000A; Shioyama2011Docking).

GAB1 contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that facilitates its translocation to the plasma membrane, where it becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. This phosphorylation allows GAB1 to serve as a docking site for various signaling molecules, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (Rodrigues2000A; Gu2003The). Through these interactions, GAB1 amplifies and channels receptor-derived signals into distinct biological pathways, influencing processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, migration, and epithelial morphogenesis (Wöhrle2009Function).

In vivo studies have demonstrated that GAB1 is crucial for normal development, as its deficiency leads to defects in the heart, placenta, and skin, highlighting its role in embryonic development and cellular responses to growth factors and cytokines (Gu2003The; Itoh2000Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GAB1 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, specific mutations such as Y83C and T387N lead to changes in cell phenotype and proliferation, contributing to cancer progression (PérezBaena2023The). GAB1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including gliomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer, and is linked to increased metastasis in breast cancer by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Wang2019Elevated; PérezBaena2023The). 

In addition to cancer, GAB1 mutations are linked to sensorineural deafness. A missense variant in the PH domain of GAB1, c.347G>A (p.Gly116Glu), is associated with nonsyndromic, profound, prelingual sensorineural deafness DFNB26. This variant affects the binding affinity of the PH domain, disrupting normal signaling pathways crucial for inner ear development (Yousaf2018Modifier). 

GAB1 also plays a role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in anterior skull base meningiomas, where its overexpression serves as a marker for Hedgehog pathway activation, potentially guiding targeted therapies (Boetto2021GAB1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GAB1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
GAB1 (GRB2 associated binding protein 1) is a docking protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in multiple signaling pathways. GAB1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upon stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation. This interaction is mediated by the Met-binding domain (MBD) of GAB1 and involves specific phosphorylated tyrosines on the EGFR, particularly Y1068 and Y1086 (Rodrigues2000A). GAB1 also associates with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the phosphatase SHP2 following stimulation by the Met receptor, with these interactions being enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Maroun1999The).

The protein contains phosphotyrosines 627 and 659, forming a bisphosphoryl tyrosine-based activation motif (BTAM) crucial for binding and activating SHP2. This interaction is necessary for the activation of ERK2 in response to EGF stimulation (Cunnick2001Phosphotyrosines). GAB1 also interacts with the cytokine receptor gp130, linking it to the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. This interaction involves SHP2 and PI3K, which are essential for ERK activation (TakahashiTezuka1998Gab1). These interactions highlight GAB1's role as a central mediator in signal transduction, facilitating communication between receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules.
