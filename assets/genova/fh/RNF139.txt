# RNF139

## Overview
RNF139 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 139, also known as TRC8, which is a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it plays a crucial role in protein turnover by tagging proteins for degradation. RNF139 is characterized by multiple transmembrane regions and a sterol-sensing domain, linking its function to cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. It is involved in various cellular processes, including growth suppression, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, by interacting with components of the lipid homeostatic machinery and influencing pathways such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The gene's expression and activity are implicated in tumor suppression, with alterations in RNF139 associated with several cancers, including glioma and tongue cancer (Nakamura2011The; Chen2021An; Gimelli2009The).

## Function
RNF139, also known as TRC8, is a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in cellular processes through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it regulates protein turnover by tagging proteins for degradation. RNF139 contains multiple transmembrane regions and a sterol-sensing domain, which links its activity to cholesterol and lipid homeostasis (Nakamura2011The; Gimelli2009The).

In healthy cells, RNF139 is involved in growth suppression and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with components of the lipid homeostatic machinery, such as INSIG and the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), inhibiting their expression by promoting proteasomal degradation. This interaction helps control the stability and trafficking of SREBPs, thereby influencing lipid metabolism (Nakamura2011The; Gimelli2009The).

RNF139 also induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its role in growth inhibition. Its ubiquitylation activity is crucial for these processes, as demonstrated by its ability to suppress cell growth in various cell types, including Drosophila and mammalian cells (Gimelli2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF139 gene, also known as TRC8, have been implicated in various cancers. In dysgerminoma, a type of ovarian germ cell tumor, a balanced translocation t(8;22)(q24.13;q11.21) disrupts the RNF139 gene, leading to its underexpression in tumor tissue. This disruption is associated with genomic instability and may contribute to tumor development through mechanisms such as microRNA-mediated suppression (Gimelli2009The).

In glioma, RNF139 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation observed in glioma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of RNF139 inhibits glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown enhances these aggressive behaviors. This tumor-suppressive effect is partly mediated through the regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Chen2021An).

RNF139 has also been linked to tongue cancer, where its low expression levels are associated with increased cell invasion and tumorigenicity. Overexpression of RNF139 in tongue cancer cells inhibits cell viability and colony formation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wang2017E3).

Additionally, a novel mutation in RNF139, specifically the p.Q650R mutation, has been identified in hemangioblastomas, suggesting a potential role in the progression of these tumors (Yang2019A).

## Interactions
RNF139, also known as TRC8, is a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing cellular processes such as growth suppression and lipid homeostasis. RNF139 interacts with components of the lipid homeostatic machinery, particularly INSIG and the lipid-regulated transcription factors SREBP1/2. It ubiquitinates INSIG-1 and likely SREBPs, leading to their degradation via the proteasome, which affects lipid metabolism by controlling the stability and trafficking of SREBPs (Nakamura2011The; Gimelli2009The).

RNF139 also interacts with the VHL protein, part of another ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for degrading hypoxia-inducible factors HIF1/2 alpha. This interaction suggests a role in hypoxia responses (Gimelli2009The). In glioma cells, RNF139 is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where its overexpression decreases the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, indicating a regulatory role in this pathway (Chen2021An).

The gene's expression is modulated by cholesterol levels, and it is implicated in tumor suppression, with its activity linked to cholesterol/lipid homeostasis pathways (Gimelli2009The). However, specific details on the physical interactions of RNF139 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
