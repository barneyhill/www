# CAVIN4

## Overview
CAVIN4, also known as caveolae-associated protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cavin family, which is integral to the formation and function of caveolae—small invaginations in the plasma membrane. The protein encoded by CAVIN4, also referred to as muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein (MURC), is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. It plays a critical role in muscle biogenesis and function by associating with sarcolemmal caveolae, thereby maintaining their structural integrity and function (Sowa2012Caveolae; Briand2011Cavin). CAVIN4 is involved in forming multimeric complexes with other cavin proteins, which are essential for caveolae biogenesis and may influence membrane dynamics (Kovtun2015Cavin; Briand2011Cavin). Additionally, CAVIN4 is implicated in modulating the Rho/ROCK pathway, which is significant for cardiac function, and its expression is disrupted in muscle diseases linked to caveolin-3 dysfunction (Sowa2012Caveolae; Chidlow2010Caveolae).

## Function
CAVIN4, also known as muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein (MURC), is a member of the cavin protein family involved in the formation and function of caveolae, which are small invaginations in the plasma membrane. CAVIN4 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it plays a crucial role in muscle biogenesis and function (Sowa2012Caveolae; Briand2011Cavin). It associates with sarcolemmal caveolae in muscle cells and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these caveolae (Hansen2010Exploring; Chidlow2010Caveolae).

CAVIN4 interacts with other cavin proteins to form multimeric complexes that are essential for the biogenesis of caveolae. These complexes stabilize the caveolar domain and may influence membrane curvature or caveolar budding (Kovtun2015Cavin; Briand2011Cavin). The protein is also implicated in the modulation of the Rho/ROCK pathway, which is associated with cardiac function (Sowa2012Caveolae). The expression of CAVIN4 is disrupted in muscle diseases linked to caveolin-3 dysfunction, suggesting its importance in maintaining muscle cell function and structure in healthy human cells (Chidlow2010Caveolae; Briand2011Cavin).

## Clinical Significance
CAVIN4, also known as caveolae-associated protein 4, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in CAVIN4 expression or function are associated with immune-mediated rippling muscle disease (iRMD), a rare myopathy characterized by wavelike muscle contractions. In iRMD, autoantibodies against cavin-4 have been identified as a specific biomarker, suggesting an autoimmune pathogenesis. Patients with iRMD exhibit symptoms such as muscle rippling, mild proximal weakness, and fatigue, with some cases showing comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and Hashimoto thyroiditis (Dubey2022Identification).

CAVIN4 is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, particularly in the context of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The deletion of CAVIN4 has been shown to have a cardioprotective effect, reducing infarct size and preserving cardiac function by modulating reactive oxygen species production and promoting antiapoptotic signaling pathways. This suggests that CAVIN4 plays a significant role in cardiac stress responses, and its overexpression may exacerbate cardiac injury (Nishi2019Systems). These findings highlight the importance of CAVIN4 in both muscle and cardiac pathophysiology, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies targeting its expression or function.

## Interactions
CAVIN4, also known as caveolae-associated protein 4, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is identified as a novel interactor with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a key regulatory protein of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in neonatal cardiomyocytes. The interaction occurs via the HR1 domain of CAVIN4 and the ERM domain of STIM1. This interaction enhances the formation of the STIM1-Orai1 complex, crucial for calcium signaling in cardiomyocytes (Malette2019MURCCAVIN4).

CAVIN4 is also involved in the modulation of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Although no direct interaction with STAT3 was observed, CAVIN4 deletion leads to increased STAT3 activation, suggesting an indirect role in antiapoptotic signaling pathways (Nishi2019Systems). Additionally, CAVIN4 interacts with proteins involved in the apoptotic pathway, such as BCL2, EGR1, and DDIT4, contributing to its role in cardioprotection (Nishi2019Systems).

In the context of immune-mediated rippling muscle disease (iRMD), CAVIN4 is identified as a target of specific IgG autoantibodies, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Dubey2022Identification).
