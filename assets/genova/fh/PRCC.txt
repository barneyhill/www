# PRCC

## Overview
The PRCC gene encodes the proline-rich mitotic checkpoint control factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich N-terminal region, which is implicated in transcriptional activation and RNA processing, although it lacks significant homology to other known proteins (Weterman1996Fusion; Sidhar1996The). PRCC is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the nucleus, where it associates with pre-mRNA splicing factors, suggesting a role in RNA splicing and cellular signaling pathways (Skalsky2001PRCC; van2004Isolation). The protein's involvement in the mitotic checkpoint is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome segregation, thereby preventing aneuploidy and its associated pathologies, such as cancer (Weterman2001Transformation). Additionally, PRCC is known to form oncogenic fusions with the TFE3 transcription factor in certain cancers, altering its normal function and contributing to tumorigenesis (Weterman2000Nuclear).

## Structure
The PRCC protein is composed of 491 amino acids and features a proline, leucine, and glycine-rich N-terminal region, with proline constituting 25% of this domain (Skalsky2001PRCC; Sidhar1996The). This N-terminal region is characterized by its potential role in transcriptional activation, as it is rich in proline, a common feature of transactivation domains (Weterman2001Genomic). The PRCC protein does not exhibit significant homology to known protein sequences and lacks motifs indicative of a specific biochemical function (Weterman1996Fusion; Sidhar1996The).

The PRCC protein is associated with pre-mRNA splicing factors, colocalizing within the nucleus with Sm pre-mRNA splicing factors, and is coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies recognizing various pre-mRNA splicing factors, including SC35, PRL1, and CDC5 (Skalsky2001PRCC). This suggests a role in RNA processing. The protein also contains several phosphorylation sites, including those for cAMP/GMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase, indicating potential regulatory roles in cellular signaling pathways (Weterman1996Fusion). The PRCC gene is ubiquitously expressed, and its protein product is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the mitotic checkpoint (van2004Isolation).

## Function
The PRCC gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. It plays a crucial role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic checkpoint control, which are essential for maintaining genomic stability. The PRCC protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of cell division, impacting organismal development and tissue homeostasis (Weterman2001Genomic).

In healthy human cells, PRCC is involved in the splicing process of pre-mRNA, which is a critical step in gene expression. This function is vital for the accurate processing of RNA transcripts into mature messenger RNA, which is then translated into proteins (Liu2021PRCC). The protein is characterized by a high content of prolines and glycines, suggesting potential interactions with SH3 domains and involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Weterman2000Nuclear).

PRCC's role in mitotic checkpoint control is significant for preventing aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, which can lead to various diseases, including cancer. By ensuring accurate chromosome segregation, PRCC helps maintain genomic integrity during cell division (Weterman2001Transformation).

## Interactions
The PRCC protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of pre-mRNA splicing. It colocalizes with Sm pre-mRNA splicing factors in the nucleus, indicating its association with the cellular splicing machinery (Skalsky2001PRCC). PRCC is co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing various pre-mRNA splicing factors, such as SC35, PRL1, and CDC5, further supporting its role in splicing (Skalsky2001PRCC). These interactions suggest that PRCC is a component of the spliceosomal complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (Skalsky2001PRCC).

In the context of papillary renal cell carcinoma, PRCC frequently forms a fusion with the TFE3 transcription factor. The PRCC-TFE3 fusion protein retains the nuclear localization signals from both PRCC and TFE3, leading to its nuclear localization. This fusion protein exhibits increased transactivation capacity compared to TFE3 alone, potentially leading to aberrant expression of TFE3 target genes (Weterman2000Nuclear). The fusion may also alter the normal splicing interactions of PRCC, as the PRCC-TFE3 fusion proteins show reduced association with Sm proteins compared to their parent proteins (Skalsky2001PRCC).
