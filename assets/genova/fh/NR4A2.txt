# NR4A2

## Overview
NR4A2, also known as Nurr1, is a gene that encodes the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2, a transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression involved in various physiological processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and immune responses (Safe2016Nuclear). As a nuclear receptor, NR4A2 contains a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with specific DNA sequences to modulate transcription (Li2012Structuredependent). NR4A2 is particularly crucial in the central nervous system, where it is essential for the development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons, with implications for neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Safe2016Nuclear). Additionally, NR4A2 influences immune system function by regulating the differentiation of regulatory T cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Sekiya2011The). Mutations and alterations in the NR4A2 gene have been associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal physiological function (Singh2020De; Le2002Mutations).

## Structure
NR4A2, also known as Nurr1, is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in transcription regulation. The protein structure of NR4A2 includes a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a ligand-binding domain (LBD), which are characteristic of the nuclear receptor superfamily (Li2012Structuredependent). The DBD of NR4A2 is composed of two conserved α-helical zinc modules and a C-terminal extension, which are crucial for its interaction with DNA (Jiang2019Structural). 

The tertiary structure of NR4A2 involves the folding of these domains, allowing it to bind DNA in specific orientations. NR4A2 can bind DNA as a monomer or dimer, with dimerization being influenced by specific DNA motifs such as inverted repeats (IR5) and everted repeats (ER0) (Jiang2019Structural). The dimerization interface is primarily formed through van der Waals contacts, with Val298 playing a key role in this interaction (Jiang2019Structural).

NR4A2 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions (Li2012Structuredependent). The protein may exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can alter its functional domains and regulatory capabilities (Li2012Structuredependent).

## Function
The NR4A2 gene, also known as Nurr1, is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression related to metabolism, inflammation, and immune responses. NR4A2 modulates gene transcription by binding as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer with retinoid X receptors (RXR) to specific response elements in gene promoters, influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis, dopaminergic neuron development, and inflammatory responses (Safe2016Nuclear).

In the central nervous system, NR4A2 is crucial for the development and maintenance of dopamine-producing neurons, particularly in regions like the substantia nigra. It is involved in dopamine synthesis and metabolism, and its reduced expression is linked to increased vulnerability to Parkinson's disease (Safe2016Nuclear). NR4A2 also plays a role in memory and learning, potentially through MAP kinase signaling pathways (Safe2016Nuclear).

In the immune system, NR4A2 regulates the differentiation and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by inducing the expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor essential for Treg function. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune diseases (Sekiya2011The). NR4A2 also influences the balance between Th1 and Treg cells, contributing to immune homeostasis (Sekiya2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NR4A2 gene are associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. NR4A2 mutations have been linked to familial Parkinson's disease, where specific mutations such as -291Tdel and -245T→G lead to reduced NR4A2 mRNA expression, affecting dopaminergic function and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Le2002Mutations). These mutations can cause dopaminergic dysfunction, which is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (Le2002Mutations).

NR4A2 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy. De novo variants in the gene have been associated with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and various forms of epilepsy, including West syndrome and infantile spasms (Singh2020De). The gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variations suggests its critical role in maintaining normal neurological function (Singh2020De).

Additionally, NR4A2 mutations are linked to dopa-responsive dystonia-parkinsonism, where frameshift mutations can lead to movement disorders that respond to dopaminergic treatments (Wirth2020Loss‐of‐Function). Alterations in NR4A2 expression have also been observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and manic depression (GabaldonAlbero2024NR4A2; Valsecchi2020The).

## Interactions
NR4A2, also known as Nurr1, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator. NR4A2 can form heterodimers with other members of the Nur subfamily, such as Nur77 (NR4A1) and NOR-1, enhancing transcriptional activation from the Nur response element (NurRE) (Maira1999Heterodimerization). These heterodimers are more potent transcriptional activators than homodimers or monomers (Maira1999Heterodimerization).

NR4A2 also interacts with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form heterodimers, which can influence its transcriptional activity. This interaction is dependent on specific residues in the RXR I-box, and mutations in this region can impair heterodimerization (Aarnisalo2002Defining). The RXR-Nurr1 heterodimer can bind to DNA response elements, such as IR5, and this interaction is important for modulating gene expression (Jiang2019Structural).

NR4A2's activity is modulated through interactions with phosphorylated NF-κB/p65 on target gene promoters, where it recruits a repressor complex known as Co-REST. This interaction helps clear NF-κB/p65 from promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, reducing inflammatory responses (Murphy2015Molecular).
