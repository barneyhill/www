The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate multiple protein products, including the C5 alpha chain, C5 beta chain, C5a anaphylatoxin and C5b. The C5 protein is comprised of the C5 alpha and beta chains, which are linked by a disulfide bridge. Cleavage of the alpha chain by a convertase enzyme results in the formation of the C5a anaphylatoxin, which possesses potent spasmogenic and chemotactic activity, and the C5b macromolecular cleavage product, a subunit of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Mutations in this gene cause complement component 5 deficiency, a disease characterized by recurrent bacterial infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
