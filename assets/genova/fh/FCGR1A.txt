# FCGR1A

## Overview
The FCGR1A gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor Ia (CD64), a high-affinity receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and is primarily expressed on immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. As a transmembrane receptor, CD64 plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating processes like phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which are essential for pathogen clearance and immune regulation (Xu2020FCGR1A; Wu2022Novel). The receptor's high affinity for IgG allows it to be constantly saturated with ligand, necessitating crosslinking by antigen for cell activation, which is crucial for specific immune responses (Nimmerjahn2008Fcγ). FCGR1A's involvement in immune signaling pathways and its expression modulation in response to infections underscore its significance in both normal immune function and disease states, including cancer and autoimmune disorders (Xu2020FCGR1A; Takai2005Fc).

## Structure
The FCGR1A gene encodes the high-affinity IgG Fc receptor, known as CD64, which is a protein involved in immune response. The primary structure of the soluble FcγRIa protein consists of 284 amino acids, including domains D1, D2, and D3 of the ectodomain (Anderson2021Dataset). The sequence between residues 16 and 282 aligns with the crystal structure of FcγRIa (PDB: 3RJD), and residues 21 to 282 match the FcγRIa-Fc complex (PDB: 4ZNE) (Anderson2021Dataset). 

The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation. It contains six asparagine sites with 30 different glycosylation structures, contributing approximately 18% to the total molecular weight. The N-glycan distribution includes complex (70%), high mannose (9%), and hybrid (3%) structures, with most glycans containing core fucosylation (67%) and a small portion capped with one Neu-5-Ac sialic acid (12%) (Anderson2021Dataset). 

The FCGR1A gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can lead to structural and functional diversity, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the available context. The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in immune signaling and interaction with IgG antibodies.

## Function
The FCGR1A gene encodes the high-affinity Fc gamma receptor Ia (CD64), which is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This receptor plays a critical role in the immune system by binding to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, facilitating various immune responses. CD64 is involved in processes such as phagocytosis, where it aids in the engulfment and destruction of pathogens, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which involves the killing of antibody-coated target cells by immune effector cells (Xu2020FCGR1A; Wu2022Novel).

In healthy human cells, CD64 contributes to the clearance of immune complexes and enhances antigen presentation, thereby augmenting both humoral and cellular immune responses (Takai2005Fc). The receptor is also involved in cytokine production, which is crucial for mediating inflammatory responses (Wu2022Novel). CD64's high affinity for IgG allows it to be constantly saturated with ligand, requiring crosslinking by antigen for cell activation, which is essential for specific immune responses (Nimmerjahn2008Fcγ). The receptor's expression can be upregulated in response to infections, indicating its role in immune activation and regulation (Xu2020FCGR1A).

## Clinical Significance
The FCGR1A gene, encoding the high-affinity IgG Fc receptor CD64, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune responses. Alterations in FCGR1A expression or function are linked to several conditions. In cancer, FCGR1A expression is associated with immune infiltration and prognosis in cancers such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). High expression correlates with better survival in CESC, CHOL, and SKCM, but with poorer prognosis in KIRC (Xu2020FCGR1A).

In sarcoidosis, FCGR1A variants, including rs1050204 and rs1848781, affect CD64 expression and are linked to disease susceptibility and severity. These variants influence immune functions like phagocytosis and cytokine production, contributing to the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis (Wu2022Novel).

FCGR1A is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where a stop-gain variant, FCGR1A.pR92X, is associated with a loss of function and increased disease risk. This variant affects immune functions, suggesting a potential link to Alzheimer's pathogenesis (Reddy2022Polygenic). Elevated CD64 levels are also associated with sepsis and systemic infections, serving as a diagnostic biomarker due to its high sensitivity and specificity (Xu2020FCGR1A).

## Interactions
The FCGR1A gene encodes the high-affinity IgG Fc receptor, CD64, which is involved in various immune interactions. CD64 interacts with monomeric IgG, playing a critical role in immune responses such as phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. It is constitutively expressed on antigen-presenting cells like monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, facilitating MHC-class II-mediated antigen presentation by internalizing IgG immune complexes (Wu2022Novel).

The cytoplasmic domain of CD64 interacts with cytoskeletal molecules, including periplakin and protein 4.1G. This interaction is crucial for its function and may explain the functional differences between alleles of the gene (Wu2022Novel). Additionally, CD64 is involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which regulates inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18, contributing to immune responses and inflammation (Zhang2023Upregulation).

In the context of cancer, FCGR1A is associated with immune infiltration and interacts with other immune cell markers, suggesting its involvement in tumor immunology and immune regulation (Xu2020FCGR1A). The protein-protein interaction network identifies FCGR3A, SYK, and HCK as significant interacting partners, indicating its role in immune signaling pathways (Xu2020FCGR1A).
