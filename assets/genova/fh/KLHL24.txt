# KLHL24

## Overview
KLHL24 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 24, which is a substrate-specific adapter in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and multiple kelch repeats, which facilitate its role in ubiquitination processes. KLHL24 is involved in the regulation of intermediate filament proteins, such as keratin 14 and desmin, through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby maintaining cellular integrity and function (Shi2019Kelchlike; Vermeer2021Gainoffunction). Mutations in KLHL24, such as those affecting the translation initiation codon, can lead to conditions like epidermolysis bullosa simplex and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in skin and cardiac health (Logli2021Proteasomemediated; He2016Monoallelic).

## Structure
KLHL24 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its function. The protein contains a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain, and multiple kelch repeats. These domains are integral to the formation of ubiquitin ligase complexes, with the BTB domain binding to Cullin3, the Kelch domain mediating substrate recruitment, and the BACK domain acting as a linker (Shi2019Kelchlike).

The kelch repeats form a β-propeller structure, which is crucial for substrate binding. This structural configuration allows KLHL24 to participate in various cellular processes, including the ubiquitination of intermediate filament proteins such as keratin 14 and desmin, which are essential for maintaining cellular integrity (Shi2019Kelchlike; Vermeer2021Gainoffunction).

Mutations in KLHL24, such as the KLHL24:c.1A>G mutation, result in a truncated protein that lacks the first 28 amino acids, leading to increased stability and altered function due to the absence of an autoubiquitination site (Logli2021Proteasomemediated). This mutation is associated with conditions like epidermolysis bullosa simplex and dilated cardiomyopathy (Vermeer2021Gainoffunction).

## Function
The KLHL24 gene encodes a protein that is part of the kelch-like family, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitination and turnover of intermediate filament (IF) proteins, particularly keratins, in human cells. KLHL24 functions as a substrate-specific adapter in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the degradation of keratin 14 in keratinocytes and vimentin in fibroblasts through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (He2016Monoallelic). This process is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, as it regulates the dynamic turnover of IFs, which are critical for cell and tissue integrity, growth, migration, and protection from apoptosis (He2016Monoallelic).

In healthy human cells, KLHL24 is expressed in various skin cell types, including keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and melanocytes, and is detected both intracellularly and at the cell periphery. It partially colocalizes with desmoplakin and E-cadherin, indicating a role in cell junctions (He2016Monoallelic). The protein's activity is crucial for the mechanical resistance of keratin intermediate filaments in basal epidermal keratinocytes, contributing to skin integrity and resilience (He2016Monoallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL24 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a skin disorder characterized by fragility and blistering. Dominant mutations in the translation initiation codon of KLHL24, such as c.1A>G and c.2T>C, lead to the production of a truncated protein that disrupts normal keratin degradation, particularly affecting keratin 14, resulting in skin fragility and blistering (He2016Monoallelic). These mutations can also cause a syndromic form of EBS, which includes dilated cardiomyopathy as a significant symptom, suggesting a cardiocutaneous syndrome (Logli2021Proteasomemediated; Yenamandra2018811).

In some cases, KLHL24 mutations are linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and abnormal glycogen storage in heart and skeletal muscle, indicating a broader impact on organ systems beyond the skin (HedbergOldfors2016Hypertrophic). The mutations can lead to the degradation of various keratins, such as keratins 7, 8, 17, and 18, contributing to congenital skin defects and fragility (Logli2021Proteasomemediated). These findings highlight the role of KLHL24 in maintaining skin and cardiac integrity, with mutations leading to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
KLHL24 is a protein that functions as a substrate-specific adapter in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. It interacts with CUL3 (Cullin 3) and RBX1 to form a complex that targets specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Vermeer2021Gainoffunction).

KLHL24 has been shown to interact with desmin, a key intermediate filament protein in muscle cells. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of desmin, which is linked to cardiac abnormalities such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Vermeer2021Gainoffunction). The KLHL24-ΔN28 mutation results in a more stable protein that excessively ubiquitinates desmin, leading to its degradation (Vermeer2021Gainoffunction).

In addition to its role in cardiac tissue, KLHL24 is involved in the degradation of keratins, including keratin 14, in the skin. This process is mediated by the KLHL24-CUL3-RBX1 complex and is essential for skin integrity. Mutations in KLHL24 can lead to excessive degradation of keratins, contributing to conditions such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) (Logli2021Proteasomemediated; Shi2019Kelchlike).
