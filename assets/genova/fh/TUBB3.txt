# TUBB3

## Overview
The TUBB3 gene encodes the tubulin beta 3 class III protein, a member of the tubulin family that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of microtubules. These cytoskeletal structures are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. Tubulin beta 3 class III is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, where it is integral to axon guidance, neuronal migration, and the modulation of microtubule dynamics within developing neurons (Shao2019Diseaseassociated; Puri2023TUBB3). The protein's interactions with motor proteins and its involvement in signal transduction pathways underscore its importance in neuronal development and function (Shao2017Uncoupling). Mutations in TUBB3 are linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Tischfield2010Human; Romaniello2018Tubulin).

## Structure
The TUBB3 gene encodes the tubulin beta-3 chain, a component of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport. The primary structure of TUBB3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Hoff2022The). 

In terms of tertiary structure, TUBB3 undergoes conformational changes, transitioning from a curved to a straight form as it incorporates into the microtubule lattice. This transition is crucial for microtubule dynamics and is nucleotide-independent (Hoff2022The). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of TUBB3 into microtubules, where it forms heterodimers with alpha-tubulin. These heterodimers are essential for the polymerization and depolymerization processes at the microtubule plus ends (Hoff2022The).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation can occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions (Hoff2022The). TUBB3 also has several splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and expression patterns, particularly in neuronal tissues where it is predominantly expressed (Hoff2022The).

## Function
The TUBB3 gene encodes the β-tubulin III protein, a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure, intracellular transport, and cell division. In healthy human cells, TUBB3 is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it plays a vital role in axon guidance and neuronal migration. This protein is involved in the modulation of microtubule dynamics within growth cones of developing neurons, which is crucial for proper axon elongation, branching, and projection (Shao2019Diseaseassociated).

TUBB3 interacts with motor proteins such as kinesins and dyneins, facilitating intracellular transport along microtubule tracks. These interactions are essential for processes like axonal transport, which is critical for neuronal function and survival (Puri2023TUBB3). The protein's role in microtubule dynamics is also important for cell division, as it contributes to the formation and stability of the mitotic spindle, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Maesawa2011Transcriptional).

TUBB3's activity is particularly significant during brain development, where it is involved in the coupling of signal transduction cascades to microtubule dynamics, essential for neuronal navigation and axon guidance (Shao2019Diseaseassociated). Its expression is tightly regulated, peaking during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, highlighting its role in cell division and growth (Maesawa2011Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB3 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, collectively known as TUBB3 syndromes. These include congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 3 (CFEOM3), characterized by ocular motility issues, ptosis, and sometimes facial weakness or limb contractures (Tischfield2010Human; Romaniello2018Tubulin). TUBB3 mutations can also lead to malformations of cortical development (MCD), such as frontal polymicrogyria and asymmetric cortical dysplasia, often resulting in intellectual disabilities and developmental delays (Romaniello2018Tubulin; Puri2023TUBB3).

Specific amino acid substitutions in TUBB3, such as R262C, A302T, and E410K, are linked to distinct phenotypes. For example, the E410K mutation is associated with Kallmann syndrome, characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia, alongside other neurological symptoms (Chew2013A). Neuroimaging of individuals with TUBB3 mutations often reveals anomalies such as hypoplasia of the oculomotor nerves, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and basal ganglia malformations (Tischfield2010Human; Blumkin2020Autosomal).

Alterations in TUBB3 expression are also linked to cancer progression and drug resistance, although specific mechanisms remain under investigation (Puri2023TUBB3). These findings underscore the critical role of TUBB3 in nervous system development and function.

## Interactions
TUBB3, or tubulin beta 3 class III, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence microtubule dynamics and neuronal development. One significant interaction is with the UNC5C receptor, which is part of the netrin-1 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for netrin-1-mediated axon repulsion. TUBB3 directly interacts with UNC5C, and this interaction is reduced by netrin-1, both in vitro and in vivo (Shao2017Uncoupling). The interaction between TUBB3 and UNC5C is specific, as TUBB3 does not interact with other β-tubulin subunits like TUBB1 and TUBB2 (Shao2017Uncoupling).

Mutations in TUBB3, such as R262C and R62Q, disrupt its interaction with UNC5C, impairing netrin-1-induced axon guidance and repulsion. These mutations lead to defects in axon pathfinding and guidance, highlighting the importance of TUBB3 in neuronal development (Shao2019Diseaseassociated). The interaction between TUBB3 and UNC5C is also dependent on microtubule dynamics, as agents that disrupt these dynamics, like Taxol or nocodazole, abolish the netrin-1-reduced interaction (Shao2017Uncoupling). These findings underscore the role of TUBB3 in regulating microtubule dynamics and its involvement in critical signaling pathways for axon guidance.
