# GALNT11

## Overview
GALNT11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 11, a member of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initiation of O-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process where N-acetylgalactosamine is transferred to serine or threonine residues on target proteins. As a type II transmembrane protein, GALNT11 is characterized by its structural domains, including a catalytic domain with a GT1 fold and a ricin B-type lectin domain, which are essential for its enzymatic function and substrate specificity (Chia2016Short). The protein plays a significant role in various biological processes, such as Notch signaling and cilia function, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and left-right asymmetry during development (Boskovski2013The). Additionally, GALNT11 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including congenital heart disease and cancer, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Boskovski2013The; Villacis2015Contribution).

## Structure
GALNT11 is a member of the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family, which initiates O-linked glycosylation by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues. The protein structure of GALNT11 includes a catalytic domain with a GT1 fold and a ricin B-type lectin domain. These domains are crucial for its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (Chia2016Short). The catalytic domain is responsible for the transferase activity, while the lectin domain aids in substrate recognition and binding (Chia2016Short).

GALNT11 is a type II transmembrane protein, characterized by a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and a large C-terminal domain that extends into the Golgi lumen (Chia2016Short). The C-terminal domain includes both the catalytic and lectin domains, which are essential for its function in glycosylation processes (Chia2016Short).

Post-translational modifications of GALNT11 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability (Chia2016Short). The protein's structure and modifications are critical for its role in various biological processes, including its involvement in Notch signaling and cilia function (Boskovski2013The).

## Function
GALNT11 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation, a process where N-acetylgalactosamine is transferred to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions. GALNT11 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences processes such as cell adhesion and migration (Chia2016Short).

In healthy human cells, GALNT11 is involved in the glycosylation of the Notch receptor, which affects ligand-receptor interactions and is crucial for the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is important for mediating left-right development, as evidenced by studies in model organisms like Xenopus (Boskovski2013The). GALNT11's activity is linked to the specification of cilia types, which is vital for generating extracellular fluid flow and proper left-right asymmetry (Boskovski2013The).

GALNT11 is also associated with the expression of Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens, markers of O-glycosylation, which are often linked to poor prognosis in various cancers. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, GALNT11 expression is observed in B-CLL cells and healthy T-cells, suggesting a role in the differentiation and transformation of lymphocytes (Hussain2016Nacetylgalactosaminyltransferases).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GALNT11 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. GALNT11 is linked to heterotaxy, a disorder characterized by abnormal left-right body patterning, which can lead to major congenital heart disease. This gene influences the balance between motile and immotile cilia, crucial for proper laterality, by glycosylating the Notch receptor, thereby activating the Notch signaling pathway (Boskovski2013The). Knockdown of GALNT11 results in laterality defects and abnormal cardiac looping, which can be rescued by overexpressing human GALNT11 mRNA (Boskovski2013The).

GALNT11 has also been implicated in kidney function deterioration. A genome-wide association study identified an association between GALNT11 and kidney function decline, with Galnt11-deficient mice exhibiting proteinuria due to reduced binding of the endocytic receptor megalin/LRP2 to its ligands (Kato2021Polypeptide).

In cancer, GALNT11 has been associated with colorectal cancer predisposition. Rare copy number variations involving GALNT11 have been observed in patients with Lynch syndrome, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Villacis2015Contribution).

## Interactions
GALNT11 is involved in the glycosylation of the Notch receptor, a process crucial for determining cilia type and laterality. This glycosylation occurs specifically in the EGF repeats and near the ADAM metalloproteinase ectodomain shedding site, enhancing the cleavage of the juxtamembrane peptide by ADAM17. This activity increases the amount of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), thereby activating the Notch signaling pathway (Boskovski2013The). GALNT11-mediated Notch signaling influences the balance between motile and immotile cilia, which is critical for left-right patterning. Knockdown of GALNT11 or NOTCH1 results in an increased ratio of motile cilia, leading to laterality defects, while overexpression of Notch decreases this ratio (Boskovski2013The).

The STRING database indicates that GALNT11 shows weak interactions with proteins such as ROCK2, NUP188, ZNF804B, and CEP152. These interactions are determined by evidence from genomic context, high-throughput experiments, co-expression, and previous literature knowledge (Hussain2013Clinically). However, specific interactions of GALNT11 with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature. The role of GALNT11 in glycosylation and its interactions with other proteins suggest its involvement in complex cellular signaling pathways.
