# CLCA2

## Overview
The CLCA2 gene encodes the chloride channel accessory 2 protein, which is a member of the CLCA family known for its involvement in various physiological processes, including ion transport and cellular adhesion. This protein is characterized by a zincin-like metalloprotease domain and a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and potential involvement in cancer metastasis (Pawłowski2006Novel; Patel2009The). CLCA2 is primarily expressed in keratinocytes and non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining skin integrity and acts as a tumor suppressor (Loewen2005Structure; Seltmann2018Humidityregulated). The protein is involved in regulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and maintaining epithelial integrity through interactions with other proteins such as STIM-1, ORAI-1, and EVA1 (Ramena2016CLCA2; Sharma2018CLCA2). Clinically, CLCA2 is significant due to its downregulation in various cancers, including breast and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition (Qiang2018Along; Li2004CLCA2).

## Structure
The CLCA2 protein is a member of the CLCA family, characterized by a zincin-like metalloprotease domain and a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain. The primary structure of CLCA2 includes a signal peptide and a metalloprotease domain, which is predicted to have a zinc-dependent enzyme structure similar to zinc metalloproteases (Pawłowski2006Novel). The vWA domain, although lacking a metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), is involved in protein-protein interactions, notably binding to β4-integrin, which may play a role in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis (Patel2009The).

The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage, resulting in an 86-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 34-kDa C-terminal fragment, both of which localize to the cell surface (Loewen2005Structure). Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification, with four glycosylation sites identified on the 86-kDa fragment and one on the 34-kDa fragment (Loewen2005Structure). The presence of a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal region suggests a potential role in stabilizing the peptidase domain or substrate binding (Lenart2013CLCAs). CLCA2 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its functional roles in different tissues (Loewen2005Structure).

## Function
The CLCA2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining skin integrity and cellular homeostasis under varying environmental conditions. In healthy human cells, CLCA2 is highly expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, and is involved in osmoregulation. Its expression is influenced by osmotic conditions, increasing significantly under reduced humidity or hyperosmotic stress, such as exposure to sorbitol or high salt concentrations. This up-regulation is mediated through the p38/JNK-ATF2 signaling pathway and helps protect keratinocytes from hyperosmotic stress by preventing cell death (Seltmann2018Humidityregulated).

CLCA2 also plays a crucial role in promoting cell-cell adhesion, particularly under hyperosmotic conditions. It maintains the localization of E-cadherin, a key cell adhesion protein, in the plasma membrane, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the epidermis. Knockdown of CLCA2 results in reduced E-cadherin levels and impaired cell-cell adhesion, leading to increased apoptosis under stress conditions (Seltmann2018Humidityregulated).

In addition to its role in the skin, CLCA2 is expressed in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells and may function as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is downregulated in tumorigenic cell lines, suggesting a role in cell cycle control and apoptosis (Loewen2005Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The CLCA2 gene is implicated in several cancers, primarily due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In breast cancer, CLCA2 is frequently downregulated, primarily through epigenetic mechanisms such as promoter hypermethylation, rather than somatic mutations. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenicity, as re-establishing CLCA2 expression in breast cancer cell lines reduces their tumorigenic potential (Li2004CLCA2). 

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CLCA2 expression is also reduced, correlating with poor prognosis and increased metastasis. Overexpression of CLCA2 in NPC cells inhibits growth and metastasis, suggesting its role in suppressing tumor progression (Qiang2018Along).

CLCA2 is also involved in prostate cancer, where its expression is repressed by factors such as CTBP1 and histone deacetylases. This repression is linked to the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis (Porretti2018CLCA2).

Additionally, a missense mutation in CLCA2 has been associated with autosomal dominant cardiac conduction block, indicating its role in cardiac conditions (Mao2019A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CLCA2 in various diseases.

## Interactions
The CLCA2 protein is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. CLCA2 interacts with STIM-1, a calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and ORAI-1, a plasma membrane store-operated calcium channel. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), enhancing intracellular calcium levels and subsequently activating calcium-activated chloride currents (I CaCC) (Sharma2018CLCA2). 

CLCA2 also interacts with the junctional protein EVA1, which is important for maintaining epithelial integrity. This interaction is mediated through the transmembrane segment of CLCA2 and is crucial for epithelial cell differentiation and junctional signaling. CLCA2 forms two independent complexes: one with EVA1 and ZO-1, and another with beta-catenin, which is involved in downregulating beta-catenin target genes and promoting epithelial polarization (Ramena2016CLCA2).

Despite its role in calcium regulation, CLCA2 does not physically interact with TMEM16A, a calcium-activated chloride channel, nor does it affect its surface expression or stability (Sharma2018CLCA2). These interactions highlight CLCA2's role in modulating calcium entry and maintaining epithelial characteristics.
