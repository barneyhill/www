# TXNDC11

## Overview
TXNDC11 is a gene that encodes the protein thioredoxin domain-containing 11, which is a type II transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is characterized by its five thioredoxin-like domains, which are crucial for its function in redox reactions and protein quality control within the ER. TXNDC11 plays a significant role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, particularly in the mannose trimming step of misfolded glycoproteins, by forming stable disulfide bonds with proteins such as EDEM2 (Patel2020Oxidoreductases; George2020EDEM2). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing ER stress. Additionally, TXNDC11 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its dual role in cancer, where it acts as an oncogene in gliomas and potentially serves a protective function in hepatocellular carcinoma (Cho2018Clinical; Chen2023High).

## Structure
TXNDC11 is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes a single transmembrane domain (TMD), five thioredoxin-like (Trx-like) domains, and a coiled coil domain. The protein also contains 24 cysteine residues, which are crucial for its function, particularly in forming disulfide bonds with other proteins such as EDEM2 (George2020EDEM2). The C692 residue, part of the Trx5 domain, is involved in a stable disulfide bond with EDEM2, essential for the protein's role in mannose trimming during glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (gpERAD) (George2020EDEM2).

TXNDC11 is a type II transmembrane protein, indicating its integration into the membrane with a specific orientation. The presence of ten potential N-glycosylation sites suggests that glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification affecting its function and stability (George2020EDEM2). The protein's structure is further influenced by alternative translation initiation sites at methionine residues M1 and M58, which affect its solubility and membrane association (George2020EDEM2). The Trx5 domain, containing a CXXC motif, exhibits reductase activity, highlighting its role in redox reactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (George2020EDEM2).

## Function
TXNDC11 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that plays a crucial role in the quality control of glycoproteins through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It contains five thioredoxin-like domains, which are involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bonds, essential for maintaining protein structure and function (Ninagawa2021Mechanisms; George2020EDEM2). TXNDC11 is particularly important for the mannose trimming step in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. It forms a stable disulfide bond with EDEM2, facilitating the conversion of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 8 GlcNAc 2, a critical step in the ERAD process (Patel2020Oxidoreductases; George2020EDEM2).

TXNDC11's interaction with EDEM2 is essential for the expression of EDEM2's mannosidase activity, which is necessary for the degradation of certain substrates, including MHC class I molecules (Ninagawa2021Mechanisms; George2020EDEM2). The protein's role in ERAD highlights its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing ER stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins (Patel2020Oxidoreductases). TXNDC11 is also involved in the reduction and unfolding of substrate glycoproteins, exposing hydrophobic domains for recognition by EDEM proteins (Patel2020Oxidoreductases).

## Clinical Significance
The TXNDC11 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly gliomas and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In gliomas, especially glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high expression of TXNDC11 is associated with advanced tumor grade and poor prognosis. It promotes malignant behaviors such as proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and regulating cell cycle progression. Knockdown of TXNDC11 in GBM cells results in reduced tumor growth, increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, and enhanced apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023High).

In contrast, in hepatocellular carcinoma, high TXNDC11 mRNA expression is linked to a favorable prognosis. It is associated with the downregulation of genes related to E2F targets and EMT, which are typically linked to poor outcomes. This suggests that TXNDC11 may play a protective role in HCC by suppressing tumor-promoting pathways (Cho2018Clinical).

These findings highlight the dual role of TXNDC11 in different cancer types, acting as an oncogene in gliomas while potentially serving a protective function in HCC. This underscores the importance of context-specific research to understand its diverse roles in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
TXNDC11, or thioredoxin domain-containing protein 11, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with EDEM2, where TXNDC11 forms a stable disulfide bond with EDEM2, specifically between C558 of EDEM2 and C692 of TXNDC11. This interaction is essential for the first mannose trimming step in glycoprotein ER-associated degradation (ERAD), a process critical for the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (George2020EDEM2). The disulfide bond between TXNDC11 and EDEM2 enhances EDEM2's enzymatic activity, facilitating the conversion of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 8 GlcNAc 2, which is a key step in glycoprotein processing (George2020EDEM2).

TXNDC11 also interacts with other proteins involved in ERAD, such as PDI, GANAB, EDEM3, GLU2B, and TXNDC5, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis (George2020EDEM2). These interactions suggest that TXNDC11 plays a broader role in the ERAD pathway, potentially influencing the folding and degradation of various glycoproteins. The Trx5 domain of TXNDC11, containing the CxxC motif, is particularly important for these interactions, and mutations in this domain can disrupt its function in the gpERAD assay (George2020EDEM2).
