# DPEP1

## Overview
DPEP1, or dipeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase protein primarily involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides. This enzyme is categorized as a metalloenzyme due to its reliance on zinc ions for catalytic activity. DPEP1 is predominantly expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney, where it plays a crucial role in dipeptide metabolism and iron homeostasis, impacting processes such as transferrin endocytosis and ferroptosis (Toiyama2010DPEP1; Guan2021A). The protein is membrane-bound, anchored by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, which facilitates its involvement in cellular processes (Toiyama2010DPEP1). Beyond its physiological roles, DPEP1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including colorectal cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance (Toiyama2010DPEP1; Zeng2021DPEP1). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions with other cellular components underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states.

## Structure
DPEP1 (dipeptidase 1) is a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme involved in the hydrolysis of dipeptides. The primary structure of DPEP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of DPEP1 refers to its three-dimensional folding, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. In terms of quaternary structure, DPEP1 is known to form homodimers, which are essential for its biological function.

Post-translational modifications of DPEP1 may include glycosylation, which can affect the protein's stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are common in proteins and play a significant role in their functional regulation. The presence of specific domains and prominent folds within DPEP1 contributes to its ability to bind zinc ions, which are necessary for its catalytic activity as a metalloenzyme. The structural features of DPEP1, including its ability to form homodimers and undergo post-translational modifications, are critical for its role in dipeptide hydrolysis.

## Function
DPEP1 (dipeptidase 1) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of dipeptides, particularly in the proximal tubules of the kidney. In healthy human cells, DPEP1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein responsible for hydrolyzing dipeptides and is involved in transferrin endocytosis, which is crucial for iron metabolism (Guan2021A). This protein is anchored to the membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, which facilitates its role in cellular processes (Toiyama2010DPEP1).

DPEP1 is involved in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis by altering iron import, which is essential for the process of ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis characterized by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation (Guan2021A). It colocalizes with clathrin, an endocytic vesicle marker, indicating its role in endocytosis (Guan2021A). The protein's enzymatic activity is also linked to glutathione metabolism, impacting the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses (Toiyama2010DPEP1). Through these functions, DPEP1 contributes to the regulation of iron and glutathione levels, which are critical for cellular health and protection against oxidative damage (Guan2021A).

## Clinical Significance
The DPEP1 gene is clinically significant in several cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). Its expression is significantly higher in CRC tissues compared to normal mucosa, making it a potential marker for early detection and prognostic stratification (Toiyama2010DPEP1; Eisenach2013Dipeptidase). High DPEP1 expression is associated with the transition from low-grade to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and correlates with advanced tumor stages, such as T3/T4, and poorer survival outcomes in CRC patients (Eisenach2013Dipeptidase). Despite its correlation with disease progression, DPEP1 expression is not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in multivariate analyses (Toiyama2010DPEP1; Eisenach2013Dipeptidase).

In colon cancer, DPEP1 is linked to increased drug resistance, particularly in an ASCL2-dependent manner, and is associated with poor disease-specific survival and progression-free intervals (Zeng2021DPEP1). The gene's expression is also implicated in immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response in cancer (Zeng2021DPEP1).

DPEP1 is also upregulated in hepatoblastoma, where it promotes tumor progression through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and is a direct target of microRNA-193a-5p, which acts as a tumor suppressor (Cui2019DPEP1).

## Interactions
DPEP1 interacts with the MYC transcription factor in colon cancer cells. MYC binds to the promoter region of the DPEP1 gene, activating its transcription. This interaction was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. Overexpression of MYC increases DPEP1 mRNA and protein levels, while silencing MYC decreases DPEP1 expression. DPEP1 and MYC proteins colocalize mainly in the nucleus and bind to each other, forming a regulatory feedback loop that enhances the proliferation of colon cancer cells (Liu2020DPEP1).

DPEP1 also regulates the stability of MYC proteins by inhibiting their ubiquitination, which enhances MYC protein stability and extends their half-life. This interaction was demonstrated using proteasome inhibitors and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments, indicating that DPEP1 affects MYC's degradation pathway (Liu2020DPEP1).

In colorectal cancer, DPEP1 is abundant in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and is enriched in CD81/EGFR double-bright exosomes. It colocalizes with CD63 in multivesicular bodies, suggesting an endosomal origin. DPEP1-positive extracellular vesicles are more prevalent in the plasma of colorectal cancer patients, indicating its potential role in immune cell recruitment (Tutanov2023Emerging).
