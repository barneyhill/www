# ZDHHC15

## Overview
ZDHHC15 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 15, a transmembrane enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation. This enzyme is characterized by its DHHC motif, which is essential for its catalytic activity, and a cysteine-rich domain that provides structural stability. ZDHHC15 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in neuronal function by influencing dendritic morphology and synapse formation. It is particularly important for the palmitoylation of PSD-95, a scaffolding protein crucial for excitatory synapse formation. Beyond its role in normal neuronal processes, ZDHHC15 is implicated in various neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities and psychiatric conditions, and is upregulated in certain cancers such as glioma, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Liu2023ZDHHC15; Gadalla2019Toward; Shah2019Regulation).

## Structure
ZDHHC15 is a palmitoyltransferase enzyme characterized by a tent-like structure formed by four transmembrane helices. The protein contains a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) motif located at the membrane-cytosol interface, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This motif is part of a catalytic triad-like arrangement involving aspartic acid and histidine residues that activate a nucleophile cysteine, essential for the palmitoylation process (Zmuda2020Regulatory; Gadalla2019Toward).

The protein also features a highly conserved cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that forms six β-sheets coordinating two zinc ions, providing structural stability. This region includes positively charged residues that interact with the negatively charged phosphates of the CoA moiety (Gadalla2019Toward). The transmembrane domains form a tepee-like arrangement, creating a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates the acyl chain of the acyl-CoA (Zmuda2020Regulatory).

ZDHHC15 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the palmitoylation of several proteins, including PSD-95, which is crucial for synapse formation (Korycka2012Human; Gadalla2019Toward). The protein's structure and localization are influenced by its transmembrane domains and the presence of specific binding domains such as ankyrin repeats and PDZ motifs (Gadalla2019Toward).

## Function
ZDHHC15 encodes a palmitoyl acyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through S-palmitoylation, a process that attaches palmitic acid to cysteine residues. This modification is essential for protein localization, stability, and function, particularly in neurons. ZDHHC15 is primarily active in the somatic Golgi complex and dendrites, where it influences signaling pathways and membrane dynamics (shimell2019regulation; Shah2019Regulation).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC15 is involved in the regulation of dendritic morphology and synapse formation. It is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but not in glial cells, and is crucial for dendritic growth and arborization during early neuronal development (shimell2019regulation; Shah2019Regulation). The enzyme's palmitoylation activity is vital for the proper trafficking and localization of PSD-95, a scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density, which is important for excitatory synapse formation and maintenance (shimell2019regulation; Shah2019Regulation).

ZDHHC15's role in palmitoylating PSD-95 affects synaptic organization and function, contributing to the formation and maturation of glutamatergic synapses. Disruptions in these processes are linked to intellectual disabilities, highlighting the enzyme's significance in maintaining neuronal connectivity and function (shimell2019regulation; Shah2019Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZDHHC15 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders and conditions. ZDHHC15 is associated with intellectual disabilities, particularly X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Mutations or loss-of-function variants in this gene can lead to intellectual disabilities, as it plays a crucial role in dendritic growth and synapse formation (Mansouri2005Loss; Shah2019Regulation). The gene is located on the X chromosome, and disruptions in its expression have been observed in cases of nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) (Mansouri2005Loss).

In addition to its role in intellectual disabilities, ZDHHC15 has been implicated in psychiatric disorders. ZDHHC15-deficient mice exhibit behaviors associated with psychiatric illnesses, such as increased sensitivity to amphetamines (Liu2023ZDHHC15). The gene has also been linked to conditions like hypotonic cerebral palsy, autism, and epilepsy (Liu2023ZDHHC15).

In the context of cancer, ZDHHC15 is significantly upregulated in glioma, a type of brain tumor. High expression levels of ZDHHC15 are associated with increased malignancy and poor prognosis in glioma patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2023ZDHHC15).

## Interactions
ZDHHC15 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a palmitoyltransferase. It interacts with PSD-95, a postsynaptic density protein, facilitating its palmitoylation, which is essential for PSD-95 trafficking into dendrites and the formation of excitatory synapses (Shah2019Regulation). This interaction is significant for maintaining synaptic connections and dendritic morphology in neurons (Shah2019Regulation).

In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), ZDHHC15 interacts with GP130, a component of the IL-6 receptor complex. This interaction is crucial for the palmitoylation of GP130, which affects its membrane localization and the activation of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. This pathway is important for the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of GSCs (Fan2021Local). The interaction between ZDHHC15 and GP130 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays (Fan2021Local).

ZDHHC15's role in these interactions highlights its importance in both normal neuronal function and pathological conditions such as glioma, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Liu2023ZDHHC15; Fan2021Local).
