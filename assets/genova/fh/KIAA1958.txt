# KIAA1958

## Overview
KIAA1958 is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of the KIAA1958 protein are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in cellular signaling pathways and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein does not belong to a well-defined category such as kinases or receptors, and its precise molecular functions remain under investigation. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in several diseases, including transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and multiple myeloma, through genetic mutations and alterations (Li2012Singlecell; Jiménez2017A). Additionally, KIAA1958 has been linked to asthma susceptibility in children, suggesting a broader impact on human health (Miteva2023Genetic). Further studies are required to fully understand the biological and clinical significance of KIAA1958.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KIAA1958 has been implicated in several diseases through mutations and genetic alterations. In transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, KIAA1958 was identified as one of the recurrently mutated genes, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis. The study found that KIAA1958, along with other genes, had a Q-score higher than or close to 1, indicating its possible importance in the development of TCC (Li2012Singlecell). The specific role of KIAA1958 in TCC remains uncharacterized, but its recurrent mutation in certain subclones of tumor cells suggests it may contribute to cancer progression (Li2012Singlecell).

In multiple myeloma, KIAA1958 was involved in a translocation event, although the study did not provide information on the clinical significance of this finding (Jiménez2017A). Additionally, KIAA1958 has been associated with asthma in children, as identified in a study focusing on genetic factors contributing to asthma susceptibility (Miteva2023Genetic). Despite these associations, the precise clinical implications of KIAA1958 mutations or alterations in its expression remain largely unexplored, necessitating further research to clarify its role in these and potentially other conditions.
