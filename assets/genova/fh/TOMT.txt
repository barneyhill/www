# TOMT

## Overview
The TOMT gene encodes the transmembrane O-methyltransferase protein, which plays a pivotal role in the auditory system, particularly in the mechanotransduction process of hair cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is essential for the proper trafficking of TMC1 and TMC2 proteins to the stereocilia of hair cells, where they form part of the mechanotransduction complex responsible for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals necessary for hearing (Erickson2017Integration; Cunningham2017The). Unlike typical methyltransferases, the function of TOMT in hair cells does not depend on its enzymatic activity but rather on its role in protein trafficking within the secretory pathway (Erickson2017Integration; Cunningham2017The). Mutations in the TOMT gene are associated with nonsyndromic deafness DFNB63, underscoring its clinical significance in auditory health (Erickson2017Integration; Cunningham2017The).

## Function
The TOMT gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the mechanotransduction process in hair cells, which is essential for hearing. In healthy cells, TOMT is involved in the trafficking of TMC1 and TMC2 proteins to the stereocilia of hair cells, which are critical components of the mechanotransduction complex. This complex is responsible for converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, a fundamental process for auditory function (Erickson2017Integration; Cunningham2017The).

TOMT is localized in the secretory pathway rather than the hair bundle itself, suggesting its role in regulating the transport of TMC proteins to the hair bundle, where mechanotransduction occurs (Erickson2017Integration). The protein's function in hair cells is distinct from its potential enzymatic activity, as its role in mechanotransduction does not rely on methyltransferase activity (Cunningham2017The).

In zebrafish models, TOMT is essential for the proper localization of TMC1/2 proteins, and its absence leads to hearing loss due to defects in mechanotransduction (Erickson2017Integration). This indicates that TOMT's primary function in hair cells is related to protein trafficking rather than methylation processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOMT gene are linked to nonsyndromic deafness DFNB63, characterized by severe to profound neurosensory hearing loss. This condition arises from defects in the mechanotransduction process in hair cells, where TOMT is crucial for the trafficking of Tmc proteins to the hair bundle. In the absence of TOMT, Tmc1/2 proteins fail to localize to the hair bundle, disrupting the mechanotransduction complex and leading to hearing loss (Erickson2017Integration).

Research using zebrafish models has demonstrated that TOMT deficiency results in a lack of mechanotransduction (MET) currents in hair cells, confirming its essential role in auditory function. The interaction between TOMT and TMC1 is vital for the proper integration of TMC proteins into the MET complex, and mutations in TOMT disrupt this process, leading to hearing impairments (Erickson2017Integration).

In mice, mutations in the Tomt gene, the murine ortholog of human TOMT, result in profound deafness due to impaired transport of TMC1 and TMC2 proteins into the stereocilia of hair cells. This highlights the critical role of TOMT in hearing and suggests that similar mutations in humans could have significant clinical implications for auditory function (Cunningham2017The).

## Interactions
The transmembrane O-methyltransferase (TOMT) protein is involved in several critical interactions within hair cells, particularly in the context of mechanotransduction. TOMT interacts with components of the mechanotransduction machinery, including TMC1 and TMC2 proteins, which are essential for proper auditory function. These interactions are crucial for the trafficking of TMC proteins to the hair bundle, a process necessary for the assembly of the mechanotransduction complex (Erickson2017Integration).

In zebrafish hair cells, TOMT is enriched in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its role in the secretory pathway to facilitate the transport of TMC proteins to the hair bundle. This interaction is essential for forming a functional mechanotransduction complex with other proteins like PCDH15, LHFPL5, and TMIE (Erickson2017Integration). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells have demonstrated that TOMT can directly interact with TMC1, and this interaction is influenced by specific mutations in TOMT (Erickson2017Integration).

In mice, TOMT is necessary for the transport of TMC1 and TMC2 into the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells, although TOMT itself does not localize within the stereocilia. This suggests that TOMT may function as an adaptor or shuttle protein, facilitating the transport of these essential components (Cunningham2017The).
