# HEBP1

## Overview
HEBP1 is a gene located on human chromosome 12 that encodes the heme binding protein 1, a member of the SOUL family of heme-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by a unique structural motif, a nine-stranded twisted beta-barrel flanked by two alpha-helices, which facilitates its role in binding and transporting heme and other tetrapyrroles within cells (Goodfellow2021The). Heme binding protein 1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in various physiological processes, including heme metabolism, mitochondrial function, and apoptosis (Yagensky2019Increased; Goodfellow2021The). Despite its involvement in these processes, the full scope of HEBP1's function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, with ongoing research exploring its potential roles in inflammation, oxidative stress response, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Yagensky2019Increased; Goodfellow2021The).

## Structure
The human gene HEBP1 encodes a 189 amino acid protein located on chromosome 12. The primary structure of HEBP1 includes a sequence that allows it to bind heme and other intermediaries from heme biosynthesis, such as protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrinogen (Goodfellow2021The). The secondary structure of murine HEBP1, which shares 87% sequence similarity with human HEBP1, consists of a nine-stranded twisted beta-barrel flanked by two alpha-helices, presenting a novel fold in eukaryotes (Goodfellow2021The). The tertiary structure of human HEBP1, modeled using NMR data, reveals a rigid globular protein with little flexibility in the 170-180 loop region (Goodfellow2021The). The protein is a monomer in solution, indicating no quaternary structure involving multiple subunits (Goodfellow2021The).

HEBP1 binds heme through hydrophobic interactions, with the heme ligand positioned similarly in both solution and crystal structures (Goodfellow2021The). The crystal structure of heme-bound murine HEBP1, with PDB code 7OON, confirms these interactions (Goodfellow2021The). The protein's role in heme binding and transport suggests its involvement in various physiological processes, although its comprehensive function remains unclear (Goodfellow2021The).

## Function
HEBP1 (heme binding protein 1) is a member of the SOUL family of heme-binding proteins, which are evolutionarily conserved across various species. It is primarily involved in the binding and transport of heme and other tetrapyrroles within cells, playing a crucial role in heme metabolism and homeostasis (Goodfellow2021The). HEBP1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver, spleen, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract (Goodfellow2021The).

Structurally, HEBP1 is characterized by a 9-stranded twisted beta-barrel flanked by two alpha-helices, which facilitates its high affinity for heme and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (Goodfellow2021The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and has been implicated in intracellular heme transport and trafficking, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Goodfellow2021The).

HEBP1 is also associated with various physiological processes, including inflammation and mitochondrial-associated caspase signaling, suggesting a potential role in cellular responses to oxidative stress and apoptosis (Goodfellow2021The). Despite these associations, a comprehensive understanding of HEBP1's function in healthy cells is still lacking, necessitating further research to elucidate its role in cellular and organismal biology (Goodfellow2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The HEBP1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), HEBP1 is upregulated in the brains of both animal models and human patients, particularly in rapidly-progressing cases. This upregulation is associated with neurotoxicity and apoptosis, as HEBP1 interacts with the mitochondrial contact site complex (MICOS) and is involved in heme-mediated cytotoxicity. HEBP1-deficient neurons show resistance to heme-induced apoptosis, suggesting that HEBP1 contributes to neuronal loss in AD (Yagensky2019Increased).

In cancer, a variant of HEBP1 has been linked to osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients undergoing bisphosphonate treatment, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Lee2019Identifying). HEBP1 is also associated with bone metastasis in breast cancer and melanoma susceptibility (Goodfellow2021The).

Additionally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near HEBP1 is linked to hypokalemia induced by hydrochlorothiazide, an antihypertensive drug, with varying effects across different populations (Goodfellow2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HEBP1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
HEBP1, a heme-binding protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of mitochondrial function and apoptosis. It interacts with components of the mitochondrial contact site complex (MICOS), including Mic60, Mic19, and Mic25, as well as outer mitochondrial membrane proteins SAMM50 and Mtx2. These interactions suggest that HEBP1 is located near the mitochondrial outer membrane and may play a role in mitochondrial function and the regulation of cell death (Yagensky2019Increased).

HEBP1 is also involved in heme-induced cytotoxicity through an apoptotic pathway, specifically involving the mitochondrial-associated caspase signaling pathway. It mediates apoptosis by interacting with mitochondrial components, particularly the MICOS complex, and plays a role in the apoptotic processes linked to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (Yagensky2019Increased).

In the context of neurovascular regeneration, HEBP1 delivered via pericyte-derived extracellular vesicles can regulate the expression of tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, -2, -3, and -11. It may directly associate with claudin-2 and claudin-3, influencing their expression, while claudin-1 and claudin-11 might be regulated through indirect pathways (Ock2023Hemebinding).
