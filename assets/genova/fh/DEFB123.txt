# DEFB123

## Overview
DEFB123 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 123, a member of the beta-defensin family known for its role in the innate immune system. This protein is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, characterized by its small, cysteine-rich, and cationic structure, which enables it to disrupt the membrane integrity of various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 123 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, contributing to mucosal immunity and serving as a first line of defense against microbial infections. Beyond its antimicrobial properties, the protein also plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses, such as protecting against endotoxemia by restoring normal levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (hall2007characterization). The gene has been studied for its potential implications in disease susceptibility, reproductive health, and metabolic processes, although specific disease associations in humans remain to be fully elucidated (Zheng2021A; Ateya2023New; Kraja2012Genetic).

## Function
DEFB123, a member of the beta-defensin family, plays a crucial role in the innate immune response by providing antimicrobial protection. This protein is characterized by its small, cysteine-rich, cationic structure, which is essential for its function in disrupting the membrane integrity of various pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. DEFB123 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, where it contributes to maintaining mucosal immunity and acts as a first line of defense against microbial infections (hall2007characterization).

The structural features of DEFB123, such as the conserved 6-cysteine signature motif and disulfide-stabilized configuration, are critical for its antimicrobial activity. These features are conserved across various species, underscoring their fundamental role in host defense mechanisms (hall2007characterization). In addition to its antimicrobial properties, DEFB123 has a novel function in protecting against endotoxemia by restoring normal levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, highlighting its role in modulating inflammatory responses (hall2007characterization).

Overall, DEFB123 is an integral component of the immune system, providing both direct antimicrobial action and regulatory functions in inflammation, thereby contributing to the organism's overall defense strategy.

## Clinical Significance
The DEFB123 gene has been studied for its potential role in disease susceptibility and resistance, particularly in the context of digital dermatitis in livestock. Research on Italian buffaloes has identified two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DEFB123 gene, specifically 108GT and 356CT, which result in amino acid substitutions Q36H and P119L. These genetic variations have been associated with the animals' susceptibility or resistance to digital dermatitis, suggesting a link between DEFB123 polymorphisms and disease resistance (Ateya2023New).

In humans, DEFB123 is part of the beta-defensin family, which plays a role in antimicrobial defense and is expressed in the reproductive tract. Alterations in DEFB123 expression have been linked to reproductive health, as beta-defensins are involved in sperm maturation and host defense. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with DEFB123 mutations or expression changes in humans have not been conclusively identified (Zheng2021A).

The gene has also been implicated in lipid metabolism, with significant SNP associations observed in studies examining lipoprotein traits. These findings suggest a potential role for DEFB123 in metabolic processes, although direct links to specific diseases remain to be fully elucidated (Kraja2012Genetic).
