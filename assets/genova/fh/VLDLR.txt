# VLDLR

## Overview
The VLDLR gene encodes the very low-density lipoprotein receptor, a transmembrane receptor that is part of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. This receptor is integral to lipid metabolism and neuronal development, functioning primarily in the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and in mediating neuronal migration through its interaction with the extracellular matrix protein Reelin. The VLDLR protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, an epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain, and a cytoplasmic domain essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it plays a crucial role in the proper positioning of neurons during development. Mutations in the VLDLR gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Dysequilibrium Syndrome and VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia, underscoring its importance in both metabolic and neurological processes (Reddy2011Similarities; Nimpf1998The; Moheb2007Identification).

## Structure
The VLDLR protein is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of several key domains, including an N-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) with eight cysteine-rich LDL receptor type A repeats, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) precursor homology domain, an O-linked sugar domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain containing the NPXY motif crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Reddy2011Similarities; Nimpf1998The; Dlugosz2018The).

The primary structure of VLDLR is composed of 873 amino acids, with a high degree of conservation across species, showing 97% identity between mouse and human (Reddy2011Similarities). The secondary structure includes cysteine-rich repeats and β-propeller domains within the EGF module (Clark2021VLDLR). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate interactions with ligands such as apolipoprotein E and Reelin, which are important for lipid metabolism and neuronal signaling (Dlugosz2018The).

VLDLR undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms that may lack specific domains, such as the O-linked sugar domain encoded by exon 16 (Reddy2011Similarities). These splice variants contribute to the functional diversity of the receptor in different tissues. The protein is less glycosylated compared to other family members, which affects its processing and maturation (Nimpf1998The).

## Function
The VLDLR gene encodes the very low-density lipoprotein receptor, which is a crucial component in lipid metabolism and neuronal development. In lipid metabolism, VLDLR functions as a peripheral lipoprotein receptor, facilitating the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and chylomicrons into cells. This process is essential for the regulation of lipid levels in the bloodstream and the delivery of fatty acids to tissues like the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where it supports energy homeostasis (Tacken2001Living; Takahashi2004The).

In the brain, VLDLR plays a significant role in neuronal migration during development. It acts as a receptor for Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein, which is crucial for the proper positioning of neurons. The interaction between VLDLR and Reelin leads to the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Dab1, activating signaling pathways that ensure correct neuronal alignment and cortical layer formation (Reddy2011Similarities). VLDLR is primarily expressed in the intermediate zone and cortical plate, areas critical for neuronal migration (Reddy2011Similarities). Mutations in the VLDLR gene can result in neuronal migration defects, highlighting its importance in brain development (Reddy2011Similarities).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VLDLR gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily Dysequilibrium Syndrome (DES) and VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia. DES is characterized by non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, delayed ambulation, and cerebellar hypoplasia. It results from recessive loss-of-function mutations in the VLDLR gene, which disrupt the reelin signaling pathway crucial for neuronal migration in the brain (Türkmen2008Cerebellar; Moheb2007Identification). 

Specific mutations, such as homozygous nonsense mutations and missense mutations, have been identified in various populations, including Iranian, Turkish, and Omani families. These mutations lead to symptoms like quadrupedal locomotion, dysarthric speech, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Ozcelik2008Mutations; Ali2012A). In the Hutterite population, a large deletion encompassing the VLDLR gene causes a similar syndrome with cerebellar hypoplasia and cerebral gyral simplification (Boycott2005Homozygous).

Alterations in VLDLR expression levels can also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. A homozygous nonsense variant in exon 4 of VLDLR leads to reduced mRNA levels and is associated with developmental delays and intellectual disabilities, although without typical cerebellar hypoplasia features (Holling2024A). These findings underscore the critical role of VLDLR in brain development and its involvement in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
The very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) is involved in various interactions with proteins and plays a significant role in several biological processes. VLDLR interacts with fibrin, a key player in transendothelial migration of leukocytes and inflammation. This interaction is mediated by the cysteine-rich (CR) domains 2-4 of VLDLR, which bind to the fibrin βN-domains. The interaction is crucial for fibrin-dependent inflammation, and inhibiting it with specific anti-VLDLR monoclonal antibodies can reduce leukocyte transmigration (Gruschus2021Structural; Banerjee2018Nuclear).

The VLDLR also forms a complex with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is enhanced by the adaptor protein FE65. This complex affects the trafficking and processing of both VLDLR and APP, potentially influencing neuronal migration, learning, and memory (Dumanis2012FE65).

Additionally, VLDLR interacts with several other ligands, including reelin, RAP, thrombospondin-1, hepatitis C virus, human rhinovirus HRV2, and proteinase-serpin complexes. These interactions highlight the multifunctional nature of VLDLR in various signaling pathways and cellular processes (Banerjee2018Nuclear).
