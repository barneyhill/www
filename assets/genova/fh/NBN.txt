# NBN

## Overview
The NBN gene encodes the protein nibrin, a critical component of the MRN complex, which also includes MRE11 and RAD50. This complex plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby maintaining genomic stability. Nibrin is categorized as a DNA repair protein and is essential for the proper functioning of the MRN complex, facilitating its nuclear localization and interaction with key proteins such as ATM kinase. These interactions are crucial for the activation of DNA repair pathways. Mutations in the NBN gene are linked to Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), a disorder characterized by chromosomal instability and increased cancer susceptibility. The gene's involvement in DNA repair underscores its significance in cellular processes that prevent genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Cilli2014Identification; DesaiMehta2001Distinct; Berardinelli2013NBN).

## Structure
The NBN gene encodes the nibrin protein, which is a crucial component of the MRN complex involved in DNA double-strand break repair. Nibrin consists of 754 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 85 kDa (Cilli2014Identification; Otahalova2023Importance). The protein is structured into three main regions. The N-terminal region contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and two BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) tandem domains, which are essential for binding phosphorylated proteins involved in DNA repair processes (Cilli2014Identification; Mendez2012Cleavage). The central region includes phosphorylation sites at Ser278 and Ser343, which are targeted by ATM kinase in response to DNA damage (Cilli2014Identification). The C-terminal region contains two MRE11-binding motifs and an ATM-binding motif, facilitating interactions within the MRN complex (Cilli2014Identification; DesaiMehta2001Distinct).

The NBN protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are critical for its role in the DNA damage response (Mendez2012Cleavage). The 657del5 mutation in the NBN gene results in the production of two truncated proteins, p26 and p70, which retain some functional domains but affect the protein's overall activity in DNA repair (Cilli2014Identification; Otahalova2023Importance). These structural features and modifications underscore nibrin's role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in various cellular processes related to DNA repair.

## Function
The NBN gene encodes the protein nibrin, which is a critical component of the MRN complex, consisting of MRE11, RAD50, and NBN. This complex plays a vital role in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Cilli2014Identification; DesaiMehta2001Distinct). Nibrin is essential for the nuclear localization of the MRN complex, as it contains nuclear-localizing signals that facilitate the translocation of the entire complex to the nucleus, where it participates in DNA repair processes (DesaiMehta2001Distinct; Fiévet2019DNA).

Nibrin interacts with the ATM protein, a key player in the DNA damage response, to facilitate its recruitment and activation at sites of DNA damage. This interaction is crucial for the proper phosphorylation of ATM and the subsequent activation of downstream DNA repair pathways (Cilli2014Identification; Wen2012NBN). The phosphorylation of nibrin by ATM is important for the accumulation of the MRN complex at DSBs, highlighting a feedback loop that enhances DNA repair efficiency (Wen2012NBN).

In healthy human cells, nibrin's role in maintaining genomic stability is underscored by its involvement in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, ensuring effective cellular responses to DNA damage and preventing chromosomal instability (Cilli2014Identification; Demuth2004An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NBN gene, which encodes the protein nibrin, are associated with Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS), an autosomal recessive disorder. NBS is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, chromosomal instability, and a heightened susceptibility to cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphoid malignancies (Otahalova2023Importance; Belhadj2022NBN; Berardinelli2013NBN). The most common mutation linked to NBS is a five base pair deletion in exon 6 (657del5), prevalent in Central and Eastern European populations (Otahalova2023Importance; Berardinelli2013NBN).

Heterozygous carriers of NBN mutations, such as 657del5, may also have an increased risk of developing various cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, although the evidence is mixed (Otahalova2023Importance; Belhadj2022NBN; Berardinelli2013NBN). The NBN 924 T>C variant has been specifically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (UZUNOGLU2016Association). Additionally, the NBN gene's role in DNA repair suggests that its mutations can lead to defects in the DNA damage response, contributing to genomic instability and cancer susceptibility (Belhadj2022NBN).

## Interactions
The NBN protein, also known as nibrin, is a crucial component of the MRN complex, which includes MRE11 and RAD50. This complex is essential for the detection and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Cilli2014Identification; Kim2019Nbn−Mre11). NBN interacts with several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response, including ATM kinase, which it helps activate. This interaction is vital for the phosphorylation of various proteins involved in DNA repair (Otahalova2023Importance).

NBN also interacts with BRCA1, influencing DNA damage response pathways. The interaction with SMC1 is BRCA1-dependent and is essential for the phosphorylation of SMC1 and BRCA1 following ionizing radiation treatment (Cilli2014Identification). Additionally, NBN interacts with SP100 through its BRCT tandem domains, facilitating co-localization within promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, which is important for genomic stability and telomere length maintenance (Cilli2014Identification).

The NBN protein's interaction with MRE11 is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and tumor suppression. In cases where this interaction is impaired, such as in the Nbn mid8 mutant allele, genomic instability and increased DNA damage are observed (Kim2019Nbn−Mre11). These interactions highlight the essential role of NBN in DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability.
