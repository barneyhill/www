# BRCA2

## Overview
BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Protein) is a gene located on chromosome 13 in humans, encoding a protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability. The BRCA2 protein is primarily involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination, a critical process for accurate DNA repair and cell survival. As a DNA repair-associated protein, BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 recombinase, facilitating the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments necessary for the homology search and strand invasion steps of DNA repair. The protein's structure includes multiple BRC repeats and a DNA-binding domain, which are essential for its function in DNA repair and replication fork protection. Mutations in the BRCA2 gene are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers, highlighting its importance in cancer predisposition and the potential for targeted therapies (StoppaLyonnet2016The; FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2).

## Structure
The BRCA2 protein is a large molecule composed of 3,418 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 384 kDa (Esashi2005CDKdependent; Shahid2014Structure). Its structure includes both ordered and disordered regions, contributing to its functional versatility. The protein contains a well-characterized DNA-binding domain (DBD) of 700 residues, which interacts with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the small acidic protein DSS1 (Julien2021Intrinsic). The DBD is modeled based on homologous structures in mouse and rat proteins and includes oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds (Shahid2014Structure).

BRCA2 features eight BRC repeats, which are crucial for binding the RAD51 recombinase, facilitating homologous recombination (Julien2021Intrinsic; Shahid2014Structure). The protein's C-terminal region also interacts with RAD51 and contains a phosphorylation site at serine 3291, which is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Esashi2005CDKdependent). This phosphorylation modulates the interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51, acting as a molecular switch during DNA repair processes.

BRCA2 exists as a dimer, with each monomer capable of binding multiple RAD51 molecules, forming a complex essential for DNA repair (Shahid2014Structure). The protein's structural flexibility, due to its intrinsically disordered regions, allows it to interact with various partners, including PALB2, and adapt to different functional states (Sidhu2020Conformational; Julien2021Intrinsic).

## Function
BRCA2 is a critical component of the DNA repair machinery in healthy human cells, primarily involved in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) through homologous recombination (HR). It facilitates the formation of RAD51 filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which are essential for the homology search and strand invasion steps of HR-mediated DSB repair (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2; O’Donovan2010BRCA1). BRCA2 interacts with RAD51 via its BRC repeats and C-terminal TR2 domain, stabilizing RAD51 nucleofilaments and ensuring efficient DNA repair (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2).

BRCA2 also plays a role in replication fork stabilization, protecting stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation by stabilizing RAD51 filaments (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2). This function is crucial for maintaining genomic stability during replication stress (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2). Additionally, BRCA2 is involved in the repair of interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and is part of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, collaborating with other proteins to facilitate repair through HR and translesion synthesis (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2).

BRCA2's activity is primarily nuclear, where it interacts with various proteins, including PALB2 and FANCD2, to execute its roles in DNA repair and replication fork protection (FradetTurcotte2016BRCA2). Its functions are vital for preventing genomic instability and potential tumorigenesis (Moynahan2001BRCA2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRCA2 gene are significant risk factors for breast and ovarian cancers. Individuals with germline pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 have a mean cumulative breast cancer risk of 49% by age 70 and an ovarian cancer risk of 18% (StoppaLyonnet2016The). BRCA2 mutations are also associated with male breast cancer, with a high mutation frequency observed in affected individuals (Lang2017The). These mutations can lead to increased aneuploidy, genome alterations, and microsatellite instability, contributing to advanced neoplasm stages and metastasis in breast cancer (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome).

In ovarian cancer, BRCA2 mutations are linked to enhanced immune responses and chromatin silencing, affecting disease progression and treatment outcomes (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). The presence of BRCA2 mutations in tumors can influence treatment strategies, as these tumors may respond to targeted therapies like poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which exploit the concept of synthetic lethality (StoppaLyonnet2016The).

BRCA2 mutations also play a role in other cancers, including prostate and pancreatic cancers, although the risk is lower compared to breast and ovarian cancers (Spurdle2011ENIGMAEvidencebased). The identification of BRCA2 mutations is crucial for risk assessment, early diagnosis, and personalized treatment strategies.

## Interactions
BRCA2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in DNA repair processes. It physically interacts with RAD51, a recombinase essential for homologous recombination (HR), through BRC repeat motifs and a C-terminal domain, facilitating RAD51's localization to DNA damage sites (Thorslund2007Interactions; Martinez2015Molding). BRCA2 also binds to the meiosis-specific recombinase DMC1, coordinating activities during meiotic recombination (Thorslund2007Interactions).

BRCA2 forms a complex with PALB2, which is essential for RAD51-mediated D-loop formation, a critical step in HR. This interaction links BRCA2 to BRCA1, forming a complex involved in breast cancer predisposition (Martinez2015Molding). BRCA2 also interacts with DSS1, which enhances its stability and promotes the loading of BRCA2-RAD51 onto RPA-coated ssDNA (Martinez2015Molding).

BRCA2's interaction with replication protein A (RPA) is crucial for DNA repair, and mutations like Y42C can compromise this interaction (Wong2003Interaction). It also interacts with FANCD2, a protein involved in the Fanconi anemia pathway, which is important for DNA repair via HR (Hussain2004Direct). These interactions highlight BRCA2's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability.
