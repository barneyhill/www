# SLC5A4

## Overview
The SLC5A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 5 member 4 (SGLT3), which is a member of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. Unlike other proteins in this family, SGLT3 functions primarily as a glucose sensor rather than a transporter. It is characterized as a glucose-gated ion channel that modulates membrane potential in response to glucose, a function that is sodium-dependent and sensitive to the inhibitor phlorizin (Wright2013Glucose; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). SGLT3 is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, liver, kidneys, skeletal muscle, and cholinergic neurons, where it plays a role in sensing glucose levels and potentially influencing physiological processes such as intestinal motility and muscle activity (Wright2013Glucose; SabinoSilva2010The). Despite its unique role, the full physiological implications of SGLT3's function in humans are still being explored (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

## Structure
The SLC5A4 gene encodes the SGLT3 protein, which is part of the sodium/glucose cotransporter family. Unlike other members of the SLC5 family, SGLT3 does not function as a traditional glucose transporter but acts as a glucose sensor. It is expressed in various tissues, including the intestine, spleen, liver, kidneys, skeletal muscle, and cholinergic neurons (Wright2013Glucose; SabinoSilva2010The).

The primary structure of SGLT3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The protein is characterized by 14 transmembrane helices, a common feature among SLC5 family members, although specific structural details for SGLT3 are not fully elucidated (Wright2013Glucose). The secondary structure likely includes these transmembrane helices, contributing to its function as a glucose sensor.

SGLT3's tertiary structure involves its 3D conformation, which allows it to function as a glucose-gated ion channel. This structure is Na+-dependent and phlorizin-sensitive, causing depolarization of the plasma membrane (Wright2013Glucose; Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). The protein does not transport glucose but instead modulates membrane potential in response to glucose, indicating a unique functional role compared to other SGLTs (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). There is no information on the quaternary structure or post-translational modifications specific to SGLT3.

## Function
The SLC5A4 gene encodes the SGLT3 protein, which functions as a glucose-gated ion channel rather than a traditional sodium/glucose cotransporter. In humans, SGLT3 is primarily expressed in cholinergic neurons of the enteric nervous system and at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle. It acts as a glucose sensor, modulating the membrane potential in response to changes in glucose levels. This activity is sodium-dependent and sensitive to phlorizin, a known inhibitor of sodium/glucose cotransporters (Wright2013Glucose; SabinoSilva2010The).

SGLT3 does not transport glucose but induces depolarization of the plasma membrane in a saturable manner when glucose is present. This depolarization is reversible and inhibited by phlorizin, indicating a specific interaction with glucose and sodium ions (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled). The protein's role as a glucose sensor suggests it may influence intestinal motility and skeletal muscle activity, although its precise physiological functions in humans remain under investigation (Gyimesi2020Sodium-coupled).

In the kidney, SGLT3 is expressed in the proximal tubule, where it may contribute to sodium reabsorption, although its exact role in renal physiology is not fully understood (Sędzikowska2021Human).
