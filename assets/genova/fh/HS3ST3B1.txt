# HS3ST3B1

## Overview
HS3ST3B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1, which is a sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex carbohydrate that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. The enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to glucosamine residues within HS chains, a modification essential for the interaction of HS with protein ligands such as growth factors and cytokines (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified; Kreuger2012Heparan). This enzymatic activity is significant in modulating growth factor signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b), thereby influencing cell proliferation and gene expression (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). HS3ST3B1 is expressed in various tissues, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes and potential redundancy with other HS3ST family members (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). Additionally, alterations in HS3ST3B1 expression have been linked to pathological conditions, including cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2019Long).

## Structure
HS3ST3B1 encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a complex carbohydrate. The primary structure of the HS3ST3B1 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. The secondary structure of the protein may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This folding allows the protein to form specific domains, such as sulfotransferase domains, which are essential for its role in transferring sulfate groups to heparan sulfate.

The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions with other molecules. These modifications can play a role in regulating the enzyme's function and its involvement in various biological processes. Additionally, HS3ST3B1 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, resulting in protein forms with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms may have variations in their structure that influence their specific roles in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and other cellular activities. The quaternary structure, if present, would involve the assembly of multiple subunits, but specific details are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HS3ST3B1 encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex carbohydrate involved in various biological processes. This enzyme specifically catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to glucosamine residues within HS chains, a modification that is essential for the interaction of HS with protein ligands such as growth factors and cytokines (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified; Kreuger2012Heparan).

In healthy human cells, HS3ST3B1 is involved in fine-tuning growth factor signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b). The 3-O-sulfated HS produced by HS3ST3B1 enhances the stability of the FGF10/FGFR2b complex, promoting downstream signaling pathways like MAPK, which are crucial for cell proliferation and gene expression (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). This modification is significant in the expansion of progenitor cells, such as KIT+ epithelial progenitors, which are important for organ development and regeneration (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

The enzyme's activity is not limited to a single tissue type; HS3ST3B1 is expressed in various tissues, suggesting its involvement in multiple physiological processes and potential redundancy with other HS3ST family members (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HS3ST3B1 gene have been implicated in the progression of bladder cancer. The gene is upregulated in bladder cancer tissues, and its increased expression is associated with maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype, promoting cancer cell proliferation, and enhancing angiogenesis. This upregulation is linked to decreased overall survival in bladder cancer patients, suggesting a poor prognosis (Li2019Long). The long non-coding RNA DLEU1 promotes bladder cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cisplatin by upregulating HS3ST3B1 expression through the miR-99b/HS3ST3B1 axis (Li2019Long).

In addition to bladder cancer, HS3ST3B1 is involved in the reprogramming of epiblast stem cells. Knockout of HS3ST3B1 in these cells enhances their reprogramming efficiency, indicating its role as a modulator in stem cell biology (Gao2021Highthroughput). The gene's expression is also crucial for the proliferation of progenitor cells during organ development, and its dysregulation could potentially impact cellular proliferation and morphogenesis (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).
