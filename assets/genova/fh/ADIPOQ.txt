# ADIPOQ

## Overview
The ADIPOQ gene encodes adiponectin, a protein hormone predominantly secreted by adipose tissue, which plays a significant role in metabolic regulation. Adiponectin is categorized as a collagen-like protein due to its structural domains, including a collagenous domain and a C1q-like globular domain. This protein is involved in enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, primarily through its interactions with specific receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. These interactions activate pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which are crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-atherogenic effects. The protein circulates in the bloodstream in various multimeric forms, with the high-molecular-weight (HMW) form being the most biologically active. Genetic variations and mutations in the ADIPOQ gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and obesity, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic health (Waki2003Impaired; Galic2010Adipose; Peters2013A).

## Structure
Adiponectin, encoded by the ADIPOQ gene, is a protein primarily expressed in white adipose tissue. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a variable domain, a collagenous domain with 22 G-X-Y repeats, and a C-terminal C1q-like globular domain, comprising a total of 244 amino acids (Heiker2010Molecular). The secondary structure of the globular domain is characterized by a ten-beta-strand jellyroll folding topology, typical of the C1q family (Heiker2010Molecular). 

In terms of tertiary structure, adiponectin forms a bell-shaped homotrimer, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions that facilitate monomer-monomer contacts (Heiker2010Molecular). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of these homotrimers into higher-order oligomeric isoforms, including trimers, hexamers, and high molecular weight (HMW) multimers. Disulfide bonds between homotrimers are crucial for forming hexamers and HMW multimers (Heiker2010Molecular).

Adiponectin undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysine residues, which are essential for its stability and multimerization. These modifications, particularly in the collagenous domain, are vital for the formation of HMW adiponectin (Heiker2010Molecular).

## Function
The ADIPOQ gene encodes adiponectin, a protein hormone secreted exclusively by adipose tissue. Adiponectin plays a crucial role in enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. It circulates in the bloodstream in various multimeric forms, with the high-molecular-weight (HMW) form being the most biologically active (Galic2010Adipose). In muscle cells, adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reducing mTOR/S6 kinase activity, and decreasing inhibitory serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1. This activation leads to increased fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (Galic2010Adipose).

Adiponectin also suppresses hepatic glucose output through AMPK activation and regulates energy expenditure and appetite via interactions in the hypothalamus (Galic2010Adipose). The protein's secretion is regulated by endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins ERp44 and Ero1-Lα, which control its retention and release (Galic2010Adipose). Adiponectin's effects are mediated through its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which are involved in AMPK activation and PPARα gene expression regulation, respectively (Galic2010Adipose). These molecular activities contribute to its anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and anti-atherogenic properties, impacting overall metabolic health (Peters2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADIPOQ gene, which encodes the hormone adiponectin, are associated with several metabolic disorders. Mutations such as G84R, G90S, R112C, and I164T are linked to hypoadiponectinemia and type 2 diabetes due to impaired multimerization and secretion of adiponectin. These mutations hinder the formation of high molecular weight (HMW) multimers, crucial for adiponectin's function, leading to reduced serum levels and contributing to the diabetic phenotype (Waki2003Impaired).

The p.M40K mutation in ADIPOQ is associated with early-onset obesity and metabolic syndrome. This mutation impairs the assembly of HMW adiponectin, resulting in a significant reduction in the serum HMW to total adiponectin ratio. Affected individuals exhibit severe cardiometabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes (Bueno2014A).

Common variants in the ADIPOQ gene, such as SNP rs17366743, are associated with increased risk of diabetes and higher glucose levels over time. These genetic variations influence plasma adiponectin levels and are linked to type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits (Hivert2008Common). Genetic variations in ADIPOQ can also affect serum adiponectin levels, influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (Peters2013A).

## Interactions
The ADIPOQ gene encodes adiponectin, a protein that participates in several significant protein-protein interactions. Adiponectin interacts directly with its receptors, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, which are crucial for mediating its metabolic effects, including the activation of AMPK and PPAR-alpha activities, influencing fatty-acid oxidation and glucose uptake (Bayram2020A; Bag2014Revealing). These interactions are supported by various protein interaction databases and coexpression data, highlighting the strong functional association between ADIPOQ and these receptors (Bag2014Revealing).

Adiponectin also interacts with CDH13, a protein associated with lung cancer and acting as a signaling receptor for adiponectin, further emphasizing its role in cellular signaling pathways (Bag2014Revealing). The interactions between ADIPOQ, ADIPOR2, and CDH13 are documented in the HRPD database, indicating a binary interaction pattern (Bag2014Revealing).

In addition to these direct interactions, adiponectin is involved in a complex network with other proteins such as FABP4, PRKAA2, and PRKAR2B, which are part of pathways like the PPAR signaling pathway (Bag2014Revealing). These interactions highlight adiponectin's role in regulating energy homeostasis and its potential implications in various metabolic and inflammatory processes.
