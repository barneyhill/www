# AIF1L

## Overview
The AIF1L gene encodes the allograft inflammatory factor 1 like protein, which is a member of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actomyosin contractility and cytoskeletal organization, particularly in human podocytes, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cell morphology and stability. AIF1L interacts with various components of the actomyosin machinery, including myosin chaperones and regulatory light chains, to modulate actin filament dynamics and prevent excessive filopodia formation. The protein's structure, characterized by a calcium-binding EF-hand domain, facilitates its function in actin bundling and interaction with filamentous actin. Clinically, alterations in AIF1L expression have been associated with several diseases, including breast cancer and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its downregulation is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor invasiveness (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L; Unknownauthors2022AprognosticindexmodelforassessingtheprognosisofccRCCpatientsbyusingthemRNAexpressionprofilesofAIF1L; Liu2018Absence).

## Structure
The AIF1L protein is characterized by the presence of a calcium-binding EF-hand domain, a helix-loop-helix structural motif capable of binding calcium ions (Parikh2020Allograft; YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L). This domain is a common feature in proteins involved in calcium signaling and is crucial for the protein's function in actin filament binding (Zhao2017Functional). The protein is composed mainly of α-helices and random coils, with a smaller proportion of extended strands (Zhao2017Functional). 

The predicted molecular weight of AIF1L is approximately 17 kDa, and it consists of 150 amino acids (Parikh2020Allograft; Liu2018Absence). The tertiary structure of AIF1L is conserved and similar to that of AIF1, with both proteins exhibiting indistinguishable F-actin bundling activity in vitro (Parikh2020Allograft). AIF1L does not have a transmembrane domain or signal peptide, but there is a probability of a mitochondrial transit peptide (Zhao2017Functional). 

The protein's structure allows it to interact with actin filaments, and it is involved in actin-bundling activity and co-sedimentation with filamentous actin (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The AIF1L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating actomyosin contractility and filopodial extensions in human podocytes, which are specialized cells in the kidney. AIF1L is highly expressed in podocytes and localizes to actin stress fibers, focal adhesions, and, to a lesser extent, the nuclear compartment. It interacts with components of the actomyosin machinery, such as the myosin chaperone UNC45 and the regulatory light chain of the non-muscle myosin-II complex MYL9, to maintain proper actomyosin contractility and cell morphology (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L).

The presence of AIF1L is necessary to prevent excessive filopodia formation and maintain podocyte membrane stability, which is crucial for preserving the morphology of podocyte foot processes (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L). AIF1L also plays a role in actin bundling and cytoskeletal organization, influencing the generation and persistence of filopodia, which are important for cell movement and interaction with the environment (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L). The protein's activity in these processes is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of podocytes, which are critical for kidney function (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AIF1L gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, AIF1L expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. This downregulation is associated with hypermethylation of the AIF1L gene promoters and is linked to poorer disease-specific survival. The absence of AIF1L contributes to increased cell migration and invasion, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer (Liu2018Absence).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), AIF1L expression is also significantly reduced in tumor samples compared to normal kidney tissues. Lower expression levels of AIF1L correlate with advanced tumor stages and worse patient survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker for ccRCC. A prognostic index model incorporating AIF1L expression has shown moderate performance in predicting patient outcomes, highlighting its clinical significance in guiding treatment decisions (Unknownauthors2022AprognosticindexmodelforassessingtheprognosisofccRCCpatientsbyusingthemRNAexpressionprofilesofAIF1L).

In human podocytes, AIF1L is involved in regulating actomyosin contractility and filopodial extensions. Its loss leads to increased filopodia formation and altered membrane dynamics, which could impact podocyte function and contribute to kidney diseases (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L).

## Interactions
AIF1L (allograft inflammatory factor 1 like) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for maintaining cellular functions, particularly in human podocytes. AIF1L interacts with components of the actomyosin machinery, including the myosin chaperone UNC45 and the regulatory light chain of the non-muscle myosin-II complex, MYL9. These interactions are essential for stabilizing the leading edge of cells and maintaining actomyosin contractility (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L). AIF1L is also associated with various members of the non-muscle myosin-II complex, such as MYH14, MYH9, MYL6, and MYL12a, as identified through SILAC-based interaction proteomics (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L).

In addition to its role in actomyosin interactions, AIF1L is known to bind actin filaments, which is significant for its function in cytoskeletal organization. This actin-binding capability is supported by the presence of a calcium-binding EF-hand domain, which is a characteristic feature of AIF1L (Zhao2017Functional). The protein's interactions with actin and myosin components suggest its involvement in regulating cell morphology and dynamics, particularly in preventing excessive filopodia formation and maintaining podocyte structure (YasudaYamahara2018AIF1L).
