# ZNF843

## Overview
ZNF843 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 843, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of zinc finger protein 843 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several biological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression, osteoarthritis, and endometriosis. The gene's expression and potential regulatory roles suggest its involvement in complex cellular pathways, making it a subject of interest in genomic and proteomic studies (Li2024Metalloproteins; Barjaste2019Genomewide; Kim2023Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF843 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma, ZNF843 is significantly upregulated in patients with brain metastasis, suggesting a potential role in the progression or development of brain metastasis in lung cancer (Kim2023Clinical). The gene is also part of a 22-gene signature that can distinguish between brain metastasis and control patients in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, indicating its potential as a biomarker for brain metastasis (Kamer2020Predicting).

In osteoarthritis, ZNF843 has been identified as having a significant causal association with the disease, as demonstrated by a multivariate Mendelian randomization analysis. This suggests that ZNF843 may contribute to the development or progression of osteoarthritis (Li2024Metalloproteins).

In endometriosis, ZNF843 is one of the most hypomethylated genes in ectopic versus eutopic endometrial tissues, which may influence gene expression changes associated with the disease (Barjaste2019Genomewide).

ZNF843 has also been identified in the proteomic profile of human sera as having high expression in control groups compared to those with pulmonary cystic echinococcosis, although its specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Sadjjadi2023Proteomics).
