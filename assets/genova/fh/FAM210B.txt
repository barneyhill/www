# FAM210B

## Overview
FAM210B is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, known as family with sequence similarity 210 member B. This protein is integral to several cellular processes, particularly in mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis, which are essential for erythrocyte differentiation and hemoglobin production. FAM210B is categorized as a mitochondrial protein and functions as a scaffold, interacting with various mitochondrial components to regulate energy metabolism and maintain mitochondrial integrity. It is involved in key signaling pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, which are vital for cellular growth and survival. The protein's role is especially significant during early development, influencing iron metabolism and erythropoiesis. Clinically, alterations in FAM210B expression have been linked to diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and certain cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression levels are also associated with opioid dependence, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Perfetto2023FAM210B; Schwarzer2022Targeting; Xu2024Deletion; Wang2024Wholeexome).

## Structure


## Function
FAM210B encodes a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis, particularly in erythroid cells, facilitating the incorporation of iron into heme, which is crucial for hemoglobin production (Perfetto2023FAM210B). FAM210B is also implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, interacting with multiple subunits of mitochondrial ATP synthetase to promote erythrocyte differentiation and development (Xu2024Deletion). 

In terms of cellular metabolism, FAM210B is associated with the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for promoting metabolic processes, cell growth, and survival (Zhou2023Loss). The protein's activity is context-specific, with its role in iron metabolism and erythropoiesis being more critical during early development rather than in adult organisms (Perfetto2023FAM210B). 

FAM210B is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, influencing cellular energy production and metabolic processes. It acts as a scaffold protein for other mitochondrial membrane or matrix proteins, potentially controlling broader cellular metabolism unrelated to heme biosynthesis (Schwarzer2022Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FAM210B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and certain cancers. In the context of SLE, FAM210B is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a contributing factor to the disease's pathogenesis. Studies have shown that FAM210B knockout mice develop lupus-like symptoms, including skin ulcerations, splenomegaly, and increased levels of autoantibodies such as ANA and anti-dsDNA IgG. These symptoms are linked to the gene's role in erythrocyte differentiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, which can activate immune responses and lead to autoimmunity (Xu2024Deletion).

In cancer, FAM210B has been identified as a tumor suppressor. Its expression levels inversely correlate with the sensitivity of certain cancer cell lines to pharmacological treatments. Low levels of FAM210B are associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as renal, cervical, and lung cancers. The gene's role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism suggests that its reduced expression may contribute to increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and an aggressive tumor phenotype (Schwarzer2022Targeting).

Additionally, FAM210B has been linked to opioid dependence through genetic variation analysis, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Wang2024Wholeexome).

## Interactions
FAM210B is a mitochondrial protein that participates in various interactions influencing cellular processes. It interacts with protoporphyrinogen oxidase, promoting the formation of the mitochondrial iron transport complex, which is crucial for terminal erythrocyte differentiation and mitochondrial iron input (Xu2024Deletion). FAM210B also interacts with multiple subunits of mitochondrial ATP synthetase, including the α and β subunits, to regulate erythrocyte differentiation and enhance mitochondrial energy metabolism (Xu2024Deletion).

In the context of B-cell lymphomas, FAM210B acts upstream of the mitochondrial protease OMA1, inhibiting the cleavage of OPA1, a process induced by compounds BTM-3528 and BTM-3566. This interaction suggests that FAM210B plays a role in suppressing the activity of these compounds by affecting mitochondrial dynamics (Schwarzer2022Targeting). FAM210B expression also robustly suppresses ATF4 induction by BTM-3566, indicating a unique mechanism of action in cellular stress responses (Schwarzer2022Targeting).

FAM210B is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes genes involved in mitochondrial functions, such as cytochrome complex assembly and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly, suggesting its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Li2023Decoding).
