# STRADB

## Overview
The STRADB gene encodes the protein STE20 related adaptor beta, a pseudokinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. Unlike typical kinases, STRADB lacks catalytic activity but is essential for its regulatory functions, particularly in the AMPK signaling pathway. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with the serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1/STK11) and the scaffold protein MO25/CAB39, which is crucial for the allosteric regulation of LKB1's kinase activity. This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism, growth, and polarity, by promoting an active conformation of LKB1 (Jacobsen2017The). STRADB's role as an allosteric modulator highlights its importance in assembling signaling complexes and influencing kinase activity, despite its non-catalytic nature (Jacobsen2017The).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STRADB gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of hereditary breast cancer, a missense variant in STRADB with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.0001 was identified, suggesting it could be a candidate for further investigation in breast cancer predisposition (Liu2022WholeExome). However, the study did not provide detailed functional analysis or clinical significance of STRADB mutations beyond this association (Liu2022WholeExome).

In neurological disorders, STRADB is localized in a chromosomal region associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), indicating a potential role in neurodegeneration and other central nervous system pathologies. The specific functions and clinical significance of STRADB in these conditions require further investigation (Tseveleki2010Comparative).

STRADB has also been associated with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) risk. Its expression levels were linked to BCC susceptibility, although the study did not specifically discuss the clinical significance of STRADB gene mutations in other diseases (Adolphe2021Genetic). Additionally, STRADB was identified as a locus with genome-wide significance in both expression quantitative trait loci and DNA methylation analyses, suggesting regulatory mechanisms influencing BCC risk (Adolphe2021Genetic).

The gene's involvement in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, particularly through its downregulation following SHH activation, suggests a role in modulating this pathway, which is linked to various overgrowth disorders (Klein2019Mutations).

## Interactions
STRADB (STE20 related adaptor beta) is a pseudokinase that plays a significant role in cellular signaling through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to form a heterotrimeric complex with serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1/STK11) and the scaffold protein calcium-binding protein 39 (MO25/CAB39). This complex is crucial for the allosteric regulation of LKB1's kinase activity, which is a key regulator in the AMPK signaling pathway. The interactions within this complex involve the substrate-binding site and pseudoactivation loop of STRADB directly associating with the LKB1 kinase domain, promoting an active conformation of LKB1 (Jacobsen2017The).

STRADB, along with its counterpart STRADA, acts as an allosteric modulator, influencing the kinase activity of LKB1/STK11. The presence of MO25/CAB39 is essential in stabilizing the LKB1-STRADB complex, facilitating its regulatory functions in cellular metabolism, growth, and polarity (Jacobsen2017The). These interactions highlight the non-catalytic roles of STRADB in modulating kinase activity and assembling signaling complexes, underscoring its importance in cellular signaling pathways (Jacobsen2017The).
