# PHACTR3

## Overview
PHACTR3, or phosphatase and actin regulator 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. The protein, also known as scapinin, is characterized by its RPEL-repeat domain, which facilitates binding to monomeric actin, and a C-terminal PP1-binding domain, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Sagara2009Scapinin). PHACTR3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex, suggesting its significant role in neuronal development and synaptic function (Miyata2020Neuronenriched). The gene exhibits complex genomic organization with alternative splicing, contributing to diverse expression patterns (Worch2006Genomic). As a member of the Phactr family, PHACTR3 shares structural similarities with other family members, facilitating interactions with PP1 and actin, which are essential for its role in cellular morphology and motility (Allen2004Phactrs; Wiezlak2012Gactin).

## Structure
The PHACTR3 protein, also known as scapinin, is characterized by specific domains that play crucial roles in its function. It contains a C-terminal protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding domain and an RPEL-repeat domain, which consists of tandem repeats of three RPEL motifs. These motifs are essential for binding to actin and are highly conserved within the phactr/scapinin family (Sagara2009Scapinin). The RPEL-repeat domain is responsible for the interaction with monomeric actin, inhibiting actin polymerization and influencing cell morphology (Sagara2009Scapinin).

The PHACTR3 gene exhibits complex genomic organization with 16 exons and alternative splicing, leading to different transcript variants. This alternative splicing involves four leader exons (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D) that splice onto exon 2, contributing to the diversity of its expression patterns (Worch2006Genomic). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, with high expression levels in regions such as the olfactory bulb, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Miyata2020Neuronenriched). The presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the leader exons suggests potential regulatory roles in its expression (Worch2006Genomic).

## Function
PHACTR3, also known as phosphatase and actin regulator 3, is involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. It contains RPEL motifs that bind G-actin, which are crucial for its role in actin dynamics and PP1 binding (Wiezlak2012Gactin). PHACTR3 interacts with both PP1 and actin, forming complexes that influence cellular morphology and motility (Allen2004Phactrs). The protein is diffusely expressed throughout the brain, with higher expression in the cortex and hippocampus, suggesting a role in neuronal development and synaptic function (Allen2004Phactrs).

In terms of cellular localization, PHACTR3 is found in the cytoplasm and is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with actin, indicating its involvement in actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Majdalani2023A). The protein's interaction with actin and PP1 suggests it may regulate PP1 activity and actin dynamics, although the specific mechanisms in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Wiezlak2012Gactin). The expression pattern and structural features of PHACTR3 imply it plays a significant role in growth control and differentiation, particularly in the brain (Worch2006Genomic).

## Interactions
PHACTR3, also known as phosphatase and actin regulator 3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It is known to bind with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a critical interaction for regulating dendritic morphology in neurons. This interaction is facilitated by a PP1-binding domain within PHACTR3, which is essential for its role in increasing dendritic complexity and altering spine morphology (Miyata2020Neuronenriched).

PHACTR3 also contains RPEL motifs, which are involved in actin binding. However, studies suggest that while PHACTR3 can bind actin, this interaction is not crucial for its effects on dendritic spine morphology, as mutants lacking actin-binding ability still exhibit similar effects to the wild type (Miyata2020Neuronenriched). The RPEL motifs overlap with the PP1-binding region, indicating a potential competitive interaction between actin and PP1 for binding to PHACTR3 (Wiezlak2012Gactin).

The protein is part of the Phactr family, which includes other members like Phactr1, Phactr2, and Phactr4, all of which share similar structural domains that facilitate interactions with PP1 and actin (Allen2004Phactrs; Wiezlak2012Gactin).
