# CLUH

## Overview
CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) is a gene that encodes a cytosolic RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. The CLUH protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial distribution and function by binding to mRNAs of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, thereby regulating their translation and stability. This regulation is crucial for cellular energy production and mitochondrial homeostasis, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation. CLUH's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in the co-translational import of mitochondrial proteins underscore its significance in cellular physiology. Alterations in CLUH expression or function are linked to various mitochondrial-related disorders, highlighting its clinical importance (Hémono2022The; Schatton2017CLUH; Gao2014CLUH).

## Function
CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) is a cytosolic RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis by regulating the translation and stability of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins. It binds to a subset of mRNAs for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, ensuring their proper translation and distribution within the cell (Schatton2017CLUH; Gao2014CLUH). CLUH is involved in maintaining mitochondrial distribution and function, preventing mitochondrial clustering and supporting cellular energy production (Hémono2022The; Gao2014CLUH).

In healthy human cells, CLUH is essential for the expression of mitochondrial proteins involved in central catabolic pathways necessary for energy conversion, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation (Schatton2017CLUH). It regulates the stability and translation of mRNAs, impacting liver physiology and enhancing mitochondrial respiratory capacity (Schatton2017CLUH). CLUH also interacts with cytosolic proteins that are precursors to mitochondrial proteins, suggesting its involvement in the co-translational import of these proteins into mitochondria (Hémono2022The).

The protein is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria-targeted pools, binding mRNAs of mitochondrial proteins and controlling their turnover and translation, which is vital for mitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival (Schatton2017CLUH; Gao2014CLUH).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CLUH gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in mitochondrial-related disorders. CLUH deficiency is associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies, secondary hyperammonemia, Leigh syndrome, and mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes. These conditions arise due to decreased steady-state levels of target mRNAs, leading to reduced protein abundance and depletion of crucial enzymes involved in energy-converting pathways, which severely impacts mitochondrial respiration and complex I activity (Schatton2017CLUH).

In Cluh -/- mice, neonatal mortality is linked to hypoglycemia caused by impaired catabolic pathways and the inability to convert amino acids into glucose, highlighting the gene's critical role in surviving postbirth starvation (Schatton2017CLUH). The absence of CLUH also results in mitochondrial clustering and respiratory deficiencies in tissues such as the liver, heart, and kidney (Schatton2017CLUH).

Alterations in CLUH expression can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and related cellular stress responses, as seen in conditions where mitophagy is impaired, resulting in the accumulation of p62 and ubiquitin in liver mitochondrial lysates (Pla‐Martín2020CLUH). The downregulation of CLUH, as influenced by Musashi-2 (MSI2), is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy, indicating its role in cardiac conditions (Singh2023Musashi2).

## Interactions
CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with mRNAs of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, playing a crucial role in their translation and stability. It forms specific ribonucleoprotein particles in primary hepatocytes, influencing the translational fate of target mRNAs such as Pcx, Hadha, and Hmgcs2 in response to nutrient availability (Pla‐Martín2020CLUH). CLUH also interacts with several proteins, notably SPAG5 and KNSTRN, in both human HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. These interactions are RNA-independent and require the TPR domain of CLUH, which is essential for its self-interaction and interaction with SPAG5 (Hémono2021CLUH; Hémono2022The).

CLUH's interaction with SPAG5 occurs in cytosolic granular structures, which are not stress granules, and is facilitated by the TPR domain. This domain is crucial for CLUH's association with mRNAs coding for mitochondrial proteins (Hémono2022The). CLUH also shows proximity to mitochondrial proteins during active translation, indicating a role in the subcellular localization of mRNAs coding for these proteins (Hémono2022The). The interactions between CLUH and SPAG5 do not depend on each other, as knocking down SPAG5 does not affect the efficiency of CLUH co-immunoprecipitation (Hémono2021CLUH).
