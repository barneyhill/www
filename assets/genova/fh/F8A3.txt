# F8A3

## Overview
F8A3 is a gene that encodes the protein coagulation factor VIII associated 3, which is involved in various biological processes, including coagulation and cellular interactions. The protein is categorized as a coagulation factor, playing a crucial role in the blood clotting cascade. F8A3 is located within the pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) of the X and Y chromosomes, which allows it to escape X-inactivation and be expressed in both sexes. This gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as neuroblastoma and Marfan syndrome, due to its differential expression patterns and interactions with other cellular pathways. Additionally, F8A3 exhibits variable expression across different populations, which may have implications for disease susceptibility and progression (Verhagen2021MultiOmics; Zhang2021Development; Singh2021African).

## Clinical Significance
F8A3, a gene associated with coagulation factor VIII, plays a role in various clinical conditions due to its expression levels and interactions. Alterations in F8A3 expression have been linked to neuroblastoma, a type of cancer. Higher levels of F8A3 are associated with lower survival rates in neuroblastoma patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2021Development). In Marfan syndrome, F8A3 is significantly downregulated, with a fold change of -7.1, suggesting its involvement in the molecular mechanisms underlying aortic disease in this condition (Verhagen2021MultiOmics).

F8A3 is also implicated in the differential expression patterns observed between African Americans and European Americans, with higher expression in African Americans. This differential expression may influence endosomal motility and autophagy, processes relevant to COVID-19 and other conditions (Singh2020Differential; Singh2021African). Additionally, the F8A3 gene is part of the pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) and may impact spermatogenesis, potentially leading to testicular maturation arrest, although specific details on its role are not fully elucidated (Halder2017Copy).
