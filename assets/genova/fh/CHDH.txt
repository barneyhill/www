# CHDH

## Overview
The CHDH gene encodes the enzyme choline dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial protein that plays a pivotal role in choline metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde. This enzyme is integral to the synthesis of betaine, a crucial methyl donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, thereby influencing one-carbon metabolism and methylation reactions within the cell (Li2023CHDH). CHDH is a transmembrane protein localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it is involved in mitochondrial quality control and autophagy processes, particularly mitophagy, through interactions with proteins such as SQSTM1/p62 and LC3 (Park2014Choline). Beyond its enzymatic function, CHDH is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, with significant roles in cellular homeostasis and male fertility (Johnson2010Deletion; Li2023CHDH).

## Structure
The CHDH (choline dehydrogenase) protein is involved in the oxidation of choline to betaine and is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. Its primary structure consists of 599 amino acids, with an N-terminal signal peptide that targets the protein to mitochondria, where it is cleaved in the intermembrane space (Huang2003Functional). The protein contains several functional domains, including two FAD/NAD(P)-binding domains (FB1 and FB2) and a FAD-linked reductase domain (RD). The FB1 domain is crucial for mitophagy-stimulating activity, while all three domains are important for enzymatic function (Park2014Choline).

CHDH is suggested to be a transmembrane protein, with the N-terminus exposed to the cytosol and the C-terminus inside the mitochondria (Park2014Choline). The protein interacts with SQSTM1/p62 to recruit LC3 and stimulate mitophagy, a process independent of its enzymatic activity (Park2014Choline). The FB1 domain is essential for this interaction, highlighting its role in mitochondrial quality control (Park2014Choline). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a complex role in cellular processes beyond its enzymatic function.

## Function
Choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in choline metabolism by catalyzing the oxidation of choline to betaine aldehyde, which is subsequently converted to betaine. Betaine acts as a significant methyl donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, influencing homocysteine levels in the blood and contributing to one-carbon metabolism (Li2023CHDH). This process is vital for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a key methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions affecting DNA, RNA, and proteins (Li2023CHDH).

CHDH is located on both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes and is involved in mitochondrial autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis. It interacts with proteins such as p62 and LC3 to facilitate the recruitment of autophagic machinery to damaged mitochondria (Li2023CHDH; Park2014Choline). CHDH's activity is linked to mitochondrial function, as evidenced by its role in male fertility, where CHDH knockout in mice leads to altered mitochondrial morphology and reduced ATP content in sperm (Li2023CHDH; Johnson2010Deletion). This suggests that CHDH is essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production in cells.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CHDH (choline dehydrogenase) is involved in mitophagy through its interactions with several proteins. It interacts with SQSTM1/p62, an adaptor protein that connects damaged mitochondria to LC3, a key protein in the autophagy pathway. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of LC3 to damaged mitochondria, facilitating their degradation. The interaction between CHDH and SQSTM1 is mediated by the FB1 domain of CHDH, which is exposed to the cytosol, and the PB1 domain of SQSTM1. This interaction is independent of PARK2, a protein typically involved in mitophagy, indicating a distinct pathway for CHDH's role in this process (Park2014Choline).

CHDH also interacts with the VDAC1-adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) complex on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which may regulate its accumulation following mitochondrial damage. This interaction is enhanced by CCCP treatment, suggesting a role in the mitophagic response to mitochondrial depolarization (Park2014Choline).

In the context of Apostichopus japonicus, a similar protein, AjCHDH, interacts with SQSTM1 to activate mitophagy, which is crucial for cell survival following infection. AjCHDH lacks a typical LC3-interacting region but still facilitates the recruitment of LC3 to mitochondria through its interaction with SQSTM1 (Sun2023Choline).
