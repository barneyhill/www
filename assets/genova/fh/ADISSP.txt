# ADISSP

## Overview
ADISSP, or adipose secreted signaling protein, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a signaling molecule predominantly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This protein is categorized as an adipokine, a type of cytokine secreted by adipose tissue, and is involved in the regulation of thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis. ADISSP plays a significant role in the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), enhancing energy expenditure and thermogenic activity through a G protein-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for its thermogenic effects and operates independently of β-adrenergic receptors, indicating a unique mechanism of action. The protein's expression is inversely related to body mass index (BMI), suggesting its potential protective role against obesity and metabolic disorders (Chen2022A).

## Structure


## Function
ADISSP, or adipose secreted signaling protein, is a brown fat-enriched adipokine that plays a crucial role in regulating thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT), and is one of the most abundant transcripts in BAT (Chen2022A). ADISSP is involved in the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), a process that enhances thermogenic activity and energy expenditure (Chen2022A).

The protein functions by activating a G protein-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which is essential for its thermogenic effects. This pathway leads to the phosphorylation of PKA substrates, including hormone-sensitive lipase, and increases cAMP levels, indicating PKA activation (Chen2022A). ADISSP's action is independent of β-adrenergic receptors, suggesting a novel mechanism for thermogenesis (Chen2022A).

ADISSP also plays a role in improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, contributing to metabolic homeostasis. Its expression is negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI), indicating its potential role in protecting against obesity and related metabolic disorders (Chen2022A). The protein's secretion is regulated by non-classical pathways and is influenced by β3-AR agonists and mitochondrial uncouplers (Chen2022A).
