# KLRB1

## Overview
The KLRB1 gene encodes the killer cell lectin-like receptor B1 (CD161), a C-type lectin-like type II transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and subsets of T cells. This receptor plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses, primarily functioning as an inhibitory receptor on NK cells by interacting with its ligand, Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1). The interaction between CD161 and LLT1 inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production, thereby influencing immune homeostasis and migration (Rother2015The; Rosen2008Functional). Genetic polymorphisms in the KLRB1 gene, such as the c.503T>C polymorphism, can affect the receptor's ligand-binding capacity and its inhibitory potential (Rother2015The). Beyond its role in NK cells, CD161 is also involved in the activation and function of T cells, contributing to various immune regulatory processes (Exley1998CD161; Kirkham2014Complexity).

## Structure
The KLRB1 gene encodes the CD161 receptor, a C-type lectin-like type II transmembrane protein expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and subsets of T cells. The primary structure of CD161 consists of a polypeptide chain encoded by the KLRB1 gene, which includes several exons responsible for different domains: exon-1 for the cytoplasmic domain, exon-2 for the transmembrane domain, exon-3 for the stalk region, and exons-4, -5, and -6 for the extracellular lectin-like domain (Kirkham2014Complexity). The secondary structure of CD161 features conserved disulfide-linked cysteine residues and N-linked glycosylation sites, which are crucial for its function (Kirkham2014Complexity). 

The tertiary structure forms a lectin-like domain that facilitates ligand binding, specifically to the Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1) ligand. The quaternary structure of CD161 likely involves disulfide-linked homodimers, similar to other C-type lectin-like receptors (Kirkham2014Complexity). The c.503T>C polymorphism in the KLRB1 gene results in an isoleucine-to-threonine change at position 168, affecting the ligand-binding capacity and inhibitory potential of the receptor (Rother2015The). This polymorphism influences the receptor's ability to bind LLT1 and modulate signal transduction (Rother2015The).

## Function
The KLRB1 gene encodes the CD161 receptor, a C-type lectin-like type II transmembrane receptor expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, subsets of T cells, and invariant NKT cells. CD161 functions primarily as an inhibitory receptor on NK cells, modulating immune responses by interacting with its ligand LLT1, which is expressed on activated dendritic cells and B cells. This interaction inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production, as well as TNF-α production by TCR-activated NKR-P1A+ CD8+ T cells (Rother2015The; Rosen2008Functional).

The receptor also plays a role in NK cell homeostasis and migration, with its expression influencing the frequency and subset composition of NK cells in peripheral blood (Rother2015The). In T cells, CD161 can act as a co-activating receptor, contributing to the activation and function of these cells, although it does not directly mediate cytolytic activity through pathways typically associated with other costimulatory molecules (Exley1998CD161).

CD161 is involved in the migration of CD4+ T cells and is an early marker in monocyte differentiation and on dendritic cells. It is also expressed by Th17 cells, MR1-restricted MAIT cells, and a unique Treg subset, suggesting its involvement in various immune regulatory processes (Kirkham2014Complexity).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the KLRB1 gene, which encodes the CD161 receptor, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In glioblastoma, inactivating KLRB1 in tumor-infiltrating T cells enhances their anti-tumor activity, leading to slower tumor growth and improved survival in mouse models. This is associated with increased infiltration of granzyme B+ CD8 T cells and reduced expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1, suggesting a less exhausted T cell state (Mathewson2021Inhibitory). The CD161-CLEC2D pathway, involving KLRB1, is identified as a potential target for enhancing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against gliomaspheres, indicating its role in regulating immune responses in gliomas (Mathewson2021Inhibitory).

In breast cancer, KLRB1 expression is an independent prognostic factor. High expression correlates with enhanced immune activity and better patient prognosis, while low expression is linked to increased chemotherapy sensitivity and lower levels of immune checkpoint proteins like CTLA4 and PD-L1 (Huang2023Machine). These findings suggest that KLRB1 expression levels can influence cancer prognosis and treatment strategies, particularly in the context of immune response and chemotherapy sensitivity (Huang2023Machine).

## Interactions
The KLRB1 gene encodes the CD161 receptor, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the immune system. CD161 is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells, where it primarily functions as an inhibitory receptor. One of its key interactions is with the ligand LLT1 (Lectin-like transcript 1), also known as CLEC2D. This interaction inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production, as well as TNF-α production by TCR-activated NKR-P1A+ CD8+ T cells, although it does not affect TCR-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells (Rosen2008Functional).

The interaction between CD161 and LLT1 is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, such as the c.503T>C polymorphism in the KLRB1 gene. This polymorphism results in an amino acid change (Ile168Thr) in the CD161 receptor, affecting its binding affinity to LLT1. Individuals with the CC genotype exhibit diminished binding of LLT1 to CD161, leading to reduced inhibitory potential of NK cells when CD161 is triggered (Rother2015The). These interactions highlight the role of CD161 in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in disease processes (Rother2015The).
