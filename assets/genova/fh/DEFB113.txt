# DEFB113

## Overview
DEFB113 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 113, a member of the defensin family known for its role in the innate immune system. Defensin beta 113 is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide, which is crucial for protecting the host against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The protein is particularly important in maintaining the integrity of mucosal surfaces, especially within epithelial cells, where it contributes to the body's defense mechanisms. DEFB113 is notably expressed in the human male reproductive tract, specifically in the caput epididymis, indicating its potential involvement in sperm maturation and male fertility (Pertea2018CHESS:; Kiyozumi2024Expression). The gene's expression is tissue-specific, which may account for its absence in some transcriptome analyses, despite its established role as a protein-coding gene (Pertea2018Thousands).

## Function
DEFB113, or defensin beta 113, is a member of the defensin family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. These proteins are known for their antimicrobial activity, providing protection against a range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. DEFB113 is involved in maintaining the integrity of mucosal surfaces, particularly in epithelial cells, where it contributes to the host's defense mechanisms (Pertea2018CHESS:).

In the context of the human male reproductive tract, DEFB113 is highly expressed in the caput epididymis, suggesting a role in epididymal function and potentially in sperm maturation and male fertility (Kiyozumi2024Expression). This expression pattern is consistent with findings in mouse models, where DEFB113 (Defb18 in mice) is significantly downregulated in certain knockout models, indicating its importance in normal reproductive processes (Kiyozumi2024Expression).

DEFB113 also exhibits tissue-specific expression patterns, which may explain its absence in certain transcriptome analyses, such as GTEx, despite having known functions and strong experimental evidence supporting its classification as a genuine protein-coding gene (Pertea2018Thousands). This specificity suggests that DEFB113 may have specialized roles in certain tissues, contributing to its functional diversity.
