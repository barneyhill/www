# WDR36

## Overview
WDR36 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 36 protein, which is characterized by its multiple WD40 repeats. These repeats form a beta-propeller structure, allowing the protein to function as a scaffold in various cellular processes, including G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and ribosome biogenesis (Chi2010Mutant; Cartier2011WDR36). The WDR36 protein is involved in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a critical component of the small ribosomal subunit, and plays a significant role in the nucleolus for ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing (Gallenberger2014Heterozygote). Additionally, WDR36 is implicated in enhancing thromboxane A2 receptor-mediated signaling by facilitating interactions with Gαq and phospholipase Cβ (Cartier2011WDR36). Mutations in the WDR36 gene have been associated with various forms of glaucoma, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Pasutto2008Profiling).

## Structure
The WDR36 protein is characterized by its multiple WD40 repeats, which are motifs of approximately 40 amino acids that often end in a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) dipeptide. These repeats form a beta-propeller structure, typically consisting of seven blades, each made up of four anti-parallel beta-strands stabilized by hydrogen bonds (Chi2010Mutant; Cartier2011WDR36). WDR36 contains 14 WD40 repeats, which are organized into two connected seven-bladed beta-propeller domains (Blankenbach2020The; Cartier2011WDR36).

The protein's tertiary structure is crucial for its function as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions with other proteins such as Gαq and phospholipase Cβ in signaling complexes (Cartier2011WDR36). WDR36 is also involved in ribosome biogenesis, similar to yeast Utp21, and plays a role in 18S rRNA processing (Blankenbach2020The). Mutations in WDR36, such as D606G and deletions at positions 605-607 and 601-640, can disrupt the stability of the beta-propeller domains, affecting protein function and leading to phenotypic consequences like retinal degeneration (Chi2010Mutant).

## Function
WDR36 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. The WDR36 protein functions as a scaffold in G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, particularly those involving the thromboxane A2 receptor (TPβ), Gαq, and phospholipase Cβ (PLCb). It enhances TPβ-mediated signaling by promoting the interaction between TPβ and Gαq, which is crucial for the production of inositol phosphates, a key step in Gαq signaling (Cartier2011WDR36). WDR36 also modulates the interaction of Gαq with other proteins like GRK2, which can inhibit Gαq-mediated activation of PLCb (Cartier2011WDR36).

In addition to its role in signaling, WDR36 is involved in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a component of the small ribosomal subunit. It localizes to the nucleolus, where it contributes to ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing. Depletion of WDR36 leads to delays in 18S rRNA processing and increased apoptotic cell death, highlighting its essential role in ribosome biogenesis (Gallenberger2014Heterozygote). The protein's structure includes multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate its function in forming multi-protein complexes (Cartier2011WDR36).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the WDR36 gene have been associated with various forms of glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Studies have identified several missense mutations in WDR36, such as L25P, P31T, and D658G, which are linked to different glaucoma types, including juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). However, these mutations do not show a significant correlation with specific clinical features of glaucoma, suggesting they may not be directly causative (Pasutto2008Profiling).

Research has also highlighted the association of WDR36 polymorphisms with clinical parameters in POAG patients. For instance, the rs10038177 polymorphism's heterozygous genotype TC is linked to higher intraocular pressure (IOP) and cup-to-disc ratio, which are critical factors in glaucoma pathogenesis (MALIK2021Association). Additionally, the WDR36 H2 haplotype has been identified as a risk factor for POAG, particularly when interacting with P53 gene variants (BlancoMarchite2011WDR36andP53Gene).

In animal models, specific WDR36 mutations, such as Del605-607, have been shown to cause retinal ganglion cell loss and retinal degeneration, further implicating WDR36 in glaucoma-related neurodegeneration (Chi2010Mutant). These findings suggest that WDR36 gene variants may contribute to glaucoma susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
WDR36 is a scaffold protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. It directly interacts with the thromboxane A2 receptor (TPβ), Gαq, and phospholipase Cβ (PLCb), forming a signaling complex that enhances TPβ-mediated signaling. This interaction is facilitated by WDR36 binding to the C-terminus and the first intracellular loop of TPβ, as demonstrated by in vitro assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cartier2011WDR36).

WDR36 also competes with GRK2 for binding to activated Gαq, which prevents the sequestration of Gαq and promotes its interaction with PLCb, thereby enhancing inositol phosphate production and ERK1/2 activation (Cartier2011WDR36). The protein's role as a scaffold is further supported by its ability to modulate the interaction between TPβ and PLCb, as well as between Gαq and PLCb, indicating its critical function in assembling a multiprotein signaling complex (Cartier2011WDR36).

WDR36's interactions are receptor-specific, as it enhances TPβ receptor signaling while attenuating signaling from other Gq-coupled receptors, such as the muscarinic M3 and bradykinin B2 receptors (Blankenbach2020The). These interactions highlight WDR36's role in modulating GPCR signaling pathways.
