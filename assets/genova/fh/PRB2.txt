# PRB2

## Overview
The PRB2 gene encodes the proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 2, a member of the basic proline-rich proteins (bPRPs) family. These proteins are predominantly secreted by the parotid glands and are present in human saliva, where they play a role in oral health by contributing to the lubrication and protection of oral tissues (Manconi2016The). The protein is characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamine, which are crucial for its structural properties and functional roles. The PRB2 gene is notable for its polymorphism and alternative splicing, leading to the production of various protein isoforms with distinct post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which enhance its functional diversity (Manconi2016The). These modifications and the gene's polymorphic nature contribute to the protein's heterogeneity and its ability to form different chromatographic clusters, reflecting its complex role in the human body (Kim1993The).

## Structure
The PRB2 gene encodes basic proline-rich proteins (bPRPs) characterized by a high content of proline, glycine, and glutamine, which constitute 70-88% of their amino acid composition (Manconi2016The). These proteins are secreted by the parotid glands and are found in saliva as fragments of larger proproteins (Manconi2016The). The primary structure of PRB2 includes tandem repeats in exon 3, contributing to length variations among different alleles (Kim1993The). The secondary structure is influenced by the rigidity of proline, which may form polyproline helices, although specific secondary structures are not detailed in the context.

Post-translational modifications of PRB2-encoded proteins include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and N-terminal pyroglutamic acid formation (Manconi2016The). These modifications contribute to the protein's heterogeneity and functional diversity. The PRB2 gene exhibits polymorphism, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and alternative splicing, resulting in various protein species such as IB-1, P-J, and IB-8a, each with specific post-translational modifications (Manconi2016The). The PRB2L allele produces the P-F protein, which undergoes C-terminal arginine removal (Manconi2016The). The structural features of these proteins result in their elution as distinct chromatographic clusters in RP-HPLC separations (Manconi2016The).
