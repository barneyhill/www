# TBC1D7

## Overview
TBC1D7 is a gene that encodes the TBC1 domain family member 7 protein, which is a crucial component of the TSC1-TSC2 complex involved in the regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its atypical TBC domain structure, lacking the typical RabGAP activity, and is involved in stabilizing the TSC1-TSC2 complex, thereby influencing cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism in response to environmental cues (Dibble2012TBC1D7; Madigan2018The). TBC1D7 interacts with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 zeta, through phosphorylation, which stabilizes its structure and function (Madigan2018The). Mutations in the TBC1D7 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including intellectual disability, megalencephaly, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Lupi2024TBC1; CapoChichi2013Disruption).

## Structure
The TBC1D7 protein is a member of the TBC1 domain family and is characterized by its atypical TBC domain structure. It is a globular protein that adopts an all-α fold, consisting of 14 α-helices and several short 310 helices (Madigan2018The). The protein is divided into N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains, spanning α1-α8 and α9-α15, respectively (Madigan2018The). Despite structural similarities to other TBC domain proteins, TBC1D7 lacks the dual-finger Arg/Gln pair critical for RabGAP activity, suggesting it does not possess RabGAP activity (Madigan2018The).

In terms of quaternary structure, TBC1D7 forms a complex with TSC1, stabilizing the dimerization of the TSC1 C-terminal coiled coil region. This interaction forms a heterotetramer consisting of two TBC1D7 molecules and two TSC1 molecules (Gai2016Structure). The interaction is mediated by conserved hydrophobic residues on the a4 and a5 helices of TBC1D7, which interact with the a1 helix of TSC1 (Gai2016Structure).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation by Akt at Ser-124, which stabilizes TBC1D7 by promoting its binding to 14-3-3 proteins (Madigan2018The). This phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch that governs its stability and interaction with other proteins (Madigan2018The).

## Function
TBC1D7 is a protein that functions as a component of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which plays a critical role in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for controlling cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism in response to environmental cues such as nutrient availability and growth factors (Dibble2012TBC1D7; Santiago2014Identification). TBC1D7 contributes to the complex's function as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rheb, a small GTPase that directly activates mTORC1. By promoting the conversion of Rheb from its active GTP-bound state to its inactive GDP-bound form, TBC1D7 helps suppress mTORC1 signaling when growth factors are withdrawn (Dibble2012TBC1D7; CapoChichi2013Disruption).

In healthy human cells, TBC1D7 is involved in maintaining the stability and integrity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. It stabilizes the dimerization of the TSC1 coiled coil region, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the complex (Gai2016Structure). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and influences cellular responses to nutrient availability, playing a role in regulating cell size and autophagy initiation (Dibble2012TBC1D7). Loss of TBC1D7 function can lead to increased mTORC1 signaling, resulting in enhanced cell growth and delayed autophagy (CapoChichi2013Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D7 gene are associated with intellectual disability and megalencephaly. A study identified a homozygous truncating mutation in TBC1D7 in siblings from a consanguineous family, leading to undetectable levels of TBC1D7 protein and mRNA, which resulted in increased mTORC1 activity. This mutation was linked to mild intellectual disability and increased head circumference, without other typical features of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (CapoChichi2013Disruption).

TBC1D7 mutations can also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. A pathogenic synonymous variant in TBC1D7 was found to disrupt an exonic splice enhancer site, causing exon skipping and preventing binding to the TSC complex. This variant was associated with symptoms such as muscle weakness, developmental delay, and severe epileptic encephalopathy (Dekker2022RNAsequencing).

In cancer, TBC1D7 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and is associated with a glycolytic phenotype. High expression levels of TBC1D7 correlate with poor prognosis in TNBC, suggesting its role in maintaining glycolytic activity and influencing cancer metabolism (Lupi2024TBC1).

## Interactions
TBC1D7 is a protein that interacts with the TSC1-TSC2 complex, forming a stable association as a third subunit. This complex is crucial for regulating mTORC1 signaling, which controls cell growth and metabolism. TBC1D7 primarily binds to the TSC1-TSC2 complex rather than to either protein individually, with a near 1:1 ratio of TSC1 and TSC2 co-immunoprecipitating with TBC1D7 (Dibble2012TBC1D7). The interaction is resistant to high salt concentrations, indicating a strong association, although it can be disrupted by high concentrations of SDS (Dibble2012TBC1D7).

TBC1D7 also interacts with 14-3-3 zeta, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, through phosphorylation at serine 124 (S124) by Akt. This phosphorylation facilitates the binding of TBC1D7 to 14-3-3 proteins, stabilizing TBC1D7 and preventing its degradation (Madigan2018The). The interaction involves a basic pocket in 14-3-3 zeta that coordinates the phosphoserine side chain of TBC1D7, further stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Madigan2018The).

Mutations or deletions in specific regions of TBC1D7, such as exons 4 and 5, can disrupt its interaction with TSC1, highlighting the importance of specific residues in maintaining the integrity of the TBC1D7-TSC1 interaction (Santiago2014Identification).
