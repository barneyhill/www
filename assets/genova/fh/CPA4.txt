# CPA4

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase A4, a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase belonging to the M14A subfamily. This enzyme is characterized by its α/β-hydrolase fold and is primarily involved in the extracellular processing of peptides, specifically cleaving C-terminal hydrophobic residues. CPA4 plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including neuropeptide regulation and adipogenesis, where it acts as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation. The enzyme's activity is modulated by its interaction with the endogenous inhibitor latexin, which binds noncompetitively to CPA4. Clinically, alterations in CPA4 expression have been associated with several cancers, including bladder, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, and liver cancers, where it serves as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Wei2021Comprehensive; Pallarès2005Structure; Tanco2010Characterization; He2016Fibroblast).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4) is a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase that exhibits a classical α/β-hydrolase fold typical of A/B-type metallocarboxypeptidases. This structure includes a central mixed β-sheet flanked by several α-helices, forming a compact globular shape with a funnel-like structure. The active-site cleft is located at the bottom of this funnel, and the rim is shaped by loops connecting regular secondary structure elements, which are crucial for interactions with protein inhibitors (Pallarès2005Structure).

The catalytic zinc ion within CPA4 is tetrahedrally coordinated by specific residues: His69, Glu72, His196, and a catalytic solvent molecule (Pallarès2005Structure). CPA4 is secreted as an inactive zymogen with an N-terminal prodomain that blocks access to the active site, and activation occurs through limited proteolysis (Pallarès2005Structure).

CPA4 contains an N-glycosylation site at Asn-148, which is a common post-translational modification (Pallarès2005Structure). The enzyme is involved in extracellular peptide processing, with a preference for cleaving C-terminal hydrophobic residues such as Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Tyr, and Phe (Tanco2010Characterization). The presence of Ile at position 255 is a major determinant of substrate specificity (Tanco2010Characterization).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4) is a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase family, specifically the M14A subfamily, and functions primarily in the extracellular environment. CPA4 is secreted as a soluble enzyme and is involved in the processing of extracellular peptides by cleaving C-terminal hydrophobic residues such as Leu, Ile, Val, Met, Tyr, and Phe. This activity is crucial for the regulation of peptide activity in the extracellular space, impacting processes like neuropeptide processing and regulation (Tanco2010Characterization).

CPA4's enzymatic activity is characterized by its preference for neutral C-terminal residues, and it does not cleave peptides with basic, acidic, or polar residues at the C-terminus. The enzyme's activity is optimal at a neutral pH, aligning with its role in the extracellular environment (Tanco2010Characterization).

In addition to its role in peptide processing, CPA4 is implicated in the regulation of adipogenesis. It acts as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation, with its expression being downregulated by fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1), which promotes adipogenesis. This regulation is independent of the PPARg pathway and is associated with insulin sensitivity, suggesting CPA4's involvement in metabolic homeostasis (He2016Fibroblast).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CPA4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, serving as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. In bladder cancer (BLCA), CPA4 expression is significantly upregulated and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including higher pathologic stages and increased mortality. High CPA4 levels correlate with shorter overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals, making it a poor prognostic biomarker in BLCA (Wei2021Comprehensive).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CPA4 is overexpressed, and its high expression is linked to poor differentiation, positive lymph node status, and advanced cancer stage. This suggests a worse prognosis and highlights CPA4's role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing the invasive and migratory capabilities of cancer cells (Yan2021Insufficient; Fu2019Downregulation).

CPA4 is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it is associated with larger tumor size, advanced T stage, and lymph-node metastasis. This overexpression correlates with negative E-cadherin expression, indicating CPA4's involvement in EMT and tumor progression (p&gt; Shao2020&lt; CPA4).

In liver cancer, elevated CPA4 levels are linked to higher cancer grade and stage, and are associated with poor overall survival, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Sun2017Association).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4) is known to interact with its endogenous protein inhibitor, latexin. The CPA4/latexin complex is characterized by a large interface, covering a surface area of 2,340 Å², which is larger than typical protease-inhibitor interfaces. This interaction involves 48 intermolecular contacts, including 13 hydrogen bonds and 7 hydrophobic interactions. The inhibitory mechanism of latexin is noncompetitive, with kinetic inhibition constants in the nanomolar range. Latexin primarily interacts with CPA4 through a loop that encompasses residues Asp273A-Pro282A of the protease, forming key interactions such as a salt bridge between Gln190B of latexin and Arg71A of CPA4, and additional contacts involving residues like Tyr248A and Glu163A (Pallarès2005Structure).

The interaction between CPA4 and latexin is crucial for its inhibitory function, as latexin binds at the rim of the funnel-like active site of CPA4, coordinating with the catalytic zinc ion. This binding is facilitated by the α/β-hydrolase fold of CPA4, which includes a central mixed β-sheet and several helices (Pallarès2005Structure). These interactions are significant for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of CPA4 in physiological processes.
