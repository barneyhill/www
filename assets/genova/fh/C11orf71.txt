# C11orf71

## Overview
C11orf71 is a gene located on chromosome 11, encoding the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 71. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, emerging research suggests that C11orf71 may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes. Notably, it has been implicated in the immune response to COVID-19, where its expression levels are associated with disease severity (Li2021Genomewide). Additionally, C11orf71 has been identified as a hub gene in network-based analyses related to Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect, indicating its potential involvement in cardiac development (Karami2020Networkbased). Despite these associations, further studies are required to understand the specific functions and mechanisms of the C11orf71 protein.

## Clinical Significance
C11orf71 has been implicated in several health conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In the context of COVID-19, genome-wide association studies have identified C11orf71 as a potential candidate gene at the 11q23.3 locus, which is associated with COVID-19 severity. The protective allele T of the SNP rs1712779 at this locus is linked to higher expression of C11orf71, suggesting a possible role in modulating the immune response to COVID-19 (Li2021Genomewide). However, the exact clinical implications of C11orf71 in COVID-19 are not fully understood, and further research is needed to clarify its role (Li2021Genomewide).

C11orf71 has also been associated with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect. Network-based analyses have identified C11orf71 as a hub gene in a module of co-expressed genes linked to TOF, indicating its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition (Karami2020Networkbased). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which C11orf71 influences these diseases are not well-documented, and ongoing research aims to elucidate its clinical significance.
