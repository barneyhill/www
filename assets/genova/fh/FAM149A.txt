# FAM149A

## Overview
FAM149A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 149 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes and is expressed in multiple tissues, including the corneal endothelium and brain. While the specific biochemical functions of the FAM149A protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts. Notably, FAM149A has been associated with congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED), Glass Syndrome, and colorectal cancer, highlighting its potential role in disease mechanisms and genetic susceptibility (Werdyani2017Germline; Zhao2024The; Cui2023Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FAM149A gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of corneal diseases, a homozygous mutation in the FAM149A gene has been identified in a patient with congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED). This mutation is significant because FAM149A is highly expressed in corneal endothelial cells and is up-regulated during oxidative stress, suggesting its role as a pathogenic gene in CHED (Zhao2024The).

In brain disorders, FAM149A has been linked to Glass Syndrome through a 3′aQTL analysis, which identified genetic effects associated with variations in 3′ UTR usage in brain tissues. This study highlights the potential of alternative polyadenylation as a molecular phenotype that can explain genetic susceptibility in brain disorders (Cui2023Alternative).

In colorectal cancer, FAM149A was among the genes selected for experimental validation in a study focusing on germline insertions and deletions (INDELs) and copy number variations (CNVs). The study explored the association of these genetic variations with relapse-free survival in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting a potential role for FAM149A in cancer susceptibility and patient outcomes (Werdyani2017Germline).
