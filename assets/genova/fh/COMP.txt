# COMP

## Overview
The COMP gene encodes the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, a pentameric glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of cartilage and other connective tissues. As a member of the thrombospondin family, COMP is characterized by its unique structure, which includes multiple calcium-binding domains and epidermal growth factor-like domains, facilitating its interaction with various extracellular matrix components. This protein is essential for collagen fibrillogenesis and the biomechanical properties of tissues, acting as an adaptor protein that bridges different extracellular matrix structures. COMP's interactions with collagen types I, II, and IX, as well as other matrix components, underscore its importance in maintaining tissue integrity. Mutations in the COMP gene are linked to skeletal dysplasias such as pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal development and disease (Schulz2016COMPassisted; Oldberg1992COMP; Posey2018Cartilage).

## Structure
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a pentameric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 524 kDa, composed of five identical disulfide-linked subunits (Oldberg1992COMP; DiCesare1995Cartilage). Each subunit consists of 755 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 82,700 Da (Oldberg1992COMP). The primary structure includes a unique amino-terminal sequence of 84 residues, followed by domains homologous to thrombospondin, including four type 2 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and eight type 3 calcium-binding domains (Oldberg1992COMP; Acharya2014Cartilage).

The secondary structure of COMP features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable conformation, forming a signature domain common to thrombospondin family members (Posey2018Cartilage). The quaternary structure is characterized by a bouquet-like pentameric assembly, with each monomer forming a flexible arm ending in a globular domain (DiCesare1995Cartilage).

COMP undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which influence its function and stability (Oldberg1992COMP). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various extracellular matrix components, playing a crucial role in cartilage integrity and function (Acharya2014Cartilage).

## Function
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage and other connective tissues. In healthy human cells, COMP is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in load-bearing tissues such as cartilage, tendons, and skin. It acts as an adaptor protein, bridging different ECM structures and binding with high affinity to collagen types I and XII. This interaction is essential for maintaining the morphology and density of collagen fibrils, which affects the biomechanical properties of tissues (Schulz2016COMPassisted).

COMP also has an important intracellular function in assisting the efficient secretion of collagens. In the absence of COMP, collagens are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of fibroblasts, leading to secretion defects and altered collagen fibril morphology. This intracellular role is crucial for the proper export of collagens into the extracellular space, necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues (Schulz2016COMPassisted).

In cartilage, COMP supports chondrocyte attachment through interactions with integrins, specifically the α5β1 and αVβ3 integrin receptors. This interaction is influenced by the conformation of COMP, which is affected by calcium binding, and plays a role in regulating cellular activities and responding to environmental changes in the cartilage matrix (Chen2005Cartilage).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COMP gene are associated with two autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias: pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). These conditions, collectively known as COMPopathies, are characterized by joint pain, short stature, and early-onset osteoarthritis. PSACH is a severe form of dwarfism with significant limb shortening and joint laxity, while MED presents with milder symptoms, including short stature and joint pain (Posey2018Cartilage).

Mutations in the COMP gene often affect the calcium-binding domains, leading to compromised protein folding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This retention causes cellular stress, oxidative and inflammatory processes, and chondrocyte death, contributing to the loss of long bone growth (Posey2018Cartilage). Specific mutations, such as those in the seventh calmodulin-like repeat, are linked to severe PSACH phenotypes, while mutations elsewhere may result in milder PSACH or MED phenotypes (Ikegawa1998Novel).

Altered COMP expression or interactions can also affect cartilage integrity, potentially contributing to osteoarthritis. The presence of mutant COMP in the ER can lead to the formation of an intracellular matrix, further disrupting normal cellular function (Thur2001Mutations; Suleman2011A).

## Interactions
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a pentameric glycoprotein that interacts with various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cartilage structure and function. COMP binds to collagen types I, II, and IX, with its C-terminal domain mediating these interactions. These interactions are essential for collagen fibrillogenesis and the mechanical integrity of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments (Holden2001Cartilage; Posey2018Cartilage). COMP also interacts with aggrecan, a process dependent on calcium ions, involving the type 3 repeats and C-terminal domain of COMP (Posey2008The).

COMP's interaction with type IX collagen is particularly significant, as it involves specific binding to the noncollagenous domains (NC1-4) of type IX collagen. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cartilage integrity and is disrupted in certain skeletal dysplasias (Holden2001Cartilage). COMP also binds to other ECM components such as heparin, heparin sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates, with calcium ions playing a critical role in these interactions (Posey2008The).

In addition to its structural roles, COMP interacts with granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP), stimulating chondrocyte proliferation, and with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in ECM remodeling and inflammation regulation (Posey2008The; Posey2018Cartilage). These interactions highlight COMP's multifaceted role in cartilage biology and its potential implications in skeletal diseases.
