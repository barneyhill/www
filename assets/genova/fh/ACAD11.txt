# ACAD11

## Overview
ACAD11 is a gene that encodes the protein acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family member 11, which is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family. This protein is primarily involved in the catabolism of 4-hydroxy acids within mammalian cells, playing a significant role in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. ACAD11 is localized to peroxisomes, where it facilitates the breakdown of very long-chain 4-hydroxy acids into 2-enoyl-CoAs. The protein is characterized by a unique structure that includes an N-terminal kinase domain and hydrophilic residues in its active site, enabling it to phosphorylate and process its substrates effectively. ACAD11's activity is crucial for the clearance of oxygenated lipids, protecting cells from the cytotoxic effects of reactive aldehydes. Additionally, its expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, linking it to cellular responses to oncogenic stress and DNA damage. Variations in the ACAD11 gene have been associated with several health conditions, including coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance (Jiang2015Analysis; Rashan2024ACAD10).

## Structure
ACAD11 is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, characterized by its role in fatty acid metabolism. The protein structure of ACAD11 includes a conserved proline residue at position 463, which causes partial unwinding of an α-helix. This structural feature results in an expanded substrate-binding cavity, allowing ACAD11 to accommodate longer-chain substrates, up to C24 in length (Narayanan2024Structural). The presence of a conserved arginine residue, Arg 627, may assist in binding to the phosphate group of substrates (Paquay2024ACAD10).

ACAD11 is peroxisomal, which influences its substrate utilization due to its subcellular localization (Paquay2024ACAD10). The protein does not require external electron acceptors, suggesting a unique electron transfer mechanism where electrons are transferred back onto the substrate (Paquay2024ACAD10). ACAD11 also contains a kinase domain and an ACAD domain, which facilitate the phosphorylation of 4-hydroxyacyl-CoAs and subsequent elimination of the phosphate to form enoyl-CoAs (Paquay2024ACAD10).

The crystal structure of ACAD11 has been examined, with the PDB code 2wbi providing insights into its structural characteristics (Narayanan2024Structural). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ACAD11 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ACAD11 is a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) family, playing a crucial role in the catabolism of 4-hydroxy acids (4-HAs) in mammalian cells. It is localized to peroxisomes and is involved in the breakdown of very long-chain 4-HAs, which are converted into 2-enoyl-CoAs, intermediates in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway (Rashan2024ACAD10). ACAD11 is characterized by unique structural features, including an N-terminal kinase domain and hydrophilic residues in its active site, which allow it to phosphorylate and process its substrates (Rashan2024ACAD10). This enzyme is essential for the efficient clearance of oxygenated lipids, protecting cells against the cytotoxic effects of reactive aldehydes like 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (Rashan2024ACAD10).

ACAD11 is also regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which induces its expression in response to oncogenic stress and DNA damage, highlighting its role in fatty acid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Jiang2015Analysis). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining lipid metabolism and may have implications for human health, as polymorphisms in the ACAD11 gene have been associated with conditions such as coronary heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance (Rashan2024ACAD10).
