# PTAR1

## Overview
PTAR1, or protein prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the post-translational modification of other proteins through prenylation. This protein is a component of the geranylgeranyltransferase type-III (GGTase-III) complex, which is responsible for the double prenylation of specific substrates, such as the SNARE protein Ykt6. This modification is crucial for the structural and functional organization of cellular components like the Golgi apparatus, as it aids in the assembly of the Golgi SNARE complex (Shirakawa2020A). PTAR1 is essential for the proper sorting and trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and plays a role in the sialylation of lysosomal membrane proteins, impacting processes such as viral entry (Shirakawa2020A; Sakata2020Double). The protein's interactions with other components, such as RabGGTb, underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and intracellular trafficking pathways (Shirakawa2020A).

## Structure


## Function
PTAR1 (protein prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat containing 1) plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through a process known as prenylation. This modification involves the attachment of lipid groups to proteins, which is essential for their proper localization and function within the cell. PTAR1 is a component of geranylgeranyltransferase type-III (GGTase-III), which is responsible for the double prenylation of the SNARE protein Ykt6. This double prenylation is critical for the structural and functional organization of the Golgi apparatus, as it facilitates the proper assembly of the Golgi SNARE complex, including syntaxin 5, GS28, and GS15 (Shirakawa2020A).

In healthy human cells, PTAR1 is essential for the correct sorting and trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases, such as cathepsin D, from the Golgi to lysosomes. The absence of PTAR1 leads to missorting and secretion of these enzymes, indicating its vital role in maintaining lysosomal function (Sakata2020Double). PTAR1 is also involved in the sialylation of lysosomal membrane proteins, which is important for cellular processes like viral entry (Shirakawa2020A). Overall, PTAR1 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of intracellular trafficking pathways.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PTAR1, a component of the geranylgeranyltransferase type-III (GGTase-III), interacts with the beta subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTb) to form a heterodimeric complex. This complex is involved in the prenylation of specific substrates, such as the Golgi SNARE protein Ykt6. PTAR1 recognizes the farnesylated Cys195 of Ykt6 and facilitates the addition of a geranylgeranyl group to Cys194, resulting in doubly prenylated Ykt6, which is crucial for its function in the Golgi apparatus (Shirakawa2020A).

PTAR1 also interacts with RabGGTb in rat brain and thymus cytosol, as confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays. Approximately 18% of RabGGTb is complexed with PTAR1 in rat brain cytosol, indicating a significant interaction between these proteins (Shirakawa2020A). The interaction between PTAR1 and RabGGTb was further demonstrated in recombinant protein production, where PTAR1 was co-expressed and purified with RabGGTb, highlighting their association in the context of GGTase-III (Shirakawa2020A).

Additionally, PTAR1 has been identified as a host factor required for Lassa virus infection, suggesting potential interactions with viral components, although specific details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Shirakawa2020A).
