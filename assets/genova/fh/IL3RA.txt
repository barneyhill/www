# IL3RA

## Overview
The IL3RA gene encodes the interleukin 3 receptor subunit alpha, a critical component of the interleukin-3 receptor complex, which is primarily involved in hematopoiesis. This gene is responsible for producing a transmembrane protein that forms part of the receptor for interleukin-3 (IL-3), a cytokine that plays a vital role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic cells. The IL3RA protein, in conjunction with the common beta subunit, forms a high-affinity receptor that activates various signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT, Ras-MAPK, and PI3K, essential for immune response regulation and hematopoietic processes (Broughton2012The; Sato1993Expression). The structural integrity and function of IL3RA are maintained through specific interactions and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are crucial for its role in immune signaling (Broughton2018A). Alterations in IL3RA expression have been linked to several hematological malignancies and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Testa2002Elevated; Hou2024EP300ZNF384).

## Structure
The IL3RA protein, or interleukin 3 receptor subunit alpha, is a crucial component of the IL-3 receptor complex. It is composed of an extracellular region with 287 residues, including an Ig-like N-terminal domain (NTD) and two fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains, D2 and D3, which together form the cytokine recognition module (CRM) (Broughton2018A; Broughton2012The). The NTD is highly mobile and plays a significant role in IL-3 binding, transitioning from high to low mobility upon cytokine binding, which optimizes ligand recognition and receptor dimerization (Broughton2018A). 

The IL3RA protein can exist in open and closed conformations, influenced by the placement of its NTD. Specific interactions, such as a disulphide bond between C76 in the NTD and C195 in D2, and a hydrogen bond between S74 in the NTD and D197 in D2, are crucial for maintaining the receptor's conformation (Broughton2018A). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at sites N80, N109, and N218, which are important for the protein's structural integrity and function (Broughton2018A). The IL3RA subunit also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its structural and functional diversity (Broughton2012The).

## Function
The IL3RA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3Rα), which is integral to the IL-3 receptor complex involved in hematopoiesis. This receptor complex is composed of the IL-3Rα subunit and the common beta subunit (βc), which together form a high-affinity receptor for interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Broughton2012The; Sato1993Expression). IL-3Rα is primarily expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, where it plays a critical role in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of various myeloid cell lineages, including megakaryocytes, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, granulocytes, and erythroid progenitors (Broughton2015The; Sato1993Expression).

The IL-3Rα subunit is involved in the binding and signaling of IL-3, which is crucial for the regulation of immune responses. It facilitates the activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT, Ras-MAPK, and PI3K pathways, which are essential for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Broughton2012The). The receptor's extracellular region includes an Ig-like N-terminal domain and two FnIII domains, which contribute to IL-3 binding and signal transduction (Broughton2012The). The IL-3Rα subunit's interactions with IL-3 are crucial for receptor binding and activation, influencing various immune responses and hematopoietic processes (Broughton2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of IL3RA, the interleukin 3 receptor subunit alpha, have significant clinical implications, particularly in hematological malignancies and inflammatory disorders. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), elevated IL3RA expression is associated with increased proliferation of leukemic blasts and reduced sensitivity to apoptosis, contributing to a poorer prognosis. High IL3RA levels correlate with higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis, lower complete remission rates, higher relapse rates, and shorter overall survival (Testa2002Elevated).

In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the EP300-ZNF384 fusion protein upregulates IL3RA expression, enhancing the proliferation and survival of leukemic cells. This suggests that IL3RA is a critical component in the progression of B-ALL and a potential therapeutic target (Hou2024EP300ZNF384).

IL3RA also plays a role in inflammatory responses. The RNFT2/IL-3Rα axis regulates IL-3 signaling, impacting inflammatory lung diseases. IL-3 exacerbates lung injury, while RNFT2, an E3 ligase, targets IL3RA for degradation, modulating inflammation. Alterations in this axis could influence the risk and severity of conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Tong2020The).

## Interactions
The IL3RA protein, also known as interleukin 3 receptor subunit alpha, is a component of the IL-3 receptor complex that interacts with the beta common chain (CSF2RB) to form a high-affinity receptor for interleukin-3. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's ability to bind IL-3 with high affinity and initiate signaling pathways involved in hematopoiesis (Broughton2012The; Esnault2018Proteomic).

IL3RA participates in forming a hexameric complex through three interaction sites. IL-3 initially binds to IL3RA with modest affinity at Site 1, and the subsequent recruitment of the bc dimer through Sites 2 and 3 stabilizes the complex, enhancing IL-3 binding affinity. Site 2 involves interactions between IL-3 and aromatic residues in the bc subunit, while Site 3 involves high-affinity interactions between IL3RA domain 3 and bc domain 4 (Broughton2012The).

The IL3RA subunit can also interact with other cytokine receptors and membrane proteins, such as c-Kit, a tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). This interaction is important for the synergistic action of SCF with IL-3 and GM-CSF on hematopoietic progenitor cells (Broughton2012The). Additionally, IL3RA is involved in interactions with the FcRc receptor on mast cells and basophils, facilitating IL-3 signaling through Syk kinase (Broughton2012The).
