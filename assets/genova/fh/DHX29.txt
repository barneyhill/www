# DHX29

## Overview
DHX29 is a gene that encodes the DExH-box helicase 29, a member of the DExH-box family of RNA helicases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the initiation of translation, particularly in the context of structured mammalian mRNAs. As a DExH-box helicase, DHX29 is involved in the unwinding of RNA secondary structures, facilitating the scanning process of the ribosome during translation initiation. The protein is characterized by a unique N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal DExH catalytic core, which are essential for its interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit and its ribosome-stimulated NTPase activity (Sweeney2021Functional). Beyond its fundamental role in translation, DHX29 is also implicated in antiviral innate immunity and has been associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and cell proliferation (Evron2021A; Shen2020General).

## Structure
The DHX29 protein is a DExH-box RNA helicase essential for translation initiation on structured mammalian mRNAs. It comprises a unique 534-amino acid N-terminal region (NTR) and a common C-terminal DExH catalytic core. The NTR includes a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and a long α-helix, which are critical for ribosomal association and 40S-stimulated NTPase activity, despite lacking typical RNA-binding motifs (Sweeney2021Functional). The NTR's α-helix and ubiquitin-associated-like (UBA-like) domain form a four-helix bundle, contributing to the main density observed in cryo-EM structures (Sweeney2021Functional). 

The dsRBD interacts with 18S rRNA and ribosomal proteins eS30 and uS12, forming part of the intersubunit domain in the ribosome (Sweeney2021Functional). The linker helix, following the dsRBD, is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of DHX29, supporting a tensile connection between the main density and the intersubunit domain (Sweeney2021Functional). 

The C-terminal DExH core is modeled to fit the cryo-EM structure, although the full correspondence of the NTR to specific structural elements remains partially unresolved (Sweeney2021Functional). The protein's structure is essential for its function, as mutations or deletions in key regions can disrupt its activity (Sweeney2021Functional).

## Function
DHX29 is a DExH-box RNA helicase that plays a critical role in the initiation of translation, particularly on structured mammalian mRNAs. It is involved in the scanning mechanism of translation initiation, especially when stable secondary structures are present in the mRNA. DHX29 binds to 40S ribosomal subunits and exhibits ribosome-stimulated NTPase activity, which is essential for its function (Sweeney2021Functional). The protein facilitates the unwinding of mRNA secondary structures, ensuring linear inspection of nucleotides and preventing the formation of aberrant 48S complexes (Sweeney2021Functional). 

DHX29 is not a processive RNA helicase but interacts with 40S-bound eIF3 subunits, potentially implicating it in ribosomal complex rearrangement and higher processivity in mRNA unwinding (Shen2020General). It is crucial for the formation of the 48S complex during translation initiation, promoting efficient translation on mRNAs with elevated 5' leader secondary structure (Shen2020General). 

In addition to its role in translation, DHX29 has been implicated in antiviral innate immunity, cooperating with cytosolic nucleic acid detectors to recognize viral dsRNA and trigger immune responses (Sweeney2021Functional). Its activity is essential for cell growth and proliferation, as depletion of DHX29 disrupts polysomes, suppresses translation, and inhibits cancer cell proliferation (Shen2020General).

## Clinical Significance
DHX29 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. Alterations in DHX29 expression levels have been associated with cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, DHX29 acts as a repressor of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and apoptosis. Knockout of DHX29 leads to increased expression of Wnt-regulated proteins, suggesting that its absence may facilitate Wnt-mediated tumorigenesis (Evron2021A). In Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients, decreased DHX29 levels in polyps correlate with increased Cyclin-D1 expression, further supporting its role in tumor suppression (Evron2021A).

DHX29 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung carcinoma, and its silencing has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a target in cancer treatment (Evron2021A; Pisareva2016DHX29). Beyond cancer, DHX29's role in translation initiation and its interaction with eIF3 suggest that dysregulation could impact protein synthesis, potentially contributing to other diseases, although specific conditions are not detailed in the provided context (Pisareva2016DHX29).

## Interactions
DHX29 is a DExH-box helicase that plays a crucial role in translation initiation by interacting with various components of the ribosome and initiation factors. It binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, specifically interacting with 18S rRNA and ribosomal proteins eS30 and uS12. The N-terminal region of DHX29, which includes a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD), is involved in these interactions, facilitating ribosomal association and 40S-stimulated NTPase activity (Sweeney2021Functional).

DHX29 also interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, particularly with the eIF3b and eIF3i subunits. The N-terminal region of DHX29 contains binding sites for eIF3, with the first half interacting with the C terminus of eIF3a and the second half associating with the RNA recognition motif of eIF3b. These interactions are essential for the unwinding of mRNA secondary structures during ribosomal scanning (Pisareva2016DHX29).

Additionally, DHX29 makes direct contact with the OB domain of eIF1A, a component of the eukaryotic initiation factor complex. This interaction is crucial for DHX29's role in AUG codon selection during the formation of the 48S initiation complex (Pisareva2016DHX29a).
