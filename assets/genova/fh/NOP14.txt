# NOP14

## Overview
NOP14 is a gene that encodes the NOP14 nucleolar protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The NOP14 protein is categorized as a nucleolar protein and is primarily involved in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a critical component of the small ribosomal subunit. It plays a vital role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, interacting with other proteins such as EMG1 to facilitate pre-rRNA processing and ribosomal subunit assembly (Liu2001Novel; Kirsch2019The). The protein's nucleolar localization aligns with its function in rRNA processing, and its activity is essential for maintaining the balance between the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, which is crucial for efficient protein synthesis and cellular growth (Liu2001Novel). Disruptions in NOP14 function can lead to defects in ribosomal subunit balance, underscoring its importance in cellular processes related to protein synthesis (Liu2001Novel).

## Function
NOP14 is a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the formation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It is involved in the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit, and is essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes in healthy human cells (Liu2001Novel; Kirsch2019The). NOP14 interacts with other proteins, such as EMG1, to facilitate the processing of pre-rRNA and the assembly of ribosomal subunits. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization of EMG1, which is necessary for efficient ribosome biogenesis (Liu2001Novel; Kirsch2019The).

NOP14 is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, aligning with its role in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Liu2001Novel). The protein's function is vital for maintaining the balance between the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, ensuring efficient protein synthesis and cellular growth (Liu2001Novel). Disruption of NOP14 function can lead to defects in ribosomal subunit balance, highlighting its importance in cellular processes related to protein synthesis (Liu2001Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOP14 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting prognosis and potential treatment strategies. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high NOP14 expression is associated with improved prognosis, including better overall survival and progression-free intervals. This suggests that NOP14 may act as a tumor suppressor, potentially through the inhibition of pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and by enhancing immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (Lu2022Increased).

In contrast, in gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), high NOP14 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and disease-specific survival. It is associated with higher tumor grades and is considered an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. NOP14's role in gliomas includes influencing cell migration, proliferation, and immune cell infiltration, particularly affecting CD8+ T cell functions (Tian2024NOP14).

In pancreatic cancer, NOP14 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and metastasis, while its suppression leads to decreased tumor growth and metastasis. This is linked to changes in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways, such as MAPK3-regulated MMP-9/E-cadherin signaling (Zhou2012NOP14).

In melanoma, NOP14, in conjunction with EMG1, suppresses tumor progression by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020EMG1).

## Interactions
NOP14 is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of 18S rRNA and the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, forming part of the small subunit (SSU) processome. NOP14 physically interacts with Emg1, a protein essential for ribosome biogenesis, and this interaction is necessary for the proper localization and function of Emg1 in the nucleolus (Liu2001Novel). The interaction between NOP14 and Emg1 is conserved across eukaryotic species and is crucial for the maturation of 18S rRNA (Liu2001Novel).

NOP14 also interacts with Noc4p, another protein involved in pre-ribosomal RNA processing. The Noc4p-Nop14p submodule is important for the incorporation of Noc4p into the SSU processome, although Noc4p can associate with pre-ribosomes independently of Nop14p (Kühn2009The). In addition, NOP14 is targeted by the cytotoxic natural product vioprolide A (VioA), which disrupts its interaction with Emg1, leading to the delocalization of Emg1 and impairing ribosome biogenesis (Kirsch2019The). These interactions highlight NOP14's essential role in ribosome assembly and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
