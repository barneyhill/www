# EVL

## Overview
The EVL gene encodes the Enah/Vasp-like protein, a member of the Ena/VASP family, which is integral to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell movement, shape, and signaling. The Enah/Vasp-like protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including the EVH1 domain, which binds to proline-rich sequences, and the EVH2 domain, which is essential for actin binding and tetramerization. These structural features enable the protein to participate in the formation of cellular structures such as filopodia and lamellipodia, which are crucial for cell migration and adhesion. Additionally, the protein plays a role in DNA repair and hematopoiesis, influencing processes such as lymphopoiesis and angiogenesis. Alterations in EVL expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Benz2023Cardiovascular; Du2023Immunocyte; Herbst2021The).

## Structure
The EVL (Enah/Vasp-like) protein is a member of the Ena/VASP family, characterized by its involvement in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The protein structure includes several key domains: the EVH1 domain, a central proline-rich region, and the EVH2 domain. The EVH1 domain is responsible for recognizing and binding to proline-rich sequences, such as the FPPPP motif, and is structurally similar to pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. It features a compact parallel L-sandwich structure with a highly conserved cluster of aromatic residues, including Tyr16, Trp23, and Phe79, which form the recognition site for proline-rich sequence ligands (Fedorov1999StructureofEVH1; Ball2001EVH1).

The central proline-rich region of EVL facilitates interactions with SH3 and WW domains, contributing to its role in signal transduction and cytoskeletal reorganization (AhernDjamali1998Mutations). The EVH2 domain is crucial for actin binding and tetramerization, which is essential for the protein's function in actin filament dynamics (AhernDjamali1998Mutations). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, and splice variants can lead to different isoforms of the protein, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Ball2001EVH1).

## Function
The EVL (Enah/Vasp-like) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell movement, shape, and signaling. EVL is involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, structures that are essential for cell migration and adhesion (Herbst2021The). In epithelial cells, EVL is necessary for the assembly of CRMP-1-dependent actin networks, contributing to junctional and cortical actin structures. Its depletion results in decreased actin at cell junctions and increased cell spreading (YuKemp2017CRMP1).

EVL also interacts with RAD51, a protein involved in DNA repair processes, and stimulates RAD51-mediated recombination reactions, indicating its role in homologous recombination and DNA repair (Takaku2011Biochemical). In the context of hematopoiesis, EVL is expressed in lymphocytes and promotes lymphopoiesis, affecting genes involved in hematopoietic system development and B-cell development (Herbst2021The). Additionally, EVL is crucial for angiogenesis, particularly in endothelial cells, where it influences VEGFR2 signaling and VEGF expression, impacting endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Benz2023Cardiovascular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EVL gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in pancreatic cancer (PC). EVL expression is typically downregulated in PC tumors, and higher levels of EVL expression are associated with improved overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival in patients. This suggests that EVL acts as a protective factor and is an independent prognostic marker for PC. The gene's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, including CD8+ T cells and B cells, indicating its role in enhancing antitumor immunity. EVL's interaction with immune cells could be a potential target for PC immunotherapy, especially in enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration in cold tumors like PC (Du2023Immunocyte).

In hematopoietic lineage differentiation, EVL is highly expressed in lymphoid leukemia, particularly T-ALL, and is one of the top differentially expressed genes between ALL and AML samples. The EVL/MIR342 locus plays a role in leukemia, with EVL promoting lymphoid lineage differentiation. The balance between EVL and its intronic miRNA, miR-342, influences hematopoietic cell fate decisions, with EVL potentially acting as a sponge to suppress miR-342's role in myelopoiesis (Herbst2021The).

## Interactions
The EVL (Enah/Vasp-like) protein is involved in various interactions that are crucial for its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. EVL interacts with proline-rich motifs through its EVH1 domain, which is a conserved module in the Ena/VASP family. This domain binds to specific motifs such as the E/DFPPPPXD/E motif found in proteins like ActA of Listeria monocytogenes, facilitating actin-based motility by recruiting proteins like VASP and Mena to the bacterial surface (Niebuhr1997A).

EVL also interacts with the WAVE complex, which is essential for actin filament nucleation and assembly. This interaction enhances the activity of the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin assembly in processes like lamellipodia formation (Havrylenko2015WAVE). The EVH1 domain of EVL binds to proline-rich sequences in proteins such as Abi1, a component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which is crucial for the localization and activity of Ena/VASP proteins (Chen2014EnaVASP).

In the context of hematopoietic cell differentiation, EVL interacts antagonistically with miR-342, where miR-342 expression reduces the lymphoid differentiation capacity induced by EVL, although miR-342 does not directly bind to EVL mRNA (Herbst2021The).
