# ITCH

## Overview
The ITCH gene encodes the itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a crucial enzyme in the ubiquitination pathway, which tags proteins for degradation or modulates their activity. This E3 ubiquitin ligase is characterized by its distinct domains, including a protein kinase C-related C2 domain, multiple WW domains, and a HECT domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin transfer (Aki2015The). ITCH is involved in various cellular processes, such as immune regulation, bone formation, and viral infection response, by targeting specific proteins for degradation (Aki2015The). It plays a significant role in modulating signaling pathways like TNF-a, TGF-b, Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog, impacting cell fate and immune responses (Aki2015The). Clinically, ITCH is implicated in cancer progression and autoimmune disorders, with its dysfunction contributing to tumorigenesis and immune dysregulation (Yin2020ITCH).

## Structure
The ITCH protein, also known as itchy E3 ubiquitin ligase, is composed of 864 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 113 kDa. It features several distinct domains: an N-terminal protein kinase C-related C2 domain, four WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain. The C2 domain, located at amino acids 17-140, binds to Ca2+ and phospholipids, targeting the protein to intracellular membranes such as the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments (Aki2015The). The WW domains, found at amino acids 290-320, 322-352, 402-431, and 442-471, are involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically binding to proline-rich motifs and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine motifs (Rossi2005The; Aki2015The). The HECT domain, spanning amino acids 509-862, is crucial for the ubiquitination process, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins (Rossi2005The; Aki2015The).

Post-translational modifications of ITCH include phosphorylation by JNK1 and tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinase Fyn, which modulate its activity and interactions with substrates (Aki2015The). ITCH is also subject to autoubiquitylation, which can be reversed by deubiquitinases like USP9X (Yin2020ITCH; Aki2015The). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, brain, testis, and kidney (Aki2015The).

## Function
The ITCH gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, tagging proteins for degradation or altering their activity. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions. ITCH is involved in immune regulation by controlling T-cell activation, tolerance, and T-helper cell differentiation, particularly by mediating the ubiquitylation and degradation of transcription factors like JunB, which influences Th2 cell differentiation (Aki2015The).

ITCH also plays a significant role in bone formation, spermatogenesis, and epidermal differentiation. It regulates osteoblast differentiation by targeting JunB for degradation and negatively influences osteoclast genesis by interacting with CYLD to deubiquitylate TRAF6 (Aki2015The). In the context of viral infections, ITCH is involved in the budding process of enveloped viruses and regulates the life cycle of viruses like herpes simplex virus type 2 and influenza A virus (Aki2015The).

In cellular signaling, ITCH modulates pathways such as TNF-a and TGF-b signaling by promoting the degradation of key signaling molecules, thereby influencing apoptosis and immune responses (Aki2015The). It also regulates the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog signaling pathways, impacting cell fate decisions and tissue patterning (Aki2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The ITCH gene, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in protein degradation and immune regulation. Alterations in ITCH expression or function can contribute to cancer progression and autoimmune disorders. In cancer, ITCH is implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways such as WNT and NOTCH, which are crucial for tumorigenesis. Mutations in ITCH are infrequent but have been identified in certain breast cancer subtypes, with somatic mutations found in 3.4% of HER2+ and 7.9% of triple-negative breast cancer cases. The E855K mutant of ITCH, for instance, loses E3 ligase activity, promoting WNT pathway activation and aiding breast cancer cell survival (Yin2020ITCH).

ITCH also influences cancer cell survival through post-translational modifications and interactions with proteins like BRAF in melanoma, supporting pro-survival roles of inflammatory cytokines (Yin2020ITCH). In autoimmune diseases, ITCH deficiency leads to severe multi-organ inflammation, as seen in Itch-deficient mice, highlighting its role in maintaining immune balance (Yin2020ITCH). The gene's involvement in immune cell differentiation and function further underscores its clinical significance, with alterations potentially leading to immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (Yin2020ITCH).

## Interactions
The ITCH protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, participates in numerous interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. ITCH interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus protein LMP2A in B cells, promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of the tyrosine kinase Lyn (Aki2015The). In innate immunity, ITCH ubiquitylates RIP2 kinase and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1), affecting their degradation (Aki2015The). It also interacts with viral proteins, such as the PPXY motif of virus Gag proteins, influencing virus budding and release (Aki2015The).

In the context of stress responses, ITCH binds to p73, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation, a process enhanced by MDM2 (Aki2015The). ITCH also interacts with thioredoxin interacting protein, inhibiting its antioxidative function, and binds to TAK1, leading to its degradation and affecting NF-kB activation (Aki2015The). In the Hippo signaling pathway, ITCH targets LATS1 for degradation, affecting cell death and transformation (Aki2015The).

ITCH's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by JNK1, which enhances its catalytic activity by disrupting intramolecular interactions between its WW and HECT domains (Gallagher2006Activation). This phosphorylation is crucial for ITCH's enzymatic activity and its ability to ubiquitylate substrates like JunB (Gallagher2006Activation).
