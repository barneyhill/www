# POLR2A

## Overview
POLR2A is a gene that encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, a pivotal enzyme in eukaryotic cells responsible for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) and various non-coding RNAs. The protein product of POLR2A, known as RPB1, is characterized by a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) composed of tandem heptapeptide repeats, which undergo dynamic phosphorylation to regulate transcription and RNA processing (Corden2013RNA; Ni2014RPRD1A). As a core component of the transcription machinery, POLR2A plays a crucial role in gene expression, interacting with numerous factors to coordinate transcription with co-transcriptional events such as splicing and 3'-end processing (Corden2013RNA; Hou2019XAB2). The proper function of POLR2A is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and certain types of tumors (Haijes2019De; Clark2016Recurrent).

## Structure
The POLR2A gene encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for mRNA synthesis. The protein's structure includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) characterized by tandem repeats of the heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS, which is highly conserved across species (Corden2013RNA). This domain is intrinsically disordered but can form secondary structures like β-turns and polyproline II helices under certain conditions (Corden2013RNA). The CTD undergoes dynamic phosphorylation, particularly at Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7, which regulates transcription and RNA processing by recruiting various factors (Corden2013RNA; Ni2014RPRD1A).

The CTD's flexibility allows it to adopt different conformations, facilitating interactions with other proteins and enabling the formation of large transcription complexes (Corden2013RNA). The CTD's phosphorylation state changes throughout the transcription cycle, influencing the recruitment of transcription machinery and RNA processing factors (Corden2013RNA). The POLR2A protein also interacts with the Mediator complex, which is crucial for transcription regulation (Corden2013RNA). The presence of splice variant isoforms of POLR2A may contribute to its functional diversity, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
POLR2A encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, a critical enzyme in eukaryotic cells responsible for transcribing DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA) and several non-coding RNAs. This subunit, known as RPB1, contains a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is essential for the enzyme's polymerase activity and coordination of transcription with co-transcriptional events such as mRNA processing (Hou2019XAB2; Haijes2019De). The CTD undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulates the transition between different stages of transcription, including initiation, elongation, and termination (Corden2013RNA; Phatnani2006Phosphorylation).

In healthy human cells, POLR2A is active in the nucleus, where it plays a central role in gene expression by synthesizing mRNA precursors and various non-coding RNAs. The CTD of RNA polymerase II interacts with numerous factors involved in RNA processing, such as splicing and 3'-end processing, ensuring the proper maturation and transport of RNA molecules (Corden2013RNA). The proper functioning of POLR2A is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing dysregulation of gene expression, which can lead to cellular senescence and disease (Hou2019XAB2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR2A gene are associated with several clinical conditions. De novo heterozygous variants in POLR2A have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by profound infantile-onset hypotonia, developmental delay, and other symptoms such as strabismus and decreased endurance. These variants can disrupt RNA polymerase II function, leading to severe phenotypes due to transcriptional dysregulation (Haijes2019De). Specific mutations, such as missense variants near the catalytic core of POLR2A, have been shown to affect transcriptional processes, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Haijes2019De).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, POLR2A mutations are implicated in a distinct subset of meningiomas, a type of brain tumor. These mutations are found in benign WHO grade I meningiomas and are associated with specific clinical characteristics, such as meningothelial histology and origin from the tuberculum sellae region (Clark2016Recurrent). The mutations in POLR2A do not significantly affect splicing or promoter usage but are linked to changes in super-enhancer activity and gene expression, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis through dysregulation of key developmental genes (Clark2016Recurrent).

## Interactions
POLR2A, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in several critical interactions essential for its function in transcription. It interacts with the XAB2 protein, which is crucial for the correct splicing of POLR2A pre-mRNA. XAB2 associates with spliceosome components, including proteins in the Prp19 complex, and its depletion leads to intron retention in POLR2A, impairing global transcription and promoting cellular senescence (Hou2019XAB2).

POLR2A also interacts with RPAP2, which is essential for its nuclear import. RPAP2 binds to POLR2A through its nuclear retention domain, and silencing RPAP2 results in the accumulation of POLR2A in the cytoplasm, indicating its role in the nuclear import of RNA polymerase II (Forget2013Nuclear).

The interaction between POLR2A and the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein is mediated by the methylation of arginine residues on POLR2A. This interaction is important for transcription termination and R-loop resolution. Disruption of this interaction, either by SMN depletion or small molecule antagonists, leads to transcriptional issues such as RNA polymerase II pausing and R-loop accumulation (Liu2022A).
