# SLC19A2

## Overview
The SLC19A2 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 19 member 2 (THTR-1), which is a high-affinity thiamine transporter. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter due to its structure, which includes 12 putative transmembrane domains essential for its function in facilitating the uptake of thiamine (vitamin B1) into cells (Lagarde2003Novel; Said2011Intestinal). Thiamine is a vital micronutrient that serves as a cofactor in several metabolic pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which are crucial for energy production and cellular function (Li2019TRMA; Scharfe2000A). The SLC19A2 gene is expressed in various tissues, and its encoded protein plays a significant role in maintaining thiamine homeostasis. Mutations in this gene can lead to thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), a condition characterized by megaloblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness, underscoring the gene's critical role in human health (Lagarde2003Novel; Zhang2021Identification).

## Structure
The SLC19A2 gene encodes a protein known as THTR-1, which functions as a high-affinity thiamine transporter. This protein is composed of 497 amino acids and contains 12 putative transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in thiamine transport (Lagarde2003Novel; Said2011Intestinal). The primary structure of THTR-1 includes specific amino acid residues that are essential for its function, such as a conserved anionic residue in the transmembrane domain, which is critical for thiamine uptake (Balamurugan2002Functional). 

The secondary structure likely involves the formation of alpha helices within the transmembrane domains, facilitating the transporter's integration into the cell membrane. The tertiary structure of THTR-1 involves the 3D folding necessary for its function as a transporter, although specific details on this folding are not provided in the context. 

Post-translational modifications include potential N-glycosylation sites at positions N63 and N314, although these modifications do not significantly affect the transporter's function or membrane expression (Balamurugan2002Functional). The protein is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, indicating its broad physiological role (Lagarde2003Novel).

## Function
The SLC19A2 gene encodes the high-affinity thiamine transporter protein THTR-1, which is essential for the uptake of thiamine (vitamin B1) into human cells. Thiamine is a crucial micronutrient that acts as a cofactor for several enzyme complexes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Li2019TRMA; Scharfe2000A). These metabolic pathways are vital for energy production and the proper functioning of the nervous system, muscles, and heart (Li2019TRMA).

THTR-1 is expressed in various tissues, including bone marrow, pancreatic beta cells, and certain cochlear cells, where it facilitates the active transport of thiamine across cell membranes (Zhang2021Identification). This transport is critical for maintaining thiamine homeostasis and supporting normal cellular metabolism (Amr2019Whole). In polarized cells, THTR-1 is primarily localized to the basolateral membrane, suggesting a role in the vectorial transport of thiamine across epithelial cells (BOULWARE2003Polarized).

Mutations in the SLC19A2 gene can lead to thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), characterized by megaloblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal function (Lagarde2003Novel; Zhang2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC19A2 gene, which encodes the thiamine transporter type 1 (THTR1), lead to thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) syndrome, also known as Rogers syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a clinical triad of megaloblastic anemia, nonautoimmune diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic; Li2019TRMA; Tahir2015A). Symptoms typically manifest in childhood or adolescence, with diabetes and anemia appearing as early as the neonatal period, while deafness usually develops later (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic).

TRMA can also present with additional symptoms such as neurological issues, ophthalmological problems, endocrinological symptoms like short stature, and cardiological issues including congenital cardiac malformations (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic). Novel mutations in the SLC19A2 gene have been identified, expanding the known mutation spectrum and introducing new phenotypic features such as ventricular premature beats and cerebral infarction (Li2019TRMA).

Thiamine supplementation is the primary treatment for TRMA, often improving diabetes control and anemia, though responsiveness may decrease after puberty. However, some complications, such as stroke or short stature, may not be preventable despite treatment (Marcé‐Grau2019Genetic; Tahir2015A).
