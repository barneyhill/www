# RSPO1

## Overview
RSPO1 (R-spondin 1) is a gene that encodes the R-spondin 1 protein, a crucial modulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein is categorized as a secreted protein and is characterized by its complex structure, which includes furin-like cysteine-rich domains and a thrombospondin type 1 repeat domain. R-spondin 1 plays a significant role in enhancing Wnt signaling by interacting with specific receptors and ligases, thereby influencing various biological processes such as development, differentiation, and proliferation (Zebisch2013Structural; Chang2016NGlycosylation). Clinically, mutations in the RSPO1 gene are linked to disorders such as palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and sex reversal, highlighting its importance in gonadal differentiation and skin integrity (Ferrari2024Testicular; Tallapaka2018Novel).

## Structure
RSPO1 (R-spondin 1) is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein features a signal peptide, two furin-like cysteine-rich domains (Fu1 and Fu2), a thrombospondin type 1 repeat domain, and a basic C-terminal region. The Fu1 domain is primarily responsible for binding to ZNRF3/RNF43, while the Fu2 domain is the main binding site for LGR receptors (Zebisch2013Structural). The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the N terminus is common in secreted proteins and transmembrane receptors, and it plays a crucial role in the interaction with LGR5 and RNF43 (Chen2013The).

The RSPO1 protein structure is further defined by a head and a rod module, with the head module spanning residues C40 to S78 and the rod module extending from C79 to C142. These modules are nearly perpendicular to each other and are stabilized by eight conserved disulfide bridges, which run perpendicular to the protein's long axis (Chen2013The). The RSPO1 CRD is essential for its signaling role, and mutations in this region can lead to developmental defects (Chen2013The).

RSPO1 exhibits structural flexibility, particularly in the hinge region between the Fu1 and Fu2 domains, allowing for different domain orientations. This flexibility influences interactions with LGR4/5, which involve both Fu1 and Fu2 domains (Peng2013Structures). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, potentially altering its functional properties.

## Function
RSPO1 (R-spondin 1) is a key regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and proliferation. RSPO1 enhances Wnt signaling by interacting with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6) and transmembrane RING finger ubiquitin ligases Znrf3 and Rnf43. These interactions stabilize Wnt receptors, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling (Chang2016NGlycosylation). RSPO1 modulates cellular responsiveness to Wnt ligands by affecting the cell-surface levels of the coreceptor LRP6, preventing its internalization mediated by DKK1/Kremen, which leads to increased LRP6 levels on the cell surface (Binnerts2007RSpondin1).

In early human ovary development, RSPO1 is expressed in a sexually dimorphic pattern, upregulating β-catenin signaling to oppose testis formation. This process involves the stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin, which may lead to the degradation of Sox9, a gene upregulated in the developing testis (Tomaselli2011Human). RSPO1 also plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell specification through its influence on the Wnt16/Dlc/Dld and Vegfa/Tgfβ signaling pathways, highlighting its importance in vascular patterning and hematopoietic competence (Genthe2017Rspondin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPO1 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and sex reversal in individuals with SRY-negative 46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) (Tallapaka2018Novel). These mutations lead to a biallelic loss of function, disrupting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for female gonadal differentiation (Ferrari2024Testicular). Patients with RSPO1 mutations often present with atypical genitalia, palmoplantar keratoderma, and an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in areas exposed to frictional stress (Dellambra2022RSPO1mutated).

The RSPO1 gene mutations can also result in syndromic true hermaphroditism, where individuals exhibit both ovarian and testicular tissue, along with other symptoms such as congenital bilateral corneal opacities and hearing impairment (Tomaselli2008Syndromic). The mutations often affect the cysteine-rich furin domains of RSPO1, which are essential for stabilizing cytosolic β-catenin, leading to dysregulation of gonadal development and skin integrity (Ferrari2024Testicular). This dysregulation may inhibit Sox9 degradation, contributing to testis development in individuals with a typically female karyotype (46,XX) (Ferrari2024Testicular).

## Interactions
RSPO1 (R-spondin 1) is involved in several key interactions that modulate the Wnt signaling pathway. It interacts with LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6 receptors, primarily through its Furin domains, which are essential for binding and signaling potentiation (Zebisch2013Structural; Lebensohn2022Receptor). The FU1 domain of RSPO1 interacts with the extracellular PA domain of ZNRF3 and RNF43, forming a complex interface that is crucial for inhibiting these transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases, thereby stabilizing Wnt receptors (Zebisch2013Structural; Lebensohn2022Receptor).

RSPO1 also interacts with Kremen1, which is involved in the regulation of LRP6, a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction prevents the internalization of LRP6, counteracting the inhibitory effects of Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and enhancing Wnt signaling (Binnerts2007RSpondin1). The cysteine-rich furin domains of RSPO1 are responsible for antagonizing DKK1 activity, thereby maintaining higher levels of LRP6 on the cell surface (Kim2008RSpondin).

These interactions highlight RSPO1's role as a critical modulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing processes such as embryonic development and stem cell renewal.
