# ATP10B

## Overview
ATP10B is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 10B (putative), a protein belonging to the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is primarily involved in the translocation of specific lipids, such as glucosylceramide and phosphatidylcholine, across cellular membranes, thereby maintaining lipid asymmetry and homeostasis within lysosomes (Martin2020Mutated). ATP10B forms a heteromeric complex with the regulatory subunit CDC50A, which is essential for its proper localization and function (Smolders2020Genetic; Wouters2023The). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and gastrointestinal tract, with significant implications in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease, due to its role in lipid metabolism and cellular stress response (Martin2020Mutated). Mutations in ATP10B have been linked to increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential genetic risk factor (Zhao2021ATP10B).

## Structure
ATP10B is a member of the P4-ATPase family, characterized by its role as a phospholipid flippase. The protein is composed of a large polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa and includes four main domains: the nucleotide (N) domain, the phosphorylation (P) domain, the actuator (A) domain, and the membrane (M) domain. The N-domain binds ATP, the P-domain contains a conserved aspartic acid residue that undergoes transient phosphorylation, and the A-domain facilitates dephosphorylation. The M-domain, which is predicted to contain 10 transmembrane segments, serves as the pathway for lipid translocation, with segments M1-M6 forming the principal unit for phospholipid transport and M7-M10 playing a supporting role (Andersen2016P4ATPases).

ATP10B requires a regulatory subunit, CDC50A, for proper functioning and localization, forming a heteromeric complex essential for its activity (Smolders2020Genetic; Wouters2023The). The N-terminal region of ATP10B contains di-leucine residues crucial for its trafficking to endosomal compartments, indicating its role in subcellular localization (Okamoto2020The). The protein is mainly expressed in brain regions and the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with diseases like Parkinson's disease (Wouters2023The). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ATP10B are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The ATP10B gene encodes a protein that functions as a late endo-/lysosomal lipid flippase, crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis within lysosomes in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in the translocation of specific lipids, namely glucosylceramide (GluCer) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic membrane leaflet, which is essential for maintaining lipid asymmetry across cellular membranes (Martin2020Mutated). ATP10B forms a complex with CDC50A, a necessary component for its activity, and undergoes autophosphorylation, which is essential for its ATPase activity (Martin2020Mutated).

The protein's activity is crucial for lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis, protecting cells from stressors linked to Parkinson's disease pathology, such as rotenone and MnCl2 (Martin2020Mutated). ATP10B is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal system and the brain, with higher expression in regions associated with Parkinson's disease, such as the medulla oblongata and substantia nigra (Martin2020Mutated). Its role in lipid transport and lysosomal function makes it a key player in sphingolipid metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to neurodegenerative processes (Martin2020Mutated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP10B gene have been implicated in increasing the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). These mutations can lead to a loss of function in the gene's role as a lysosomal lipid flippase, which is crucial for the translocation of lipids such as glucosylceramide (GluCer) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) towards the cytosolic membrane leaflet. The mutation p.D433N, for instance, has been used to demonstrate the loss of enzymatic activity, which compromises lysosomal glucosylceramide export, a process implicated in the pathogenesis of PD (Martin2020Mutated).

Research has shown that ATP10B mutations can disrupt lipid homeostasis, leading to neurodegenerative processes. Knockdown of ATP10B sensitizes cells to oxidative stress and lysosomal dysfunction, which are related to PD (Martin2020Mutated). In rodent models, ATP10B knockdown results in motor deficits and dopaminergic neurodegeneration, similar to symptoms observed in PD patients (SanchizCalvo2024Loss).

Studies in different populations, including a large cohort study in the Chinese mainland, suggest a potential association between ATP10B variants and PD, highlighting its significance as a genetic risk factor for the disease (Zhao2021ATP10B).

## Interactions
ATP10B is known to interact with CDC50A, an essential subunit that guides ATP10B to the late endo-/lysosomal compartments. This interaction is crucial for ATP10B's function as a lipid flippase, facilitating the translocation of glucosylceramide (GluCer) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) across the lysosomal membrane. The interaction between ATP10B and CDC50A has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and split-luciferase protein complementation assays in HEK293T cells, indicating a stable and necessary partnership for ATP10B's activity and localization (Martin2020Mutated).

Mutations in ATP10B that impair its ATPase activity do not affect its ability to interact with CDC50A, suggesting that the interaction is independent of ATP10B's catalytic function (Martin2020Mutated). The presence of CDC50A is also required for ATP10B's proper subcellular localization and function, as it ensures the exit of ATP10B from the endoplasmic reticulum and its correct positioning within the cell (Wouters2023The). There is no evidence from the provided context that ATP10B interacts with nucleic acids.
