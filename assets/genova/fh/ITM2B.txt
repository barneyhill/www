# ITM2B

## Overview
The ITM2B gene encodes the integral membrane protein 2B, also known as BRI2, which is a type II transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Brichos domain, which plays a crucial role in modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid-beta aggregation, processes that are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Peng2010The). ITM2B is widely expressed in the brain and is implicated in synaptic transmission, neuritogenesis, and mitochondrial functions (Baron2017Expression; Wohlschlegel2021First). Mutations in ITM2B are associated with familial British and Danish dementias, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Martins2021The; Wohlschlegel2021First).

## Structure
The ITM2B gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 266 amino acids. The protein includes a Brichos domain, which is approximately 100 residues long and located in the extracellular region. This domain is evolutionarily conserved and plays a role in modulating amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid-beta aggregation (Peng2010The). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage at three sites: by furin in the C-terminal region, by ADAM10 releasing the Brichos domain, and by SPPL2a/2b liberating the intracellular domain (Peng2010The).

The primary structure of ITM2B includes a single potential N-glycosylation site, which is a common post-translational modification that can affect protein folding and stability (Pittois1998cDNA). The secondary structure is mainly helical, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis (Peng2010The). The protein is primarily monomeric, but multimeric forms can be removed by reduction, suggesting some level of quaternary structure interaction (Peng2010The).

ITM2B is also known to have splice variant isoforms, which can influence its function and localization, and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as familial British and Danish dementia (Baron2015The).

## Function
The ITM2B gene encodes the BRI2 protein, a type II transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ITM2B is widely expressed in the brain, including cortical and hippocampal neurons, Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum, and neurons in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem (Baron2017Expression). ITM2B plays a crucial role in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), acting as a physiological inhibitor of APP processing and amyloid-beta (Aβ) generation. It interferes with the docking of secretases to APP, thereby reducing the production of amyloidogenic peptides, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Matsuda2008BRI2).

BRI2, the protein product of ITM2B, is also involved in neuritogenesis and synaptic transmission. It promotes neurite outgrowth and interacts with cytoskeletal proteins, indicating a role in cytoskeleton organization and microtubule-based processes. BRI2 is implicated in synaptic plasticity by affecting AMPA and NMDA receptor trafficking and is a component of GABA B receptors, potentially influencing their axonal targeting (Martins2021The). Additionally, ITM2B is associated with mitochondrial functions, particularly in the retina, where it interacts with proteins involved in cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (Wohlschlegel2021First).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITM2B gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Familial British Dementia (FBD) and Familial Danish Dementia (FDD). These conditions are characterized by early-onset progressive dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spasticity, with shared neurological features such as severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy and neurofibrillary tangles similar to those found in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Martins2021The; Wohlschlegel2021First). The mutations result in the production of longer protein products, leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates in the brain (Wohlschlegel2021First). In FBD and FDD, the mutated forms of BRI2, known as ABriPP and ADanPP, are associated with the secretion of peptides that contribute to the pathogenesis of these dementias (Del2014Role).

Alterations in ITM2B expression are also implicated in Alzheimer's disease. ITM2B is thought to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, potentially attenuating AD development. Loss of ITM2B function may lead to neurological impairment due to the release of toxic APP metabolites (Baron2017Expression). Additionally, ITM2B-related retinal dystrophy is linked to a missense mutation, which is characterized by retinal ganglion cell abnormalities and inner retinal dysfunctions, but not dementia (Wohlschlegel2021First).

## Interactions
ITM2B, also known as integral membrane protein 2B, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP), forming a complex that inhibits amyloid-β production, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease. This interaction is specific to the mature, glycosylated forms of AβPP and occurs in cellular membranes, with BRI2 preferentially interacting with C99 and larger AβPP COOH-terminal fragments (Matsuda2005The; Fotinopoulou2005BRI2).

In the human retina, ITM2B interacts with a wide range of proteins, including those involved in mitochondrial functions, cytoskeleton organization, and protein translation. Notably, ITM2B interacts with COX5B, a mitochondrial protein, and is associated with proteins like ADD1, PLEC, and VIM, suggesting roles in mitochondrial and cytoskeletal functions (Wohlschlegel2021First).

ITM2B also forms complexes with APLP2 and GABA b receptors in the brain, indicating its involvement in neuronal functions such as neurite outgrowth. The interaction with APLP2 is particularly significant, as its deletion in the mouse retina results in a phenotype similar to retinal dystrophy observed in humans with specific ITM2B mutations (Wohlschlegel2021First).
