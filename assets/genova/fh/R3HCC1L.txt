# R3HCC1L

## Overview
R3HCC1L is a gene that encodes the protein R3H domain and coiled-coil containing 1 like, which is characterized by the presence of an R3H domain and coiled-coil motifs. These structural features suggest that the protein may be involved in nucleic acid binding and protein-protein interactions, although its specific biological functions are not yet fully elucidated. The gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and infectious diseases, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research. Studies have suggested that alterations in the expression of R3HCC1L may influence tumor progression and immune responses, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood (Rangel2016Transposon; Vahedi2024Strong; Li2022Genomewide).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The R3HCC1L gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a study identified R3HCC1L as part of a DNA methylation signature that predicts clinical outcomes for patients treated with bevacizumab. Patients classified as high-risk based on this signature, which includes R3HCC1L, exhibited significantly inferior progression-free survival and overall survival (Li2022Genomewide).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), R3HCC1L was identified through transposon mutagenesis as a gene that, when silenced, reduces tumor growth, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Rangel2016Transposon). However, the specific clinical significance of R3HCC1L in breast cancer remains unclear (Rangel2016Transposon).

Additionally, R3HCC1L has been associated with susceptibility to infectious pneumonia, indicating a possible role in the immune response to respiratory pathogens. The molecular mechanisms by which R3HCC1L influences these processes are not fully understood and require further investigation (Vahedi2024Strong).

Overall, while R3HCC1L is linked to several conditions, the precise clinical implications and mechanisms of its involvement are still being explored.
