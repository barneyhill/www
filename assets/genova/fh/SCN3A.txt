# SCN3A

## Overview
The SCN3A gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 3, known as NaV1.3, which is a critical component of neuronal function. NaV1.3 is a transmembrane protein that forms part of the voltage-gated sodium channel family, playing a pivotal role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. This channel is particularly important during fetal brain development, where it is highly expressed in regions such as the cortical plate and outer subventricular zone, contributing to processes like cortical folding and oral motor function (Smith2018Sodium). Structurally, NaV1.3 consists of four homologous domains, each with six transmembrane segments, forming a complex that interacts with auxiliary β-subunits to regulate its kinetics and expression (Li2022Structural). The channel's function and regulation are further modulated by interactions with proteins such as calmodulin, which influence its gating processes (Wu2021Calmodulin). Mutations in SCN3A have been linked to various neurological disorders, including epilepsy and developmental encephalopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Zaman2020SCN3A‐Related).

## Structure
The SCN3A gene encodes the NaV1.3 voltage-gated sodium channel, which is crucial for neuronal function. The protein structure of NaV1.3 includes four homologous domains (DI-DIV), each consisting of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (Smith2018Sodium). These segments form the channel's pore-forming structure, with the first four segments in each domain forming the voltage-sensor domain and the remaining segments forming the pore module (Li2022Structural). The α-subunit of NaV1.3 is organized in a domain-swapped manner, similar to other mammalian NaV channels (Li2022Structural).

The NaV1.3 channel interacts with β-subunits, which regulate its kinetics and cell surface expression. The β1 subunit interacts extensively with the α-subunit, while the β2 subunit shows weak and fragmented density, suggesting mobility or weak binding (Li2022Structural). The inactivation gate IFM motif binds tightly to its receptor site, resulting in a non-conductive intracellular activation gate (Li2022Structural).

Post-translational modifications and alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context. The structural insights into NaV1.3 are significant for understanding its function and for developing isoform-selective drugs (Li2022Structural).

## Function
The SCN3A gene encodes the sodium channel NaV1.3, which is crucial for the regulation of sodium influx in neurons. This channel is involved in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, contributing to neuronal excitability and signal transmission. In healthy human cells, SCN3A channels are characterized by a larger, non-inactivating persistent current (I-NaP), which is essential for maintaining normal neuronal activity and development, particularly in the cerebral cortex and oral motor areas (Smith2018Sodium).

SCN3A is robustly expressed in the human brain during fetal development, especially in regions like the cortical plate and outer subventricular zone, suggesting its role in cerebral cortical development and processes such as cortical folding and oral motor function (Smith2018Sodium). The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with high levels during fetal periods and significant downregulation after birth, indicating its primary function during early brain development (Smith2018Sodium).

In the gastrointestinal tract, SCN3A is expressed in enterochromaffin (EC) cells, where it is crucial for electrical excitability and serotonin release. This function is important for the regulation of serotonin, which has various physiological roles in the gastrointestinal system (Strege2017Sodium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCN3A gene, which encodes the sodium channel NaV1.3, are associated with a range of neurological disorders. These include developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), polymicrogyria (PMG), and various forms of epilepsy, such as focal epilepsy and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Zaman2020SCN3A‐Related; Zaman2018Mutations; Vanoye2014Novel). SCN3A mutations can lead to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function effects, impacting neuronal excitability and contributing to seizure disorders (Ademuwagun2021Voltage). 

Specific mutations, such as p.Ile875Thr, have been linked to severe phenotypes, including diffuse cortical malformations and severe neurocognitive impairment (Zaman2020SCN3A‐Related). These mutations often result in increased persistent sodium currents, which enhance neuronal excitability and may lead to conditions like PMG and severe seizures (Smith2018Sodium). 

Alterations in SCN3A expression can also affect brain development, as seen in cases of microcephaly and developmental delays (Lamar2017SCN3A). The gene's role in regulating cerebral cortical folding and oral motor development further underscores its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Smith2018Sodium).

## Interactions
The SCN3A gene encodes the NaV1.3 sodium channel, which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. NaV1.3 interacts with auxiliary subunits, such as the β1 and β2 subunits, which modulate its activity and are crucial for its proper function in neuronal excitability (Li2022Structural). These interactions are important for the modulation of the channel by clinical drugs and selective antagonists, as demonstrated in studies using cryo-EM to resolve the NaV1.3/β1/β2 complex (Li2022Structural).

Calmodulin (CaM) is another protein that interacts with NaV1.3, modulating its gating process. This interaction occurs through the CaM-binding IQ domain located in the C-terminal domain of the sodium channels, which is essential for channel inactivation. The interaction is Ca2+-independent and involves conserved residues forming an α-helix that binds to CaM (Wu2021Calmodulin).

Additionally, NaV1.3 is involved in a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network in breast cancer, where it interacts with long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2 and the miRNA hsa-miR-106a-5p. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism affecting SCN3A expression in cancer pathogenesis (Wu2019Long).
