# SLC4A7

## Overview
The SLC4A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 4 member 7, commonly known as the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1. This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in maintaining intracellular pH balance by mediating the electroneutral exchange of sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions across the cell membrane (Choi2021Sodium; Park2017Alternative). NBCn1 is expressed in various tissues, including vascular smooth muscle, cardiac, and neuronal tissues, where it contributes to essential physiological processes such as vascular tone regulation, cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, and neuronal signaling (Ng2017Increased; Boedtkjer2008Antibodyindependent). The protein's structure is characterized by multiple transmembrane helices and cytosolic domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to the plasma membrane (Severin2022Dynamic). Alterations in the SLC4A7 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including Usher syndrome type II, retinal dystrophy, hypertension, and breast cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Axelsen2024Antibodies; Christensen2013Na+; Ahn2020Novel; Ng2017Increased).

## Structure
The SLC4A7 gene encodes the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1, which is part of the solute carrier family 4. NBCn1 is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes approximately 14 transmembrane helices, a long N-terminal cytosolic domain, and a short C-terminal cytosolic domain (Severin2022Dynamic). The N-terminal domain is about 600 amino acids long and includes a proximal part predicted to be largely unfolded, followed by two core interacting regions linked by a variable loop (Severin2022Dynamic). The C-terminal domain contains a short proximal α-helical motif crucial for plasma membrane localization (Severin2022Dynamic).

NBCn1 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms due to alternative promoters and splicing, producing variants with different N-terminal sequences, such as 'MEAD' and 'MERF' (Liu2013Effects). The protein also includes optional structural elements like cassettes I-IV, which affect its surface abundance and transport activity (Liu2013Effects). The transmembrane domain, particularly the fourth extracellular loop, is essential for the protein's electrogenicity (Liu2013Effects).

NBCn1 forms homodimers in the membrane, and its localization is influenced by specific N- and C-terminal motifs, including the highly conserved RELSWLD motif (Severin2022Dynamic). The protein's structure and function are regulated by interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation (Liu2013Effects).

## Function
The SLC4A7 gene encodes the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular pH balance by facilitating the electroneutral uptake of sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions into cells (Choi2021Sodium; Park2017Alternative). This transporter is active in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells, where it plays a significant role in regulating pH and ion homeostasis (Ng2017Increased; Boedtkjer2008Antibodyindependent).

In vascular tissues, NBCn1 contributes to the regulation of vascular tone and contractility, which is essential for blood pressure control (Ng2017Increased). In cardiac tissues, it is involved in protecting excitation-contraction coupling, particularly in the t-tubules (Park2017Alternative). In the nervous system, NBCn1 influences pH regulation in neurons, which is important for neuronal signaling and protection against excitotoxicity (Boedtkjer2008Antibodyindependent).

NBCn1 is also implicated in the transepithelial transport of bicarbonate in the kidney and gastrointestinal tract, contributing to acid-base balance and protection against acid-induced injury (Boedtkjer2008Antibodyindependent). The protein's localization to the plasma membrane is crucial for its function, and it interacts with various proteins to maintain cellular polarity and pH-sensitive processes (Severin2022Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC4A7 gene, which encodes the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1, have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In knockout mouse models, deletion of SLC4A7 results in characteristics of Usher syndrome type II, including progressive hearing loss due to the loss of inner and outer hair cells in the inner ear. This is attributed to disrupted sodium bicarbonate flux affecting pH-sensitive potassium secretion into the endolymph (Christensen2013Na+). 

A novel mutation in SLC4A7 has been associated with autosomal recessive progressive rod-cone dystrophy, a type of inherited retinal dystrophy. This mutation leads to progressive night blindness and visual field loss, highlighting the importance of ion homeostasis in photoreceptor function (Ahn2020Novel).

Variations in the SLC4A7 gene have also been linked to blood pressure regulation. A specific genetic variant, rs13082711, is associated with increased SLC4A7 expression and higher intracellular pH in vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to hypertension (Ng2017Increased). 

In breast cancer, NBCn1 is implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. High-affinity antibodies targeting NBCn1 have been shown to inhibit its activity, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for breast cancer treatment (Axelsen2024Antibodies).

## Interactions
The SLC4A7 gene encodes the sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter NBCn1, which participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function and localization. NBCn1 interacts with the scaffold protein RACK1, which is important for its trafficking to the plasma membrane (Severin2022Dynamic). It also associates with proteins involved in cell adhesion and polarity, such as E-cadherin, DLG1, and components of the Scribble complex and adherens junctions, including LLGL1, α-catenin-2, p120 catenin, β-catenin-1, afadin, non-muscle myosin-IIA, vinculin, and α-actinin (Severin2022Dynamic).

NBCn1 interacts with Rho GTPases and F-actin regulators, localizing to leading edge protrusions in migrating epithelial cells. It shows strong interactions with Rho GTPase family members such as Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoC, as well as with Arp2/3 and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which are key regulators of lamellipodia and filopodia formation (Severin2022Dynamic). Additionally, NBCn1 is found in spindle-organizing Rab11-positive endosomes, and Rab11 is identified as a strong potential interactor, confirmed through mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation analyses (Severin2022Dynamic). These interactions highlight NBCn1's role in cell polarity, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular trafficking.
