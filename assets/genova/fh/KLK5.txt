# KLK5

## Overview
KLK5, or kallikrein-related peptidase 5, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes, particularly in skin homeostasis and immune defense. The protein product, kallikrein-related peptidase 5, is characterized by its trypsin-like activity and is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, requiring proteolytic activation. KLK5 plays a pivotal role in skin desquamation by participating in a proteolytic cascade that regulates the shedding of dead skin cells. It also activates the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), influencing intracellular signaling pathways. Beyond its physiological roles, KLK5 is implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and skin disorders such as Netherton syndrome, where its dysregulation can contribute to disease progression and severity (Debela2008Structures; Kalinska2016Kallikreins; Kasparek2017KLK5).

## Structure
KLK5, or kallikrein-related peptidase 5, is a serine protease with a trypsin-like catalytic domain. It is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and activated by proteolytic cleavage, often involving trypsin-like specificity (Debela2008Structures). The primary structure of KLK5 includes a long propeptide of 37 amino acids, which is longer than those of related peptidases KLK4, KLK6, and KLK7 (Debela2008Structures). 

The secondary structure of KLK5 is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine proteases. The tertiary structure is stabilized by several disulfide bridges and features a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Debela2008Structures). KLK5 also contains an internal salt bridge important for zymogen activation (Debela2008Structures).

KLK5's substrate specificity is influenced by its structural components, particularly the S1 and S2 subsites, which show specificity for certain residues. The S1 pocket can accommodate Lys to some extent, while the S2 subsite is wedge-shaped and more polar compared to KLK4 (Debela2008Structures). KLK5 is involved in physiological processes such as skin desquamation and immune defense, and it can induce signaling events via proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) (Debela2008Structures).

## Function
KLK5, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 5, is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in skin physiology, particularly in the process of desquamation, which involves the shedding of dead skin cells from the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum (Kalinska2016Kallikreins; Shaw2007Distribution). This enzyme is active in the extracellular space of the epidermis, where it contributes to maintaining skin barrier function and homeostasis (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK5 is involved in the activation of the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) system, which is a G protein-coupled receptor system that leads to intracellular calcium release and signaling to downstream processes (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). It also plays a role in the enzymatic processing of antimicrobial peptides, such as converting the inactive proform hCAP18 into the active peptide LL-37, which is important for innate immunity (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated).

KLK5 is part of a proteolytic cascade in the skin, where it can auto-activate and subsequently activate other kallikrein-related peptidases like KLK7 and KLK14, a process influenced by the pH gradient in the epidermis (Yoon2007Activation; Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated). This cascade is essential for regulating skin desquamation and maintaining skin health.

## Clinical Significance
KLK5, a serine protease, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, KLK5 is notably implicated in breast, ovarian, and testicular cancers. In breast cancer, high KLK5 expression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in early-stage tumors, and is a predictor of reduced disease-free and overall survival (Paliouras2007Human; Yousef2002Human). In ovarian cancer, KLK5 is overexpressed in malignant tissues, correlating with higher tumor grade and stage, and serves as an independent prognostic marker for aggressive forms of the disease (Kim2001Human). In testicular cancer, KLK5 expression is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues, suggesting its potential as a favorable prognostic marker in late-stage carcinomas (Paliouras2007Human).

KLK5 is also involved in skin disorders, particularly Netherton syndrome (NS), a severe genetic condition characterized by skin barrier defects. The hyperactivity of KLK5, along with KLK7, contributes to the pathogenesis of NS by disrupting the epidermal barrier and initiating inflammation. Simultaneous inactivation of KLK5 and KLK7 in mouse models can rescue the lethal phenotype associated with NS, highlighting their critical role in the disease (Kasparek2017KLK5).

## Interactions
KLK5, a serine protease, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in skin physiology and cancer progression. KLK5 can activate other kallikreins, such as pro-KLK7 and pro-KLK14, forming part of a proteolytic cascade that contributes to skin desquamation by degrading corneodesmosomal proteins (Debela2008Structures; Emami2007New). It also autoactivates and can activate pro-KLK11, indicating its role as a general activator within the kallikrein family (Debela2008Structures).

KLK5 interacts with proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), inducing signaling events that may affect various cellular processes (Debela2008Structures). It forms stable complexes with serpins, specifically alpha-2-antiplasmin and antithrombin, which inhibit its activity (Michael2005Biochemical). KLK5 is also regulated by serine protease inhibitors like LEKTI, which modulate its activity in skin desquamation and immune defense (Emami2007New).

In cancer, KLK5 is involved in the cleavage of extracellular matrix components, influencing processes like angiogenesis and fibrinolysis, and potentially interacting with other kallikreins in proteolytic cascades (Papachristopoulou2019Uncovering; Michael2005Biochemical).
