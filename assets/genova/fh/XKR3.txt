# XKR3

## Overview
XKR3 is a gene that encodes the protein XK related 3, which is part of the XK/Kell complex. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in various cellular processes. The gene has garnered attention due to its potential role in health conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and carotid paragangliomas. A notable single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within XKR3, rs9605146, has been identified as a genetic marker for increased susceptibility to ARDS, highlighting its clinical significance (Shortt2014Identification). Although the specific functions and interactions of the XK related 3 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in the XK/Kell complex suggests a potential link to McLeod syndrome, a disorder characterized by neurological and muscular abnormalities (Snezhkina2019Novel). Further research is necessary to clarify the biological roles and clinical implications of XKR3 and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
The XKR3 gene has been implicated in several health conditions, primarily through its association with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9605146, in the XKR3 gene has been identified as a potential genetic marker for increased susceptibility to ARDS. This SNP results in a deleterious amino acid change from proline to leucine, which is predicted to have a significant impact on the protein's function (Shortt2014Identification). The association of rs9605146 with ARDS is particularly notable in the general population and various subgroups, although it does not appear to affect African Americans with sepsis or pneumonia etiology (Shortt2014Identification).

In addition to its role in ARDS, the XKR3 gene has been mentioned in studies of carotid paragangliomas, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Snezhkina2019Novel). The gene is also part of the XK/Kell complex, which is linked to McLeod syndrome, a condition characterized by neurological and muscular abnormalities, though direct associations with XKR3 mutations have not been established (Shortt2014Identification). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of XKR3 mutations.
