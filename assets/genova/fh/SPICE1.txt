# SPICE1

## Overview
SPICE1, or spindle and centriole associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the regulation of spindle assembly and centriole duplication during cell division. The SPICE1 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a significant role in maintaining spindle integrity and ensuring accurate chromosome alignment during mitosis. Its function is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly by Aurora kinases, which are essential for mitotic processes (Deretic2019A). SPICE1 localizes to centrioles and spindles, with its localization influenced by its phosphorylation status, which is necessary for proper spindle architecture and centriole number maintenance (Deretic2019A). The protein's interactions and dynamic phosphorylation are vital for its role in spindle organization and genomic stability, highlighting its importance in cell division and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer (Deretic2019A).

## Function
SPICE1 (spindle and centriole associated protein 1) plays a critical role in cell division by regulating spindle assembly and centriole duplication. It is involved in maintaining spindle integrity and ensuring accurate chromosome alignment during mitosis. SPICE1 contains a microtubule-binding region in its N terminus, and its function is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly by Aurora kinases, which are essential for mitotic processes (Deretic2019A).

In healthy human cells, SPICE1 localizes to centrioles and spindles, with its localization influenced by its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation by Aurora kinases is necessary for SPICE1 to properly associate with the spindle apparatus, contributing to correct spindle architecture and centriole number maintenance (Deretic2019A). Non-phosphorylatable mutants of SPICE1 fail to localize to the spindle, leading to defects such as abnormal centriole numbers and spindle multipolarity, which can result in chromosome misalignment (Deretic2019A).

SPICE1's activity is crucial for proper mitotic progression and genomic stability, as it ensures the correct segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Its dynamic phosphorylation and localization are vital for its role in spindle organization and centriole regulation (Deretic2019A).

## Clinical Significance
SPICE1 (spindle and centriole associated protein 1) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell division processes. In osteosarcoma, SPICE1 is part of a centrosome-related prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes. The model, which includes SPICE1 among five key genes, categorizes patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on a CRMS score. High-risk patients, who exhibit upregulated SPICE1 expression, tend to have a poorer prognosis, indicating that SPICE1 expression levels are associated with disease severity (Zhong2023Deciphering).

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), SPICE1 is significantly upregulated in response to changes in CEMIP expression, a gene known to promote cellular migration and invasion. This suggests that SPICE1 may play a role in the metastatic processes of SCLC, although the specific clinical implications of this upregulation are not fully detailed (Li2020A).

SPICE1 is also a substrate of Aurora kinases, which are crucial for mitosis and genomic stability. Misregulation of SPICE1 phosphorylation by these kinases can lead to spindle architecture defects, chromosome misalignment, and abnormal centriole numbers, potentially contributing to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis (Deretic2019A).

## Interactions
SPICE1 (spindle and centriole associated protein 1) is known to interact with several proteins involved in cell division processes. It has been identified as a substrate of Aurora kinases A and B, which are crucial for its phosphorylation and proper localization during mitosis. Phosphorylation by these kinases is necessary for SPICE1 to associate with the spindle apparatus, while its centriole localization is independent of this phosphorylation (Deretic2019A). 

SPICE1 contains a microtubule-binding region in its N terminus, and its interactions with microtubules are influenced by its phosphorylation status. Non-phosphorylatable mutants of SPICE1 fail to localize to the spindle, remaining at the centrioles, which affects centriole duplication and spindle integrity (Deretic2019A). 

Additionally, SPICE1 has been identified in proximity to CEP120, a protein involved in centriole biogenesis, using the BioID technique. This suggests a potential interaction or close association with CEP120 at the centrosome, a key microtubule organization center (Varnaitė2016Meet). 

These interactions highlight SPICE1's role in maintaining spindle architecture and chromosome alignment, essential for proper cell division.
