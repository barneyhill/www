# CLK1

## Overview
CLK1 (CDC like kinase 1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is a member of the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK) family. The protein product of CLK1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of alternative splicing by phosphorylating serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which are essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA. This process is crucial for generating protein diversity and regulating gene expression. The CLK1 protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with SR proteins to influence splicing activity and cellular distribution. Beyond its role in splicing, CLK1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and the regulation of autophagy. It also acts as a molecular thermometer, modulating splicing in response to circadian body-temperature changes. Due to its involvement in critical cellular functions, CLK1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Song2023Cdc2like; haltenhof2020cdc2).

## Structure
The human CLK1 protein is a member of the Cdc2-like kinase (CLK) family, characterized by a conserved kinase domain and a flexible, unstructured N-terminal region. The N-terminal region resembles RS domains found in SR protein substrates, facilitating interactions with the RS domain of SR proteins, which is crucial for the phosphorylation of the RS domain of SRSF1 (Song2023Cdc2like; Aubol2014Nterminus). The kinase domain of CLK1 displays a typical kinase fold with an N-lobe and a C-lobe connected by a hinge region that forms a conserved ATP binding pocket. The N-lobe includes three β-strands and an α-helix, while the C-lobe contains three conserved structural insertions: a β-hairpin insertion, a LAMMER domain, and a MAPK-like insertion, which are important for substrate recognition and binding specificity (Song2023Cdc2like).

CLK1 is known to auto-phosphorylate at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and phosphorylates serine residues of its substrates (Song2023Cdc2like). The N-terminus of CLK1 induces oligomerization, forming large multimeric structures that enhance its activity towards physiological substrates like SRSF1 (Keshwani2015Nuclear). The crystal structure of human CLK1, excluding the N-terminus, is available under PDB ID: 6I5H (Song2023Cdc2like).

## Function
CLK1 (CDC like kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing by phosphorylating serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. This phosphorylation is essential for the proper splicing of pre-mRNA, which allows for the generation of multiple mRNA and protein products from a single gene, thereby contributing to protein diversity and gene expression regulation (Song2023Cdc2like; Funnell2017CLKdependent). CLK1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with SR proteins to facilitate their binding to primary transcripts, influencing splicing activity and cellular distribution (Song2023Cdc2like).

In addition to its role in splicing, CLK1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, particularly peaking in abundance during the G2/M phase (Song2023Cdc2like). It also participates in non-splicing activities such as the activation of Aurora B during cytokinesis and the regulation of autophagy, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and survival (Song2023Cdc2like). CLK1's activity is temperature-sensitive, acting as a molecular thermometer that modulates splicing in response to circadian body-temperature oscillations (haltenhof2020cdc2).

## Clinical Significance
CLK1 (CDC like kinase 1) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA splicing and phosphorylation processes. Alterations in CLK1 expression or activity are associated with several cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and ovarian cancer. In pancreatic cancer, CLK1 promotes cell growth and metastasis by phosphorylating SRSF5, which affects alternative splicing events that enhance cancer progression (Song2023Cdc2like). In gastric cancer, CLK1 is overexpressed, and its inhibition reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Song2023Cdc2like; Babu2020Phosphoproteomic).

CLK1 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease through its role in tau protein hyperphosphorylation and alternative splicing of tau exon 10 (Song2023Cdc2like). In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, CLK1-regulated splicing manipulation contributes to the disease, with CLK1 inhibitors showing potential in promoting exon skipping to produce functional dystrophin protein (Song2023Cdc2like).

In viral infections, CLK1 is implicated in the replication of viruses such as HIV-1, influenza A, and West Nile virus, making it a potential target for antiviral therapies (Song2023Cdc2like). These findings highlight CLK1's significance as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CLK1 (CDC like kinase 1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins that regulate pre-mRNA splicing. It forms a stable complex with SRPK1 (Serine/Arginine Protein Kinase 1) in the nucleus, which is essential for the phosphorylation of SR proteins, such as SRSF1. This interaction is facilitated by the N terminus of CLK1, which binds with high affinity to the SRPK1 kinase domain, playing a crucial role in the phosphorylation cycle of SR proteins and promoting spliceosome assembly (Aubol2016Release).

CLK1 also interacts with the splicing factor U1-70K, encoded by the SNRPN70 gene. It phosphorylates U1-70K at specific serine residues, which is important for its interaction with other proteins like SRSF1 and components of the U1 snRNP complex. This phosphorylation facilitates the stable binding of U1-70K with proteins associated with U1 snRNP, essential for spliceosome assembly (Aubol2021CLK1).

The N-terminus of CLK1 enhances its interaction with SRSF1, promoting hyperphosphorylation and cooperative binding to RNA. This region is crucial for the phosphorylation process and acts as a general activator of RS domain phosphorylation in other SR proteins (Aubol2014Nterminus).
