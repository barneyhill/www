gene encodes a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family. Collapsin response mediator proteins form homo- and hetero-tetramers and facilitate neuron guidance, growth and polarity. The encoded protein promotes microtubule assembly and is required for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse, and also plays a role in synaptic signaling through interactions with calcium channels. This gene has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders, and hyperphosphorylation of the encoded protein may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene.
