# ALG9

## Overview
ALG9 is a gene that encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which is integral to the N-linked glycosylation pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is categorized as a mannosyltransferase and is responsible for the addition of specific mannose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides during their assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. The proper function of ALG9 is essential for the correct glycosylation of proteins, which affects their stability, function, and cellular localization. Mutations in the ALG9 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, such as Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome, and have been implicated in conditions like autosomal dominant polycystic kidney and liver diseases (Boerrigter2023Heterozygosity; Frank2005ALG9; Frank2004Identification).

## Function
The ALG9 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of the seventh and ninth mannose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) during their assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells (Frank2005ALG9; Frank2004Identification). The ALG9 enzyme's activity is dolichylphosphomannose-dependent, and it ensures the proper assembly of the oligosaccharide precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, which is critical for protein glycosylation (Frank2005ALG9).

In healthy human cells, ALG9's function is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins, impacting their stability, function, and localization. This process is vital for various cellular activities, including protein folding, quality control, and cell-cell communication (Tham2015A). The enzyme's activity ensures that only fully assembled oligosaccharides are transferred to proteins, which is crucial for determining whether glycoproteins are exported or degraded (Frank2005ALG9). Deficiencies in ALG9 can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal glycosylation patterns and preventing associated disorders (Haeuptle2009Congenital).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG9 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Autosomal recessive loss-of-function variants in ALG9 cause congenital disorder of glycosylation type IL (CDG-IL), also known as Gillessen-Kaesbach-Nishimura syndrome. This condition presents with a range of symptoms, including facial dysmorphism, muscular hypotonia, epileptic seizures, developmental delay, cardiac failure, and skeletal dysplasia. Some patients also exhibit renal cysts and mild to moderate hepatomegaly (Vleugels2009Quality; Boerrigter2023Heterozygosity).

Heterozygous pathogenic variants in ALG9 have been linked to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). A novel heterozygous missense variant in ALG9 has been associated with ADPLD without kidney cysts, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of ALG9-related conditions (Boerrigter2023Heterozygosity).

The ALG9 gene is crucial for the proper glycosylation of proteins, and mutations can lead to the accumulation of truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharides, affecting protein folding and degradation. This disruption in glycosylation pathways contributes to the clinical manifestations observed in patients with ALG9 mutations (Vleugels2009Quality; Tham2015A).
