# ANXA2

## Overview
The ANXA2 gene encodes annexin A2, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. Annexin A2 is characterized by its ability to form a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10, which is essential for its function in vascular fibrinolysis and homeostasis (Grindheim2017Protein; Madureira2011The). This protein is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell shape, influencing cell motility, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Grindheim2017Protein). ANXA2 is also implicated in cancer progression, where its overexpression is associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis (Ning2023ANXA2). Additionally, ANXA2 has been linked to cardiovascular diseases through its role in regulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (Fairoozy2017Identifying). The multifunctional nature of annexin A2 underscores its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts.

## Structure
Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a protein characterized by a core domain composed of four annexin repeats, each approximately 70 amino acids long, forming a consensus sequence known as the 'endonexin fold' that harbors the Ca2+ binding site (Schulz2007Annexin). The protein is almost entirely alpha-helical, with each domain consisting of five helices, four of which are oriented (anti-) parallel and the fifth perpendicular to them (Schulz2007Annexin). The molecular structure of ANXA2 is planar and slightly curved, with a convex surface that interacts with phospholipid membranes and a concave surface facing the cytosol (Waisman1995Annexin).

ANXA2 can form a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 (p11), resulting from the attachment of two ANXA2 subunits to the p11 dimer (Schulz2007Annexin). This complex is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane bridging and cytoskeletal interactions (Waisman1995Annexin). The N-terminal domain of ANXA2 contains phosphorylation sites, which regulate its interaction with other proteins and its structural conformation (Ecsédi2017Regulation). Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as Tyr24, affects the structure and flexibility of ANXA2, influencing its regulatory mechanisms (Ecsédi2017Regulation).

## Function
Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in vascular fibrinolysis and homeostasis. It forms a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10, which is crucial for the activation of plasminogen, a key step in the fibrinolytic cascade. This complex enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, facilitating the breakdown of fibrin clots and maintaining blood fluidity (Madureira2011The). ANXA2 acts as a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), promoting plasmin generation on the surface of endothelial cells, which is essential for balancing coagulation and fibrinolysis (Flood2011The; Ling2004Annexin).

ANXA2 is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. It is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, influencing cell motility, proliferation, and angiogenesis (Grindheim2017Protein). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell shape, with phosphorylation at specific sites affecting its interaction with other proteins and its cellular functions (Grindheim2017Protein). ANXA2's role in stabilizing S100A10 and directing its binding to cellular membranes is crucial for its function in fibrinolysis (Madureira2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The ANXA2 gene is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In cancers such as glioma, cervical cancer, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer, ANXA2 is abnormally expressed, serving as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and immune infiltration (Ning2023ANXA2). High ANXA2 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival in several cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma and low-grade glioma (Ning2023ANXA2). 

ANXA2 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis. It negatively correlates with E-cadherin expression in breast cancer and enhances EMT through pathways involving STAT3, Slug, and EGF (Wang2019Crucial). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ANXA2 overexpression facilitates invasion and metastasis, and its role in EMT is crucial for cancer progression (Zhang2012The).

In addition to cancer, ANXA2 is involved in regulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Variants in the ANXA2 gene, such as the SNP rs17845226, have been associated with changes in LDL-C levels and an increased risk of coronary heart disease (Fairoozy2017Identifying). These findings highlight ANXA2's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is involved in numerous protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. ANXA2 forms a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10, known as AIIt, which is crucial for membrane organization and cytoskeletal interactions. This complex is involved in the repair of plasma membranes and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, particularly in cancer cells (Myrvang2013Protein; Liu2014Annexin). ANXA2 also interacts with Ebp1, a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and invasion through the suppression of ANXA2 protein levels (Zhang2015A).

ANXA2 is part of a protein complex with HE4 and MMP2, which promotes cell migration in various malignant cells (Wang2019Interaction). It also interacts with MIEN1, enhancing ANXA2 phosphorylation and promoting its translocation to the cell surface, which facilitates breast cancer cell migration and invasion (Kpetemey2015MIEN1). Additionally, ANXA2 binds to nucleolin, poly (A)-binding protein, and elongation factor-1α, among others, indicating its involvement in RNA-related processes and ribosome structure (Zhang2015A). These interactions highlight ANXA2's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and cancer progression.
