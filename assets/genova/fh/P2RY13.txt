# P2RY13

## Overview
The P2RY13 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y13, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the purinergic receptor family. This receptor is primarily activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including cholesterol metabolism, insulin secretion, and bone remodeling. The P2Y13 receptor is expressed in several tissues, such as the spleen, brain, liver, and pancreas, and plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways by coupling with Gi proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase and activate the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Its involvement in cholesterol transport and immune response modulation underscores its importance in metabolic and inflammatory disorders (Kyrargyri2019P2Y13; Duparc2024P2Y13; PérezSen2017An).

## Structure
The P2RY13 gene encodes the P2Y13 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the purinergic receptor family. This receptor is characterized by the typical GPCR structure, which includes seven transmembrane alpha-helices (Martínez‐Ramírez2015Purinergic). The primary structure of the P2Y13 receptor shares approximately 40-45% amino acid sequence identity with its close relatives, P2Y12 and P2Y14, and less than 20% identity with Gq-coupled P2Y receptors (PérezSen2017An). The amino acid sequence is highly conserved across species, particularly in mammals, with over 95% identity in humans and great apes (PérezSen2017An).

The P2Y13 receptor's tertiary structure is not fully elucidated due to the lack of a crystal structure or homology models, which limits detailed understanding of its 3D conformation (PérezSen2017An). However, it is known to share many key residues with the P2Y12 receptor that are involved in ligand binding, although specific differences at positions F106E, L155I, and T163S may account for pharmacological variations (PérezSen2017An). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are likely to affect the receptor's activity and localization, as is common with GPCRs, though specific modifications for P2Y13 are not detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The P2RY13 gene encodes the P2Y13 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. This receptor is primarily activated by ADP and is expressed in tissues such as the spleen, brain, bone marrow, liver, pancreas, and heart (PérezSen2017An). In the brain, P2Y13 receptors are found in glial cells, including microglia, where they regulate morphology and surveillance, influencing the release of cytokines like interleukin-1β (Kyrargyri2019P2Y13).

P2Y13 receptors play a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism by facilitating the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for elimination, a process involving HDL endocytosis (PérezSen2017An). They also influence insulin secretion by inhibiting insulin release in pancreatic β cells and are involved in bone formation and remodeling by affecting osteoblast differentiation (PérezSen2017An).

At the molecular level, P2Y13 receptors couple with Gi proteins, leading to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and decreased cAMP production. This receptor is also involved in the activation of the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling axis, contributing to cell survival and neuroprotection (PérezSen2017An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RY13 gene, which encodes the P2Y13 receptor, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The P2Y13 receptor plays a significant role in cholesterol metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), affecting hepatic HDL uptake and biliary lipid secretion. This impairment is linked to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and fatty liver disease, as seen in P2Y13 receptor-deficient mice (Fabre2010P2Y13; Duparc2024P2Y13).

In humans, variations in P2RY13 expression are associated with metabolic conditions. A negative correlation between P2RY13 mRNA expression in adipose tissue and lipolytic activity suggests that alterations in P2RY13 can influence adipocyte lipolysis, potentially exacerbating insulin resistance and liver steatosis (Duparc2024P2Y13). P2Y13 receptor deficiency also leads to increased lipolysis and systemic inflammation, contributing to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (Duparc2024P2Y13).

The P2RY13 gene has been identified as a putative asthma risk gene, with polymorphisms potentially promoting airway inflammation, although the specific pathophysiological consequences in humans remain unclear (PérezSen2017An). These findings highlight the clinical significance of P2RY13 in metabolic and inflammatory disorders.

## Interactions
P2RY13, a G-protein-coupled receptor, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It primarily interacts with G-proteins, including Gi, Gs, and Gq, to mediate intracellular responses such as the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (PérezSen2017An). P2RY13 shares a high degree of sequence homology with P2Y12 and has a similar pharmacological profile, suggesting evolutionary gene duplication (PérezSen2017An).

P2RY13 is known to interact with the immune checkpoint gene PD-L2, indicating its role in immune response modulation (Wang2021Screening). It also forms part of the G-protein coupled receptor pathway, sharing interactions with S1PR1, which is involved in signal transduction and interacts with tumor-related genes such as AKT1, STAT3, and CXCR4 (Wang2021Screening).

In microglial cells, P2RY13 interacts with other purinergic receptors, such as P2Y12, affecting microglial morphology and cytokine release (Kyrargyri2019P2Y13). The receptor's activation can lead to the inhibition of calcium channel activity and influence cytoskeletal reorganization through RhoA activation (PérezSen2017An). These interactions highlight P2RY13's role in various physiological processes, including immune response, neuroprotection, and lipid metabolism.
