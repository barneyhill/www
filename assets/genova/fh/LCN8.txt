# LCN8

## Overview
LCN8 is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 8, a member of the lipocalin family, which is known for its role in binding and transporting small hydrophobic molecules. Lipocalin 8 is characterized by a conserved eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structure, which forms a ligand-binding pocket typical of lipocalins (Wen2021Deficiency; Chandrasekaran2024Structure). This protein is primarily expressed in the epididymis, where it plays a significant role in sperm maturation by maintaining sperm quality and preventing premature acrosome reactions (Wen2021Deficiency; Suzuki2004Molecular). Although LCN8 is not essential for basic reproductive function, as evidenced by normal fertility in knockout mice, it is crucial for optimal sperm quality (Wen2021Deficiency). Beyond its reproductive functions, LCN8 has been implicated in various diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels may influence disease progression and response to treatment (Liu2018Targeting; Li2021Cancer).

## Structure
Lipocalin 8 (LCN8) is a member of the lipocalin family, characterized by a conserved molecular structure that includes an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel. This β-barrel forms a cup-shaped ligand-binding pocket, or calyx, which is typical of lipocalins and allows them to bind small hydrophobic molecules (Wen2021Deficiency; Chandrasekaran2024Structure). The primary structure of LCN8 consists of amino acid sequences that contribute to its specific folding and function, although detailed sequence information is not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of LCN8 is defined by the β-barrel configuration, which is crucial for its role in transporting hydrophobic substances such as retinoids within the epididymis (Chandrasekaran2024Structure). This structure is highly conserved among lipocalins, despite significant sequence heterogeneity across the family (Du2015A).

LCN8 does not appear to have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as the context does not mention any such assembly. The protein's function and expression are influenced by hormonal changes, as its expression in the epididymis is affected by castration and not restored by testosterone administration (Wen2021Deficiency).

## Function
LCN8, a member of the lipocalin family, plays a crucial role in the maturation of sperm within the epididymis. It is specifically expressed in the initial segment of the caput epididymis, where it is involved in maintaining sperm quality by preventing premature acrosome reactions and ensuring proper sperm morphology and motility (Wen2021Deficiency; Suzuki2004Molecular). LCN8 is hypothesized to transport small hydrophobic molecules, potentially including retinoids, which are important for regulating gene expression in the epididymis (Wen2021Deficiency; Chandrasekaran2024Structure). 

The protein's function is linked to its ability to bind and transport these molecules, contributing to the homeostasis of the epididymal luminal microenvironment, which is essential for sperm maturation (Wen2021Deficiency). The lipocalin family, to which LCN8 belongs, is characterized by a conserved structure that facilitates the binding of hydrophobic ligands, allowing these proteins to act as transporters and modulators of various physiological processes (Charkoftaki2019Update). Despite its critical role in sperm maturation, LCN8 knockout mice exhibit normal fertility, suggesting that while LCN8 is important for optimal sperm quality, it is not essential for basic reproductive function (Wen2021Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
LCN8 (lipocalin 8) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), LCN8 is identified as an upregulated gene in patients with a high mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi), which is associated with poorer prognosis. This suggests that LCN8 may play a role in the stemness characteristics or immune response in this cancer subtype (Li2021Cancer).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LCN8 is downregulated, but its expression is upregulated following treatment with PEN-FFW, a pharmacologic peptide that disrupts the SALL4-RBBp4/HDAC/NuRD interaction. This upregulation indicates that LCN8 may be involved in reversing the repressive function of SALL4, potentially contributing to apoptosis and enhanced cell adhesion in cancer cells (Liu2018Targeting).

In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), LCN8 is noted for its high transcription activation, suggesting a potential role in leukemia pathobiology, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (trentin2009two). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of LCN8 gene mutations or expression alterations remains under investigation, with further research needed to fully understand its role in disease.
