# MAT2A

## Overview
Methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) is a gene that encodes the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, which plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) from methionine and ATP. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase, specifically involved in methyl group transfer, and is essential for numerous methylation reactions that regulate gene expression, protein function, and lipid metabolism (Ramani2017Methionine; Nordgren2011Methionine). MAT2A is predominantly expressed in nonhepatic tissues and forms a functional homotetramer, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Murray2016Crystallography). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its interaction with the regulatory subunit MAT2B, enhancing its stability and function (Wan2024MAT2B). Dysregulation of MAT2A has been implicated in various cancers, where it influences cell growth, survival, and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ramani2017Methionine; Chu2021MAT2A).

## Structure
The MAT2A gene encodes the methionine adenosyltransferase 2A enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) from methionine and ATP. The primary structure of MAT2A consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function (Markham2008Structurefunction).

In terms of tertiary structure, MAT2A forms a functional enzyme that is often organized as a homotetramer in its quaternary structure. This tetrameric form is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing the enzyme to efficiently catalyze the formation of SAMe (Murray2016Crystallography). The enzyme's active site is characterized by a gating loop that regulates substrate access, which is essential for the catalytic mechanism (Murray2016Crystallography).

MAT2A also contains specific domains, such as the Rossmann fold, which is common in enzymes that bind nucleotides like ATP. This structural feature is important for the enzyme's function in SAMe synthesis (Shafqat2013Insight). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the enzyme's activity and stability (González2012NADP+). Additionally, splice variants of MAT2A can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties, potentially affecting its role in various tissues (Nordgren2011Methionine).

## Function
The MAT2A gene encodes the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, which is crucial for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the primary methyl donor in numerous methylation reactions. These reactions are essential for the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids, impacting gene expression and cellular metabolism (Ramani2017Methionine; Nordgren2011Methionine). MAT2A is predominantly expressed in nonhepatic tissues and plays a significant role in one-carbon metabolism and methylation processes (Nordgren2011Methionine).

In healthy human cells, MAT2A forms a dimer that associates with the regulatory subunit encoded by MAT2B to form a heterotetramer. This interaction enhances the enzyme's activity and stability by reducing its degradation, thus maintaining adequate levels of SAM for cellular functions (Nordgren2011Methionine). The MAT2A enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the conversion of methionine and ATP into SAM, supporting various methylation reactions critical for cellular homeostasis (Ramani2017Methionine).

The regulation of MAT2A is influenced by several factors, including promoter methylation and histone acetylation, which modulate its expression in response to cellular conditions (Yang2001Role). This regulation ensures that SAM levels remain stable, supporting essential cellular processes and organismal outcomes (MartínezChantar2003Methionine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the MAT2A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In breast cancer, higher expression of MAT2A is linked to poor survival rates, with a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear (C/N) ratio of MAT2A protein correlating with increased invasiveness and worse overall survival. This ratio serves as an independent prognostic marker for breast cancer, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it is associated with worse relapse-free survival (Chu2021MAT2A). MAT2A is also implicated in drug resistance, as it is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells (Chu2021MAT2A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a switch from MAT1A to MAT2A/MAT2B is observed during liver dedifferentiation, contributing to cancer progression. MAT2A expression is induced by growth factors and interacts with polyamine biosynthesis, enhancing cell growth and promoting transcription through a feed-forward mechanism (Ramani2017Methionine). Additionally, MAT2A is involved in chemoresistance in liver cancer cells through post-translational modifications that stabilize the protein (Ramani2017Methionine).

In cervical cancer, MAT2A interacts with PDCD6, facilitating its methylation and stabilization, which promotes cell growth under glucose deprivation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell survival and proliferation under metabolic stress, highlighting MAT2A as a potential therapeutic target (Luo2022MAT2A).

## Interactions
MAT2A, the gene encoding methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and stability. MAT2A forms a complex with the regulatory subunit MAT2B, which modulates its catalytic activity and stabilizes the protein in an NADP+-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a key methyl donor in cellular methylation processes (Wan2024MAT2B).

MAT2A also interacts with the mRNA-binding protein HuR, which influences mRNA stabilization and cell cycle progression (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). In the context of cancer, MAT2A interacts with the oncoprotein MafK, acting as a corepressor in gene repression activities (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). Additionally, MAT2A is involved in a complex with Cullin 3 (CUL3), which facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation, a process influenced by post-translational modifications and nutrient availability (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

In cervical cancer, MAT2A interacts with programmed cell death protein 6 (PDCD6), a relationship enhanced under glucose deprivation. This interaction is mediated by AMPK activation, which facilitates PDCD6 methylation, promoting its stability and supporting cell growth under nutrient stress (Luo2022MAT2A). These interactions highlight MAT2A's role in cellular processes and its potential impact on disease progression.
