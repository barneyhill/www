# KAT6A

## Overview
KAT6A is a gene that encodes the lysine acetyltransferase 6A protein, a member of the MYST family of lysine acetyltransferases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure by acetylating lysine residues on histones and non-histone proteins. KAT6A is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, stem cell maintenance, and cell cycle progression. It forms a tetrameric complex with other proteins, such as BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, which enhances its specificity for histone substrates, particularly acetylating histone H3 tails at lysine residues H3K9 and H3K23. Mutations in the KAT6A gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like Arboleda-Tham syndrome and KAT6A syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delays. Additionally, alterations in KAT6A expression or function are implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease states (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The; Jiang2021A; Kennedy2019KAT6A).

## Structure
The KAT6A protein, encoded by the KAT6A gene, is a member of the MYST family of lysine acetyltransferases and is composed of 2004 amino acids. It shares 60% amino acid identity with its paralog KAT6B (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). The protein features several specific domains, including a highly conserved MYST domain, which contains an Acetyl-CoA-binding motif and a PHD (plant homeodomain)-type zinc finger domain. This domain is crucial for binding to DNA and enhancing acetylation through zinc finger and helix-turn-helix motifs (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). 

KAT6A also includes a double PHD zinc finger domain, which is essential for interaction with histone H3 and necessary for nuclear localization to chromatin (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). The protein's structure is further characterized by a glutamate/aspartate-rich region and a serine/methionine-rich region in the C-terminal part (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, KAT6A forms a tetrameric complex with BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, which acetylates lysine residues on histone H3 tails, specifically H3K9 and H3K23 (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). This complex is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin states and plays a role in gene transcription (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). 

The protein also recognizes and catalyzes other histone acylations, such as crotonylation, butyrylation, and propionylation (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
KAT6A, a lysine acetyltransferase, is a crucial enzyme involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histones and non-histone proteins, playing a significant role in regulating gene expression and chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, KAT6A is part of the MYST family of acetyltransferases and forms a tetrameric complex with proteins such as BRPF1/2/3, ING5, and MEAF6, which enhances its specificity for histone substrates (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). This complex acetylates histone H3 tails, particularly at lysine residues H3K9 and H3K23, which are associated with transcriptionally active genes (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

KAT6A is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription, maintenance of hematopoietic and neural stem cells, and cell cycle progression (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). It acts as a coactivator for transcription factors like RUNX1 and PU.1, essential for hematopoiesis, and regulates the expression of hematopoietic genes (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). KAT6A also influences the immune response by affecting memory B and T cells and is required for macrophage activation, impacting the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages and M1 macrophage polarization (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KAT6A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably Arboleda-Tham syndrome and KAT6A syndrome. These conditions are characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech delay, and various congenital anomalies such as microcephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, and cardiac defects (Jiang2021A; Kennedy2019KAT6A). The KAT6A gene, also known as MYST3 or MOZ, is part of the histone acetyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and gene expression (Urreizti2020Five).

Pathogenic variants in KAT6A, particularly truncating mutations, are linked to a recognizable syndrome with intellectual disability and other features such as hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and subtle facial dysmorphisms (Tham2015Dominant; Kennedy2019KAT6A). These mutations often occur de novo and can lead to a spectrum of developmental and neurological challenges, with specific genotype-phenotype correlations observed (Millan2016Whole; Kennedy2019KAT6A).

Alterations in KAT6A expression or interactions can also contribute to various cancers, including leukemia, due to its role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (Jiang2021A). The gene's involvement in chromatin remodeling and its interactions with other proteins are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions, and disruptions can lead to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
KAT6A, a member of the MYST family of lysine acetyltransferases, participates in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a tetrameric complex with bromodomain-PHD finger proteins (BRPF1/2/3), inhibitor of growth 5 (ING5) or its paralog ING4, and MYST/Esa1-associated factor 6 (MEAF6). This complex is involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histone H3 tails, specifically H3K9, H3K14, and H3K23, which are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin states (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The).

KAT6A also interacts with non-histone proteins such as p53, influencing its acetylation and activity. It plays a role in the regulation of the INK4A-ARF pathway by maintaining the expression of its inhibitors, CDC6, EZH2, and E2F2, which are important for stem cell maintenance and prevention of senescence (Wiesel-Motiuk2020The). In the context of cancer, KAT6A interacts with the transcription factor TRIM24, enhancing PI3K/AKT signaling, which is significant in glioma tumorigenesis (Lv2017Histone).

In ovarian cancer, KAT6A acetylates COP1, stabilizing β-catenin by impairing its ubiquitination, which promotes tumorigenicity and chemoresistance (Liu2021KAT6A). These interactions highlight KAT6A's role in modulating chromatin organization and gene expression through its acetyltransferase activity.
