# MMEL1

## Overview
The MMEL1 gene encodes the protein membrane metalloendopeptidase like 1, which is a type II class transmembrane protein belonging to the metalloendopeptidases family, specifically categorized under the M13 family of zinc metallopeptidases. This protein, also known as Neprilysin 2 (NEP2), plays a critical role in proteolytic processes, including the degradation of neuropeptides and beta-amyloid, which are important in neurological health and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. MMEL1 is predominantly expressed in the testis and central nervous system (CNS), indicating its specialized function in these tissues. The gene has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and primary biliary cirrhosis, through its genetic variations, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease pathogenesis (Danoy2011Association; Saadah2015Replication; Hirschfield2010Variants; Yazdanpanah2021Investigating).

## Function
The MMEL1 gene encodes a type II class transmembrane protein that is part of the metalloendopeptidases family, also known as Neprilysin 2 (NEP2) (Yazdanpanah2021Investigating). This protein is involved in proteolytic processes, specifically in the degradation of neuropeptides and beta-amyloid, which are significant in the context of neurological health and diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (Yazdanpanah2021Investigating). MMEL1 is expressed predominantly in the testis and central nervous system (CNS), suggesting a specialized role in these tissues (Yazdanpanah2021Investigating).

The protein's activity involves cleaving peptide bonds, a function characteristic of the M13 family of zinc metallopeptidases, to which MMEL1 belongs. This activity is crucial for modulating neuropeptide and peptide hormone activity, thereby influencing cellular signaling and maintaining homeostasis (Yazdanpanah2021Investigating). Although the precise function of MMEL1 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, its involvement in these molecular processes indicates a role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions, particularly in the CNS and reproductive system (Yazdanpanah2021Investigating). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete range of its biological activities and implications in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The MMEL1 gene has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases due to its genetic variations. In celiac disease, particularly among the Saudi Arabian population, the MMEL1 gene's rs3748816 SNP is significantly associated with increased disease susceptibility. The Thr/Thr genotype of this SNP is notably more frequent in celiac patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in disease development (Saadah2015Replication). 

In rheumatoid arthritis, studies in the Han Chinese population have identified a strong association between MMEL1 variants and the disease. The SNP rs3890745 in MMEL1 shows a robust association, indicating that genetic variations in this gene may contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (Danoy2011Association).

MMEL1 is also associated with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Specific SNPs, such as rs3748816 and rs3890745, have been linked to an increased risk of PBC, highlighting the gene's potential role in the genetic predisposition to this liver disease (Hirschfield2010Variants). These findings underscore the importance of MMEL1 in understanding the genetic basis of various autoimmune conditions.
