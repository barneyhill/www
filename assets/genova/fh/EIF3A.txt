# EIF3A

## Overview
EIF3A is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (eIF3a), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex plays a pivotal role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF3a protein is characterized by its PCI domain, which is essential for mRNA recruitment and the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, thereby facilitating the binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:; Khoshnevis2014Structural). As a scaffold protein, eIF3a is integral to the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex, interacting with various ribosomal proteins and other initiation factors to regulate translation initiation (Valášek2017Embraced; Vo2021Interactome). The expression and activity of EIF3A have significant implications in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Sun2024Eukaryotic; Zhang2007Individual).

## Structure
The human EIF3A protein is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is crucial for the initiation of protein synthesis. EIF3A is characterized by the presence of a PCI domain, which is a conserved bipartite domain comprising a helical bundle (HB) and a winged-helix (WH) subdomain. The PCI domain is essential for mRNA recruitment to the 43S pre-initiation complexes (PICs) (Khoshnevis2014Structural). The N-terminal region of EIF3A, including the PCI domain, is involved in RNA binding, with specific residues such as R363 and K364 playing a critical role in mRNA recruitment (Khoshnevis2014Structural).

The eIF3 complex, including EIF3A, forms a quaternary structure that is essential for its function in translation initiation. EIF3A, along with other subunits like eIF3b, forms the nucleation core of the complex, which is crucial for the assembly of the human octamer (Valášek2017Embraced). The eIF3 complex is described as having a modular structure, with specific subunits interacting with ribosomal proteins and other initiation factors (Valášek2017Embraced). The structural integrity of the PCI domain in EIF3A is necessary for the eIF3 core's integrity and RNA binding (Khoshnevis2014Structural).

## Function
EIF3A, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It acts as a scaffold for assembling translation initiation complexes, facilitating the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to mRNA and the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:). EIF3A is essential for the stability and formation of the eIF3 complex, serving as the nucleation core along with eIF3b, and is crucial for the proper assembly of the multi-factor complex (MFC) (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:; Valášek2017Embraced).

In healthy human cells, EIF3A is involved in mRNA recruitment and scanning during translation initiation, interacting with other initiation factors such as eIF4G and eIF5 (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:). It also plays a role in stabilizing the assembly of the 48S pre-initiation complex and modulating the scanning process for AUG start codon recognition (Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3A is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences the translation of specific mRNAs, impacting cellular growth and proliferation (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:). Its expression is associated with cell differentiation and development, particularly in maintaining an undifferentiated state in certain tissues (Liu2007Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3A gene have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of EIF3A is associated with oncogenic properties, such as decreased doubling times and increased clonogenicity, in several human tumors, including breast, cervical, esophageal, lung, and gastric cancers. This overexpression is often linked to poor clinical outcomes, suggesting that EIF3A may contribute to the hyperactivation of translation initiation in cancer development (Zhang2007Individual).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), EIF3A is upregulated and correlates with poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival. Knockdown of EIF3A in DLBCL cells inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor progression. High EIF3A expression is also associated with decreased cytotoxic immune cells and increased chemosensitivity to certain antitumor drugs, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Sun2024Eukaryotic).

In lung cancer, EIF3A expression affects sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Higher EIF3A levels are linked to better chemotherapy responses, as it modulates DNA repair mechanisms by down-regulating nucleotide excision repair proteins, thereby enhancing chemosensitivity (Xu2013The; Yin2011Effect). Conversely, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), lower EIF3A expression is associated with poor prognosis, suggesting a complex role in different cancer types (Zhang2021Systematic).

## Interactions
EIF3A, a core component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, participates in various interactions crucial for translation initiation. It interacts with other eIF3 subunits, such as eIF3C, eIF3D, eIF3F, and eIF3G, indicating a close spatial relationship within the eIF3 complex (Vo2021Interactome). EIF3A also forms physical interactions with eIF4A1 and YB-1, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Vo2021Interactome).

In the context of translation initiation, EIF3A interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The N-terminal domain of EIF3A is crucial for forming a bridge between eIF3 and the 40S subunit, interacting with ribosomal proteins RPS0A and RPS10A, as well as helices 16-18 of 18S rRNA (Szamecz2008eIF3a). These interactions are essential for maintaining the association of eIF3 with the ribosome during translation, supporting the resumption of scanning and reinitiation (Szamecz2008eIF3a).

EIF3A also interacts with mRNA, particularly in the context of transcript-specific translation regulation. It engages with mRNA secondary structures, such as the hepatitis C virus (HCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element, facilitating the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit on mRNAs (Siridechadilok2005Structural). These interactions highlight EIF3A's role in modulating translation initiation and its potential involvement in cancer-related translational regulation (Vo2021Interactome).
