# CFAP97D1

## Overview
The CFAP97D1 gene encodes the CFAP97 domain containing 1 protein, which is integral to the structural integrity and function of the flagellar axoneme, particularly within sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a structural component, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the microtubule doublets of the axoneme, essential for the symmetrical beating and motility of the sperm flagellum. Predominantly expressed in the testes, CFAP97D1 is crucial for maintaining the ultrastructure of the flagellum, with its absence leading to motility defects and conditions such as asthenozoospermia. The gene's function is vital for male fertility, highlighting its significance in reproductive biology and its potential link to disorders like Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Sperm Flagella (MMAF) syndrome (Oura2020Cfap97d1).

## Function
The CFAP97D1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the flagellar axoneme, a key component of the sperm flagellum. This structure is essential for proper sperm motility, which is crucial for male fertility. The axoneme consists of a 9 + 2 microtubule arrangement, and CFAP97D1 is involved in stabilizing these microtubule doublets, particularly the fourth doublet, which is vital for the symmetrical beating of the flagellum (Oura2020Cfap97d1).

In healthy cells, CFAP97D1 is predominantly expressed in the testes, beginning at the diplotene spermatocyte stage, and is crucial for the formation and maintenance of the flagellar ultrastructure. Its absence leads to structural instability and motility defects, such as asthenozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility and fertility (Oura2020Cfap97d1). The gene's function is not limited to the initial formation of the flagellum but is more focused on maintaining its integrity, ensuring effective sperm motility and successful fertilization (Oura2020Cfap97d1). CFAP97D1's role in these processes underscores its importance in reproductive biology and its potential involvement in conditions like Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Sperm Flagella (MMAF) syndrome (Oura2020Cfap97d1).
