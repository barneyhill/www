# CDT1

## Overview
The CDT1 gene encodes the chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1, a pivotal protein involved in the regulation of DNA replication. As a licensing factor, CDT1 plays a crucial role in the formation of the pre-replicative complex by facilitating the loading of the MCM2-7 helicase onto chromatin, thereby ensuring that DNA replication occurs precisely once per cell cycle (Nishitani2006Two; Zhang2021Regulation). The protein's structure is characterized by a winged helix fold, which is essential for its interaction with other replication machinery components (Khayrutdinov2009Structure). CDT1's activity is tightly regulated through interactions with proteins such as Geminin and ubiquitin ligases, which prevent re-replication and maintain genomic stability (Nishitani2006Two; Fujita2006Cdt1revisited:complexandtightregulationduringthecellcycleandconsequencesofderegulationinmammaliancells). Dysregulation of CDT1 is implicated in various clinical conditions, including Meier-Gorlin syndrome and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Pozo2018Cdt1; Cai2021CDT1).

## Structure
The CDT1 protein is integral to DNA replication licensing, characterized by its complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Khayrutdinov2009Structure).

The tertiary structure of CDT1 involves the folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional conformation, featuring a winged helix fold. This fold is conserved among replication licensing factors and is crucial for CDT1's interaction with the MCM2-7 complex, a key component of the DNA replication machinery (Khayrutdinov2009Structure). The C-terminal domain of CDT1, particularly, contains two winged helix repeats that facilitate this interaction (Khayrutdinov2009Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, CDT1 forms a complex with the MCM2-7 helicase, essential for chromatin loading and DNA replication initiation (Liu2011Structural). CDT1 also interacts with Geminin, forming a heterohexameric complex that regulates its activity and prevents DNA rereplication (De2009Quaternary). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genome integrity by ensuring that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle.

## Function
The CDT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in DNA replication licensing in healthy human cells. CDT1 is involved in the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) by facilitating the loading of the MCM2-7 helicase complex onto chromatin at replication origins. This process is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, ensuring that replication occurs only once per cell cycle (Nishitani2006Two; Zhang2021Regulation). CDT1 operates primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with the origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6 to assemble the pre-RC during late mitosis and early G1 phase (Fujita2006Cdt1revisited:complexandtightregulationduringthecellcycleandconsequencesofderegulationinmammaliancells; Zhang2021Regulation).

The activity of CDT1 is tightly regulated to prevent re-replication, which can lead to genomic instability. This regulation is achieved through proteolytic degradation mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as SCF-Skp2 and DDB1-Cul4, and the inhibitory protein Geminin, which binds to CDT1 to inhibit its function during the S phase (Nishitani2006Two; Fujita2006Cdt1revisited:complexandtightregulationduringthecellcycleandconsequencesofderegulationinmammaliancells). Proper regulation of CDT1 is critical for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring normal cell cycle progression (Pozo2018Cdt1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a form of primordial dwarfism, is linked to mutations in CDT1. These mutations, such as Cdt1-R462Q and Cdt1-E468K, impair interactions with the MCM complex, leading to slower cell proliferation and growth retardation (Pozo2018Cdt1). The Cdt1-A66T variant, associated with dwarfism, induces significant DNA re-replication, suggesting a gain-of-function mutation that disrupts normal cell cycle regulation (Pozo2018Cdt1).

In cancer, CDT1 overexpression is implicated in tumorigenesis. High levels of CDT1 are associated with genomic instability, replication stress, and poor prognosis in cancers such as colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Cai2021CDT1; Petropoulos2022Cdt1). In HCC, CDT1 expression correlates with tumor stage and immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in cancer progression (Cai2021CDT1). CDT1 is also a potential biomarker for HCC risk in chronic liver conditions, as high CDT1 mRNA expression is linked to a higher risk of HCC development (Ogawa2024Clinical).

Targeting CDT1 interactions, such as with Geminin, has been explored as a therapeutic strategy in cancer, with inhibitors like AF615 inducing DNA damage and cell death in cancer cells (Karantzelis2022Small).

## Interactions
CDT1 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. It binds to the APC/C Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase, which targets CDT1 for degradation to regulate the exit from mitosis. This interaction is mediated by destruction boxes (D-boxes) in the N-terminus of CDT1, and mutations in these D-boxes impair the binding, highlighting their importance for recognition by APC/C Cdh1 (Sugimoto2008Identification). 

CDT1 also interacts with PCNA, a processivity factor for DNA polymerases, which mediates its ubiquitination and degradation during the S phase (Sugimoto2008Identification). Additionally, CDT1 forms a complex with Geminin, which inhibits CDT1 to prevent re-replication. This interaction is characterized by high binding affinity, and specific mutations in CDT1 can weaken this interaction, making it a target for small molecule inhibitors (Karantzelis2022Small).

Other proteins identified as CDT1 interactors include MCM4 and MCM6, which are involved in the formation of the pre-replication complex, and the SNF2H-WSTF complex, which may play a role in DNA replication initiation (Sugimoto2008Identification).
