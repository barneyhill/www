# HSD17B2

## Overview
The HSD17B2 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 2, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which plays a pivotal role in steroid hormone metabolism. This enzyme is primarily involved in the conversion of active steroids, such as estradiol and testosterone, into their less active forms, estrone and androstenedione, respectively, thereby regulating local steroid levels and influencing various physiological processes, including reproduction and development (Saloniemi2011The; Su2007Regulation). Hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 2 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed in multiple tissues, including the breast, endometrium, placenta, and prostate, where it modulates ligand availability for nuclear receptors (Saloniemi2011The). The gene's expression and activity are crucial for maintaining hormonal balance and have been implicated in several hormone-related conditions and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Plourde2008Mutation; Karageorgi2011Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The HSD17B2 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 2, which is involved in steroid metabolism. The primary structure of the HSD17B2 protein consists of 387 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 42,782 Da (Durocher1995Mapping). The protein is likely associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (Durocher1995Mapping).

HSD17B2 belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by specific sequence motifs such as TGxxxGxG, NAG, YxxSK, and PGxxxT, which are involved in cofactor binding and structural stabilization (Mindnich2004The). The protein contains a Rossmann fold, a common structural motif for NAD(P)(H)-binding proteins, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (Mindnich2004The).

Alternative splicing of the HSD17B2 gene results in three isoforms: the wild type (L), a middle-length (M) isoform lacking exon 2, and a short-length (S) isoform lacking exons 2 and 3. The M and S isoforms are catalytically inactive due to the absence of the catalytic domain and can form dimers with the wild type isoform, potentially promoting its degradation (Gao2019Functional). These isoforms are less stable than the wild type and degrade quickly unless protease inhibitors are present (Gao2019Functional).

## Function
The HSD17B2 gene encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 2, which plays a crucial role in steroid hormone metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of active steroids such as estradiol and testosterone into their less active forms, estrone and androstenedione, respectively (Saloniemi2011The; Su2007Regulation). This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating local steroid levels, impacting processes like reproduction and development (Andersson1997Physiology).

HSD17B2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed in various tissues, including the breast, endometrium, placenta, and prostate, where it regulates ligand availability for several nuclear receptors, such as estrogen and androgen receptors (Saloniemi2011The). In the placenta, HSD17B2 is highly expressed in endothelial cells, contributing to the creation of steroid gradients between maternal and fetal circulation, thus protecting the fetus from excessive exposure to bioactive estrogens and androgens (Su2007Regulation).

The enzyme's activity is also significant in the endometrium, where it is upregulated during the luteal phase, contributing to the inactivation of estradiol to estrone, which is important for maintaining hormonal balance and preventing conditions like endometriosis (Osiński2018HSD3B2). Retinoic acid has been shown to induce HSD17B2 expression, highlighting its regulatory role in steroid hormone metabolism (Su2007Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HSD17B2 gene have been implicated in various hormone-related conditions. The gene encodes an enzyme involved in the conversion of active estrogens and androgens to their inactive forms, playing a crucial role in hormone regulation. Variants in HSD17B2 have been studied in the context of breast cancer, particularly among French Canadian families with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential link between these genetic variants and increased cancer susceptibility (Plourde2008Mutation).

In endometrial cancer, polymorphisms in HSD17B2 have been investigated for their role in altering enzyme activity and estradiol levels, which may influence cancer risk due to prolonged estrogen exposure unopposed by progesterone (Karageorgi2011Polymorphisms). However, no statistically significant associations were found with endometrial cancer risk after adjusting for multiple testing (Karageorgi2011Polymorphisms).

Additionally, the HSD17B2 gene has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in the Chinese Han population, where specific polymorphisms were linked to increased susceptibility to this cancer type (Zhang2014Association). These findings underscore the gene's potential involvement in hormone-dependent cancers and highlight the need for further research to confirm these associations across diverse populations.

## Interactions
HSD17B2 interacts with several proteins as part of a complex involved in testosterone metabolism, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. Molecular docking studies have shown that HSD17B2 forms a complex with HSD17B3, SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin), and SRD5A1 (steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1). This macro-complex is suggested to influence androgenic signaling and therapy response in prostate cancer, highlighting its functional significance in testosterone metabolism and potential impact on drug response and cancer progression (Bamodu2021Differential).

The interactions within this complex are not only spatial but also functionally significant, suggesting that these proteins may be targeted therapeutically to modulate therapy response and disease progression. The expression of these proteins correlates with drug resistance and cancer stemness markers, indicating their role in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Bamodu2021Differential).

While the context does not provide specific information on direct interactions of HSD17B2 with nucleic acids, it highlights the enzyme's involvement in multiprotein complexes that play a crucial role in regulating steroid metabolism and influencing cancer progression.
