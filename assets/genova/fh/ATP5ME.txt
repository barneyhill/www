# ATP5ME

## Overview
ATP5ME is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit e, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is integral to the process of oxidative phosphorylation, where it contributes to the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of the cell. As a transmembrane protein, ATP synthase membrane subunit e is involved in the formation of the proton channel within the ATP synthase complex, facilitating the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for ATP production. The structural integrity and functional efficiency of ATP5ME are vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, and any alterations in its expression or structure can have significant implications for cellular metabolism and energy production (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
ATP5ME, also known as ATP synthase membrane subunit e, is a component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, which plays a critical role in ATP production. The primary structure of ATP5ME consists of its specific amino acid sequence, which determines its unique properties and function within the complex. The secondary structure of ATP5ME includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and interaction with other subunits. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its proper function and integration into the ATP synthase complex. In terms of quaternary structure, ATP5ME is assembled as part of the larger ATP synthase complex, where it interacts with other subunits to facilitate ATP synthesis.

Post-translational modifications may occur, potentially affecting the protein's function and stability. These modifications can include phosphorylation, acetylation, or other chemical changes that influence the protein's activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of ATP5ME may exist, leading to isoforms with potentially different functional properties. These structural and functional characteristics of ATP5ME are crucial for its role in the efficient production of ATP within mitochondria.
