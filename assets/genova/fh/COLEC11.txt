# COLEC11

## Overview
The COLEC11 gene encodes the protein collectin subfamily member 11 (CL-11), also known as collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), which is a crucial component of the innate immune system. CL-11 is categorized as a collectin, a type of pattern recognition receptor involved in the lectin complement pathway. It plays a significant role in pathogen recognition and immune response by binding to various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, in a calcium-dependent manner. This binding facilitates the opsonization and clearance of pathogens. Additionally, CL-11 is involved in developmental processes, particularly in guiding cranial neural crest cell migration during embryogenesis. Mutations in the COLEC11 gene have been linked to 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities, highlighting its importance in both immune defense and developmental biology (Hansen2010Collectin; Rooryck2011Mutations; Selman2012Structure).

## Structure
The COLEC11 gene encodes the collectin 11 (CL-11) protein, also known as collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), which is a component of the innate immune system. The primary structure of CL-11 includes a signal peptide of 25 amino acids, which is cleaved to produce a mature protein of 246 amino acids. The protein is organized into a homotrimeric subunit, with each polypeptide chain consisting of an N-terminal segment, a collagen-like region with 24 Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Selman2012Structure; Farrar2016Collectin11).

The secondary structure involves inter-chain disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions in the α-helical coiled-coil of the neck regions and the collagen-like region, which stabilize the trimer assembly. The tertiary structure is characterized by the presence of cysteine residues (Cys 8, Cys 88, and Cys 90) that form disulfide bonds between polypeptide chains. The Cys 88 and Cys 90 residues form a CXC motif, unique to CL-11 and CL-L1 among collectins (Selman2012Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, CL-11 forms oligomers, with recombinant CL-11 showing molecular masses of 100 and 200 kDa under non-reducing conditions, indicating dimers of trimeric subunits. In serum, CL-11 appears as dimers, trimers, and larger multimers (Selman2012Structure). The CRD of CL-11 contains motifs like EPN (Glu-Pro-Asn) and WND (Trp-Asn-Asp) that are crucial for calcium coordination and ligand binding (Selman2012Structure).

## Function
The COLEC11 gene encodes collectin 11 (CL-11), also known as collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), a protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. CL-11 is involved in the lectin complement pathway, where it acts as a recognition molecule similar to mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins. It forms complexes with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs), specifically MASP-1 and MASP-3, which are crucial for complement activation (Selman2012Structure; Ma2012Collectin11MASP). 

CL-11 binds to a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, in a calcium-dependent manner, with a preference for carbohydrates like L-fucose and D-mannose (Hansen2010Collectin; Ma2012Collectin11MASP). This binding activity leads to the opsonization and neutralization of pathogens, decreasing their infectivity and facilitating their clearance by phagocytes (Hansen2010Collectin). 

In addition to its role in pathogen recognition, CL-11 is involved in developmental processes, particularly in guiding the migration of cranial neural crest cells during embryonic development (Selman2012Structure). Mutations in COLEC11 have been linked to 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities (Rooryck2011Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COLEC11 gene are associated with 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that includes Carnevale, Mingarelli, Michels, and Malpuech syndromes. These conditions are characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, growth deficiencies, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss (Rooryck2011Mutations; Gardner2017Familial). Specific mutations in COLEC11, such as non-synonymous mutations and deletions, lead to functional deficiencies in the CL-K1 protein, which is crucial for normal embryonic development and neural crest cell migration (Gajek2020Association; Rooryck2011Mutations). 

Alterations in COLEC11 expression levels have also been linked to susceptibility to urinary schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease. Certain COLEC11 haplotypes, such as COLEC11*TCCG, are associated with a higher risk of infection, while others, like COLEC11*TCCA, appear to offer a protective effect (Antony2015Lectin). The p.R216H variant in exon 8 of COLEC11 is particularly significant, as it is associated with increased susceptibility to schistosomiasis (Antony2015Lectin). These findings suggest that COLEC11 plays a role in both developmental disorders and immune response modulation.

## Interactions
Collectin 11 (CL-11), encoded by the COLEC11 gene, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. CL-11 forms complexes with MASP-1 and MASP-3, serine proteases that are part of the lectin complement pathway. This interaction is crucial for complement system activation, as demonstrated by sandwich ELISA and other assays (Hansen2010Collectin; Selman2012Structure). CL-11 does not interact with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in the same manner, as MBL was not detected in CL-11-MASP complexes (Hansen2010Collectin).

CL-11 also binds to a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, in a calcium-dependent manner. This binding is partly inhibited by saccharides like D-mannose, indicating its carbohydrate specificity (Hansen2010Collectin; Selman2012Structure). CL-11's interaction with influenza A virus is notable for its ability to inhibit viral infectivity and hemagglutination activity (Hansen2010Collectin).

In addition to protein interactions, CL-11 binds to DNA in a calcium-independent manner, forming complexes with both bacterial and mammalian genomic DNA (Hansen2010Collectin; Selman2012Structure). These interactions highlight CL-11's role in immune defense and complement activation.
