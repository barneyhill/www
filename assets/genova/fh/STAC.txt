# STAC

## Overview
The STAC gene encodes the SH3 and cysteine-rich domain protein, which is integral to the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process in skeletal muscle. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal C1 domain and two tandem SH3 domains, which facilitate its interaction with key components of the muscle contraction machinery, such as the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel (CaV1.1) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) (Campiglio2017STAC3; Rufenach2020Multiple). The STAC3 protein is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and is essential for the proper trafficking and functional expression of CaV1.1, thereby playing a crucial role in the coupling of membrane depolarization to calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Zaharieva2018STAC3variants; Flucher2019STAC). Mutations in the STAC3 gene are associated with congenital myopathies, such as Native American Myopathy and STAC3 disorder, underscoring its significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Essop2024STAC3; Horstick2013Stac3).

## Structure
The STAC3 protein is characterized by an N-terminal C1 domain, which is a cysteine-rich lipid-binding module, and two tandem SH3 domains. The C1 domain includes two Zn2+ ions coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine, contributing to its structural stability and involvement in protein-protein interactions (Campiglio2017STAC3; Rufenach2021Structure). The SH3 domains are composed of five-stranded antiparallel beta sheets and a short 3_10 helix, which are crucial for binding to proline-rich segments and interacting with the CaV1.1 channel, a key player in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (Rufenach2020Multiple).

The primary structure of STAC3 includes specific mutations such as P269R, K329N, and W284S, which have been studied for their effects on protein stability and interaction with CaV1.1 (Rufenach2020Multiple). The secondary structure features limited elements like antiparallel beta strands and a short alpha helix adjacent to the C1 domain (Rufenach2021Structure). The tertiary structure involves the SH3 domains forming a rigid unit due to extensive hydrophobic interactions, allowing a continuous interface with other proteins (Rufenach2021Structure). The quaternary structure details are not explicitly provided, but the interactions with CaV1.1 suggest a functional complex formation (Rufenach2020Multiple). STAC3 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at multiple serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (Yin2020Molecular).

## Function
The STAC3 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, a process essential for muscle contraction. STAC3 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and is localized to the triads, specialized structures composed of a T-tubule and two lateral sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Within these triads, STAC3 interacts with the L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel (CaV1.1) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel RyR1, facilitating the coupling of membrane depolarization to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Zaharieva2018STAC3variants; Campiglio2017STAC3).

STAC3 is essential for the proper trafficking and functional expression of CaV1.1 in the plasma membrane, where it promotes the formation of CaV1.1 tetrads necessary for EC coupling. The C1 domain of STAC3 is crucial for its stable incorporation into the CaV1.1 complex, while the SH3 domains may be involved in other functional interactions (Flucher2019STAC; Campiglio2017STAC3). The absence of STAC3 results in impaired EC coupling, leading to paralysis and developmental failure in animal models, underscoring its vital role in muscle function (Flucher2019STAC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STAC3 gene are linked to several congenital myopathies, most notably Native American Myopathy (NAM) and STAC3 disorder. NAM is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by muscle weakness, susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, joint contractures, and dysmorphic facial features. It is caused by a missense mutation in the STAC3 gene, specifically a tryptophan to serine substitution at amino acid 284 (W284S) in the first SH3 domain, which is crucial for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles (Horstick2013Stac3). This mutation leads to decreased EC coupling, affecting muscle function and contributing to the clinical manifestations of NAM (Horstick2013Stac3).

STAC3 disorder, prevalent in Southern African populations, is another condition associated with the STAC3 c.851 G > C (p.Trp284Ser) variant. It presents with congenital hypotonia, neuromuscular pathology, respiratory distress, and dysmorphic features. The disorder is suggested to have a common ancestral founder mutation, with a significant carrier frequency in the population (Essop2024STAC3). The clinical features of STAC3 disorder overlap with those of NAM, highlighting the critical role of STAC3 in muscle function and its potential impact on various congenital myopathies (Essop2024STAC3).

## Interactions
The STAC3 protein is a critical component of the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling machinery in skeletal muscle, primarily interacting with the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) complex, which includes CaV1.1 and RyR1. STAC3 is a stable part of this complex, incorporating into skeletal muscle triads only in the presence of CaV1.1, indicating a strong interaction (Campiglio2017STAC3; Horstick2013Stac3). The C1 domain of STAC3 is essential for its stable association with CaV1.1, with specific residues V104 and Y133 playing a crucial role in this interaction (Campiglio2017STAC3). 

STAC3 also interacts with the II-III loop of CaV1.1, which is necessary for the activation of RyR1 and subsequent calcium release, a key step in muscle contraction (Polster2018Stac). The SH3 domains of STAC3 are involved in these protein-protein interactions, binding to proline-rich segments of other proteins (Rufenach2021Structure). While STAC3 is primarily associated with protein interactions, there is no specific evidence of its interaction with nucleic acids in the provided context (Rufenach2021Structure).
