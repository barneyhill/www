# ENTR1

## Overview
ENTR1, or endosome associated trafficking regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking within cells. The protein plays a pivotal role in the transport and sorting of cargo proteins, influencing their movement from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus or their degradation in lysosomes. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper signaling pathways, impacting processes such as receptor recycling and degradation (Farries2019Identification). ENTR1 is associated with pyrimidine metabolism and cell division, and it interacts with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, which is vital for post-endocytic sorting and apoptosis regulation (Huang2023Identification). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where its dysregulation can contribute to tumorigenesis and resistance to apoptosis (Zhang2024Endosome).

## Function
ENTR1, also known as endosome associated trafficking regulator 1, is a protein involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking processes within cells. It plays a critical role in the transport and sorting of cargo proteins from the endosome to the Golgi apparatus or for degradation in the lysosome. This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling pathways, impacting processes such as receptor recycling and degradation (Farries2019Identification).

ENTR1 is localized to early and recycling endosomes and is associated with pyrimidine metabolism and cell division. It is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, and its overexpression has been linked to an increased number of multinucleate cells, which can lead to chromosome instability and tumorigenesis (Huang2023Identification). ENTR1 also interacts with the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, regulating post-endocytic sorting of Fas to resist Fas-induced apoptosis (Huang2023Identification).

In healthy human cells, ENTR1 is primarily active in the endosomal compartments, where it is crucial for the proper functioning of cellular transport mechanisms and signaling pathways, although specific details about its function in non-cancerous cells are less documented in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
ENTR1, also known as SDCCAG3, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC), ENTR1 is significantly overexpressed compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker. ENTR1 expression correlates with immune infiltration, particularly CD8+ T cells, and is linked to cancer stem cell characteristics, which may contribute to the aggressive nature of MAC (Huang2023Identification).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ENTR1 is also highly expressed and correlates with poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression enhances GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also providing resistance to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide (TMZ). ENTR1 affects the TNF signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor growth and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM (Zhang2024Endosome).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ENTR1 in cancer, where its dysregulation contributes to tumor progression and resistance to treatment. However, specific mutations in ENTR1 and their direct clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
ENTR1, also known as endosome associated trafficking regulator 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC), ENTR1 interacts with the Fas receptor through the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13. This interaction is crucial for connecting to the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery via dysbindin, which regulates the post-endocytic sorting of Fas, thereby resisting Fas-induced apoptosis (Huang2023Identification).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ENTR1 is involved in cellular membrane receptor remodeling and transportation. It interacts with components of the retromer complex, facilitating the degradation of Fas cell surface levels by sorting Fas into luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. This process effectively shuts down Fas-dependent apoptosis signal transduction. ENTR1 also down-regulates the surface expression of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), which restrains TNF-specific apoptosis in certain cell lines (Zhang2024Endosome).

These interactions suggest that ENTR1 plays a role in modulating apoptosis and may act as a 'tumor promoter' by influencing malignant biological behavior in tumor cells (Zhang2024Endosome).
