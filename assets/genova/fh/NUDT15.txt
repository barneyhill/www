# NUDT15

## Overview
NUDT15 is a gene that encodes the enzyme nudix hydrolase 15, a member of the NUDIX hydrolase family, which is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates and other nucleotide derivatives. The protein plays a critical role in the metabolism and detoxification of thiopurine drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, by converting active thiopurine metabolites into inactive forms, thereby mitigating their cytotoxic effects (Yamashita2023Loss; Rehling2021Crystal). NUDT15 is also involved in the hydrolysis of isoprene pyrophosphates, suggesting a broader role in cellular signaling and cholesterol synthesis (Scaletti2023Kinetic). Variants in the NUDT15 gene, such as the p.Arg139Cys variant, are clinically significant due to their association with increased sensitivity to thiopurine drugs and the risk of adverse drug reactions, particularly in certain populations (Relling2019Clinical; Kakuta2017Pharmacogenetics).

## Structure
The NUDT15 protein is a member of the NUDIX hydrolase family and is characterized by a classic NUDIX fold, which includes an arrangement of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Each monomer of NUDT15 consists of two alpha-helices, seven beta-strands, and four 3_10 helices, forming a stable tertiary structure (Rehling2021Crystal). The protein functions as a homodimer, with the dimeric structure confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments (Carter2015Crystal; Rehling2021Crystal).

The NUDIX motif, crucial for magnesium binding and substrate hydrolysis, is located on α-helix 1 and β-strand 4 (Scaletti2023Kinetic). This motif is essential for the enzymatic activity of NUDT15, which involves the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates. The protein's active site is characterized by specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that stabilize substrate binding (Scaletti2023Kinetic).

Variants of NUDT15, such as R139C and R139H, can alter the protein's conformation and stability, impacting its function and sensitivity to thiopurine drugs (GómezRubio2022Molecular; Rehling2021Crystal). These structural insights are crucial for understanding the protein's role in drug metabolism and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Function
The NUDT15 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the NUDIX hydrolase family, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates, including nucleoside diphosphates and oxidized nucleotides. In healthy human cells, NUDT15 plays a crucial role in the detoxification of thiopurine drugs, such as 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine, by converting active thiopurine metabolites into inactive forms, thereby reducing their cytotoxic effects (Yamashita2023Loss; Rehling2021Crystal). This function is particularly important in preventing thiopurine-induced toxicity, such as hematopoietic toxicity and leukopenia, which can occur due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites (Rehling2021Crystal).

NUDT15 is also involved in the hydrolysis of isoprene pyrophosphates, which are intermediates in cholesterol synthesis and protein isoprenylation. This activity suggests a role in modulating cholesterol levels and cellular signaling processes (Scaletti2023Kinetic). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in most tissues, indicating its broad physiological relevance (Scaletti2023Kinetic). Variants in the NUDT15 gene, such as the p.Arg139Cys variant, can lead to a loss of function, resulting in increased sensitivity to thiopurine drugs and associated adverse effects (Yamashita2023Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NUDT15 gene are clinically significant due to their impact on thiopurine metabolism, leading to adverse drug reactions. The c.415C>T polymorphism, resulting in the p.Arg139Cys variant, is strongly associated with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression (TIM) and leukopenia, particularly in patients undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Relling2019Clinical; Kakuta2017Pharmacogenetics). This variant leads to a near-complete loss of enzymatic activity, causing excessive incorporation of thioguanine nucleotides into DNA, which results in DNA damage and apoptosis (Relling2019Clinical).

The prevalence of NUDT15 variants is notably higher in East Asian populations, where they are a significant factor in thiopurine intolerance and toxicity (Kakuta2017Pharmacogenetics). Patients with the TT genotype of the c.415C>T variant are highly sensitive to thiopurines like mercaptopurine, tolerating only a small fraction of the standard dose (Aşlar2024Determination). Genetic testing for NUDT15 variants is recommended to guide thiopurine dosing and minimize the risk of severe myelosuppression, especially in populations with a high frequency of these variants (Walker2019Association; Relling2019Clinical).

## Interactions
NUDT15 interacts with various nucleotide analogs and proteins, playing a significant role in drug metabolism and response. It exhibits strong diphosphatase activity against acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV) triphosphate nucleotides, converting them to their monophosphate forms and releasing pyrophosphate. This interaction is crucial for modulating the therapeutic effects of these antiviral drugs (Nishii2021NUDT15). NUDT15 also interacts with thiopurine metabolites, influencing their efficacy and toxicity in treatments. The enzyme's activity is affected by specific mutations, such as R139C, which results in a complete loss of activity against ACV and GCV substrates (Nishii2021NUDT15).

Structurally, NUDT15 forms a homodimer, which is stabilized by interactions with the inhibitor TH7755. This inhibitor binds deep within the NUDT15 binding pocket, coordinated by hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, enhancing the enzyme's thermal stability (Rehling2021Crystal). The interaction with TH7755 also increases the cytotoxicity of thiopurine drugs in NUDT15-proficient cells, indicating its potential to enhance thiopurine efficacy through specific inhibition of NUDT15 (Rehling2021Crystal). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in modulating drug response and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
