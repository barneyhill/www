# SFT2D3

## Overview
SFT2D3 is a gene that encodes the SFT2 domain containing 3 protein, a non-essential membrane protein primarily localized to the late-Golgi compartment. This protein is integral to vesicle fusion processes, playing a crucial role in the intracellular transport system by facilitating the fusion of vesicles with the Golgi complex, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein trafficking (Liu2020A). Additionally, SFT2D3 is implicated in lipid synthesis and development, contributing to the formation and maintenance of lipid cell membranes (Bedhane2019GenomeWide). While the precise functions of SFT2D3 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in these molecular processes underscores its potential importance in cellular transport and lipid metabolism. The gene has also been associated with various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, through alterations in its expression or methylation status, suggesting a complex role in disease pathology (Ulff‐Møller2018Twin; Carvalho2024Unraveling).

## Structure


## Function
SFT2D3 (SFT2 domain containing 3) is a non-essential membrane protein localized to the late-Golgi compartment, where it plays a significant role in vesicle fusion processes. This protein is involved in the intracellular transport system, particularly in the fusion of vesicles with the Golgi complex, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein trafficking (Liu2020A). The involvement of SFT2D3 in vesicle-mediated transport suggests its importance in cellular transport processes, contributing to the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.

In addition to its role in vesicle fusion, SFT2D3 is associated with the synthesis of lipoproteins, which are vital components of fat and cholesterol cells. This association indicates that SFT2D3 may also play a role in lipid synthesis and development, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of lipid cell membranes (Bedhane2019GenomeWide). Although the specific function of SFT2D3 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these molecular processes highlights its potential significance in cellular transport and lipid metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
The SFT2D3 gene has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression or methylation status. In pancreatic cancer, increased genetically predicted expression of SFT2D3 is associated with an elevated risk, suggesting its potential role in cancer biology (Liu2020A). In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SFT2D3 is hypermethylated in B-cells, indicating a possible role in the epigenetic regulation associated with this autoimmune disease (Ulff‐Møller2018Twin). 

In treatment-resistant depression, SFT2D3 was identified among differentially methylated regions in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy, although these findings did not remain statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (Carvalho2024Unraveling). In colorectal cancer, hypomethylation of the SFT2D3 promoter is linked to genome instability and uncontrolled cell proliferation, common features in cancer progression (Elhamamsy2016DNA). 

Despite these associations, specific mutations in SFT2D3 have not been conclusively linked to these conditions, highlighting the complexity of its role in disease and the need for further research to clarify its clinical significance.
