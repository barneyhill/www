# RSRP1

## Overview
RSRP1, or arginine and serine rich protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing and protein-protein interactions. The protein encoded by RSRP1 is characterized by its rich content of arginine and serine residues, which are often associated with roles in RNA binding and splicing regulation. RSRP1 has been implicated in the modulation of alternative splicing and polyadenylation, processes critical for the generation of diverse protein isoforms (Martinez2016ProteinRNA). Additionally, RSRP1 is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as CEP350, particularly in the context of viral infections like SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential role in viral pathogenesis (Karunakaran2022Interactome). These functions underscore the importance of RSRP1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease.

## Structure


## Interactions
RSRP1 (arginine and serine rich protein 1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of viral infections. Notably, RSRP1 has been identified as part of a novel protein-protein interaction with CEP350 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This interaction is among the eight novel protein-protein interactions identified between host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and those targeted by SARS-CoV, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these viral infections (Karunakaran2022Interactome).

In addition to its role in viral interactions, RSRP1 is also implicated in RNA processing. The protein hnRNP A2/B1, which is involved in RNA metabolism, has been shown to bind to the 3' UTR of the RSRP1 transcript. This binding influences alternative splicing and polyadenylation, leading to the generation of a longer isoform of RSRP1 by removing an intron. This suggests that hnRNP A2/B1 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of RSRP1 through its RNA processing activities (Martinez2016ProteinRNA). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RSRP1 in cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
