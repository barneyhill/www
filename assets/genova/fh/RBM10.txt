# RBM10

## Overview
RBM10 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 10, a multifunctional protein primarily involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. This protein is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by structural domains such as RNA recognition motifs and zinc finger domains, which enable it to interact with specific RNA sequences. As a key player in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation, RBM10 influences exon skipping and intron removal, contributing to protein diversity. It is also implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and the regulation of signaling pathways like Notch. Mutations in the RBM10 gene have been linked to TARP syndrome and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance as both a regulator of normal cellular function and a potential tumor suppressor (Zhao2017Functional; Cao2021RBM10; Collins2017An).

## Structure
RBM10 is a protein characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by its structural domains. The protein contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and two zinc finger (ZnF) domains, which are crucial for its function in RNA processing (Collins2017An). The RRM1 domain features a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helices, with a unique additional strand, β3', formed by the linker between α2 and β4 (Serrano2018Splicing). The ZnF1 domain adopts a ZRANB2-like structure with an α-turn and four short β-strands, coordinating Zn2+ with four cysteines (Serrano2018Splicing). The RRM2 domain maintains a canonical RRM structure with two α-helices and four β-strands (Serrano2018Splicing).

RBM10's RRM1-ZnF unit specifically recognizes a GGA-centered motif in exonic sites, promoting exon skipping, while RRM2 targets C-rich sequences, interacting with intronic sites (Collins2017An). The RRM1 and ZnF domains, although loosely linked, come together to recognize RNA sequences, particularly the GGA motif, with high specificity (Collins2017An). The RRM2 domain independently binds C-rich RNA sequences, such as the CCNC motif, with moderate affinity (Collins2017An).

RBM10 is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and interactions. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, further influencing its activity and role in RNA processing.

## Function
RBM10 (RNA binding motif protein 10) is a crucial regulator of alternative splicing, a process essential for post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. It binds predominantly to intronic regions of pre-mRNAs, facilitating the removal of introns and influencing exon skipping events, which are vital for generating protein diversity (Rodor2016The; Wang2013Integrative). RBM10 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs and other components of the splicing machinery, playing a significant role in splice site recognition and intron removal (Wang2013Integrative).

In healthy human cells, RBM10 is involved in regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. It influences the alternative splicing of apoptotic proteins such as Fas and BCL-X, and it activates the p53 pathway by prolonging the half-life of p53 through the inhibition of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop (Cao2021RBM10). RBM10 also regulates the Notch signaling pathway by modulating the splicing of the Numb gene, which is crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Cao2021RBM10). These activities highlight RBM10's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RBM10 gene are associated with TARP syndrome, a rare X-linked disorder characterized by Talipes equinovarus, atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and persistent left superior vena cava. The clinical spectrum of TARP syndrome is broader than initially defined, including severe developmental delay, brain malformations, respiratory issues, and facial dysmorphism. Pathogenic variants in RBM10 can be de novo, inherited from a heterozygous female carrier, or due to maternal mosaicism (OwczarekLipska2022A; Kumps2021Phenotypic).

RBM10 mutations also play a role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) pathogenesis. These mutations, often protein-truncating variants, lead to deregulated splicing and reduced RBM10 expression, contributing to tumor progression. High RBM10 mRNA expression is associated with longer overall survival in LUAD patients, suggesting a tumor suppressive role (Zhao2017Functional).

RBM10 mutations have been observed in other cancers, such as colorectal carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, though less frequently. The gene's involvement in alternative splicing and its role as a tumor suppressor highlight its clinical significance in both congenital disorders and cancer (Zhao2017Functional; OwczarekLipska2022A).

## Interactions
RBM10 is a multifunctional protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA splicing and regulation. It is a subunit of the U2 snRNP complex, engaging with intron branch sites on chromatin, and interacts with spliceosomal components to regulate alternative splicing (Loiselle2018RBM10:; Damianov2023The). RBM10 binds to RNA sequences, with a preference for C-rich motifs, and is involved in exon exclusion by recognizing specific RNA motifs such as the CUGUGGA sequence (Collins2017An).

RBM10 interacts with the RNA helicase DHX15 within the U2 RNPs, although the G-patch motifs in RBM10 do not mediate this recruitment (Damianov2023The). It also binds to non-coding RNAs, including spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs, suggesting a role in snRNA processing or in regulating the association of the U2/U12 snRNP complex with mRNA during splicing (Rodor2016The).

RBM10's interactions extend beyond splicing, as it binds the 3'UTR of the angiotensin receptor type 1 transcript, increasing its stability and downregulating transcription. It also interacts with proteins like FilGAP and the 2A-DUB deubiquitinase complex, indicating roles in cell structure regulation and epigenetic modifications (Loiselle2018RBM10:).
