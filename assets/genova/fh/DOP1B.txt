# DOP1B

## Overview
DOP1B, also known as DOPEY2 or C21orf5, is a gene that encodes the DOP1 leucine zipper-like protein B, a protein involved in intracellular transport processes. This protein plays a critical role in the retrograde transport of endosomes from the trans-Golgi network to the Golgi apparatus, a function essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper membrane trafficking (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Ravanidis2021Differentially). The DOP1B protein forms a complex with its ortholog DOP1A and the partner protein MON2, which is crucial for these transport processes. Additionally, DOP1B is implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking of cargo proteins, influencing cell differentiation and signaling pathways (Chansaenroj2022Indirect). The gene is also associated with neurological conditions, such as mental retardation in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in both cellular and neurological health (Ravanidis2021Differentially).

## Structure


## Function
The DOP1B gene, also known as DOPEY2 or C21orf5, encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly the retrograde transport of endosomes from the trans-Golgi network to the Golgi apparatus. This function is facilitated through its interaction with its ortholog DOP1A and the partner protein MON2, forming a complex that is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Ravanidis2021Differentially). DOP1B is also implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking of cargo proteins, which can indirectly influence cell differentiation by affecting signaling pathways through ligands and receptors (Chansaenroj2022Indirect). 

In the context of osteogenic differentiation, DOP1B is suggested to assist in the membrane trafficking of the transmembrane Notch ligand, Jagged-1, thereby potentially enhancing the differentiation process in human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) (Chansaenroj2022Indirect). Although DOP1B is not directly linked to osteogenic differentiation, its role in membrane trafficking could influence signaling pathways that regulate cell differentiation (Chansaenroj2022Indirect). Additionally, DOP1B is considered a candidate gene for neurological conditions such as mental retardation in Down syndrome and has been associated with Alzheimer's disease, indicating its broader significance in cellular and neurological health (Ravanidis2021Differentially).

## Clinical Significance
The DOP1B gene, also known as DOPEY2 or C21orf5, has been implicated in several neurological conditions. It is identified as a candidate gene for mental retardation in Down syndrome, suggesting its involvement in intellectual disabilities (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Ravanidis2021Differentially). Copy number variations in DOP1B have been observed in Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential role in neurodegenerative disorders (Whittle2024Earlystage; Ravanidis2020Differentially). 

In Parkinson's disease, the expression of circular RNAs derived from DOP1B, such as hsa_circ_0001187, is significantly down-regulated in patients, although no direct functional link to the disease has been established (Whittle2024Earlystage; Ravanidis2021Differentially). The gene's interaction with MON2 is crucial for the retrograde transport of endosomes, and disruptions in this process may contribute to its role in neurological conditions (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Vogt2021Biallelic).

DOP1B is also noted for its potential involvement in protein synthesis, transport, and endoplasmic reticulum stress response, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and may be linked to its neurological roles (Hu2020Whole).

## Interactions
DOP1B, also known as DOPEY2 or C21orf5, is involved in cellular trafficking processes, particularly in the retrograde transport of endosomes from the trans-Golgi network to the Golgi apparatus. This function is facilitated through its interaction with its ortholog DOP1A and the partner protein MON2, forming a complex that is crucial for endosomal transport (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Ravanidis2021Differentially). DOP1B is also part of a conserved complex with ATP9A and MON2, which is functionally linked with the SNX3-retromer, suggesting a role in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking (Vogt2021Biallelic). 

While specific physical interactions of DOP1B with nucleic acids are not detailed, its involvement in protein complexes indicates its role in cellular transport processes. The gene is also noted as a candidate for mental retardation in Down syndrome, and copy number variations in DOP1B have been observed in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential significance in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Ravanidis2020Differentially; Ravanidis2021Differentially). Despite these associations, detailed molecular interactions of DOP1B with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
