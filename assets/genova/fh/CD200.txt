# CD200

## Overview
CD200 is a gene that encodes a type I membrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein product, also known as OX-2, is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in immunoregulation. It plays a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis by interacting with its receptor, CD200R, on immune cells, particularly myeloid cells, to deliver inhibitory signals that suppress immune responses (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Holmannová2012CD200CD200R). This interaction is essential for preventing excessive inflammation and autoimmune reactions. CD200 is expressed on a variety of cell types, including myeloid and lymphoid cells, neurons, and endothelial cells, and its expression is upregulated in response to immune activation (Holmannová2012CD200CD200R). Alterations in CD200 expression are associated with various malignancies, contributing to immune evasion and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a target in cancer immunotherapy (Herbrich2021Overexpression; Choe2023Cancel).

## Structure
CD200, also known as MRC OX-2, is a type-1 cell membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin supergene family. It is a 48 kDa type 1a transmembrane glycoprotein structurally related to the B7 family of costimulatory receptors. The primary structure of CD200 includes a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with two immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail that lacks signaling motifs (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Barclay2002CD200). 

The extracellular domain of CD200 is composed of a single V and C domain, which are typical of IgSF domains, facilitating cell-cell interactions (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Barclay2002CD200). The glycosylation status of CD200 varies across tissues, although this does not appear to have significant functional consequences (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). 

A splice variant of CD200, known as CD200 tr, results from the exclusion of exon 2, leading to a truncated protein that acts as a competitive inhibitor to the full-length CD200 (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). The expression of CD200 and its splice variant is regulated by an exonic splicing enhancer, SF2/ASF:ESE, located in exon 2 (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).

## Function
The CD200 gene encodes a type I membrane glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a crucial role in immunoregulation. It is expressed on a variety of cell types, including myeloid and lymphoid cells, neurons, and endothelial cells (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Holmannová2012CD200CD200R). The primary function of CD200 is to interact with its receptor, CD200R, on immune cells, particularly myeloid cells, to deliver inhibitory signals that suppress immune responses. This interaction is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation and autoimmune reactions (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R; Holmannová2012CD200CD200R).

The CD200/CD200R interaction activates an intracellular inhibitory pathway that recruits RasGAP, leading to the inhibition of effector cells and modulation of the immune response. This process promotes the differentiation of T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) and shifts the cytokine environment from a Th1 to a Th2 pattern, facilitating the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β (Holmannová2012CD200CD200R). CD200 expression is upregulated in response to immune activation and is associated with apoptotic cells, where it helps prevent autoimmune diseases by maintaining immune tolerance (Holmannová2012CD200CD200R).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD200 gene are associated with various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, contributing to immune evasion and poor prognosis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD200 is overexpressed in leukemic stem cells, aiding in immune evasion by suppressing T cell activity and cytokine production, which leads to impaired immune responses and worse survival outcomes (Herbrich2021Overexpression). High CD200 expression in AML is linked to lower complete remission rates and poorer overall survival, particularly in patients with certain genetic mutations (Tiribelli2017High).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD200 overexpression is associated with trisomy +12 and poor prognosis, while its blockade can enhance immune response and reduce tumor cell survival (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). CD200 is also implicated in solid tumors such as melanoma, prostate, and breast cancers, where it contributes to immune suppression and tumor progression (Kawasaki2008Cancer). The CD200:CD200R interaction promotes immune evasion by inhibiting macrophages and altering cytokine profiles, which supports tumor growth and metastasis (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R). These findings highlight the potential of targeting CD200 in cancer immunotherapy (Choe2023Cancel).

## Interactions
The CD200 protein, also known as OX-2, interacts with its receptor, CD200R, which is primarily expressed on myeloid cells. This interaction is characterized by low affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_D) of approximately 0.5 µM at 37°C and a half-life of 7 seconds (Letarte2005Analysisofleukocytemembraneproteininteractionsusingproteinmicroarrays). The binding occurs through the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains, primarily via the GFCC faces of their N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domains. Key residues involved in this interaction include E44, I71, T73, E75, and I133 (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).

The interaction between CD200 and CD200R delivers inhibitory signals that modulate immune responses, particularly by downregulating myeloid cell activity (Barclay2002CD200). This is achieved through the recruitment of inhibitory adaptor proteins Dok1 and Dok2, which inhibit Ras/MAPK activation upon phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within NPxY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of CD200R1 (KotwicaMojzych2021CD200:CD200R).

CD200 also interacts with monoclonal antibodies, such as OX108, which can block its interaction with CD200R. The binding sites for CD200 and OX108 are located on the GFCC' face of the N-terminal IgSF domain of CD200R (Letarte2005Analysisofleukocytemembraneproteininteractionsusingproteinmicroarrays).
