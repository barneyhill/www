# ACOXL

## Overview
ACOXL (acyl-CoA oxidase like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway, which is crucial for the catabolism of very long-chain fatty acids. The ACOXL protein functions within peroxisomes, specialized organelles that are integral to lipid metabolism and cellular detoxification processes. As a member of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, ACOXL plays a role in the initial steps of fatty acid degradation, contributing to energy production and metabolic homeostasis. The expression of ACOXL is modulated by small nucleolar RNAs, such as SNORD115 and SNORD116, which are known to influence various metabolic pathways. Notably, ACOXL expression levels are altered in certain genetic conditions, such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, highlighting its potential significance in metabolic disorders (Falaleeva2015SNORD116; Hong2013A).

## Function
ACOXL (acyl-CoA oxidase like) is involved in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway, a critical process for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids. This pathway is essential for energy production and lipid metabolism in human cells. The ACOXL protein is active in peroxisomes, which are cellular organelles that play a significant role in lipid metabolism and detoxification (Hong2013A).

In the context of gene expression regulation, ACOXL is influenced by the activity of SNORD115 and SNORD116, which are small nucleolar RNAs. These RNAs act synergistically to regulate the expression of several genes, including ACOXL. The expression of ACOXL is typically higher in normal patients compared to those with Prader-Willi Syndrome, suggesting its role in maintaining normal metabolic functions (Falaleeva2015SNORD116).

ACOXL is also associated with the ontology term 'acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity,' indicating its involvement in metabolic pathways related to fatty acid degradation (Hong2013A). However, the specific function of ACOXL in healthy human cells is not fully detailed in the available literature, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role.
