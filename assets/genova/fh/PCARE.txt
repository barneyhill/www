# PCARE

## Overview
PCARE, also known as C2orf71, is a gene that encodes the photoreceptor cilium actin regulator protein, a crucial intracellular component involved in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is primarily expressed in the retina and plays a significant role in regulating actin dynamics within the photoreceptor cilium, which is essential for the formation of outer segment disks necessary for phototransduction (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical; CorralSerrano2020PCARE). The PCARE protein is characterized by its interaction with actin-associated proteins, such as WASF3, and its involvement in the activation of the ARP2/3 complex, which facilitates actin nucleation and the formation of a dynamic branched F-actin network (CorralSerrano2020PCARE). This network is crucial for ciliary membrane expansion and disk morphogenesis, processes vital for photoreceptor health and function (Smith2020Primary). Mutations in the PCARE gene are linked to retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its importance in retinal health (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

## Structure
The PCARE protein, encoded by the C2orf71 gene, is a ciliary intracellular protein consisting of 1,289 amino acids and weighing approximately 140 kDa. It is primarily expressed in the retina and plays a crucial role in photoreceptor cell function (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical; CorralSerrano2020PCARE). The protein is divided into three fragments: PCARE-F1, PCARE-F2, and PCARE-F3. PCARE-F1, spanning amino acids 2 to 449, is characterized by post-translational lipid modifications, including myristoylation at glycine position 2 and S-palmitoylation at cysteine position 3, which are essential for membrane anchoring and protein trafficking (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical). This region also contains a helical domain forming an antiparallel coiled coil, important for ciliary trafficking (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

PCARE-F2, covering amino acids 450 to 900, includes an actin-binding WH2 motif and sites for MAK/RP62 kinase, which are crucial for ciliary length and retinal health. It also has EVH1-binding motifs that promote actin filament formation (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical). PCARE-F3 features a nuclear localization signal and a proline-rich region, which, along with WH2 domains, enhance actin polymerase activity (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

PCARE interacts with proteins linked to actin dynamics, such as the WAVE regulatory complex member WASF3, inducing ARP2/3 complex activation necessary for actin nucleation and F-actin network formation (CorralSerrano2020PCARE). This interaction is crucial for the formation of photoreceptor outer segment disks, highlighting PCARE's role in organizing the cytoplasmic microtubule network and ciliary trafficking (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

## Function
The PCARE gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. PCARE is primarily involved in the regulation of actin dynamics within the photoreceptor cilium, which is essential for the formation of outer segment disks necessary for phototransduction. The protein localizes to the basal body and axoneme of the primary cilium, where it interacts with actin-associated proteins, including WASF3, a member of the WAVE regulatory complex. This interaction promotes actin nucleating activity, facilitating the formation of a dynamic branched F-actin network crucial for ciliary membrane expansion and disk morphogenesis (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical; CorralSerrano2020PCARE).

PCARE's function involves recruiting the ARP2/3 complex to the ciliary tip, inducing membrane expansion and supporting the development of new outer segment disks. This process is vital for maintaining photoreceptor health and function, as it ensures the proper organization and renewal of photoreceptor outer segments (Smith2020Primary; CorralSerrano2020PCARE). Mutations in PCARE can disrupt these processes, leading to retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in retinal health (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCARE gene are associated with several retinal diseases, most notably retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD). These conditions are characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In RP, mutations in PCARE lead to night blindness, peripheral visual field loss, and eventually central vision loss as the disease progresses from rod to cone degeneration (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical). CRD, on the other hand, involves initial cone dysfunction followed by rod deterioration, often resulting in earlier and more severe vision loss compared to RP (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

PCARE mutations are linked to ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in the ciliary components of cells. These mutations can disrupt the transport of proteins like WASF3 into the cilia, affecting the actin filament network and ciliary tip expansion, ultimately leading to photoreceptor dysfunction (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical). Additionally, digenic RP has been observed with heterozygous mutations in PCARE and other genes, such as FSCN2, and combinations with mutations in genes like CEP250 can lead to atypical Usher syndrome (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

## Interactions
PCARE, encoded by the C2orf71 gene, is a photoreceptor-specific ciliary protein that plays a crucial role in actin remodeling and protein transport within the cilia of photoreceptors. It interacts with several proteins, notably WASF3, a member of the WAVE regulatory complex involved in actin dynamics. This interaction is significant for the activation of the ARP2/3 complex, which is responsible for actin nucleation and the formation of the F-actin network necessary for outer segment disk formation in photoreceptors (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical; CorralSerrano2020PCARE).

PCARE also interacts with proteins associated with microtubules, centrosomes, and actin, such as OFD1, CEP290, and CEP250, which are involved in retinal ciliopathies. These interactions suggest PCARE's role in organizing the cytoplasmic microtubule network and ciliary trafficking (CorralSerrano2020PCARE). The recruitment of WASF3 to the photoreceptor cilium by PCARE enhances the formation of the F-actin network, leading to ciliary membrane expansion (ZufiaurreSeijo2023Clinical).

Additionally, PCARE interacts with proteins like ENAH and gelsolin, which are involved in actin dynamics, further supporting its role in actin network assembly and ciliary function (CorralSerrano2020PCARE). These interactions are crucial for the proper function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells.
