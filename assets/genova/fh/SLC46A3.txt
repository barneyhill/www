# SLC46A3

## Overview
SLC46A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 46 member 3, which functions as a lysosomal transporter. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of hepatic cytosolic copper homeostasis, playing a crucial role in the transport of copper into lysosomes, thereby maintaining copper balance within liver cells (Kim2021Lysosomal). Beyond its role in copper transport, SLC46A3 is implicated in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism, influencing mitochondrial morphology and activity by modulating copper availability (Kim2021Lysosomal). The expression of SLC46A3 is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and can be induced by environmental toxins such as TCDD, linking it to liver pathophysiology and energy homeostasis (Kim2021Lysosomal). The gene's involvement in cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes underscores its significance in liver health and disease.

## Function
SLC46A3 is a lysosomal transporter involved in modulating hepatic cytosolic copper homeostasis. It plays a critical role in transporting copper into lysosomes, which is essential for maintaining copper balance within liver cells. This function is supported by evidence showing increased copper levels in the lysosomal fraction of Slc46a3 knockout mice compared to wild-type mice, indicating its role in copper sequestration (Kim2021Lysosomal). SLC46A3 is also implicated in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. Overexpression of SLC46A3 leads to altered mitochondrial morphology, reduced mitochondrial potential, and decreased ATP levels, suggesting that it influences mitochondrial activity by affecting copper availability (Kim2021Lysosomal). The gene is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and is induced by TCDD, which links its expression to liver pathophysiology and energy homeostasis (Kim2021Lysosomal). SLC46A3's role in copper transport and its impact on mitochondrial function highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes in the liver. However, its specific function in healthy human cells remains less characterized (Kim2021Lysosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC46A3 gene have been linked to various liver-related conditions and diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SLC46A3 expression is significantly downregulated in the majority of tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This downregulation is associated with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and poorer patient prognosis. Overexpression of SLC46A3 in HCC cell lines has been shown to reduce cell migration and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Additionally, higher SLC46A3 expression levels correlate with better overall survival and relapse-free survival rates in HCC patients, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhao2019Increased).

SLC46A3 also plays a role in hepatic copper homeostasis, and its dysfunction can lead to copper deficiency, which is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal lipid metabolism. This can result in conditions such as hepatic steatosis and may contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases like Wilson's and Menkes disease. The gene's expression is induced by environmental toxins like TCDD, which can exacerbate liver toxicity and lipid accumulation, further implicating SLC46A3 in liver pathophysiology (Kim2021Lysosomal).
