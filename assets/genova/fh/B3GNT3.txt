# B3GNT3

## Overview
B3GNT3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3, a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycan structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the glycosylation process, which is essential for various cellular functions, including protein stability, cell-cell communication, and immune response modulation. The B3GNT3 protein is characterized by its glycosyltransferase domains, which facilitate the transfer of sugar moieties to specific substrates, influencing cellular processes such as cell migration, invasion, and immune evasion. The gene's expression and the resulting enzymatic activity have been implicated in several cancers, where it can either promote tumor progression or suppress malignancy, depending on the context (Zhang2015B3GNT3; Ho2013B3GNT3; Ma2023Targeting).

## Structure
The B3GNT3 gene encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes. The protein structure of B3GNT3 includes primary sequences of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure of the protein may consist of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and functional specificity. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional configuration, which is essential for its enzymatic activity.

B3GNT3 contains specific domains, such as glycosyltransferase domains, which are critical for its role in catalyzing the transfer of sugar moieties during glycosylation. These domains are integral to the protein's function and specificity in recognizing substrates. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, potentially influencing the enzyme's activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules.

The existence of splice variant isoforms of B3GNT3 can lead to structural diversity, allowing for variations in function and regulation. These isoforms may differ in their amino acid sequences, affecting the protein's overall structure and potentially its enzymatic properties. This structural diversity is significant for the protein's adaptability and functional versatility in various biological contexts.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the B3GNT3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high expression of B3GNT3 is associated with resistance to ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. This resistance is mediated through the N-glycosylation of 4F2hc, which stabilizes the protein and supports the assembly of system Xc-, promoting cystine uptake and activation of the GSH-GPX4 axis. Knockout of B3GNT3 sensitizes PDAC cells to ferroptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ma2023Targeting).

In lung cancer, B3GNT3 is overexpressed and linked to advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. It is a direct target of miR-149-5p, and its silencing reduces cell proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in promoting tumor growth (p&gt; B3GNT3; Sun2020&lt).

In cervical cancer, B3GNT3 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes, including pelvic lymph node metastasis and reduced survival rates. It is associated with high-risk HPV infection and advanced tumor stages, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Zhang2015B3GNT3).

Conversely, in neuroblastoma, B3GNT3 expression is linked to favorable outcomes, suppressing cell migration and invasion, and predicting better survival rates (Ho2013B3GNT3).

## Interactions
B3GNT3, a glycosyltransferase, participates in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, B3GNT3 interacts with the membrane protein 4F2hc, catalyzing its N-glycosylation. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and localization of 4F2hc on the cell surface, which is necessary for the recruitment of xCT to the plasma membrane and the assembly of system Xc-. This system is involved in cystine uptake and activation of the GSH-GPX4 axis, enhancing resistance to ferroptosis in PDAC cells (Ma2023Targeting). 

B3GNT3 also plays a role in the glycosylation of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune evasion in cancer. It increases glycosylation at specific sites on PD-L1, promoting its binding to PD-1 and potentially contributing to immune escape mechanisms in lung adenocarcinoma (Xiao2022B7). 

In neuroblastoma cells, B3GNT3 expression is associated with the suppression of cell migration and invasion by inhibiting the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules such as FAK, Src, and paxillin, which are crucial for these processes (Ho2013B3GNT3). These interactions highlight B3GNT3's role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular behaviors across different cancer types.
