# SCPPPQ1

## Overview
SCPPPQ1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein proline-glutamine rich 1, which plays a critical role in the structural integrity of the basal lamina at cell-tooth interfaces. This protein is characterized by its rich composition of proline, glutamine, and hydrophobic residues, contributing to its hydrophobic nature and potential antimicrobial properties (Mary2021Effect). SCPPPQ1 is involved in the formation of supramolecular complexes with other proteins such as amelotin (AMTN) and odontogenic ameloblast-associated (ODAM), which are essential for the adhesion of epithelial cells to mineralized surfaces (Fouillen2017Interactions). The protein's ability to self-aggregate and form molecular networks is crucial for maintaining the structural organization of the basal lamina, particularly during tooth development and maturation (Mary2021Effect; Moffatt2014Characterisation).

## Structure
The SCPPPQ1 protein, encoded by the human SCPPPQ1 gene, is characterized by a sequence rich in proline, glutamine, and hydrophobic residues, contributing to its hydrophobic nature (Mary2021Effect). The primary structure of SCPPPQ1 consists of 87 to 95 amino acids, with a predicted cleavable signal peptide of 15 residues (Moffatt2014Characterisation). The mature protein, excluding the signal peptide, has a computed isoelectric point (pI) close to 6 and is rich in proline (~20%), leucine (~17%), glutamine (~12%), and phenylalanine (~10%) (Moffatt2014Characterisation).

Secondary structure predictions indicate the presence of two alpha helices and two extended strands (Moffatt2014Characterisation). The human SCPPPQ1 protein is predicted to have two α-helices and three β-sheets, differing from the rat version, which has three α-helices and no β-sheets (Mary2021Effect). A conserved serine phosphorylation motif (SSSE) is located at positions 26-29, with the first two serines potentially being phosphorylation sites (Moffatt2014Characterisation).

The protein's tertiary structure has been modeled using i-TASSER, showing an overlay of human and rat SCPPPQ1 proteins with labeled secondary structure elements (Mary2021Effect). SCPPPQ1 has a propensity to form multimolecular assemblies, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving self-interaction and aggregation (Fouillen2017Interactions).

## Function
SCPPPQ1, or secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein proline-glutamine rich 1, is a protein involved in the structural integrity of the basal lamina at cell-tooth interfaces. It is expressed in the gingival epithelium and plays a role in mediating the attachment of epithelial cells to tooth surfaces (Mary2021Effect; Moffatt2014Characterisation). SCPPPQ1 is part of a specialized basal lamina that includes other proteins such as amelotin (AMTN) and odontogenic ameloblast-associated (ODAM), which together form supramolecular complexes essential for binding epithelial cells to mineralized surfaces (Fouillen2017Interactions).

The protein is characterized by its ability to self-aggregate and form molecular networks, which is crucial for its function in maintaining the structural organization of the basal lamina (Mary2021Effect; Fouillen2017Interactions). SCPPPQ1 is rich in proline, glutamine, and hydrophobic residues, contributing to its hydrophobic nature and potential antimicrobial activity (Mary2021Effect). During tooth development, SCPPPQ1 is expressed at the ameloblast-enamel interface during the maturation stage, indicating its involvement in the maturation of tooth structures and the formation of the primary junctional epithelium (Moffatt2014Characterisation).

## Interactions
SCPPPQ1, a protein encoded by the human gene SCPPPQ1, is involved in several interactions within the specialized basal lamina (sBL) that attaches epithelial cells to tooth mineral. It interacts with amelotin (AMTN) and odontogenic ameloblast-associated (ODAM) proteins, forming a macromolecular complex essential for the structural integrity of the sBL. These interactions are crucial for mediating the adhesion of epithelial cells to mineralized surfaces, providing a protective seal against bacterial invasion (Fouillen2017Interactions).

SCPPPQ1 exhibits a high propensity for self-interaction, which is consistent with its tendency to aggregate during purification. This self-interaction contributes to the formation of linear profiles that, when combined with AMTN and ODAM, create a porous supramolecular network within the sBL. This network is thought to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sBL (Fouillen2017Interactions).

The protein-protein interactions involving SCPPPQ1 were confirmed using techniques such as bacterial two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation. These studies demonstrated that SCPPPQ1, along with AMTN and ODAM, can form supramolecular aggregates, which are important for the extracellular matrix's structure and function (Fouillen2017Interactions).
