# SLC25A24

## Overview
SLC25A24 is a gene that encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 25 member 24, also referred to as the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC1). This protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family and plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transport of adenine nucleotides and phosphate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The SLC25A24 protein is characterized by its three-domain structure, which includes an N-terminal calcium-regulatory domain, a linker loop domain, and a C-terminal carrier domain responsible for substrate transport. The protein's function is regulated by calcium ions through a unique locking pin mechanism, allowing it to respond to cellular energetic demands. Mutations in the SLC25A24 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including Fontaine progeroid syndrome, and its expression levels have implications in diseases such as autism spectrum disorder and colon cancer (Harborne2017Calcium; Chen2022An; Palmieri2020Diseases).

## Structure
The SLC25A24 protein, also known as the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC1), is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family and is involved in transporting solutes across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The protein has a three-domain structure: an N-terminal calcium-regulatory domain with four EF-hand motifs, a linker loop domain with an amphipathic α-helix, and a C-terminal carrier domain responsible for substrate transport (Harborne2017Calcium; Ruprecht2020The). The N-terminal domain is crucial for calcium regulation, as it binds calcium ions, which modulate the protein's transport activity through a "locking pin mechanism" (Harborne2017Calcium).

The secondary structure of SLC25A24 includes transmembrane α-helices, which are typical of mitochondrial carriers. The C-terminal carrier domain features a structural fold common to mitochondrial carriers, consisting of three homologous sequence repeats, each with two membrane-spanning α-helices connected by a matrix α-helix (Harborne2017Calcium). The tertiary structure involves a compact arrangement that facilitates the transport function, with the amphipathic α-helix playing a key regulatory role by interacting with different domains based on calcium presence (Harborne2017Calcium).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate the activity of SLC25A24, although specific details are not provided in the context. Splice variant isoforms may exist, contributing to the functional diversity of the protein (Palmieri2013The).

## Function
The SLC25A24 gene encodes the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC1), a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transport of adenine nucleotides and phosphate across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Harborne2017Calcium; Palmieri2013The). This carrier is involved in importing adenine nucleotides into the mitochondrial matrix and exporting phosphate to the cytosol, processes essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Harborne2017Calcium). 

SLC25A24 is regulated by calcium through a unique locking pin mechanism, which involves the interaction of EF-hand motifs and an amphipathic α-helix within the protein. This regulation allows the carrier to respond to cellular energetic demands by controlling the size of the matrix adenine nucleotide pool (Harborne2017Calcium). The protein's activity is modulated by external calcium levels, which activate the carrier and facilitate ATP uptake (Harborne2017Calcium). 

In healthy human cells, SLC25A24 contributes to respiratory function and protects against calcium-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, thus playing a vital role in cellular growth and energy metabolism (Harborne2017Calcium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC25A24 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Gorlin-Chaudhry-Moss and Fontaine-Farriaux syndromes, now collectively known as Fontaine progeroid syndrome, are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the SLC25A24 gene, specifically the de novo p.Arg217Cys or p.Arg217His mutations. These mutations are associated with symptoms such as aged appearance, short stature, hypertrichosis, skull deformities, and cardiovascular abnormalities. The connection between these mutations and the symptoms is not fully understood, but they may lead to impaired energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction (Palmieri2020Diseases).

Alterations in the expression of SLC25A24, particularly through increased methylation, can lead to reduced gene expression and impaired mitochondrial function. This reduction is associated with higher rates of cell death due to oxidative stress, making neuronal cells vulnerable to damage. Such mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD. In ASD, reduced expression of SLC25A24 has been reported in the thalamus and motor cortex, potentially contributing to sensory processing and response inhibition impairments (Farrow2021SLC25A24).

In colon cancer, high expression of SLC25A24 is statistically significant for longer survival in patients, and its expression levels are associated with clinical stage and prognosis (Chen2022An).
