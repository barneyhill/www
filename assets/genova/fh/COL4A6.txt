# COL4A6

## Overview
The COL4A6 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha 6 chain, a crucial component of the basement membrane, which is a specialized structure that supports and separates epithelial and endothelial cells from underlying connective tissue. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in forming the extracellular matrix. The collagen type IV alpha 6 chain is involved in the formation of heterotrimers with other type IV collagen chains, contributing to the structural integrity and function of various tissues, including the kidney, oral mucosa, and inner ear. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are vital for processes such as cell adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, and tissue development. Mutations in COL4A6 are associated with several clinical conditions, including Alport syndrome and diffuse leiomyomatosis, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions (Ninomiya1995Differential; Komori2018Type; Heidet1995Deletions).

## Structure
The COL4A6 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha 6 chain, a component of the basement membrane. The primary structure of the alpha 6(IV) chain consists of 1690 amino acids, including a 21-residue signal peptide, a 24-residue amino-terminal non-collagenous (NC) domain, a central collagenous domain of 1417 residues, and a 228-residue carboxy-terminal NC1 domain (Ninomiya1995Differential; Zhou1994Complete). The collagenous domain features a Gly-X-Y repeat structure, which is characteristic of collagenous polypeptides, and includes 25 interruptions that provide flexibility (Oohashi1994Identification; Zhou1994Complete).

The secondary structure involves the formation of a triple helix, stabilized by the Gly-X-Y repeats. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these helices, while the quaternary structure involves the assembly into a network with other type IV collagen chains, forming heterotrimers through NC1 domain association (Sand2016Type). The NC1 domain contains 12 cysteine residues, which form disulfide bonds contributing to a compact structure (Harvey2005Type).

Post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are common in collagen molecules (Sand2016Type). The COL4A6 gene is known to have splice variants, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functions (SUND2005Bifunctional).

## Function
The COL4A6 gene encodes the alpha 6 chain of type IV collagen, a critical component of basement membranes in various tissues. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these membranes, particularly in the oral mucosa, kidney, and inner ear. In the oral mucosa, the alpha 6 chain is part of the α112:α556 network, which is essential for keratinization, a process crucial for healthy gingival tissue. The absence of the α6 chain leads to reduced keratinization, highlighting its importance in epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (Komori2018Type).

In the kidney, the α6(IV) chain is found in the basement membranes of Bowman's capsule and distal tubules, contributing to the structural integrity and filtration function of the renal system (SUND2005Bifunctional). The protein is also involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and structural integrity, as evidenced by its localization in the ECM and its role in pathways such as focal adhesion and ECM-receptor interaction (Ma2020Downregulation).

In the inner ear, COL4A6 is expressed in membranous and osseous structures, playing a role in cochlear development and function (Rost2013Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and deletions in the COL4A6 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Alport syndrome (AS) and diffuse leiomyomatosis (DL). Alport syndrome is a hereditary nephropathy characterized by progressive renal failure, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. It is often linked to deletions involving both the COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes, which are located on the X chromosome (Segal1999LINE1; Heidet1995Deletions). In some cases, these deletions also lead to diffuse leiomyomatosis, a condition involving smooth muscle tumors in the esophagus and other areas (Liu2015Chinese; Heidet1995Deletions).

The presence of contiguous gene deletions in COL4A5 and COL4A6 can result in Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis (AS-DL), with symptoms such as hematuria, proteinuria, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. These symptoms are more severe in males due to the X-linked inheritance pattern (Zhou2021Clinical). Additionally, mutations in COL4A6 have been implicated in X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss, where specific variants can lead to cochlear malformations and severe sensorineural hearing loss (Rost2013Novel; O’Brien2021Confirmation). These findings highlight the critical role of COL4A6 in maintaining normal auditory and renal function.

## Interactions
The COL4A6 gene encodes the alpha 6 chain of type IV collagen, which is a component of the basement membrane. This protein is involved in forming a network with other collagen IV chains, such as COL4A1, COL4A2, COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues (Parkin2011Mapping). The COL4A6 chain is part of the a5a5a6 heterotrimer, which is one of the structural forms of collagen IV (Parkin2011Mapping).

COL4A6 interacts with various extracellular matrix proteins, including laminin and nidogen, which are crucial for maintaining the basement membrane's structure and function (Parkin2011Mapping). The NC1 domain of the COL4A6 chain plays a role in regulating angiogenesis, with binding sites for endothelial cell integrins and heparin, which can have anti-angiogenic effects (Parkin2011Mapping).

In prostate cancer, the downregulation of COL4A6 is associated with the activation of the p-FAK/MMP-9 signaling pathway, promoting cell migration and invasion (Ma2020Downregulation). This suggests that COL4A6 may have a regulatory role in cellular processes related to cancer progression.
