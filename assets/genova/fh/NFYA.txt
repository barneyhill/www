# NFYA

## Overview
The NFYA gene encodes the nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha, a critical component of the NF-Y transcription factor complex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to the CCAAT box, a common promoter element in eukaryotic genes. The NFYA protein, in conjunction with NF-YB and NF-YC subunits, forms a heterotrimeric complex that is essential for high-affinity DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Structurally, NFYA is characterized by a histone fold domain and specific alpha-helices that facilitate its interaction with DNA and other proteins. Functionally, NFYA is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, differentiation, and response to physiological signals. Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which generate isoforms with distinct roles in cellular function and disease. Alterations in NFYA expression and splicing are implicated in several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific; Okada2023NFYA; Mantovani1999The).

## Structure
The NFYA subunit of the nuclear transcription factor Y is characterized by a complex molecular structure that facilitates its role in DNA binding and transcription regulation. The primary structure of NFYA includes a sequence of amino acids that form two alpha-helices, A1 and A2, which are crucial for its function (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific). The secondary structure is defined by these alpha-helices, which are rich in basic residues and overlap with nuclear localization signals, aiding in nuclear import (Libetti2019NFYA).

The tertiary structure of NFYA involves the formation of a specific 3D shape that allows it to interact with DNA and other subunits. The A2 helix and a Gly-X-Gly-Gly-Arg-Phe motif are essential for DNA binding, inserting into the DNA minor groove and causing a bend in the DNA (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific). NFYA's quaternary structure is formed by its association with NFYB and NFYC subunits, creating a heterotrimeric complex that binds to the CCAAT box in DNA (Nardone2017Structural).

NFYA contains a histone fold domain, which is similar to other histone-like proteins, facilitating its interaction with DNA (Nardone2017Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, particularly at Ser320, can influence its DNA binding capability (Bernardini2018The). NFYA also exists in two isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the long form containing an additional 28 amino acids (Libetti2019NFYA).

## Function
NFYA, a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transcriptional activation of genes containing CCAAT motifs, which are prevalent in eukaryotic promoters (Mantovani1999The). NFYA is essential for cell cycle control and differentiation, as its expression levels vary across different cell types and growth conditions. For instance, NFYA levels increase during the maturation of monocytes into macrophages, indicating its role in cell differentiation (Dolfini2011NF-Y; Mantovani1999The).

NFYA is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the assembly of the NF-Y complex, enabling precise transcriptional regulation. It interacts with other transcription factors and coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferases, to enhance transcriptional activity by modifying chromatin structure (Mantovani1999The). NFYA's function is also modulated by post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which affect its stability and role in cell cycle progression (Dolfini2011NF-Y).

In muscle cells, NFYA is necessary for both proliferation and differentiation, although its expression is downregulated during differentiation, coinciding with the downregulation of cell cycle genes (Maity2017NFY). Overall, NFYA is crucial for maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis, influencing processes like cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to physiological signals (Maity2017NFY).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFYA gene are implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the NFYAv1 splice variant is associated with malignant behavior through the regulation of lipid metabolism. NFYAv1 upregulates lipogenic enzymes such as ACACA and FASN, which are crucial for the aggressive nature of TNBC. Targeting the NFYAv1-lipogenesis axis is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy (Okada2023NFYA).

In prostate cancer, alternative splicing of NFYA contributes to tumor aggressiveness. The NF-YA isoforms, particularly NF-YAs and NF-YAl, have distinct roles, with NF-YAs linked to tumor proliferation and NF-YAl promoting cell migration. A high NF-YAl/NF-YAs ratio is observed in circulating prostate cancer cells, indicating a role in metastasis (Belluti2021Alternative; Dolfini2024Expression).

In colorectal cancer, NF-YAl is associated with reduced proliferation and increased cell migration, while NF-YAs maintains cell adherence, highlighting the isoforms' contrasting roles in cancer progression (Dolfini2024Expression). NFYA is also identified as a significant transcription factor in diffuse gastric cancer, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased cell proliferation (Cao2018Gene).

## Interactions
NFYA, a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, plays a crucial role in DNA binding and transcription regulation by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids. NFYA forms a heterotrimeric complex with NF-YB and NF-YC subunits, which is essential for binding to the CCAAT box, a common element in eukaryotic promoters. The NF-YB and NF-YC subunits form a stable dimeric scaffold that associates with NFYA, allowing the complex to bind DNA with high affinity and specificity (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific; Nardone2017Structural).

NFYA interacts with DNA by inserting its A2 helix into the DNA minor groove, inducing a bend in the DNA, which facilitates the binding of other transcription factors to adjacent major grooves (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific). This interaction is crucial for transcriptional activation and the establishment of chromatin modifications at CCAAT promoters (Nardini2013SequenceSpecific).

NFYA also interacts with the transcription factor Sp1, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, and GST pull-down assays. This interaction occurs independently of DNA and is conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Roder1999Interaction). These interactions underscore NFYA's role in regulating gene expression through complex protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.
