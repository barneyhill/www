# ALDH1L2

## Overview
The ALDH1L2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L2, which plays a pivotal role in folate metabolism. This enzyme is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and is involved in the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and carbon dioxide, a reaction that is crucial for maintaining the cellular folate pool and supporting one-carbon metabolism (Strickland2011Enzymatic; Krupenko2010ALDH1L2). The enzyme is characterized by its unique structure, comprising three distinct domains, and is localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the distribution of one-carbon groups between cellular compartments (Strickland2011Enzymatic). ALDH1L2 is also involved in the production of NADPH, which is essential for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy balance (Krupenko2020Aldh1l2). The enzyme's expression is notably high in the pancreas, heart, and brain, underscoring its importance in these tissues (Krupenko2010ALDH1L2).

## Structure
The ALDH1L2 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that is a homolog of the cytosolic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH). The protein is composed of 923 amino acids and includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence of 22 amino acids at the N-terminus, which is cleaved upon mitochondrial import (Krupenko2010ALDH1L2). The enzyme consists of three distinct domains: an N-terminal 10-fTHF hydrolase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal domain homologous to aldehyde dehydrogenases (Strickland2011Enzymatic). The N-terminal domain contains the folate binding site, while the intermediate domain is homologous to acyl carrier proteins and is crucial for the enzyme's activity due to the attachment of a 4′-phosphopantetheine (4-PP) group (Strickland2011Enzymatic).

The C-terminal domain can catalyze esterase reactions but does not exhibit typical aldehyde dehydrogenase activity with short-chain aldehyde substrates (Strickland2011Enzymatic). The enzyme exists as a tetramer, similar to its cytosolic counterpart (Strickland2011Enzymatic). Post-translational modification involves the attachment of a 4-PP group by 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase at Ser375, which is necessary for the enzyme's dehydrogenase activity (Strickland2011Enzymatic). The enzyme's structure and function are integrated into mitochondrial folate metabolism, which is compartmentalized within eukaryotic cells (Strickland2011Enzymatic).

## Function
The ALDH1L2 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in folate metabolism, specifically catalyzing the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-fTHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in an NADP+-dependent manner (Strickland2011Enzymatic; Krupenko2010ALDH1L2). This reaction is crucial for maintaining the folate pool and supporting one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and other cellular processes (Vasiliou2013Aldehyde; Krupenko2010ALDH1L2). The enzyme is localized in the mitochondria and plays a significant role in distributing one-carbon groups between the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments, which is important for various biosynthetic reactions, including amino acid metabolism (Krupenko2010ALDH1L2).

ALDH1L2 also contributes to the production of NADPH, a critical cofactor for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense, helping to maintain mitochondrial integrity and energy balance (Krupenko2020Aldh1l2). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modification, specifically the attachment of a 4'-phosphopantetheine group, which is necessary for its dehydrogenase function (Strickland2011Enzymatic). ALDH1L2 is highly expressed in the pancreas, heart, and brain, indicating its importance in these tissues (Krupenko2010ALDH1L2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH1L2 gene have been implicated in neuro-ichthyotic syndromes, a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by neurological and skin abnormalities. These mutations lead to a deficiency in the mitochondrial enzyme 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, which is crucial for folate metabolism and NADPH production. The loss of ALDH1L2 function results in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and altered lipid metabolism, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Sarret2019Deleterious).

Patients with ALDH1L2 mutations exhibit symptoms such as hypotonia, ichthyosis, developmental delays, and atypical MRI findings. These symptoms are distinct from those associated with Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, which is linked to mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (Sarret2019Deleterious). The study of fibroblasts from affected individuals shows altered mitochondrial morphology and metabolic profiles, including changes in amino acid, nucleotide, and lipid pathways (Sarret2019Deleterious).

In addition to its role in neuro-ichthyotic syndromes, ALDH1L2 has been studied in the context of cancer. Its expression is upregulated in certain tumors, such as colorectal cancer and melanoma, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and metastasis (Krupenko2020Aldh1l2). The enzyme's involvement in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy balance highlights its clinical significance in various metabolic disorders (Krupenko2020Aldh1l2).
