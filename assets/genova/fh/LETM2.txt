# LETM2

## Overview
LETM2, or leucine zipper and EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of leucine zipper motifs and EF-hand domains, which are indicative of its role in calcium binding and signaling. LETM2 is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it is thought to play a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. The protein's involvement in calcium homeostasis suggests its potential impact on cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis. Dysregulation of LETM2 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding mitochondrial-related diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
