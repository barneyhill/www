# MRPL53

## Overview
MRPL53 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L53, a crucial component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial translation machinery, facilitating the synthesis of proteins necessary for the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is essential for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Masotti2017MRPL53). As a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, MRPL53 is involved in protein-protein interactions within the ribosomal complexes, contributing to the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Wessels2013Analysis). The gene's expression and function are critical for normal cellular processes, and disruptions in MRPL53 have been linked to developmental abnormalities and diseases, including nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate and diabetes-related mitochondrial dysfunction (Masotti2017MRPL53; Del2019Diabetes‐mediated). Understanding MRPL53's role in mitochondrial biology is essential for elucidating its contributions to both health and disease.

## Function
MRPL53 encodes a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein plays a critical role in the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are necessary for the oxidative phosphorylation system. Oxidative phosphorylation is a vital process for ATP production, providing energy for various cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, and migration (Masotti2017MRPL53).

MRPL53 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function. The proper functioning of the mitochondrial translation machinery, which includes MRPL53, is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Disruptions in MRPL53 levels can potentially affect cellular processes and have been implicated in developmental abnormalities, such as craniofacial development issues (Masotti2017MRPL53).

The gene's involvement in mitochondrial ribosome function and its interaction with transcription factors like MYC suggest its importance in normal facial morphogenesis and possibly in the pathogenesis of conditions like nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCL/P) (Masotti2017MRPL53). Understanding the molecular activities of MRPL53 is essential for unraveling its role in both healthy and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
The MRPL53 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function. Research by Masotti et al. suggests that genetic variants near MRPL53, specifically rs1063588 and rs6546909, are associated with an increased risk of non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) in individuals with higher Native American ancestry. These variants are in high linkage disequilibrium and are thought to affect MRPL53 expression, potentially contributing to orofacial clefting by disrupting craniofacial development (Masotti2017MRPL53).

In the context of diabetes, MRPL53 has been identified as one of the mitochondrial proteins upregulated in both tumor and adjacent mucosa in diabetic patients. This upregulation is part of a broader pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with diabetes, which may contribute to carcinogenesis through increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis (Del2019Diabetes‐mediated).

Additionally, the integration of proteomics with genomics has shown that normal expression levels of MRPL53 can be used to reject non-pathogenic variants in the context of diagnosing Mendelian disorders, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Kopajtich2021Integration).

## Interactions
MRPL53 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically part of the large 39S subunit. It is involved in protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial ribosomal complexes. Complexome profiling studies have identified MRPL53 as part of a 200 kDa subcomplex, suggesting its potential interactions with proteins such as C14ORF156 (SLIRP), LRPPRC, and cytochrome c oxidase subunits (Wessels2013Analysis). These interactions indicate that MRPL53 may play a role in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, possibly through co-migration with other mitoribosomal proteins.

The study by Wessels et al. also suggests that MRPL53 might be involved in the co-translational assembly of inner mitochondrial membrane complexes with mitoribosomal complexes, indicating a dynamic role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Wessels2013Analysis). Additionally, MRPL53 has been identified as an ortholog of yeast Mrpl44, linking it to known ribosomal proteins in other species, which may provide insights into its evolutionary conservation and functional significance (Smits2007Reconstructing). These interactions highlight the importance of MRPL53 in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes.
