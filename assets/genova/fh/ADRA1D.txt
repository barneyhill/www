# ADRA1D

## Overview
The ADRA1D gene encodes the alpha-1D adrenergic receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in the sympathetic nervous system. This receptor is primarily involved in mediating physiological responses to catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, and is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. The alpha-1D adrenergic receptor is crucial for vasoconstriction and the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone, making it a significant factor in cardiovascular function (Zhong1999α1Adrenoceptor; Ahles2014Polymorphic). Additionally, it is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are essential for smooth muscle contraction and cellular growth (Zhong1999α1Adrenoceptor). The receptor's activity extends to the central nervous system, where it influences neurotransmitter release, although its precise role in the brain remains to be fully elucidated (Ahles2014Polymorphic).

## Structure


## Function
The ADRA1D gene encodes the alpha-1D adrenergic receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family involved in the sympathetic nervous system. This receptor primarily mediates physiological responses to catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine. It is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, where it plays a crucial role in vasoconstriction and the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone (Zhong1999α1Adrenoceptor; Ahles2014Polymorphic).

The alpha-1D adrenergic receptor is involved in several molecular processes, including the activation of phospholipase C through the Gq/11 family of G proteins. This activation leads to the release of stored calcium ions and the activation of protein kinase C, which are essential for smooth muscle contraction (Zhong1999α1Adrenoceptor). Additionally, the receptor is implicated in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are important for cellular growth and differentiation (Zhong1999α1Adrenoceptor).

In the central nervous system, alpha-1D adrenergic receptors are abundant and play a role in neurotransmitter release, although their precise functional role in the brain remains unclear (Ahles2014Polymorphic). The receptor's activity is also linked to various physiological outcomes, such as influencing bladder and prostate tone and affecting pupil width (Ahles2014Polymorphic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADRA1D gene have been implicated in several health conditions. In the context of hypertension, ADRA1D is a key regulator of the sympathetic nervous system and is involved in vasoconstriction, which affects blood pressure. Studies have shown that increased expression of ADRA1D is associated with hypertension, particularly in conditions of elevated dietary salt. Targeting ADRA1D expression has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing hypertension and its associated renal damage (Du2021QiShenYiQi).

In glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain cancer, ADRA1D expression is significantly lower in tumor samples compared to healthy controls. This suggests a potential role in tumor formation, although the specific involvement of ADRA1D in GBM is not fully understood. The differential expression of ADRA1D in GBM is likely due to regulatory mechanisms other than promoter and gene methylation (Kraboth2021Involvement).

Despite these associations, large genome-wide association studies have not shown significant links between ADRA1D and specific traits, including blood pressure regulation and other conditions, indicating a need for further research to clarify its clinical significance (Ahles2014Polymorphic).

## Interactions
The ADRA1D protein, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several significant protein-protein interactions. It interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins, notably forming complexes with syntrophins and the protein Scribble (SCRIB). These interactions are crucial for the receptor's function and localization. ADRA1D forms a unique complex with SCRIB and syntrophin, which is not observed in other GPCRs with C-terminal Type I PDZ ligands. This complex is essential for the proper cellular localization and function of α1D-ARs, and its disruption could lead to therapeutic benefits (Janezic2019Scribble).

SCRIB binds to the α1D-AR with higher affinity than other known interactors, such as syntrophin, CASK, and DLG1. The PDZ domains 1 and 4 of SCRIB are identified as high-affinity interaction sites for α1D-AR, suggesting these sites as potential drug targets for diseases associated with abnormal α1D-AR signaling (Janezic2019Scribble). The interaction between α1D-AR and SCRIB is cooperative, with multiple PDZ domains of SCRIB contributing to the binding affinity (Janezic2019Scribble).

ADRA1D also forms a signalosome with syntrophin and utrophin, which is crucial for its role in regulating blood pressure. This interaction is essential for the functional expression of α1D-AR in vascular smooth muscle cells (Lyssand2008Blood).
