# CCT6B

## Overview
CCT6B is a gene that encodes the protein chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 6B, which is a component of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins, particularly those with complex tertiary structures such as actin and tubulin (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). The CCT6B protein is one of the eight subunits that form the double-ring structure of the CCT complex, which is essential for its function in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Liu2021Exploring). The CCT6B subunit, like other subunits in the complex, is involved in recognizing and binding substrate proteins, facilitating their proper folding and preventing aggregation (Yi2019Overexpression). The expression and function of CCT6B have been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer and fibrotic conditions, highlighting its significance in cellular physiology and pathology (Yi2019Overexpression; Li2021Prognostic).

## Structure
The CCT6B protein is a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, which is involved in protein folding. The primary structure of CCT6B consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, although the exact sequence is not detailed in the provided context. The secondary structure of CCT6B includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common structural motifs in proteins (Liu2021Exploring). The tertiary structure of CCT6B forms a barrel-like shape, typical of chaperonin subunits, facilitating the encapsulation and folding of substrate proteins within the complex (Liu2021Exploring).

In terms of quaternary structure, CCT6B is part of a larger complex composed of eight different subunits, forming a double-ring hexadecamer. This structure is crucial for its function in protein folding (Liu2021Exploring). The CCT complex, including CCT6B, has three domains: an apical domain for substrate recognition, an intermediate domain, and an equatorial domain containing the ATP-binding site (Liu2021Exploring).

Common post-translational modifications of CCT6B may include phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms of CCT6B.

## Function
CCT6B is a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex, which plays a crucial role in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins, particularly actin and tubulin, within the cytoplasm. This complex is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and ensuring proper cytoskeletal function, which is vital for cell division and intracellular transport (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). The CCT complex, composed of multiple subunits including CCT6B, assists in the folding and refolding of proteins, thereby preventing misfolding and aggregation that could lead to cellular dysfunction (Yi2019Overexpression).

CCT6B is specifically involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins, which are critical for maintaining cell shape, enabling cell movement, and facilitating intracellular transport processes. The proper functioning of the CCT complex, including CCT6B, is therefore integral to cellular activities such as mitosis and maintaining the structural integrity of cells (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). The expression of CCT6B is notably high in reproductive tissues, such as the testis, suggesting a specialized role in these tissues, potentially related to the high demand for protein folding during spermatogenesis (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCT6B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and fibrotic conditions. In joint contracture, a fibrous disease characterized by joint capsule fibrosis, CCT6B expression is significantly decreased in fibroblasts from contractive joints. Overexpression of CCT6B in these fibroblasts inhibits the expression of fibrous markers and reduces fibroblast migration and collagen synthesis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for joint contracture (Yi2019Overexpression).

In cancer, CCT6B has been studied for its role in tumor progression and prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCT6B expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its high expression is associated with better overall survival, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Liu2021Exploring; Li2021Prognostic). Conversely, in thyroid cancer, high expression of CCT6B is associated with poor patient survival and is correlated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting its involvement in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Bai2024Effects).

In breast cancer, CCT6B is noted for its decreased expression in cancerous tissues, contrasting with other TRiC subunits that are typically upregulated, highlighting its unique role among these subunits (Xu2021Systematic). These findings underscore the complex role of CCT6B in different pathological contexts, where its expression levels and interactions can significantly impact disease outcomes.

## Interactions
CCT6B, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in protein folding. In humans, CCT6B is part of a nine-subunit complex that interacts with other subunits within the CCT complex and with various cellular proteins. The interactions of CCT6B are primarily physical, identified through methods such as affinity capture, which account for a significant portion of the interactions observed in humans (Narayanan2016The).

CCT6B has been shown to interact with proteins involved in diverse biological processes and diseases. Although specific physical interactions of CCT6B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is noted that CCT6B, along with other CCT subunits, plays a role in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin, which are crucial for cellular structure and function (Yi2019Overexpression). The CCT complex, including CCT6B, is also implicated in the folding of proteins with high beta sheet propensity, which are often misfolded in neurodegenerative diseases (Narayanan2016The).

In the context of joint contracture, overexpression of CCT6B in fibroblasts has been shown to inhibit the expression of fibrous markers and reduce fibroblast migration and collagen synthesis, indicating its potential role in modulating fibrotic processes (Yi2019Overexpression).
