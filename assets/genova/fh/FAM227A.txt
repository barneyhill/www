# FAM227A

## Overview
FAM227A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 227 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. FAM227A has been identified as a novel candidate gene in several pathological conditions, including chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and various cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer and other gynecological malignancies (Wu2020Unraveling; Lee2023Novel; Jia2021Multivariate). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been studied in the context of cancer, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis and disease progression. Despite these associations, the exact molecular mechanisms and pathways involving FAM227A require further investigation to clarify its role in health and disease.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM227A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through studies focusing on its genetic variants and expression levels. In the context of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, FAM227A was identified as a novel candidate gene. A specific variant, NM_001013647:c.637_646del, was found with a minor allele frequency of 0.0002 in the AMR population and predicted to be deleterious, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma (Lee2023Novel).

In cancer research, FAM227A has been associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It was identified as significantly differentially expressed and methylated between TNBC and non-TNBC, indicating its potential involvement in the molecular differences between these cancer types (Wu2020Unraveling). Additionally, FAM227A was highlighted as a novel pleiotropic gene potentially associated with breast, ovarian, and cervical cancers, with significant enrichment in pathways relevant to cancer biology (Jia2021Multivariate).

While FAM227A has been mentioned in studies related to prostate cancer, its clinical significance in this context remains unclear, as no direct correlation between identified SNPs and FAM227A expression was found (Shan2013Genome; Fiorica2020Multiethnic). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of FAM227A in these and other conditions.
