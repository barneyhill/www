# SPATS2L

## Overview
SPATS2L (spermatogenesis associated serine-rich 2-like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to gene expression and ribosomal biogenesis. The protein encoded by SPATS2L is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and translation, thereby influencing protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Palau2013Genomewide). This protein is ubiquitously expressed across multiple tissues, underscoring its importance in fundamental cellular functions such as chromosomal organization and cell proliferation (Palau2013Genomewide). While the precise mechanisms of SPATS2L in healthy cells are not fully understood, its involvement in processes like cell invasion and migration highlights its significance in development and tissue repair (Matsumoto2022Characteristic).

## Function
SPATS2L (spermatogenesis associated serine-rich 2-like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily related to gene expression activation. In healthy human cells, SPATS2L is associated with chromosomal organization and ribosomal biogenesis, suggesting a role in normal cell growth and proliferation (Palau2013Genomewide). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, impacting protein synthesis. This function is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and homeostasis.

SPATS2L is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its involvement in fundamental cellular processes. Although its specific function in healthy cells is not fully detailed, its role in ribosomal biogenesis and translational control suggests it contributes to normal cellular growth and proliferation (Palau2013Genomewide). The gene's expression is also linked to processes such as cell invasion and migration, which are essential during development and tissue repair (Matsumoto2022Characteristic).

Overall, SPATS2L plays a significant role in cellular processes that are vital for maintaining normal physiological functions, although its precise mechanisms in healthy human cells require further elucidation.

## Clinical Significance
The SPATS2L gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), SPATS2L is upregulated, particularly in cells resistant to treatments like homoharringtonine (HHT). High SPATS2L expression is associated with poor prognosis, as it correlates with shorter overall survival, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival. Knockdown of SPATS2L in AML cells has been shown to suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023Spermatogenesis).

In asthma, a genome-wide association study identified SPATS2L as a gene associated with bronchodilator response. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near SPATS2L, rs295137, was linked to variations in response to b2-agonists, indicating a role in the pharmacogenetics of asthma (Himes2012GenomeWide).

SPATS2L expression is also significant in gliomas, where it is upregulated in patients with EGFR amplification and CDKN2A deletion. Higher expression levels are linked to worse prognosis in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma multiforme, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2021Analysis).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SPATS2L mRNA is highly expressed, and its methylation status is inversely correlated with expression levels. Hypermethylation of SPATS2L is associated with longer survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic factor (Wei2023Prognostic).
