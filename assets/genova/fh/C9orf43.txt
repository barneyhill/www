# C9orf43

## Overview
C9orf43 is a gene located on chromosome 9 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 9 open reading frame 43. This protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, and its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in signaling pathways. The expression of C9orf43 has been observed in multiple tissue types, suggesting a role in diverse physiological contexts. Research into the gene and its encoded protein continues to uncover its significance in health and disease, particularly in relation to its potential involvement in certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
