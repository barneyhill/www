# KLHDC7A

## Overview
KLHDC7A is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 7A, which is characterized by the presence of a kelch domain, a structural motif known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes and has been associated with several diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and Dupuytren's contracture. The kelch domain containing 7A protein is involved in circadian rhythm regulation and may interact with immune cell populations and signaling pathways, such as those related to insulin-like growth factor I binding, which are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions (Ling2023Identification). Additionally, alterations in the phosphorylation levels of this protein have been observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, suggesting a potential role in cardiac function (Hu2020Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KLHDC7A (kelch domain containing 7A) is implicated in various protein-protein interactions, which may play a role in different diseases. In the context of diabetic retinopathy (DR), KLHDC7A is identified as a key circadian rhythm-related gene (CRRG) with potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The study by Ling et al. suggests that KLHDC7A is upregulated in DR and may interact with immune cell populations and signaling pathways such as death domain binding and insulin-like growth factor I binding, which are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms of DR (Ling2023Identification).

In Dupuytren's contracture (DC), KLHDC7A is highlighted as a differentially expressed gene that may play a role in the development of the condition. It is co-expressed with PRKCE, a member of the protein kinase C family involved in cell growth and β1-integrins activation, suggesting potential interactions within signaling pathways relevant to DC (Liu2015Screening).

In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the phosphorylation level of KLHDC7A is significantly increased, indicating a potential role in cardiac function, although specific interactions with other proteins in this context are not detailed (Hu2020Proteomic).
