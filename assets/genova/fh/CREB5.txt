# CREB5

## Overview
CREB5, or cAMP responsive element binding protein 5, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ATF/CREB family, characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain. This domain is essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing the protein to function as a CRE-dependent transactivator. The CREB5 protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including the development and maintenance of synovial joints and articular cartilage, as well as in cellular responses to external signals through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. It is involved in significant protein interactions that influence cancer progression and therapy resistance, particularly in prostate and colorectal cancers. Additionally, CREB5 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, where its expression levels correlate with disease severity. The multifaceted roles of CREB5 in both normal physiological and pathological contexts underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Nho2020Genome‐wide; Hwang2022CREB5; Zhang2021Creb5).

## Structure
CREB5 is a transcription factor that belongs to the ATF/CREB family and is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization (Wang2020CREB5). This domain allows CREB5 to form homodimers or heterodimers with other proteins, such as c-Jun or CRE-BP1, facilitating its role as a CRE-dependent transactivator (Wang2020CREB5). The protein also contains N-terminal zinc finger domains, which contribute to its functional capabilities (Wang2020CREB5).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating CREB5 activity. The N-terminus of CREB5 includes conserved Threonine-Proline sequences (T59 and T61) that are substrates for kinases such as p38, JNK, and ERK. Phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for its function in promoting Prg4 expression in chondrocytes (Zhang2021Creb5). The phosphorylation of T61 is notably enhanced by EGFR and TGF-β signals (Zhang2021Creb5).

CREB5 is also involved in various cellular processes, including resistance to androgen receptor-targeting therapies in prostate cancer, where it interacts with co-factors like JUN and FOS through its B-Zip and L-Zip domains (Hwang2022CREB5). These interactions are essential for its role in ART resistance (Hwang2022CREB5).

## Function
The CREB5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synovial joints and articular cartilage. It is involved in directing the articular perichondrium to develop into articular cartilage by repressing the expression of Wnt5a, which is necessary for growth plate formation, thereby allowing the formation of secondary ossification centers (Zhang2022Creb5). CREB5 maintains the competence for synovial joint formation by promoting the expression of Wnt family members that stabilize β-catenin and Gdf5, while blocking Wnt5a expression in the developing joint interzone (Zhang2022Creb5).

In articular cartilage, CREB5 is specifically expressed in the superficial zone chondrocytes and is essential for the expression of Prg4, a gene encoding lubricin, which is crucial for joint lubrication and protection against arthritis (Zhang2021Creb5). CREB5 binds directly to regulatory elements of the Prg4 promoter, facilitating its induction by TGF-β signaling (Zhang2021Creb5). The gene is also involved in maintaining zonal gene expression in articular cartilage, particularly in the superficial zone where it helps maintain flat cells (Zhang2022Creb5). Loss of CREB5 function leads to decreased expression of Prg4 and Wif1, premature endochondral ossification, and loss of flat cells in the articular cartilage's superficial zone (Zhang2022Creb5).

## Clinical Significance
CREB5 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 5) is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, particularly metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), CREB5 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to resistance against androgen-receptor antagonists and androgen deprivation therapies like enzalutamide. This overexpression is linked to high relapse rates and enhanced tumorigenicity, as CREB5 reactivates androgen receptor signaling, a key resistance mechanism (Hwang2019CREB5; Hwang2021CREB5).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CREB5 is associated with cisplatin resistance. It promotes cell proliferation and inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis by enhancing anti-apoptotic proteins and suppressing pro-apoptotic ones. CREB5's transcriptional regulation of the TOP1MT gene is a significant factor in this resistance (Tong2022A).

CREB5 is also linked to Alzheimer's disease, where increased expression correlates with poor memory performance and greater brain atrophy. It is associated with increased amyloid-beta accumulation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology (Nho2020Genome‐wide). These findings highlight CREB5's role in various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CREB5 (cAMP responsive element binding protein 5) is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer. CREB5 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and the pioneering factor FOXA1, which are crucial in the progression and resistance to androgen receptor-targeting therapies (ART) in prostate cancer. These interactions are significant in the reprogramming of nuclear interactions that promote ART resistance (Hwang2022CREB5; Hwang2021CREB5).

CREB5 also interacts with other nuclear proteins such as HOXB13, GRHL2, TBX3, and NFIC. These interactions are essential for transcription regulation and are associated with ART resistance. TBX3 and NFIC, in particular, are critical for cell viability and are often amplified or overexpressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Hwang2022CREB5; Hwang2021CREB5).

In colorectal cancer, CREB5 directly interacts with the MET promoter, enhancing MET signaling, which is involved in cancer progression. This interaction is facilitated by a specific binding site on the MET promoter, indicating a direct transcriptional role for CREB5 in activating MET expression (Wang2020CREB5). These interactions highlight CREB5's role in modulating transcriptional activity and its potential impact on cancer progression and therapy resistance.
