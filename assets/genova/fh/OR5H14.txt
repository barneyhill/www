# OR5H14

## Overview
OR5H14 is a gene in humans that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily H member 14, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection of odor molecules and contributing to the sense of smell. It is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, leading to signal transduction processes that result in the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Unlike some other olfactory receptors, OR5H14 is not a pseudogene, as it maintains intact coding sequences without frame shifts (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Additionally, OR5H14 has been implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility, with certain variants associated with an increased risk of the disease (Karyadi2016Whole). Further research is needed to fully understand the gene's role in both olfactory function and disease.

## Function
OR5H14 is a human gene encoding an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. OR5H14 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The activation of OR5H14 by specific odorants results in the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which subsequently leads to the expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). This process is used to measure the activity of the receptor in functional assays (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

OR5H14 is not a pseudogene, as it does not contain frame shifts in its coding sequences, distinguishing it from some other olfactory receptors (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). While the specific function of OR5H14 in healthy cells is not detailed, its role in olfactory signaling suggests it contributes to the perception of smell by detecting and responding to specific odorant molecules. This receptor is shared with chimpanzees but not with other species like mice, rats, or dogs, indicating a unique evolutionary aspect of its function in humans (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The OR5H14 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in prostate cancer susceptibility. A study by Karyadi et al. identified the OR5H14 variant p.Met59Val as being associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. This variant was found to have an odds ratio of 1.39, indicating a suggestive association with prostate cancer risk, particularly in non-aggressive cases (Karyadi2016Whole). The study involved whole exome sequencing in high-risk families and validation in independent case-control studies, highlighting the potential role of OR5H14 in the genetic underpinning of prostate cancer (Karyadi2016Whole).

Despite these findings, the specific function of OR5H14 in relation to prostate cancer remains unclear, and the model of causality is not yet established (Karyadi2016Whole). The study suggests that OR5H14, along with other identified genes, may contribute to prostate cancer susceptibility, but further research is needed to clarify its role (Karyadi2016Whole). The clinical significance of OR5H14 mutations beyond prostate cancer is not well-documented, and its role in other diseases or conditions remains to be explored.
