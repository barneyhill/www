# ANXA5

## Overview
The ANXA5 gene encodes annexin A5, a member of the annexin family of proteins, which are characterized by their ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. Annexin A5 is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including membrane repair, anticoagulation, and apoptosis regulation. It is known for forming two-dimensional arrays on phospholipid membranes, a feature that is crucial for its role in membrane resealing and cellular homeostasis (Carmeille2016Membrane; Gerke2002Annexins:). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as integrins and protein kinase C, further underscore its importance in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (Yu2019Annexin; Hoque2014Annexins). Clinically, alterations in ANXA5 expression have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer progression and pregnancy-related complications, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tiscia2016Functional; Sun2018Annexin).

## Structure
Annexin A5 (ANXA5) is a protein characterized by a conserved core domain composed of four annexin repeats, each approximately 70 amino acids long, forming a right-handed superhelix of five alpha-helices (Huber1990The; Moss2004Theannexins). The primary structure includes a variable N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal core domain (Hong2020Highresolution). The secondary structure is predominantly alpha-helical, contributing to a tightly packed, disk-like tertiary structure with a slight curvature (Gerke2002Annexins:). The convex side of the core contains calcium-binding sites and faces the membrane, while the concave side is accessible for interactions (Gerke2002Annexins:).

The quaternary structure of ANXA5 involves the formation of two-dimensional arrays on phospholipid membranes, influenced by calcium concentration, which is crucial for membrane repair (Hong2020Highresolution). ANXA5 can form trimers or higher-order oligomers, contributing to its functional properties (Mosser1991Subdomain). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and myristoylation are common, affecting interactions and functional specificity (Moss2004Theannexins). The protein's structure allows it to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner, a key feature of its role in cellular processes (Gerke2002Annexins:).

## Function
Annexin A5 (ANXA5) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is primarily involved in membrane repair, where it binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on damaged cell membranes. This binding facilitates the formation of two-dimensional arrays that help in membrane resealing, a process essential for maintaining cell integrity, particularly in muscle cells (Carmeille2016Membrane; Bouter2011AnnexinA5). ANXA5 also exhibits potent anticoagulant activity by binding to acidic phospholipids like PS on cell membranes, forming a protective shield that prevents excessive coagulation (Božič2005Antibodies).

In addition to its role in membrane repair and coagulation, ANXA5 is involved in apoptosis regulation. It binds to PS-exposing apoptotic cells, inhibiting their pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory activities (Božič2005Antibodies). ANXA5 also interacts with αvβ5 integrin, enhancing the phagocytic activity of retinal pigment epithelium cells, which is crucial for the clearance of apoptotic cells and photoreceptor outer segments (Yu2019Annexin). These functions highlight ANXA5's importance in cellular homeostasis and its protective roles in physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANXA5 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ANXA5 overexpression is linked to cancer progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. It is positively correlated with the upregulation of CRKI/II and RAC1, enhancing clinical progression and lymphatic metastasis through the integrin and MEK-ERK pathways (Sun2018Annexin). Knockdown of ANXA5 in HCC models results in decreased proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2018Annexin).

In gastric cancer, high ANXA5 expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy, particularly anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy. It is involved in angiogenesis and immune evasion, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Hong2024The). ANXA5 also plays a role in glioma, where its expression correlates with tumor grade and promotes invasion and chemoresistance through the PI3K-dependent mechanism (Jing2024The).

In the context of pregnancy, specific allelic variants in the ANXA5 promoter, such as the M2 haplotype, are linked to complications like recurrent pregnancy loss and small-for-gestational age newborns, due to reduced promoter activity and ANXA5 expression (Tiscia2016Functional).

## Interactions
Annexin A5 (ANXA5) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. ANXA5 interacts with actin in activated platelets, specifically binding to the g-isoform of actin. This interaction is calcium-dependent and forms a complex with an 85-kDa molecular weight, suggesting a direct association with the cytoskeleton of activated platelets (Tzima2000Annexin).

In retinal pigment epithelial cells, ANXA5 associates with the αvβ5 integrin, promoting its surface localization. This interaction is also calcium-dependent and requires the C-terminal annexin repeat 4 of ANXA5 for its activity (Yu2019Annexin).

ANXA5 modulates protein kinase C (PKC) localization and signaling. It interacts with PKCδ, facilitating its translocation to the membrane, which is essential for PKCδ's role in signal transduction pathways. This interaction is specific and does not involve a lipid bridge (Kheifets2006Protein; Hoque2014Annexins).

In human trophoblasts, ANXA5 forms a 2D-network at the plasma membrane, interacting with E-cadherin, β-catenin, and α-catenin. These interactions are crucial for trophoblast fusion, a process necessary for placental development (Degrelle2017AnnexinA5).
