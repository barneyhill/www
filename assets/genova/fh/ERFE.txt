# ERFE

## Overview
Erythroferrone (ERFE) is a gene that encodes the protein erythroferrone, a key regulator of iron homeostasis in the human body. Erythroferrone is primarily produced by erythroblasts in the bone marrow in response to erythropoietin signaling and functions as a hormone to modulate iron metabolism. It achieves this by suppressing the synthesis of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption and distribution, thereby ensuring adequate iron availability for hemoglobin production during increased erythropoietic activity. Structurally, erythroferrone is characterized by a complex molecular architecture, including a TNFα-like domain, and forms multimers that enhance its interaction with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This interaction allows erythroferrone to act as a BMP trap, sequestering BMP ligands and reducing hepcidin expression. The gene and its protein product have significant clinical implications, particularly in disorders of iron metabolism, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, where alterations in ERFE expression or function can lead to systemic iron imbalances (Srole2023Characterization; Andolfo2019The; Srole2020Erythroferrone).

## Structure
Erythroferrone (ERFE) is a protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in iron regulation. The primary structure of ERFE includes a leading signal sequence for secretion, a variable N-terminal region, and a TNFα-like head at the C terminus (Srole2023Characterization). The N-terminal domain contains several segments, including a hydrophobic segment (81-86), a cationic segment (96-107), a collagen segment (109-125), and a helical segment (126-148) (Srole2023Characterization). The hydrophobic segment, particularly the tryptophan residue W82, is essential for binding to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (Srole2023Characterization).

The secondary structure of ERFE includes small alpha helices in the N-terminal region, although it is mostly unstructured (Srole2023Characterization). The C-terminal region is highly structured and contains a globular TNFα-like domain (Srole2023Characterization).

ERFE forms trimers as its basic structural unit, which can further assemble into hexamers and high-molecular-weight oligomers, involving intermolecular disulfide bonds mediated by conserved cysteine residues (Stewart2020Protein). The cationic segment is crucial for multimerization, enhancing ERFE's avidity for BMP ligands (Srole2023Characterization).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-linked glycosylation, are critical for ERFE's proper folding and secretion (Stewart2020Protein). These modifications, along with specific cysteine residues, play significant roles in the structural integrity and function of ERFE (Stewart2020Protein).

## Function
Erythroferrone (ERFE) is a hormone produced by erythroblasts in the bone marrow in response to erythropoietin (EPO) signaling. It plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis by regulating the hormone hepcidin, which controls iron absorption and distribution in the body. ERFE functions by suppressing hepcidin synthesis, thereby facilitating the mobilization of iron from cellular stores for use in heme and hemoglobin synthesis. This process ensures that developing erythrocytes in the bone marrow have sufficient iron for hemoglobin production, which is vital during periods of increased erythropoietic activity, such as after blood loss or during hypoxia (Kautz2014Identification; Srole2020Erythroferrone).

ERFE achieves hepcidin suppression by acting as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) trap, sequestering BMP ligands away from their receptors, which diminishes hepcidin expression. This action allows for increased iron availability by reducing hepcidin's inhibition of ferroportin, facilitating iron export into plasma (Srole2020Erythroferrone). The N-terminal region of ERFE is primarily responsible for its suppressive activity on hepcidin, and its interaction with BMPs is crucial for its function (Srole2023Characterization). In healthy human cells, this regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining adequate red blood cell production and overall iron balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ERFE gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in conditions related to iron metabolism. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), especially those with ring sideroblasts, mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 lead to the production of a variant ERFE transcript. This variant effectively suppresses hepcidin, contributing to systemic iron overload. Increased expression of this mutant ERFE is associated with longer survival in SF3B1-mutated MDS patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Srole2020Erythroferrone; Bondu2019A).

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), anemia is often linked to elevated hepcidin levels. ERFE mimetics or activators could potentially aid in treatment by mobilizing iron, thus addressing CKD-related anemia (Srole2020Erythroferrone). The A260S mutation in ERFE, found in some patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII), results in higher ERFE expression. This mutation is associated with severe anemia due to increased iron availability and oxidative stress, highlighting ERFE's role as a genetic modifier in monogenic diseases like CDAII (Andolfo2019The). These findings underscore the importance of ERFE in iron homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in various iron-related disorders.

## Interactions
Erythroferrone (ERFE) interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), specifically BMP2, BMP6, and the BMP2/6 heterodimer, to regulate iron homeostasis by suppressing hepcidin transcription. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal domain of ERFE, which contains several key structural features, including a hydrophobic segment with a conserved tryptophan residue (W82) that is crucial for binding to BMPs (Srole2023Characterization). The cationic segment of ERFE also plays a role in its interaction with BMPs, although it does not directly bind to them. Instead, it contributes to the multimerization of ERFE, enhancing its binding avidity to BMP ligands (Srole2023Characterization).

ERFE acts as a BMP trap, sequestering BMP ligands away from their receptors, which prevents BMP-SMAD signaling necessary for hepcidin transcription (Srole2020Erythroferrone). The interaction of ERFE with BMPs is similar to that of BMP receptors, involving hydrophobic aromatic residues like tryptophan and phenylalanine (Srole2023Characterization). ERFE's ability to bind and neutralize BMPs is largely due to these hydrophobic interactions, which are essential for its function in coupling erythropoiesis to iron supply (Srole2023Characterization).
