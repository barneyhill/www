# ACP5

## Overview
The ACP5 gene encodes the enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a metalloenzyme characterized by its binuclear iron center, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. TRAP is primarily expressed in osteoclasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells, where it plays significant roles in bone resorption, immune response, and antigen processing. The enzyme exists in two isoforms, TRACP 5a and TRACP 5b, which differ in their post-translational modifications and structural forms. TRAP's involvement in bone metabolism and immune function underscores its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Mutations in the ACP5 gene are linked to spondyloenchondrodysplasia, a disorder marked by skeletal and immune abnormalities, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Hayman2001Tartrateresistant; Briggs2011Tartrateresistant; Elhossini2023Spondyloenchondrodysplasia).

## Structure
The ACP5 gene encodes the enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), which is characterized by a binuclear iron center essential for its catalytic activity (Hayman2001Tartrateresistant; Ramesh2020Characterisation). TRAP exists in two isoforms, TRACP 5a and TRACP 5b, resulting from differential post-translational processing. TRACP 5a is a monomeric enzyme with an intact loop peptide, while TRACP 5b is a proteolytically cleaved enzyme consisting of two subunits (23 kD and 16 kD) held together by disulfide bonds, forming a dimeric structure (Ramesh2020Characterisation).

The primary structure of TRAP involves the sequence of amino acids encoded by exons 2 to 5 of the ACP5 gene (Ramesh2020Characterisation). The presence of disulfide bonds in TRACP 5b suggests specific secondary structures, although detailed secondary structure information is not explicitly provided (Ramesh2020Characterisation). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein into a functional form, which can be affected by missense mutations leading to protein destabilization and impaired enzyme function (Ramesh2020Characterisation). The quaternary structure is represented by the dimeric form of TRACP 5b, held together by disulfide bonds (Ramesh2020Characterisation). TRAP is also known to be glycosylated, a common post-translational modification (Ramesh2020Characterisation).

## Function
The ACP5 gene encodes tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), an enzyme involved in bone metabolism and immune function. In healthy human cells, TRAP is primarily expressed in osteoclasts, where it plays a critical role in bone resorption by breaking down bone tissue. This process is essential for maintaining bone density and remodeling (Hayman2001Tartrateresistant). TRAP is also expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells, contributing to immune responses. In macrophages, TRAP is involved in the inflammatory response and influences effector signaling pathways in innate immunity (Bune2001Mice). It participates in oxygen-dependent reactions, catalyzing peroxidation reactions that lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are important in microbial defense (Bune2001Mice).

In dendritic cells, TRAP is associated with antigen processing and T-cell activation. Its activity is higher in mature dendritic cells compared to immature ones, correlating with their role in immune responses (Hayman2001Tartrateresistant). TRAP is also involved in regulating interferon metabolism, as its deficiency leads to elevated type I interferon activity, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses (Briggs2011Tartrateresistant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACP5 gene, which encodes tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), are associated with spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, immune dysregulation, and neurological impairments (Elhossini2023Spondyloenchondrodysplasia). Patients with SPENCD often exhibit autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune cytopenia, and Sjögren's syndrome, alongside skeletal dysplasia and neurological symptoms like spasticity and intracranial calcifications (Sacri2016Childhoodonset; Briggs2011Tartrateresistant; Ramesh2020Characterisation).

The loss of TRAP activity due to ACP5 mutations leads to elevated serum interferon alpha activity and a type I interferon signature, linking the gene to interferon metabolism and autoimmunity (Briggs2011Tartrateresistant). These mutations often result in inactive proteins due to misfolding, affecting enzyme function and contributing to the disease phenotype (Ramesh2020Characterisation).

Alterations in ACP5 expression are also implicated in certain cancers and osteoporosis, highlighting its role in bone metabolism and immune responses (Elhossini2023Spondyloenchondrodysplasia). The gene's involvement in immune pathways, such as the Toll-like receptor and IL-17 signaling pathways, suggests a regulatory role in conditions like SLE (Hong2022Novel).

## Interactions
ACP5, also known as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with β-catenin, a protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. ACP5 binds to phosphorylated β-catenin at specific sites, Ser33 and Thr41, leading to its dephosphorylation. This interaction inhibits the degradation of β-catenin, enhancing its signaling activity in the nucleus, which is crucial for fibroblast differentiation, proliferation, and migration in pulmonary fibrosis (Hu2022Tartrateresistant).

ACP5 also interacts with the TGFβ receptor interacting protein-1 (TRIP-1), which activates TGFβ receptor type 2 (TGFβR2) and Smad2/3 signaling pathways. This interaction is implicated in processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in cancer cells (Reithmeier2017Tartrateresistant; Hu2022Tartrateresistant).

In breast cancer cells, ACP5 is involved in the regulation of the TGFβ2/TβR and CD44 pathways, influencing cell adhesion and migration. The phosphorylation of CD44 at specific sites is significantly increased in cells with high ACP5 expression, suggesting a regulatory role in metastasis-related properties (Reithmeier2017Tartrateresistant).
