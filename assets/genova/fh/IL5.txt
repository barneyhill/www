# IL5

## Overview
Interleukin 5 (IL5) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 5, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the regulation and activation of eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell involved in the body's defense against parasitic infections and in mediating allergic responses. The IL5 gene is primarily expressed in T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural helper cells, and its product, interleukin 5, is a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein. This cytokine is characterized by a four alpha-helical bundle structure, a common motif among cytokines, which is essential for its biological activity (Kusano2012Structural; TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). Interleukin 5 interacts with its specific receptor, IL-5R, to initiate signaling pathways that promote eosinophil proliferation and activation, as well as B cell differentiation, particularly influencing Immunoglobulin A (IgA) production in mucosal tissues (Kusano2012Structural; TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). Dysregulation of IL5 expression is implicated in various eosinophil-related disorders, including asthma and familial eosinophilia, highlighting its clinical significance (Shearer2003Biology; Prakash2017Dysregulation).

## Structure
Interleukin 5 (IL5) is a disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein, with each monomer consisting of 115 amino acids. The primary structure includes glycosylation sites at Thr-3 (O-linked) and Asn-28 (N-linked), although these modifications do not affect its biological activity (Minamitake1990Structure; Tavernier1995Identification). The secondary structure of IL5 features a typical four alpha-helical bundle known as the 'cytokine fold,' which is common among cytokines. This fold consists of four alpha-helices arranged in an up-up, down-down array (Tavernier1995Identification; Kusano2012Structural).

The tertiary structure of IL5 is characterized by a unique D-helix swapping, where one bundle is composed of three helices from one monomer and a fourth helix contributed by the second monomer (Tavernier1995Identification). The quaternary structure is a dimer stabilized by two intermolecular disulfide bonds, specifically Cys63-Cys105 and Cys105-Cys63 between chain A and chain B (Kusano2012Structural). The IL5 dimer interacts with its receptor, IL-5RA, through three distinct interfaces, involving salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Kusano2012Structural). The overall architecture of the IL5-IL5RA complex is described as 'wrench-like,' with the receptor wrapping around the IL5 dimer (Kusano2012Structural).

## Function
Interleukin 5 (IL-5) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the differentiation and activation of eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell involved in the body's defense against parasitic infections and in allergic responses (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). IL-5 is primarily produced by T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and natural helper cells (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). 

In healthy human cells, IL-5 promotes the proliferation and activation of eosinophils by binding to its receptor, which is expressed on eosinophils and B cells (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). This interaction triggers signaling pathways that lead to the survival and function of these cells, enhancing their ability to combat parasitic infections and participate in allergic reactions (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). 

IL-5 also plays a role in the regulation of immune responses by promoting the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells, particularly influencing the production of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in mucosal tissues (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). The cytokine's activity is characterized by its unique helical-bundle motif, which is necessary for its biological function (TAKATSU2011Interleukin5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL5 gene are implicated in several eosinophil-related conditions, particularly asthma. Elevated IL-5 levels are associated with increased eosinophil counts and airway hyperreactivity in asthmatic patients, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Shearer2003Biology; TAKATSU2011Interleukin5). In asthma, IL-5 is crucial for eosinophil recruitment and activation, leading to inflammation and lung damage (Foster1996Interleukin). Anti-IL-5 therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, have been developed to reduce eosinophil counts in asthma, although they have shown limited effects on asthma symptoms (Leckie2000Effects; TAKATSU2011Interleukin5).

Familial eosinophilia, a rare autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by increased IL-5 expression, although no specific mutations in the IL5 gene have been identified (Prakash2017Dysregulation). This condition results in lifelong peripheral eosinophilia, with increased IL-5 and IL-5 receptor levels observed in affected individuals (Prakash2017Dysregulation). The dysregulation of IL-5 in familial eosinophilia suggests a cytokine-driven mechanism rather than a primary eosinophil defect (Prakash2017Dysregulation).

## Interactions
Interleukin 5 (IL-5) interacts with its specific receptor, IL-5R, which is composed of an alpha subunit (IL-5RA) and a common beta subunit (CSF2RB). The IL-5RA subunit alone is sufficient for ligand binding, but the presence of the beta subunit enhances binding affinity by 2- to 3-fold (Tavernier1995Identification). The interaction between IL-5 and IL-5RA involves a large binding interface, with the IL-5RA D1 domain playing a significant role by forming hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and polar interactions with IL-5 (Kusano2012Structural).

Upon binding to IL-5R, IL-5 induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of several signaling proteins, including JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT5, which are crucial for IL-5-dependent signal transduction (van1995Interleukin5; Kusano2012Structural). The IL-5/IL-5RA complex associates with the common beta chain in a manner similar to the GM-CSF/GM-CSFRA complex, with specific residues like Glu32 of IL-5 and Tyr421 of the beta chain being essential for binding (Kusano2012Structural).

IL-5 also activates DNA-binding complexes in eosinophils, involving STAT1 alpha, which forms homodimers or heterodimers, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (van1995Interleukin5). These interactions highlight the critical role of IL-5 in immune response modulation through its receptor-mediated signaling pathways.
