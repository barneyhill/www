# SYPL2

## Overview
SYPL2, also known as synaptophysin-like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics, primarily within the cytoplasm and associated with synaptic vesicles. The protein, synaptophysin-like 2, is categorized as a vesicle-associated protein and plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and signal transduction, thereby influencing neurological function and cellular communication (Park2009Aberrant). Beyond its neurological implications, SYPL2 is also significant in muscle biology, where it is linked to muscle contractility, development, and morphology, and is responsive to physiological changes such as physical activity (Tseng2015Preclinical; Galmés2023KLB). The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by genetic elements like (CAG)n repeat-derived sncRNAs or miRNAs, which may impact its role in synaptic vesicle dynamics and contribute to its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases (Nahalka2019The).

## Function
SYPL2, or synaptophysin-like 2, is a protein involved in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics, primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with synaptic vesicles. It plays a significant role in neurotransmitter release, contributing to cellular communication and neurological function. SYPL2 is implicated in synaptic plasticity and signal transduction, impacting processes such as synaptic signaling and structure (Park2009Aberrant). 

In the context of muscle biology, SYPL2 is associated with muscle contractility, development, and morphology. It is upregulated in conditions that promote muscle health, suggesting a role in maintaining muscle function (Tseng2015Preclinical). The protein's involvement in transport processes within cells is influenced by physical activity levels, indicating its role in cellular transport mechanisms that are responsive to physiological changes (Galmés2023KLB).

SYPL2's function in synaptic vesicle membranes is potentially regulated by (CAG)n repeat-derived sncRNAs or miRNAs, which may affect its role in synaptic vesicle dynamics (Nahalka2019The). This regulatory mechanism highlights the complex interplay between genetic elements and protein function in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The SYPL2 gene has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential interactions with specific genetic sequences. In Huntington's disease (HD), SYPL2 is upregulated and may interact with toxic (CAG)n repeats, which are known to contribute to the disease's pathophysiology. This interaction suggests that SYPL2 could play a role in the neurodegenerative processes associated with HD by being influenced by these repeats and potentially dysregulating protein functions through riboregulation (Nahalka2019The).

In contrast, SYPL2 expression is downregulated in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, indicating a possible link between its expression levels and these conditions. The gene's sequence can be recognized by (CAG)n repeat-derived small non-coding RNAs or miRNAs, which might lead to dysregulation of protein functions, further supporting its involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Nahalka2019The).

A study on a family with LMNA-related cardiomyopathy identified a single nucleotide variant in the SYPL2 gene (c.272A>T, p.Tyr91Phe), but this variant was not validated as significant due to discrepancies in sequencing data, suggesting it may not be directly linked to the associated conditions in that study (Zaragoza2017Dupuytren’s).
