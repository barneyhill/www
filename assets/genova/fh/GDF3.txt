# GDF3

## Overview
Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which is involved in numerous cellular processes, including development and differentiation. The GDF3 protein is characterized as a cytokine and functions primarily as a signaling molecule. It is unique within its family due to its lack of a typical interchain disulfide bond, yet it maintains stability through non-covalent interactions, forming homodimers and heterodimers with other proteins such as GDF-9 and BMP-15 (Yadin2016Structural; Hinck2016Structural). GDF3 plays a critical role in embryonic development, particularly in Nodal signaling pathways essential for axis formation and left-right patterning (Pelliccia2017Gdf3; Bisgrove2017Maternal). Additionally, it is involved in regulating adipose tissue and energy balance, with implications in obesity (Andersson2008Growthdifferentiation). GDF3's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes underscores its significance in both developmental biology and clinical research.

## Structure
GDF3, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, exhibits a unique structural profile. Unlike other members of its family, GDF3 lacks the typical interchain disulfide bond due to the absence of a specific cysteine residue, yet it can still form stable homodimers through non-covalent interactions (Yadin2016Structural; Hinck2016Structural). The protein structure resembles a curled left hand, with the N-terminus forming the thumb, an α-helix as the palm, and two β-sheets as fingers (Yadin2016Structural). 

GDF3 shares the cystine knot motif common to the TGF-β family, which includes six cysteines forming an eight-membered ring, contributing to the protein's stability (Yadin2016Structural). Despite the absence of a disulfide bond, GDF3 can form heterodimers with other proteins like GDF-9 and BMP-15, which exhibit enhanced biological activity compared to homodimers (Hinck2016Structural). 

The protein's structural differences, particularly in regions like the heel, prehelix extension, and fingertips, are crucial for its interaction with receptors and other proteins (Hinck2016Structural). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. In human granulosa cells, GDF3 is involved in folliculogenesis by modulating the effects of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), specifically BMP-6 and BMP-7. It acts as a BMP inhibitor, facilitating the expression of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor mRNA, which is crucial for the transition from growing to preovulatory follicles (Shi2012Growth).

GDF3 is also implicated in neurogenesis, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease. It promotes the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and neuronal differentiation, suggesting a role in adult neurogenesis, which is essential for memory and learning (Jaeger2016Networkdriven). In the central nervous system, GDF3 is expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, indicating its potential involvement in CNS functions (Hexige2005Expression).

Additionally, GDF3 is active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, influencing cell differentiation and growth processes. It is expressed in pluripotent stem cells and is involved in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating embryonic development (Park2012Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GDF3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. Although a study on Klippel–Feil syndrome (KFS) associated with situs inversus totalis excluded GDF3 mutations as causal factors, previous research has identified GDF3 mutations in individuals with KFS and ocular anomalies (ChacónCamacho2012Klippel–Feil). 

GDF3 is also involved in adipose tissue regulation and energy balance. Studies have shown that GDF3 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and may contribute to obesity by acting as an adipogenic factor under high lipid load conditions. Mice lacking GDF3 exhibit reduced adipose tissue accumulation and are partially resistant to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that GDF3 plays a role in regulating fat accumulation and energy balance (Andersson2008Growthdifferentiation).

In the context of congenital ocular malformations, a study found no deleterious mutations in the GDF3 gene among subjects with various eye abnormalities, indicating that such mutations are uncommon causes of these conditions (GarciaMontalvo2014Mutational). However, the potential role of GDF3 in ocular development remains an area of interest.

## Interactions
GDF3 interacts with several proteins, primarily within the TGF-β superfamily signaling pathways. It binds to type II receptors such as BMPR2, ACTRIIA, and ACTRIIB, with a particularly high affinity for BMPR2. These interactions allow GDF3 to inhibit BMP signaling by preventing the formation of BMP homodimers, acting as a broad inhibitor of BMP signaling (Ramachandran2022GDF3). 

GDF3 also functions as a TGFβ/activin-like SMAD2/3 signaling agonist. It can autonomously activate SMAD2/3 signaling and has additive effects when combined with TGFβ1 or activin A. Although GDF3 does not directly bind to TGFBR2, it can activate TGFβ signaling, potentially through an indirect interaction with latent TGFβ (Ramachandran2022GDF3). 

In the context of embryonic development, GDF3 acts as a cofactor in Nodal signaling, essential for embryonic axis formation. It likely forms a complex with Nodal to activate signaling pathways crucial for proper embryonic development (Pelliccia2017Gdf3; Bisgrove2017Maternal). GDF3's interaction with Nodal is critical for mesendoderm formation and left-right patterning in zebrafish (Pelliccia2017Gdf3).
