# PIP5K1B

## Overview
PIP5K1B is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1 beta, a member of the kinase family. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including membrane dynamics, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization. PIP5K1B is predominantly active at the plasma membrane, where it regulates PIP2 production, influencing processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin remodeling. The enzyme's interactions with small GTPases and other proteins underscore its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Tariq2021Striking; Padrón2003Phosphatidylinositol; Kallikourdis2016Phosphatidylinositol).

## Function
PIP5K1B encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a key lipid involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PIP5K1B is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it regulates the production of PIP2, influencing membrane dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Padrón2003Phosphatidylinositol).

PIP5K1B is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, particularly in the internalization of transferrin receptors. Overexpression of PIP5K1B increases PIP2 levels, enhancing the formation of clathrin-coated pits and the association of AP-2 adaptor proteins with the membrane, thereby facilitating endocytosis (Padrón2003Phosphatidylinositol). Conversely, reduced expression of PIP5K1B leads to decreased PIP2 production and impaired endocytosis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal endocytic rates (Padrón2003Phosphatidylinositol).

PIP5K1B also contributes to cytoskeletal organization and actin remodeling, which are vital for cellular processes such as migration and adhesion. It is involved in the recruitment of lipid rafts into the immunological synapse, a process important for T cell activation and signaling (Kallikourdis2016Phosphatidylinositol). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the assembly of signaling complexes and the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for effective immune responses (Kallikourdis2016Phosphatidylinositol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIP5K1B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). FRDA is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by GAA repeat expansions in the FXN gene, which also affects the expression of nearby genes, including PIP5K1B. In FRDA patients, PIP5K1B expression is decreased, leading to cytoskeleton anomalies due to impaired actin network dynamics. This depletion is associated with the disorganization of actin stress fibers and impaired cell migration and spreading, contributing to the disease's pathology (Bayot2013Cissilencing).

The silencing of PIP5K1B in FRDA is linked to epigenetic changes such as histone modifications and DNA methylation, which result in transcriptional silencing at the FXN locus. This silencing affects the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a crucial signaling molecule, leading to decreased levels and subsequent cellular dysfunctions (Bayot2013Friedreich’s).

The potential clinical significance of PIP5K1B depletion in FRDA includes oxidative stress hypersensitivity and cytoskeletal destabilization, which may contribute to the variable clinical manifestations of the disease. Overexpression of PIP5K1B in FRDA fibroblasts has been shown to restore normal actin network dynamics, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Bayot2013Cissilencing).

## Interactions
PIP5K1B, also known as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1 beta, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with small GTPases such as RhoA and Rac1, which are known to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Tariq2021Striking). PIP5K1B is also associated with ARF6, a GTPase involved in membrane trafficking, indicating its participation in membrane-related processes (Tariq2021Striking).

The enzyme can form homo- and heterodimers with other PIP5K isoforms, such as PIP5KIγ, which enhances its enzymatic activity and interaction with the plasma membrane (de2020Plasma). This dimerization is crucial for its function in synthesizing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), a key lipid involved in various signaling pathways (de2020Plasma).

PIP5K1B's interaction with RASSF4, a putative upstream activator, affects the distribution of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and influences cellular morphology and signaling (de2020Plasma). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in modulating phosphoinositide metabolism and its impact on cellular signaling and structural dynamics.
