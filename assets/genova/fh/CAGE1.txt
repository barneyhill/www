# CAGE1

## Overview
CAGE1, or cancer antigen 1, is a gene that encodes a protein primarily expressed in the testis, where it plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. The protein is characterized by long coiled coil domains and a putative nuclear localization signal, suggesting its involvement in structural and nuclear processes (Alsheimer2005The). CAGE1 is notably active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular homeostasis (Alsheimer2005The). While its precise functions in normal physiology are not fully elucidated, CAGE1 is implicated in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses. In pathological contexts, CAGE1 is recognized as a cancer/testis antigen, with aberrant expression linked to various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer, where it contributes to drug resistance and tumorigenic potential (Yeon2023Cancertestis; Yeon2021The).

## Function
CAGE1, also known as cancer antigen 1, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis. In healthy human cells, CAGE1 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is involved in the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis. It is a component of the acrosome in spermatids and spermatozoa, suggesting its involvement in acrosome formation or function, which is crucial for sperm development and fertilization (Alsheimer2005The).

The protein is characterized by long coiled coil domains and a putative nuclear localization signal, indicating its potential structural role and involvement in nuclear processes (Alsheimer2005The). CAGE1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may influence gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Although specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, it is implied that CAGE1 could be involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses, contributing to the maintenance of cellular integrity and function (Alsheimer2005The). The presence of CAGE1 in cancer cells, as a cancer/testis antigen, also highlights its potential role in tumorigenesis, although this aspect is more relevant to pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
CAGE1, also known as cancer antigen 1, is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly pulmonary adenocarcinoma, CAGE1 is associated with resistance to the anticancer drug osimertinib. High expression of CAGE1 correlates with increased autophagic flux, enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential, leading to poor prognosis in patients (Yeon2023Cancertestis). Knocking down CAGE1 expression in resistant cells has been shown to decrease autophagic flux and tumorigenic potential, while increasing sensitivity to osimertinib (Yeon2023Cancertestis).

In gastric cancer, CAGE1 is linked to increased drug resistance and autophagic flux. It binds to Beclin1, promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis, which contributes to drug resistance. The CAGE1-miR-181b-5p-S1PR1 axis is identified as a regulatory pathway influencing these processes, suggesting potential therapeutic targets to overcome resistance (Yeon2021The).

In bladder cancer, CAGE1 is frequently hypermethylated, particularly in adenocarcinomas and signet ring cell carcinomas, indicating a role in tumorigenesis through epigenetic alterations rather than genetic mutations (Kunze2006Promoter; Kunze2007High).
