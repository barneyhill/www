# MAL2

## Overview
The MAL2 gene encodes the mal, T cell differentiation protein 2, a member of the MAL proteolipid family characterized by its four transmembrane domains. This integral membrane protein is primarily involved in the trafficking and sorting of proteins within polarized epithelial cells, playing a crucial role in processes such as transcytosis and raft-dependent apical membrane transport. MAL2 is associated with lipid rafts, which are specialized membrane microdomains involved in vesicular trafficking. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as TPD52-like proteins, IQGAP1, and INF2, underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression. Dysregulation of MAL2 expression has been implicated in various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor promoter or suppressor, depending on the tissue context, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Labat-de-Hoz2023The; Wilson2001Identification; Borowczak2024High).

## Structure
The MAL2 protein is a member of the MAL proteolipid family and is characterized by its hydrophobic nature, with 61.9% of its residues being hydrophobic (Wilson2001Identification). The primary structure of MAL2 consists of 176 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa (Wilson2001Identification; de2002MAL2). The protein contains four transmembrane domains, which are typical features of MAL-like proteins (Wilson2001Identification; de2002MAL2).

MAL2 has a unique N-terminal domain that is longer and has a higher proline content compared to other MAL-like proteins (Wilson2001Identification). It also includes a 10-residue insertion between the third and fourth transmembrane domains, which contains a consensus N-glycosylation site, indicating potential post-translational modification (Wilson2001Identification). The protein is found in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms, with glycosylation sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment (de2002MAL2).

MAL2 is associated with lipid rafts, specialized membrane microdomains enriched with glycolipids and cholesterol, which are involved in vesicular trafficking (de2002MAL2). The protein's topology within membranes is similar to MAL, with the N terminus and an extra-membrane loop predicted to be cyto- and exoplasmic, respectively (Wilson2001Identification).

## Function
The MAL2 gene encodes a four-transmembrane integral protein that plays a critical role in the trafficking and sorting of proteins within polarized epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, MAL2 is essential for the process of transcytosis, which involves the transport of protein cargo from the basolateral to the apical membrane. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular polarity and function. MAL2 is distributed in subapical endosome structures and travels in vesicular carriers towards the basolateral surface, where it fuses with peripheral endocytic basolateral vesicles. These fused vesicles then transport the endocytosed cargo to the apical surface, with the participation of the formin INF2 (Labat-de-Hoz2023The).

MAL2 is also involved in raft-dependent apical membrane transport, particularly in hepatocytes, where it interacts with serine/threonine kinase 16 to sort secretory cargo through the constitutive secretory pathway. It localizes to cholesterol-rich lipid raft membrane microdomains and is involved in the apical transport of polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor (pIgA-R) and CD59, preventing their accumulation in perinuclear endosomes (Li2024Research). This protein is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including respiratory, digestive, genitourinary, endocrine, and exocrine epithelia, as well as in specialized secretory cell clusters like pancreatic endocrine cells (Li2024Research).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the tissue type. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), high MAL2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Borowczak2024High). MAL2 overexpression in breast cancer is linked to cancer progression through interactions with β-catenin, promoting proliferation and invasion via the c-Myc pathway (Li2024Research; An2023Downregulation).

In ovarian cancer, MAL2 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor overall survival. Its high expression is linked to drug resistance and cancer metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Yuan2022MultiOmics). MAL2's role in cancer is complex, as it may also function as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it reduces cell migration and invasion (LópezCoral2020MAL2Induced). The gene's dysregulation in various cancers highlights its potential as a biomarker and target for cancer therapy (Labat-de-Hoz2023The).

## Interactions
MAL2, a member of the MAL proteolipid family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in vesicular trafficking and cancer progression. MAL2 interacts with TPD52-like proteins, which are membrane-associated and involved in vesicle transport. These interactions were identified using the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays, indicating that they are weak and/or transient (Wilson2001Identification).

MAL2 also interacts with IQGAP1, a scaffold protein in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, enhancing ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is critical for pancreatic cancer progression (Zhang2021MAL2). In breast carcinoma cells, MAL2 interacts with MUC1, a mucin protein, facilitating its localization to the cell surface and contributing to the basolateral-to-apical transport of MUC1 (Fanayan2009Mucin).

Additionally, MAL2 binds to INF2, a formin protein, which is essential for apical transcytosis and lumen formation. This interaction involves the carboxy-terminal region of INF2 and is crucial for maintaining the apical distribution of MAL2 and facilitating transcytotic transport (Madrid2010The). These interactions highlight MAL2's role in cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer progression.
