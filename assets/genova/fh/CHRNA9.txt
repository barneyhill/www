# CHRNA9

## Overview
The CHRNA9 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 9 subunit, a component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are part of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family. This subunit is primarily involved in forming heteromeric receptors with the alpha 10 subunit, particularly in cochlear and vestibular hair cells, where it plays a crucial role in auditory and vestibular functions (Lipovsek2021The). The alpha 9 subunit is also implicated in immune modulation, where it participates in metabotropic signaling pathways that regulate inflammatory responses (Zakrzewicz2017Canonical). The CHRNA9 gene's expression and function are significant in both sensory processing and immune regulation, highlighting its diverse biological roles (Richter2016Phosphocholine).

## Structure
The CHRNA9 gene encodes the alpha 9 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is part of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family. The protein structure includes a large extracellular domain, four transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain is characterized by a conserved Cys-loop, which is essential for receptor folding and assembly (Lipovsek2021The). The transmembrane domains are composed of alpha helices, contributing to the formation of the ion channel pore (Albuquerque2009Mammalian).

The CHRNA9 protein can form homomeric receptors, although these are not significant in vivo, and more commonly forms heteromeric complexes with the alpha 10 subunit, particularly in cochlear and vestibular hair cells (Lipovsek2021The). This heteromeric assembly is crucial for its functional properties, including synaptic inhibition through the activation of calcium-dependent SK2 potassium channels (Lipovsek2021The).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's functional dynamics. The CHRNA9 gene contains five exons and four introns, with splice variant isoforms contributing to its functional diversity (Lustig2002Chromosome). The protein's structure and assembly are critical for its role in auditory and vestibular systems.

## Function
The CHRNA9 gene encodes the alpha 9 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is involved in various molecular processes in human cells. This subunit, often in combination with the alpha 10 subunit, forms heteromeric receptors that are crucial for modulating immune responses and inflammation. These receptors are involved in metabotropic signaling pathways that inhibit ATP-induced release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from monocytes, a process important for controlling inflammation and preventing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Richter2016Phosphocholine; Zakrzewicz2017Canonical).

The alpha 9 subunit plays a significant role in the regulation of IL-1β release by interacting with phosphatidylcholine metabolites, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and glycerophosphocholine (G-PC), which act as agonists of nAChRs. These interactions inhibit the activation of the P2X7 receptor, thereby reducing IL-1β release without activating ion channel functions (Richter2016Phosphocholine; Zakrzewicz2017Canonical). The CHRNA9 gene is also expressed in cochlear hair cells, where it contributes to auditory processing by mediating inhibitory efferent effects (Lustig2002Chromosome). This dual role in immune modulation and auditory function highlights the diverse biological activities of the alpha 9 subunit.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHRNA9 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. The CHRNA9 gene, which encodes the alpha 9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been linked to nicotine dependence (ND) and alcohol dependence (AD). Studies have shown that rare variants in CHRNA9 are significantly associated with ND in European Americans and with both ND and AD in African Americans (Zuo2016Associations). These associations suggest that CHRNA9 may play a role in the genetic susceptibility to these dependencies.

In addition to its role in substance dependence, a specific point mutation in CHRNA9, known as L99T, has been studied for its effects on cochlear function. This mutation enhances noise protection by prolonging cochlear inhibition, which suggests a potential protective role against noise-induced hearing loss (Taranda2009A). The mutation leads to increased sensitivity and reduced desensitization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in hair cells, which contributes to enhanced auditory protection (Taranda2009A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CHRNA9 in auditory processing and its potential implications for hearing-related conditions.

## Interactions
The CHRNA9 gene encodes the alpha 9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are involved in various physiological processes. The α9 subunit forms functional receptor channels by interacting with the α10 subunit, creating heteromeric α9α10 nAChRs. These receptors are known for their role in auditory pathways and immune responses (Pucci2022α9Containing; Richter2016Phosphocholine).

In immune cells, α9 and α10 subunits are essential for the inhibition of ATP-induced ion channel functions at P2X7 receptors, which affects the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). This interaction is mediated by phosphocholine (PC) and choline (Cho), which act as ligands for α9* nAChRs. The inhibition of IL-1β release is antagonized by the selective antagonist RgIA4, highlighting the cooperative interaction between α9 and α10 subunits (Richter2016Phosphocholine).

The α9 subunit also participates in metabotropic signaling pathways, where it interacts with G protein-coupled pathways. This interaction does not involve the opening of ion channels but rather influences downstream signaling events, such as the inhibition of ATP-mediated IL-1β release in monocytes (Pucci2022α9Containing).
