# SORBS1

## Overview
SORBS1 is a gene that encodes the protein sorbin and SH3 domain-containing 1, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and structural organization. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its involvement in insulin signaling pathways and its ability to facilitate protein-protein interactions through its sorbin homology (SoHo) domain and three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (Kuroda2018Vinexin; Park2008A). These domains are integral to the protein's function in mechanotransduction and glucose uptake, particularly in insulin-sensitive tissues. SORBS1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including glucose metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion, by interacting with key proteins such as c-Cbl and influencing the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (Cho2020SORBS1; Chang2018Genetic). The gene's expression and function are also modulated by microRNAs, which have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic and oncological contexts (Jin2022miR2233p; Yu2019MiR1425p).

## Structure
SORBS1 encodes a protein known as sorbin and SH3 domain-containing 1, which is involved in insulin signaling and cytoskeletal organization. The protein is characterized by the presence of a sorbin homology (SoHo) domain and three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Kuroda2018Vinexin; Park2008A). These domains are crucial for its role in mechanotransduction and glucose uptake processes.

The primary structure of SORBS1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form these domains, allowing it to interact with other proteins such as c-Cbl, which is important for glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissues (Park2008A). The secondary structure likely involves common motifs such as alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with SH3 domains, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function of SORBS1, particularly in the context of insulin signaling pathways (Yamada2009Association). The gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, as identified in studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may result in proteins with distinct functions (Brandsma2020Integrated). These structural features enable SORBS1 to play a significant role in various cellular processes, including glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal organization.

## Function
SORBS1 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in insulin signaling pathways, particularly in the process of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. It contains a sorbin homology domain and three SH3 domains, which are involved in the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane, a critical step for glucose uptake in response to insulin (Chang2018Genetic). This protein acts as an adaptor in cellular signaling, interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, and is involved in cell adhesion through interactions with various proteins (Cho2020SORBS1).

SORBS1 is also associated with the regulation of cell adhesion and motility, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it forms complexes with c-Cbl upon insulin stimulation, contributing to signaling pathways that regulate GLUT4 translocation (Cho2020SORBS1). The protein's involvement in these processes is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and proper cellular function, highlighting its significance in metabolic pathways and cellular organization (Chang2018Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SORBS1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the Japanese population, the 682A-G (Thr228Ala) polymorphism in SORBS1 is associated with hypertension and diastolic blood pressure, particularly in women. The G (Ala) allele is identified as a risk factor for hypertension and is also linked to lacunar infarction, indicating a broader impact on cardiovascular health (Yamada2009Association).

In the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in a Korean population, the T228A polymorphism in SORBS1 is associated with the condition. This variant is linked to insulin resistance and glucose metabolism, suggesting its role in PCOS pathogenesis (Park2008A).

In breast cancer, SORBS1 expression is downregulated, which correlates with poor prognosis and advanced pathological stages. The gene acts as a tumor suppressor, and its low expression is linked to worse clinical outcomes. miR-142-5p, which is upregulated in breast cancer, targets SORBS1, promoting cancer progression (Yu2019MiR1425p).

In gastric cancer, miR-223-3p targets SORBS1, facilitating cancer progression by modulating cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This interaction highlights the potential of targeting the miR-223-3p/SORBS1 axis as a therapeutic strategy (Jin2022miR2233p).

## Interactions
SORBS1, also known as sorbin and SH3 domain containing 1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In colorectal cancer cell lines, SORBS1 interacts with the AHNAK protein, forming a complex that regulates cell proliferation and migration. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation assays, with co-localization confirmed in the cytoplasm. The expression of AHNAK is negatively associated with SORBS1, and SORBS1 knockdown leads to increased AHNAK expression originating from the nucleus (Cho2020SORBS1).

In endothelial cells, SORBS1 interacts with the FAK-Src signaling module, which regulates the balance between RhoA and Rac1 activities. This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell adhesion and migration, affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and adhesion turnover. SORBS1's involvement in this pathway highlights its role in controlling the development of lymphatic and venous vessels in zebrafish (Veloso2024The).

SORBS1 is also targeted by microRNAs in cancer contexts. In breast cancer, miR-142-5p targets SORBS1, promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Similarly, in gastric cancer, miR-223-3p carried by cancer-associated fibroblast microvesicles targets SORBS1, modulating cancer progression (Jin2022miR2233p; Yu2019MiR1425p).
