# FCGBP

## Overview
The FCGBP gene encodes the Fc gamma binding protein, a mucin-like glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mucosal immunity and epithelial defense. This protein is primarily secreted by goblet cells in various epithelial tissues, including the intestinal, colonic, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. Structurally, FCGBP is characterized by multiple domains, including an IgG Fc-binding domain and several von Willebrand factor type D and C domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as mucin-2 (MUC2) and trefoil factor family peptides. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the mucus layer, thereby enhancing the mucosal barrier function and preventing microbial infiltration. FCGBP is also involved in immune responses, acting as an antigen for macrophages and inhibiting complement-mediated hemolysis. Clinically, alterations in FCGBP expression and mutations are associated with various diseases, including colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding; Zhuang2021Prognostic; Liu2022Role).

## Structure
The FCGBP protein is a large mucin-like glycoprotein encoded by the human gene FCGBP, located on chromosome 19q13. It consists of 5,405 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 500 kDa (Liu2022Role). The protein is characterized by several structural domains, including a single IgG Fc-binding domain, 13 von Willebrand factor type D (vWD) domains, 12 trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine-rich (TIL) domains, 12 reactive sites on conserved domain TIL (TIL-R), 12 'contains 8 conserved cysteine residues' (C8) domains, and 8 von Willebrand factor type C domains (Liu2022Role).

Structurally, FCGBP is divided into three main parts: the H domain, the R domain, and the T domain. The H domain, consisting of 450 amino acids, is crucial for Fc-binding activity and intracellular targeting. The R domain is composed of 12 tandem repeats of vWD-C8-TIL-TILR, rich in cysteine residues and glycosylation sites, indicating high glycosylation. The T domain is a C-terminal vWD domain with 170 amino acids (Liu2022Role).

FCGBP undergoes post-translational modifications, including autocatalytic cleavage at the GDPH sequence, resulting in fragments with different molecular weights (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding; Liu2022Role). It contains 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, but no O-linked glycosylation sites, suggesting interactions with MUC2 N-linked glycans (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its structure and function (Liu2022Role).

## Function
The IgGFc-binding protein (FCGBP) is a mucin-like glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity and epithelial defense. In healthy human cells, FCGBP is primarily secreted by goblet cells in the intestinal and colonic epithelium, as well as in the respiratory and urogenital tracts. It is involved in forming disulfide-linked heterodimers with mucin-2 (MUC2) and trefoil factor family peptides, such as TFF3, which enhance the mucosal barrier function and prevent microbial infiltration (Weste2022Different; Liu2022Role).

FCGBP contributes to the structural integrity of the mucus layer, which is essential for protecting epithelial barriers from pathogenic microorganisms. It acts as an antigen recognized by macrophages and presented to T cells, thereby activating primary defense mechanisms. FCGBP also inhibits complement-mediated hemolysis and binds to IgG-viral complexes, preventing viral particles from reaching epithelial tissues (Liu2022Role).

In the respiratory system, FCGBP expression increases in response to pollutants, potentially reducing the severity of infections. Its interaction with TFF3 in the respiratory tract forms oligomers that play a role in innate immune defense, independent of other mucosal components (Weste2022Different).

## Clinical Significance
The FCGBP gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FCGBP expression is significantly decreased, with a 10.5% mutation frequency observed in CRC tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced-stage CRC and shorter survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhuang2021Prognostic). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), low FCGBP expression correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy, indicating its role in the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Lin2022MultiOmics; Ding2024Noncoding).

FCGBP is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where it is upregulated, suggesting a role in neuroinflammation and disease progression (GómezGarre2022Transcriptomic). In severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), a specific FCGBP variant, rs1326680184, is associated with increased severity and complications, including spontaneous intraabdominal hemorrhage, highlighting its role in vascular stability (Tang2024Whole). These findings underscore the gene's involvement in immune and inflammatory processes across various conditions.

## Interactions
FCGBP (Fc gamma binding protein) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of mucosal immunity. It interacts with mucin-2 (MUC2), a major component of intestinal mucus, forming a structural scaffold crucial for innate immune responses. Although earlier studies suggested a covalent linkage between FCGBP and MUC2, recent findings indicate that their interaction is non-covalent, possibly involving N-linked glycans (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding; Liu2022Role). FCGBP also forms heterodimers with trefoil factor family peptides (TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3), particularly with TFF3, through disulfide bonds. These heterodimers are part of the soluble layer of colonic mucus and play a role in preventing microbial infiltration and trapping viruses (Liu2022Role).

In addition to its interactions with MUC2 and TFFs, FCGBP is associated with other mucin-associated proteins (MAPs) such as CLCA1 and ZG16. These interactions are non-covalent and may involve glycan-glycan binding, which stabilizes the proteins within mucin granules (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding). FCGBP's interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the mucus layer and may have implications for innate immunity and host defense (Gorman2023IgGFcbinding).
