# CSNK1A1L

## Overview
CSNK1A1L is a gene that encodes the protein casein kinase 1 alpha 1 like, which is a member of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. These kinases are involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, circadian rhythm, and signal transduction pathways. The protein encoded by CSNK1A1L shares structural and functional similarities with other CK1 family members, contributing to its role in modulating key signaling pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway. Alterations in the expression and function of CSNK1A1L have been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and bone diseases, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a therapeutic target (Litlekalsoy2016Expression; Rigolin2010Circulating; Rauner2021Perspective).

## Clinical Significance
CSNK1A1L has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and mutations. In urothelial cancer, CSNK1A1L shows significant variability in expression levels, with some tumor samples exhibiting up-regulation by thirty-fold to over one hundred-fold, while others show down-regulation or no expression. This variability suggests a complex role in cancer biology, potentially linked to DNA ploidy status, as CSNK1A1L is up-regulated in both diploid and aneuploid cancer cells (Litlekalsoy2016Expression).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CSNK1A1L is part of the Wnt signaling pathway and is down-regulated in circulating endothelial cells compared to CD19-positive CLL cells, indicating its involvement in the molecular differences between these cell types (Rigolin2010Circulating). Additionally, CSNK1A1L has been identified in DNA methylation studies related to bone diseases, suggesting a potential role in bone metabolism and turnover (Rauner2021Perspective).

Mutations in CSNK1A1L have been observed in the context of Gorlin syndrome, although the specific impact of these mutations on the disease phenotype remains unclear (Onodera2017Multilayered). The gene is also located within a critical region associated with developmental delays in 13q deletion syndrome, though its direct contribution to the syndrome's phenotype is not fully established (Privitera202113q).
