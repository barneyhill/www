# SLC7A7

## Overview
The SLC7A7 gene encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, a critical component of the solute carrier family 7, which functions as a transmembrane amino acid transporter. This protein is part of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter system y+L, which is essential for the transport of cationic amino acids such as lysine, arginine, and ornithine across cell membranes, particularly in the kidney and intestine (Torrents1999Identification; Borsani1999SLC7A7). The y+LAT-1 protein forms a functional complex with the heavy chain subunit 4F2hc, facilitating the exchange of cationic amino acids with neutral amino acids and sodium ions (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric). Mutations in the SLC7A7 gene can lead to lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a disorder characterized by impaired amino acid transport and a range of clinical symptoms (Sebastio2011Lysinuric). Beyond its transport role, y+LAT-1 is also implicated in modulating inflammatory responses, highlighting its multifaceted biological significance (Rotoli2018Downregulation).

## Structure
The SLC7A7 gene encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, which is a component of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family. This protein is the light chain of a complex that includes the heavy chain subunit 4F2hc, encoded by the SLC3A2 gene (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric). The y+LAT-1 protein consists of 511 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 56 kDa. It is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, with both the amino and carboxyl termini located intracellularly (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric; Borsani1999SLC7A7). 

The quaternary structure of the y+LAT-1 protein involves its association with the 4F2hc subunit through a disulfide bond, forming a complex with a predicted molecular weight of 135 kDa. This complex facilitates the transport of cationic amino acids across the plasma membrane (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric). The primary role of the 4F2hc subunit is to traffic the complex to the plasma membrane, where y+LAT-1 performs its specific transport activity (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric). 

Mutations in the SLC7A7 gene can lead to structural changes, such as the loss of transmembrane domains, which affect the protein's function in amino acid transport (Borsani1999SLC7A7).

## Function
The SLC7A7 gene encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, a component of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter system y+L, which is crucial for the transport of cationic amino acids (CAAs) such as lysine, arginine, and ornithine across the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells in the kidney and intestine (Torrents1999Identification; Sperandeo2007Lysinuric; Borsani1999SLC7A7). This transport system is essential for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, facilitating the absorption and reabsorption of these amino acids, and preventing their excessive loss in urine (Noguchi2000SLC7A7; Sperandeo2007Slc7a7).

In healthy human cells, the y+LAT-1 protein forms a disulfide-linked heterodimer with the heavy chain subunit 4F2hc (CD98), which is necessary for the transporter's activity (Sperandeo2005Lysinuric; Torrents1998Identification). This transporter operates in both sodium-independent and sodium-dependent manners, allowing the exchange of CAAs for neutral amino acids through an antiport mechanism (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric). The proper functioning of this transporter is vital for various physiological processes, including the urea cycle, which detoxifies ammonia in the liver, and overall nitrogen balance in the body (Noguchi2000SLC7A7; Sperandeo2007Lysinuric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, which encodes the y+LAT-1 protein, are responsible for lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. LPI is characterized by defective transport of cationic amino acids such as lysine, arginine, and ornithine at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney. This defect leads to a range of clinical symptoms, including failure to thrive, hyperammonemia, nephropathy, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, hepatosplenomegaly, osteoporosis, and hematological abnormalities (Bodoy2019Inducible; FontLlitjós2008Novel; Sebastio2011Lysinuric).

The disease is diagnosed by detecting elevated excretion of lysine and other dibasic amino acids in urine, despite low plasma levels, and is confirmed by DNA testing. Over 60 mutations in the SLC7A7 gene have been identified, including point mutations, large deletions, and splice site variants, but no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been established (Torrents1999Identification; Noguchi2019Overview). Treatment typically involves a low-protein diet and citrulline supplementation, though this may not prevent severe complications such as renal and pulmonary disorders (Sperandeo2007Lysinuric; Sperandeo2000Structure).

## Interactions
The SLC7A7 gene encodes the y+LAT1 protein, which is a component of the amino acid transport system y+L. This system is responsible for the transport of cationic amino acids, such as arginine, across cell membranes. y+LAT1 forms a heterodimeric complex with the glycoprotein 4F2hc (also known as CD98hc or SLC3A2), which is essential for its proper expression and function on the plasma membrane (Bodoy2019Inducible; Rotoli2019y+LAT1). This interaction facilitates the exchange of cationic amino acids with neutral amino acids and sodium, playing a crucial role in cellular amino acid homeostasis (Bodoy2019Inducible).

In addition to its role in amino acid transport, y+LAT1 has been implicated in modulating inflammatory responses. The downregulation of SLC7A7, which encodes y+LAT1, can trigger an inflammatory phenotype in human macrophages and airway epithelial cells. This effect is mediated through the NF-κB signaling pathway and is independent of intracellular arginine levels, suggesting that y+LAT1 may have immunomodulatory functions beyond its transport role (Rotoli2018Downregulation). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of SLC7A7 in both amino acid transport and immune regulation.
