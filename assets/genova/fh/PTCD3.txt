# PTCD3

## Overview
PTCD3 is a gene located on human chromosome 2p11.2-p12 that encodes the protein pentatricopeptide repeat domain 3, a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein. This protein is characterized by the presence of multiple pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs, which are typically involved in RNA binding and processing. PTCD3 plays a critical role in mitochondrial translation and gene expression by associating with the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the 28S subunit, and interacting with mitochondrial initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) (Haque2011Contacts; Christian2012Mechanism). It is essential for the assembly and function of mitochondrial ribosomes, contributing to the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins necessary for respiratory chain complexes (He2012Mitochondrial). PTCD3's involvement in mitochondrial nucleoids suggests a broader role in mitochondrial DNA metabolism and protein synthesis (He2012Mitochondrial). The protein's expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in various cancers, where it may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Kalantari2022RNA‐sequencing; Huang2018Elevated).

## Structure
PTCD3 is a protein characterized by the presence of multiple pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs, which are typically involved in RNA binding and processing. The primary structure of PTCD3 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 77.8 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.0, making it one of the largest and most acidic components of the mitochondrial ribosome (Koc2013Identification). 

The secondary structure of PTCD3 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in PPR motifs, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, which is often stabilized by interactions between PPR motifs. PTCD3 is associated with the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the 28S subunit, and interacts with mitochondrial initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt), indicating its role in mitochondrial translation (Haque2011Contacts; Christian2012Mechanism).

PTCD3 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context. The protein is highly conserved among animal mitochondrial homologs, underscoring its essential role in mitochondrial function (Koc2013Identification).

## Function
PTCD3 (pentatricopeptide repeat domain 3) is a mitochondrial RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial translation and gene expression. It is located on the human chromosome 2p11.2-p12 and encodes a polypeptide of 689 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 79 kDa (Huang2018Elevated). PTCD3 is associated with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit and is involved in RNA binding, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (He2012Mitochondrial; Huang2018Elevated).

In healthy human cells, PTCD3 is integral to the assembly or function of mitochondrial ribosomes, contributing to the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins necessary for respiratory chain complexes (He2012Mitochondrial). Knockdown studies in 143B osteosarcoma cells have shown that depletion of PTCD3 leads to decreased mitochondrial respiration and reduced activity of respiratory complexes, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial protein synthesis and overall mitochondrial health (Huang2018Elevated).

PTCD3 is also identified as a component of mitochondrial nucleoids, suggesting its involvement in the broader context of mitochondrial DNA metabolism and protein synthesis (He2012Mitochondrial). These functions highlight PTCD3's essential role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
PTCD3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In prostate cancer (PCa), PTCD3 is overexpressed, correlating with aggressive tumor progression and hormone independence. High PTCD3 expression is associated with advanced pathological grades and clinical stages, as well as shorter overall survival and biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients. This suggests that PTCD3 could serve as an independent prognostic marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer (Huang2018Elevated).

In pancreatic cancer (PaC), PTCD3 expression is downregulated in blood samples of patients compared to normal individuals, but its expression increases from early to metastatic stages. This pattern suggests an oncogenic role for PTCD3 in tumor progression. Low expression of PTCD3 in PaC is positively correlated with patient survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for cancer progression and patient prognosis (Kalantari2022RNA‐sequencing).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PTCD3 in cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient outcomes. Further research is needed to explore PTCD3's role in other diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PTCD3, a pentatricopeptide repeat domain protein, is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation. It interacts with the mammalian mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3 (IF3 mt) and is located near the IF3 mt binding site on the 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Cross-linking studies have shown that PTCD3 is in proximity to several ribosomal proteins, including MRPS10, MRPS18-2, MRPS29, MRPS32, and MRPS36, indicating its integral role in the ribosomal structure and function (Haque2011Contacts).

PTCD3 is also associated with mitochondrial nucleoids, suggesting its involvement in mitochondrial DNA metabolism and protein synthesis. It has been identified in tandem affinity purification experiments, indicating its presence in complexes with other mitochondrial proteins such as ATAD3, prohibitin, and TUFM (He2012Mitochondrial). The interaction of PTCD3 with these proteins supports its role in the assembly or function of mitochondrial ribosomes and highlights its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and protein synthesis (He2012Mitochondrial).
