# ATP13A4

## Overview
ATP13A4 is a gene that encodes the ATPase 13A4 protein, a member of the P5-type ATPase family, which is primarily involved in the transport of cations across cellular membranes. The ATPase 13A4 protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring multiple transmembrane segments and domains typical of P-type ATPases, such as the E1-E2 ATPase domain. It plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum, and is essential for neuronal development and function. The gene is expressed in various human tissues, with notably higher expression levels in fetal tissues, underscoring its importance during early development. Mutations in ATP13A4 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and specific language impairments, highlighting its significance in neurological health and development (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization; Vallipuram2009The; Gibbons2019mRNA).

## Structure
The ATP13A4 protein is a member of the P5-type ATPase family, characterized by its role in cation transport across membranes. The primary structure of ATP13A4 consists of a polypeptide chain with 1197 amino acids (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). The protein includes several conserved regions typical of P-type ATPases, such as the E1-E2 ATPase phosphorylation site (CFDKTGTLT) and a phosphatase region with the sequence Thr-Gly-Glu-Ser (T-G-E-S) (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). 

Bioinformatics analysis predicts that ATP13A4 contains 10 transmembrane segments, a cation ATPase domain, an E1-E2 ATPase domain, and a hydrolase domain (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). The protein also features the PPxxP motif, a characteristic of P5 ATPases (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). 

The tertiary structure model suggests that ATP13A4 is a transmembrane protein, although specific details on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not explicitly provided in the available context (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). The protein is expressed as a 4.5-kb transcript in various human tissues, with higher expression in fetal tissues compared to adult tissues (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization).

## Function
The ATP13A4 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the P5-type ATPase subfamily, which is involved in cation transport across biological membranes. This protein is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is implicated in calcium homeostasis, a critical process for neuronal development and function (Vallipuram2009The). In healthy cells, ATP13A4 overexpression leads to a significant increase in intracellular calcium levels, suggesting its role in augmenting cellular calcium concentrations (Vallipuram2009The).

The protein's activity is crucial during mouse embryonic development, particularly between embryonic days 11 and 17, a period significant for neurogenesis, indicating its importance in the developing nervous system (Vallipuram2009The). ATP13A4's involvement in calcium regulation is essential for neuronal communication and synaptic transmission, which are vital for complex brain functions (Vallipuram2009The). The protein's role in maintaining calcium homeostasis suggests that it may also be involved in secretory and endocytic pathways, although this requires further research for confirmation (Vallipuram2009The). Overall, ATP13A4's function in calcium regulation highlights its potential impact on neurological health and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP13A4 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The E646D mutation in ATP13A4 is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is characterized by a defect in calcium regulation, which is crucial for neuronal communication and synaptic transmission (Vallipuram2009The). This mutation results in impaired calcium transport, potentially affecting brain functions such as memory and learning (Vallipuram2009The).

ATP13A4 is also implicated in language-related disorders. A chromosomal inversion disrupting ATP13A4 has been observed in individuals with specific language impairment (SLI) and language delay, suggesting its role in language development (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization). The gene's expression is notably higher in fetal brain tissue, indicating its importance during early neuronal development (KwasnickaCrawford2005Characterization).

In schizophrenia, increased mRNA expression of ATP13A4 has been reported in Broca's area, a region associated with speech and language processing. This alteration may contribute to the speech-related symptoms of schizophrenia, such as auditory verbal hallucinations (Gibbons2019mRNA). These findings suggest that ATP13A4 may play a role in establishing or maintaining neural connections, which is significant given the proposed disconnectivity in schizophrenia (Gibbons2019mRNA).
