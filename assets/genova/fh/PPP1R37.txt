# PPP1R37

## Overview
The PPP1R37 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 37, which is a regulatory component of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, protein synthesis, and neuronal signaling. By influencing the phosphorylation state of target proteins, PPP1R37 can impact processes such as synaptic plasticity and tau dephosphorylation, which are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Wathra2023Exploratory). Additionally, PPP1R37 has been implicated in immune regulation, particularly in modulating cytokine levels, which may affect the risk of developing conditions such as asthma (Konieczny2024The). As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R37's interactions and effects on PP1 activity make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in both neurological and immune-related disorders.

## Interactions
PPP1R37 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a role in modulating the phosphatase activity of PP1 complexes. This modulation can influence various cellular processes by affecting the phosphorylation state of target proteins. PPP1R37 has been associated with differential expression in hippocampal tissue in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting it may influence GABAergic function through phosphorylation of neurotoxic aggregates (Wathra2023Exploratory). The gene encodes a protein that may inhibit the phosphatase activity of PP1, which is involved in tau dephosphorylation and synaptic plasticity, indicating a potential role in neurodegenerative processes (Wathra2023Exploratory).

In the context of immune-related diseases, PPP1R37 has been implicated in modulating cytokine levels, specifically associated with lower levels of G-CSF/CSF-3, which correlates with a reduced risk of asthma. This suggests that PPP1R37 may participate in interactions that influence cytokine-mediated pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Konieczny2024The). The specific protein interactions of PPP1R37 in these contexts are not detailed, but its regulatory role in PP1 activity suggests it may interact with various proteins involved in these pathways.
