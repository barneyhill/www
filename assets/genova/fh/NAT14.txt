# NAT14

## Overview
NAT14 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetyltransferase 14 (putative), which is part of the N-acetyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the transfer of acetyl groups to various substrates, a process that is crucial for numerous cellular functions, including protein modification and regulation. The specific role of NAT14 in cellular processes is not fully understood, but it is hypothesized to participate in acetylation pathways that influence protein function and stability. As a putative acetyltransferase, NAT14 may have implications in various biological pathways and diseases, although further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions and interactions.
