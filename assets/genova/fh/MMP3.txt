# MMP3

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) is a gene that encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 3, also known as stromelysin-1, which is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. This family of enzymes is primarily involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and cellular migration. MMP3 is characterized as a zinc-dependent endopeptidase, featuring a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif essential for its enzymatic activity (Wetmore1996Roles). Beyond its extracellular functions, MMP3 has been implicated in intracellular processes, including gene regulation and cell signaling, highlighting its multifaceted role in both physiological and pathological contexts (Eguchi2008Novel). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders, making it a significant focus of clinical research (Santos2010MMP3; Mehner2015Tumor).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3), also known as stromelysin-1, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family. The primary structure of MMP3 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Wetmore1996Roles; Saus1988The). The catalytic domain features a zinc metalloprotease signature sequence (HEXXH) and is coordinated by three histidine residues and a glutamic acid-bound water or hydroxide ion in its mature form (Wetmore1996Roles). 

The secondary structure of MMP3 consists of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a three-helix bundle and a five-strand beta sheet (Wetmore1996Roles). The tertiary structure is characterized by a compact fold stabilized by disulfide bonds, with a zinc-calcium loop and a second calcium site contributing to its stability (Wetmore1996Roles). 

MMP3 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications include glycosylation and activation by proteolytic cleavage, which is essential for converting the inactive proenzyme to its active form (Saus1988The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by the presence of metal ions, particularly zinc and calcium, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity and enzymatic function (Wetmore1996Roles).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes beyond its traditional role in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. In healthy human cells, MMP3 is known to regulate gene expression by acting as a transcription factor-like molecule. It translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA enhancer elements, such as TRENDIC and BCE1/TbRE, to regulate the expression of the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) gene. This nuclear function highlights MMP3's role in gene regulation, which is significant in both physiological and pathological states (Eguchi2008Novel).

MMP3 also plays a role in cell signaling and immune response modulation. It is involved in the cleavage of osteopontin, enhancing its cell adhesive and migratory properties, and in the processing of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), converting it into a soluble form that acts as a potent mitogen. These activities are crucial for processes like wound healing and immune response regulation (Rodríguez2010Matrix).

Additionally, MMP3 is involved in the activation of other MMPs, such as MMP-9, by cleaving their precursor forms, which is essential for their enzymatic activity in tissue remodeling and cellular migration (Ogata1992Matrix).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MMP3 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, MMP3 is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Its overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes in breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers, where it promotes tumor progression through mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and genomic instability (Mehner2015Tumor). In breast cancer, MMP3 contributes to cancer cell invasion and metastasis, with higher expression levels linked to increased invasive potential (Suhaimi2020Matrix; Holliday2007Intrinsic).

In prostate cancer, MMP3 expression levels are used to stratify the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). High expression levels correlate with worse clinical outcomes and increased risk of recurrence, suggesting its role as a molecular marker for assessing BCR risk (Olczak2023The).

MMP3 gene polymorphisms, such as the 5A/6A polymorphism, affect its expression and have been linked to various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The 5A allele is associated with higher transcriptional activity and increased risk of certain pathologies, highlighting its potential as a genetic marker for disease susceptibility (Suhaimi2020Matrix; Santos2010MMP3).

## Interactions
MMP3, or matrix metallopeptidase 3, is known for its interactions with various proteins that influence its role in tissue remodeling and cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the extracellular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 beta (HSP90β). The hemopexin domain of MMP3 mediates this interaction, which is crucial for mammary epithelial invasion and morphogenesis. Blocking HSP90β with inhibitory antibodies can halt the invasion and branching capabilities of MMP3, highlighting the importance of this interaction (Correia2013The).

MMP3 also interacts with triple-helical collagen, although it does not cleave it. The enzyme binds to specific sequences within the collagen, involving both its catalytic and hemopexin domains. This binding is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and is thought to regulate collagen turnover and compete with other collagen-binding proteins (Manka2019Structural).

Intracellularly, MMP3 can translocate to the nucleus and influence gene transcription. It interacts with chromobox proteins and cooperates with heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to upregulate heat shock protein genes, such as HSP70B', HSP72, and others, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Eguchi2016Intracellular).
