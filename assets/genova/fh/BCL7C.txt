# BCL7C

## Overview
BCL7C is a gene that encodes the BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit BCL7C, a protein integral to the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically the BAF complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in modifying chromatin structure, thereby regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. As a chromatin remodeling factor, BCL7C is involved in essential cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and development by altering chromatin accessibility. The protein's interaction with the nucleosome core particle and the BRG1 protein, a core component of the SWI/SNF complex, underscores its importance in maintaining genome integrity and influencing gene expression pathways. Mutations or alterations in BCL7C expression have been implicated in various cancers, including glioma and primary cutaneous lymphomas, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for tumor progression and severity (Dietrich2023BRG1; Diaz2023BCL7; Liu2021BCL7A).

## Function
BCL7C is a subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in modifying chromatin structure to regulate DNA accessibility and gene expression. This protein is involved in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for maintaining genome integrity and influencing gene expression pathways related to the extracellular matrix and senescence (Dietrich2023BRG1; Diaz2023BCL7). BCL7C binds directly to the nucleosome core particle with high affinity, a function primarily attributed to its N-terminal region (Diaz2023BCL7). This binding is crucial for the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to chromatin, potentially through interactions with histones or other subunits (Diaz2023BCL7).

BCL7C interacts with the HSA domain of BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, which is necessary for its binding to chromatin and for driving BRG1-dependent gene expression changes (Dietrich2023BRG1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell differentiation, proliferation, and development by altering chromatin accessibility (Dietrich2023BRG1). BCL7C's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease when mutated.

## Clinical Significance
BCL7C is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Mutations in BCL7C, such as the R11S mutation, have been shown to reduce the protein's affinity for the nucleosome, potentially contributing to cancer development by disrupting normal chromatin interactions (Diaz2023BCL7). In glioma, a type of brain cancer, BCL7C expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues, and its expression increases with higher glioma grades, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Liu2021BCL7A). This suggests that BCL7C may play a role in tumor progression and could serve as a biomarker for glioma severity.

In the context of primary cutaneous lymphomas, BCL7C is among the genes that may be involved in tumorigenesis due to somatic duplications, although specific diseases directly associated with BCL7C mutations are not detailed (Gallardo2022Genetics). Despite its involvement in these conditions, the precise mechanisms by which BCL7C mutations or expression alterations contribute to disease remain incompletely understood, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its clinical significance.

## Interactions
BCL7C is a subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically the BAF complex, and is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function. BCL7C interacts with the BRG1 protein, a core component of the SWI/SNF complex, through the HSA domain of BRG1. This interaction is essential for chromatin remodeling and gene expression, as the deletion of the HSA domain results in the loss of BCL7C binding, indicating the importance of this domain for maintaining the interaction (Dietrich2023BRG1).

BCL7C also binds to nucleosome core particles (NCP) and free DNA with high affinity, forming complexes with nucleosomes. This binding is facilitated by the conserved N-terminal region of BCL7C, which is sufficient for nucleosome interaction (Diaz2023BCL7). The interaction with nucleosomes is characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 124 nM, indicating a strong affinity (Diaz2023BCL7).

Within the BAF complex, BCL7C is part of a network that includes interactions with other subunits such as SMARCA4 and SMARCB1, contributing to the assembly and function of the chromatin remodeling complex (Mashtalir2018Modular).
