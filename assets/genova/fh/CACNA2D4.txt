# CACNA2D4

## Overview
The CACNA2D4 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 4, a critical component of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex. This protein is categorized as an auxiliary subunit and plays a pivotal role in modulating calcium ion influx into cells, particularly within the retina. The alpha2delta 4 subunit is essential for the proper functioning of rod photoreceptors, influencing synaptic transmission and visual processing under low light conditions. It interacts with other components of the calcium channel complex, such as the CaV1.4 channels, and is involved in synaptogenesis by organizing presynaptic compartments and facilitating the recruitment of synaptogenic molecules. Mutations in CACNA2D4 have been linked to various retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, as well as psychiatric and cardiac conditions, highlighting its broad clinical significance (Andrade2019Genetic; Cheng2021Novel; Wang2017The).

## Structure
The CACNA2D4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the alpha-2/delta subunit family within the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex. This protein has a molecular mass of approximately 127,938 Da and is involved in the regulation of calcium ion influx into cells (Cheng2021Novel). The CACNA2D4 protein can be processed into two peptides, alpha-2 and delta, which are held together by a disulfide bond (Ablinger2020Neuronal). The protein contains four conserved domains: VWA_N, vWA_VGCC_like, dCache_1, and VGCC_alpha2 superfamily (Cheng2021Novel). The vWA_VGCC_like domain is notable for containing the p.D319N mutation, although its exact biochemical function is not fully understood (Cheng2021Novel).

The protein is highly glycosylated and undergoes post-translational cleavage into its alpha-2 and delta components, which are likely attached to the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Ablinger2020Neuronal). The structure of the alpha-2/delta subunit is crucial for the stability and function of the calcium channel complex, influencing channel properties and trafficking (Kerov2018α2δ4). The CACNA2D4 protein is highly expressed in the retina, indicating its significant role in retinal function (Cheng2021Novel).

## Function
The CACNA2D4 gene encodes the auxiliary calcium channel subunit α2δ4, which is integral to the function of rod photoreceptors in the retina. This subunit is part of the voltage-gated calcium channel complex, specifically interacting with CaV1.4 channels at synaptic ribbons in rod photoreceptors. It plays a crucial role in synaptogenesis, the process of forming synapses, by organizing the presynaptic compartment and facilitating the recruitment of synaptogenic molecules like ELFN1. This interaction is essential for the formation of trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic receptors such as mGluR6 on ON-bipolar cells, which are necessary for effective synaptic transmission (Wang2017The).

The α2δ4 subunit is also involved in tuning the voltage sensitivity of CaV1.4 channels, which is critical for setting the dark release rate of glutamate in rod cells. This function helps distinguish the rod's single-photon response from background noise, contributing to visual processing under low light conditions (Wang2017The). In the absence of α2δ4, synaptic transmission from rods is impaired, leading to night blindness and affecting the organization of retinal circuitry (Wang2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA2D4 gene have been associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the retina and potentially other systems. Notably, novel compound heterozygous missense variants in CACNA2D4 have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) in a Chinese patient. These mutations, identified as p.D319N and p.I608L, were found to co-segregate with the disease phenotype, suggesting their role in the pathogenesis of arRP (Cheng2021Novel). The CACNA2D4 gene is also implicated in other retinal disorders, such as cone dystrophy and retinal dystrophy, due to its crucial role in retinal function (Cheng2021Novel).

Beyond retinal diseases, CACNA2D4 has been associated with psychiatric disorders. Variations in this gene have been linked to major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A splice donor site variation in CACNA2D4 was identified in brain samples from suicide victims with MDD, and a rare homozygous deletion affecting CACNA2D4 was found in a male proband with ASD (Andrade2019Genetic). Additionally, CACNA2D4 variants have been associated with familial atrial fibrillation, highlighting its potential role in cardiac conduction (Weeke2014Wholeexome). These findings underscore the gene's significance in various clinical contexts.

## Interactions
The CACNA2D4 gene encodes the auxiliary calcium channel subunit α2δ4, which is involved in several critical interactions within the retina. α2δ4 is a component of the CaV1.4 channel complex, interacting with the main pore-forming CaV1.4 α1 subunit and the auxiliary β2 subunit. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of calcium channels in photoreceptor synaptic terminals, influencing channel properties such as voltage-dependent activation and inactivation (Lee2015Characterization).

α2δ4 also interacts with the synaptogenic molecule ELFN1, which is essential for the formation of rod photoreceptor synapses. This interaction involves the leucine-rich repeat domain of ELFN1 and the N-terminal region of α2δ4, facilitating the alignment of presynaptic glutamate release machinery with postsynaptic receptors (Wang2017The). The α2δ4 subunit is part of a larger macromolecular complex at photoreceptor synapses, which includes CaV1.4 channels and is critical for synaptic ribbon organization and vesicular fusion (Wang2017The).

In addition, α2δ4's interaction with CaV1.4 channels is necessary for the synaptic targeting of ELFN1 and mGluR6, as demonstrated by rescue experiments in α2δ4 knockout mice (Wang2017The). These interactions highlight the role of α2δ4 in synaptic transmission and the organization of photoreceptor synapses.
