# HSPA13

## Overview
HSPA13 is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 13, a unique member of the Hsp70 family of proteins. Unlike typical Hsp70 proteins, the HSPA13-encoded protein lacks a substrate binding domain, which suggests a specialized function in cellular processes. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining proteostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol, playing a critical role in the translocation and maturation of secretory proteins. It interacts with various components of the ER translocon and is implicated in processes such as cotranslocational glycosylation and signal peptide cleavage. HSPA13 is also involved in the regulation of immune functions, particularly in plasma cell production and antibody secretion. The gene is responsive to cellular stress, being a target of the unfolded protein response, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including certain cancers and conditions related to protein aggregation (He2020Hspa13; Espinoza2022Hspa13).

## Function
HSPA13, also known as STCH, is a member of the Hsp70 family of proteins and plays a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis within cells, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. It is involved in the translocation of secretory proteins into the ER by interacting with the Sec61 translocon, a key component in this process (Espinoza2022Hspa13). Unlike other Hsp70 proteins, HSPA13 lacks a substrate binding domain, which is typically necessary for canonical Hsp70 functions, indicating a unique role in protein translocation and aggregation (Espinoza2022Hspa13).

HSPA13 modulates protein import and maturation by binding to translocon subunits and complexes involved in cotranslocational glycosylation and signal peptide cleavage (Espinoza2022Hspa13). It interacts with translocon-associated Hsp40 proteins, Sec62, and Sec63, potentially influencing post-translational ER import (Espinoza2022Hspa13). HSPA13 is also involved in the regulation of plasma cells and antibody production, facilitating protein transport from the ER to the cytosol, which is essential for normal immune function (He2020Hspa13).

HSPA13's ATPase activity is important for its function in protein import and ER proteostasis, as mutations in this domain exacerbate the formation of immature and insoluble protein aggregates (Espinoza2022Hspa13). The gene is a target of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is selectively induced by the XBP1s arm of the UPR, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Espinoza2022Hspa13).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the HSPA13 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), significant genetic variations in HSPA13 have been identified, with higher expression levels linked to reduced survival, particularly in African American patients (Laksita2021Genetic). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HSPA13 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, and its high expression is associated with a negative prognosis, correlating with advanced cancer stages and lower overall survival rates (Wang2021The).

HSPA13 also plays a critical role in maintaining proteostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cytosol. Dysregulation, such as overexpression or mutation, can impair protein translocation and maturation, leading to proteostasis imbalances. This is evidenced by the accumulation and aggregation of proteins like transthyretin (TTR) and Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), which can contribute to diseases associated with protein aggregation and secretion deficiencies (Espinoza2022Hspa13).

In mouse models, variations in the Hspa13-App region affect muscle function and mitochondrial activity, suggesting that gene dosage changes can influence metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes, potentially relevant for conditions like Down syndrome (Brault2015Opposite).

## Interactions
HSPA13, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It interacts with several components of the ER translocon, including Sec61a1, Sec61b, NCLN, Sec62, and Sec63, which are crucial for protein translocation into the ER (Espinoza2022Hspa13). HSPA13 also associates with the signal peptidase complex (SEC11C, SEC11A, SPCS2, and SPCS3) and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (RPN1, RPN2, DAD1, DDOST, MAGT1, STT3A, and STT3B), indicating its role in cotranslocational glycosylation and signal peptide cleavage (Espinoza2022Hspa13).

HSPA13 interacts with major ER chaperones such as BiP, ERdj3/DNAJB11, and Grp94/HSPB90B1, which are involved in protein folding and preventing misfolding (Espinoza2022Hspa13). These interactions suggest that HSPA13 is closely associated with maintaining proteostasis for nascent proteins. It also binds to translocon-associated Hsp40 proteins, Sec62 and Sec63, which are involved in post-translational ER import (Espinoza2022Hspa13).

In the context of plasma cell production and antibody secretion, HSPA13 interacts with proteins such as Bcap31, which is involved in protein transport from the ER to the cytosol (He2020Hspa13). These interactions highlight HSPA13's role in regulating protein transport and maintaining cellular proteostasis.
