# CENPU

## Overview
CENPU, also known as centromere protein U, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function and assembly of the kinetochore, a critical structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein, categorized as a centromere-associated protein, plays a pivotal role in ensuring stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability during mitosis (Wang2017Centromere; zhang2018centromere). CENPU is involved in the recruitment and maintenance of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at the kinetochore, a process necessary for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Wang2018Centromere). Beyond its structural role, CENPU also functions in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control, acting as a transcription suppressor (Wang2017Centromere). The gene's expression and interactions have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Lin2021CENPU; Pan2020Centromere).

## Structure


## Function
CENPU, also known as centromere protein U, is a crucial component in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It plays a significant role in ensuring stable kinetochore-microtubule attachment, which is vital for proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability during mitosis (Wang2017Centromere; zhang2018centromere). CENPU is involved in the initial recruitment and maintenance of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at the kinetochore, which is necessary for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Wang2018Centromere). This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and is crucial for PLK1 recruitment during interphase and mitosis (Wang2017Centromere).

CENPU contains nuclear receptor-binding motifs and potential phosphorylation sites, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control (Wang2018Centromere). It acts as a transcription suppressor, contributing to the regulation of gene expression during cell division (Wang2017Centromere). The protein is active at the centromere, where it contributes to the mitotic spindle checkpoint signaling, ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thus maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (zhang2018centromere).

## Clinical Significance
CENPU, also known as centromere protein U, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In bladder cancer (BCa), CENPU is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and reduced survival rates. Silencing CENPU in BCa cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, suggesting its role in tumor growth and progression (Wang2017Centromere).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CENPU is also significantly overexpressed, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival. It acts as an oncogene by suppressing the tumor suppressor DUSP6, leading to the activation of the ERK1/2 and p38 signaling pathways, which promote cancer growth and metastasis. Knockdown of CENPU in NPC cells reduces proliferation and migration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2021CENPU; Lin2024Overexpression).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high CENPU expression is linked to late-stage disease, lymph node involvement, and specific demographic factors such as age and smoking history, indicating its role in cancer progression (Liu2018Identification).

## Interactions
CENPU, also known as centromere protein U, participates in several significant protein interactions that influence cancer progression. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CENPU interacts physically with COX-2, a key protein in the COX-2-p-ERK-HIF-1α-VEGFA signaling pathway. This interaction stabilizes COX-2 by inhibiting its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing angiogenesis in TNBC (Pan2020Centromere). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between CENPU and COX-2, highlighting its role in promoting VEGFA production and angiogenesis (Pan2020Centromere).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CENPU interacts with Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), a tumor suppressor. This interaction inhibits DUSP6, leading to increased activation of the MAP kinase pathways, including ERK1/2 and p38, which promotes NPC development. Co-immunoprecipitation and reciprocal western blotting analyses have confirmed the physical interaction between CENPU and DUSP6 (Lin2021CENPU).

In bladder cancer, CENPU is involved in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome segregation, interacting with proteins such as Hec1 and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and is crucial for Plk1 recruitment to the kinetochore during mitosis (Wang2017Centromere).
