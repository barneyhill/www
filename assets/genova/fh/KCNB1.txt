# KCNB1

## Overview
The KCNB1 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily B member 1, commonly known as the Kv2.1 channel. This protein is a transmembrane ion channel that plays a pivotal role in regulating neuronal excitability by facilitating the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. Kv2.1 channels are integral to maintaining the resting membrane potential and repolarizing the membrane during action potentials, particularly in neurons. Structurally, the Kv2.1 channel is composed of four identical subunits, each containing six transmembrane helices, which form a pore for ion conduction. The channel's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which influences its role in neuronal homeostasis and excitability. Mutations in the KCNB1 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, underscoring its clinical significance (Bar2019Expanding; Kang2019Spectrum; Du1998The).

## Structure
The KCNB1 gene encodes the Kv2.1 potassium channel, a voltage-gated ion channel crucial for neuronal excitability. The primary structure of Kv2.1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific domains including transmembrane segments and a pore region essential for ion selectivity (Thiffault2015A). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the channel's ability to form a selective pore for potassium ions. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a three-dimensional shape that facilitates the channel's function (Grandi2016Potassium).

The quaternary structure of Kv2.1 is characterized by the assembly of four identical subunits, creating a functional channel that spans the cell membrane (Grandi2016Potassium). This tetrameric assembly is crucial for the channel's voltage-dependent gating and ion conduction properties. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the channel's activity and localization within the cell (Thiffault2015A). The Kv2.1 channel also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may affect its expression and function in different tissues (Roder2006The).

## Function
The KCNB1 gene encodes the Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel, which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and action potential repolarization in healthy human cells. Kv2.1 channels are primarily active in the plasma membrane of neurons, particularly on the somata and proximal dendrites, where they contribute to maintaining the resting membrane potential and shaping action potentials (Du2000Frequency‐dependent; Du1998The). These channels are involved in generating a delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent outward potassium current, which is essential for membrane repolarization during high-frequency neuronal firing (Bar2019Expanding).

Kv2.1 channels are composed of four alpha subunits that form a pore for ion conduction. Each subunit contains six transmembrane helices, including a voltage-sensing domain and a pore domain, which are critical for the channel's function (Bar2019Expanding). The activity of Kv2.1 is modulated by phosphorylation, allowing it to act as a homeostatic suppressor of neuronal activity, thus maintaining electrical excitability balance in the brain (Speca2014Deletion).

In the broader context of organismal outcomes, Kv2.1 channels help prevent excessive neuronal firing, which is crucial for normal cognitive and motor functions. Mutations or deficiencies in KCNB1 can lead to increased seizure susceptibility and behavioral hyperexcitability, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Kang2019Spectrum).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNB1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders. These conditions often manifest with severe developmental delays, epilepsy, and various neuropsychiatric symptoms (Kang2019Spectrum; Bar2020Developmental). The phenotypic spectrum of KCNB1-related disorders is broad, with some patients experiencing drug-resistant epilepsy, while others may have milder forms of the disease or even no epilepsy at all (Bar2019Expanding).

Specific mutations, such as missense variants, are frequently linked to more severe epilepsy and drug resistance, whereas truncating variants might result in less severe epilepsy outcomes (Bar2020Developmental). The KCNB1-p.G379R variant, for example, is known to cause a loss of ion selectivity and voltage sensitivity, leading to a non-specific cation leak current, which contributes to the severe epileptic phenotype (Hawkins2021Epilepsy).

Alterations in KCNB1 expression or function can disrupt neuronal signaling, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders. The variability in clinical outcomes suggests that other genetic or environmental factors may also influence the severity of the conditions associated with KCNB1 mutations (Xiong2022Correlation).

## Interactions
The KCNB1 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular functions. KCNB1 forms macromolecular complexes with integrins, particularly integrin-α5 and integrin-β5, in both mouse and human brains. These integrin-KCNB1 complexes (IKCs) are essential for neuronal development and migration, and their disruption can lead to neuromorphological abnormalities and epilepsy (Bortolami2022IntegrinKCNB1).

KCNB1 also interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), forming a complex that is crucial for FAK activation and cell motility. This interaction is significant for processes such as cell polarization, migration, and adhesion. The Kv2.1-FAK complex, involving the N-terminus of Kv2.1, influences FAK phosphorylation, which is essential for cell directional migration and wound healing (Wei2008Formation).

In the brain, the oxidation of KCNB1 channels triggers apoptotic signaling pathways mediated by integrin-FAK-Src/Fyn kinases. This process involves the formation of non-conducting KCNB1 oligomers that activate integrin signaling, leading to apoptosis (Yu2017Oxidation). These interactions highlight the role of KCNB1 in both physiological and pathological processes.
