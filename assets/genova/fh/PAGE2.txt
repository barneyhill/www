# PAGE2

## Overview
PAGE2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cancer-testis (CT) antigen family, specifically known as PAGE family member 2. This protein is characterized by its restricted expression pattern, predominantly found in various cancerous tissues and germline cells, with minimal presence in other normal tissues. The PAGE family member 2 protein is implicated in cellular processes associated with cancer progression, particularly during the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in colorectal cancer cells, where its expression is upregulated. This suggests a role in the modulation of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, which are critical in cancer metastasis and progression (YilmazOzcan2014Epigenetic). The regulation of PAGE2 expression is influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, including promoter methylation and hydroxymethylation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment strategies (YilmazOzcan2014Epigenetic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The PAGE2 gene, a member of the cancer-testis (CT) gene family, is primarily expressed in various cancers and germline cells, with limited expression in other normal tissues. Alterations in PAGE2 expression have been linked to cancer progression and tumor heterogeneity. During the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in colorectal cancer cells, PAGE2 expression is upregulated, which is associated with the differentiation process and a decrease in mesenchymal markers. This suggests that PAGE2 may play a role in the transitional phases between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, potentially influencing cancer progression and metastasis (YilmazOzcan2014Epigenetic).

The regulation of PAGE2 expression involves epigenetic mechanisms, including changes in promoter methylation and hydroxymethylation. The upregulation of PAGE2 during MET is linked to increased hydroxymethylation mediated by TET2, as well as the removal of repressive chromatin proteins from its promoter region. Conversely, during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PAGE2 expression is downregulated, indicating a dynamic regulation in response to cellular differentiation states (YilmazOzcan2014Epigenetic). These findings highlight the potential of PAGE2 as a target for cancer therapies, particularly in strategies aimed at modulating differentiation and metastasis. However, specific clinical implications of PAGE2 mutations or expression alterations in diseases other than cancer are not detailed in the available context.
