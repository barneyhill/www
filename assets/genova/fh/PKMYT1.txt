# PKMYT1

## Overview
PKMYT1 is a gene that encodes the protein kinase, membrane-associated tyrosine/threonine 1, which is a member of the WEE kinase family. This protein is a dual specificity kinase, meaning it can phosphorylate both tyrosine and threonine residues, and is primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. PKMYT1 plays a critical role in controlling the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis by phosphorylating Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) at specific sites, thereby inhibiting its activity and preventing premature mitotic entry. The protein is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, where it interacts with Cdk1 complexes to regulate their activity and localization. PKMYT1's function is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and is particularly important during the recovery from DNA damage. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Schmidt2017Regulation; Cai2021PKMYT1; Liu2017PKMYT1).

## Structure
The PKMYT1 protein, also known as Myt1, is a dual specificity kinase that phosphorylates CDK1 at Thr14 and Tyr15, playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Structurally, PKMYT1 is characterized by its kinase domain, which is responsible for its enzymatic activity. This domain has been crystallized and analyzed using X-ray diffraction, providing insights into its structural features (Zhu2017Structural). The kinase domain of PKMYT1 shows an unusual ability to autophosphorylate multiple serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which is distinct from its close relatives Wee1 and Wee2 (Zhu2017Structural).

PKMYT1 is a membrane-associated kinase, complicating its enzyme preparation and assay development (Rohe2012In). It is localized to the ER-Golgi complex, which is essential for Golgi and ER assembly at the end of mitosis (Zhu2017Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its regulatory functions. PKMYT1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its structure and function. The structural analysis of PKMYT1 provides a framework for understanding its interaction with inhibitors and its role in cell cycle regulation (Zhu2017Structural).

## Function
The PKMYT1 gene encodes a kinase that is part of the WEE kinase family, which includes WEE1 and PKMYT1. This kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly the transition from the G2 phase to the M phase (mitosis). PKMYT1 is a membrane-associated tyrosine-and threonine-specific kinase that inhibits Cdk1 by phosphorylating it at specific sites (Thr14 and Tyr15), thereby preventing premature entry into mitosis. This regulation is essential for maintaining genomic integrity, as it ensures that cells do not proceed to mitosis before DNA replication and repair are complete (Schmidt2017Regulation).

PKMYT1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, where it interacts with Cdk1 complexes, sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their entry into the nucleus. This action delays cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. Overexpression of PKMYT1 can prevent entry into mitosis, although its catalytic activity is not essential for this delay, indicating the importance of its protein-protein interactions (Schmidt2017Regulation).

PKMYT1 is suggested to have a minor role in the unperturbed cell cycle but is essential for G2 checkpoint recovery after DNA damage. During checkpoint recovery, PKMYT1 is negatively regulated by Plk1, which phosphorylates and inactivates it, facilitating the activation of Cdc25 and inactivation of WEE1, thus promoting cell cycle progression (Schmidt2017Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
PKMYT1 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PKMYT1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis and immune infiltration. High PKMYT1 expression correlates with lower levels of certain immune cells and higher levels of immunosuppressive cells, suggesting a role in immune evasion. It is also linked to drug sensitivity and mutations in tumor suppressor and oncogenes, such as TP53 and PIK3CA, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in aggressive breast cancer subtypes (Li2023Overexpression).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PKMYT1 overexpression is associated with poor overall survival. Its downregulation in ESCC cell lines leads to increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation, suggesting its role as an oncogene. PKMYT1 may promote tumor progression by affecting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Zhang2019&lt; p&gt; Overexpressed).

In gastric cancer, PKMYT1 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, potentially through the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Silencing PKMYT1 results in increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth, highlighting its role in cancer cell survival (Zhang2020&lt; p&gt; PKMYT1).

## Interactions
PKMYT1 is a kinase that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. It is known to interact with Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) complexes, sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their entry into the nucleus, which delays cell cycle progression (Schmidt2017Regulation). PKMYT1 also interacts with CCNA2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, where it regulates cell behaviors by targeting CCNA2. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays (Cai2021PKMYT1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PKMYT1 interacts with GSK3beta, a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex. This interaction inhibits GSK3beta's activity, leading to the activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling, which promotes cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Liu2017PKMYT1). In breast cancer, PKMYT1 is co-expressed with PLK1, suggesting a potential partnership in regulating the cell cycle (Liu2019Systematic).

PKMYT1's interactions extend to its regulation by Plk1, which negatively regulates PKMYT1 through direct phosphorylation, influencing checkpoint recovery and mitotic entry (Schmidt2017Regulation). These interactions highlight PKMYT1's role in various cancer types and its potential as a therapeutic target.
