# BBS4

## Overview
BBS4 is a gene that encodes the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4 protein, which is a critical component of the BBSome complex, a group of proteins essential for ciliary function and intracellular trafficking. The BBS4 protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role in forming a stable complex with other BBSome subunits. This complex is vital for the proper localization and function of cilia, which are involved in various cellular processes, including vision, olfaction, and renal function. Mutations in the BBS4 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a genetic disorder that manifests in a range of clinical symptoms such as retinal degeneration, obesity, and cognitive impairment, due to the disruption of ciliary function (Iannaccone2005Clinical; Singh2019Structure; Horwitz2020BBS4).

## Structure
The BBS4 protein is a component of the BBSome complex, characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) that fold into α-solenoids, a type of secondary structure. These TPR domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing BBS4 to form a conventional uninterrupted α-solenoid structure, which is a tertiary structure that typically binds specific linear peptides within its concave surface (Singh2019Structure). In the BBSome, BBS4 is physically connected to BBS8, another protein with a similar α-solenoid structure. BBS8 has an insertion between its third and fourth α-helices, consisting of two short α-helices and long loops that form a compact domain. This insertion is flexible or capable of unfolding, as suggested by weaker density in this region (Singh2019Structure).

BBS18, the smallest BBSome subunit, binds the concave surfaces of BBS8 and the N-terminal half of BBS4, stabilizing their association. In the absence of BBS18, BBS4 fails to incorporate into the BBSome, indicating its role in the quaternary structure of the complex. The quaternary structure involves the interaction of BBS4 with BBS8 and BBS18, forming a subcomplex within the BBSome (Singh2019Structure).

## Function
The BBS4 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the function and formation of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes. BBS4 is a component of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for protein trafficking within cilia and intracellular trafficking. It localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and the basal body of primary cilia, playing a role in recruiting cargo to centriolar satellites and forming a functional centrosomal microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (Horwitz2020BBS4; Kim2004The).

BBS4 is involved in the nuclear transport of transcription factors that mediate the neuronal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. It is essential for the proper translocation of sXBP-1 and cleaved ATF6α to the nucleus following ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) activation (Horwitz2020BBS4). BBS4 also plays a role in microtubule anchoring and cell cycle progression by interacting with PCM1, a protein involved in microtubule organization (Kim2004The).

In terms of organismal outcomes, BBS4 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper ciliary function, which are critical for processes such as vision, olfaction, and renal function (PrietoEchagüe2017BBS4; Chamling2013Ectopic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BBS4 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a range of clinical manifestations. These include retinal degeneration, obesity, limb anomalies, genito-urinary abnormalities, dental problems, and cognitive impairment (Iannaccone2005Clinical). Specifically, a homozygous deletion in the BBS4 gene (c.77-220del) has been linked to decreased olfaction in affected individuals, as evidenced by severe anosmia and hyposmia in patients from a studied family (Iannaccone2005Clinical). This olfactory dysfunction is supported by findings in Bbs4 knockout mice, which also exhibit significant olfactory deficits, suggesting that ciliary dysfunction due to BBS4 mutations is a key aspect of BBS pathogenesis (Iannaccone2005Clinical).

BBS4 is part of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for the biogenesis and maintenance of the primary cilium, a structure important for sensing the extracellular environment and modulating ciliary protein trafficking (Manara2019Mutation). Mutations in BBS4 can lead to abnormalities in ciliary function, contributing to the multiorgan dysfunctions observed in BBS (Ece2015Targeted). The frequency of BBS4 mutations is relatively low compared to other BBS genes, but they are still significant contributors to the syndrome's clinical features (Ece2015Targeted).

## Interactions
BBS4 is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome. It is a component of the BBSome complex, which is essential for ciliary function. BBS4 interacts with other BBSome subunits, including BBS1, BBS2, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, and BBS18, forming a stable complex that is necessary for proper ciliary localization and function (Prasai2020The).

BBS4 also interacts with PCM1, a pericentriolar material protein, which is crucial for recruiting other centrosomal components. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of PCM1 and is essential for microtubule anchoring at the centrosome (Kim2004The). BBS4 acts as an adaptor for the p150 glued subunit of the dynactin complex, facilitating the transport of PCM1 and associated proteins to the pericentriolar region (Kim2004The).

In addition to these interactions, BBS4 has been shown to bind with other proteins such as ALDOB, EPAS1, FHOD1, FLOT1, and PAX2, suggesting a role in intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal organization (Oeffner2007Novel). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of BBS4 in cellular dynamics and its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function.
