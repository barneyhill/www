# HIGD1C

## Overview
HIGD1C is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family member 1C, which plays a significant role in the cellular response to hypoxia. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the electron transport chain, particularly influencing Complex IV (CIV) activity. HIGD1C is crucial for oxygen sensing in the carotid body glomus cells, which are essential for detecting blood oxygen levels in mammals. By interacting with the hypoxia-induced CIV subunit COX4I2, HIGD1C enhances the oxygen sensitivity of CIV, thereby facilitating an effective response to low oxygen conditions. This function is vital for maintaining proper ventilatory responses to hypoxia, as demonstrated by studies on HIGD1C-deficient mice (TimónGómez2021A).

## Structure


## Function
The HIGD1C gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in oxygen sensing, particularly in the carotid body (CB) glomus cells, which are key chemoreceptors for blood oxygen levels in mammals. HIGD1C is involved in modulating the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), specifically Complex IV (CIV), by enhancing its sensitivity to hypoxia. This modulation is achieved through its interaction with the hypoxia-induced CIV subunit COX4I2, which together increase the oxygen sensitivity of CIV, allowing the CB to detect low oxygen levels more effectively than other tissues (TimónGómez2021A).

HIGD1C negatively regulates oxygen consumption by CIV, contributing to the acute oxygen-sensing mechanism of the CB. It is essential for the proper ventilatory response to hypoxia, as evidenced by HIGD1C-deficient mice, which exhibit a defective hypoxic ventilatory response while maintaining normal responses to hypercapnia (TimónGómez2021A). The protein's role in altering the protein environment around the active center of CIV suggests it affects the heme a centers, which is consistent with changes observed in cytochrome absorbance spectra under hypoxic conditions (TimónGómez2021A).

## Interactions
HIGD1C is a mitochondrial protein that interacts with components of the electron transport chain, particularly Complex IV (CIV) and cytochrome c. It associates with CIV and cytochrome c, influencing the activity of CIV by potentially altering its active site and the surrounding protein environment. This interaction is suggested by changes in the UV/Vis absorption spectra of cytochromes when HIGD1C is overexpressed in cells (TimónGómez2021A). HIGD1C's interaction with CIV is crucial for modulating the oxygen sensitivity of CIV, especially in hypoxic conditions, as seen in carotid body glomus cells. In these cells, HIGD1C works alongside the hypoxia-induced CIV subunit COX4I2 to enhance CIV's sensitivity to low oxygen levels (TimónGómez2021A).

In HEK293T cells lacking HIGD1A, HIGD1C overexpression can restore CIV activity, indicating a functional similarity between HIGD1C and HIGD1A in regulating CIV activity (TimónGómez2021A). However, HIGD1C does not appear to be involved in the biogenesis of ETC complexes or supercomplexes, as its overexpression does not rescue defects in supercomplex assembly in knockout cell lines (TimónGómez2021A).
