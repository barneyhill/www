# TFR2

## Overview
The TFR2 gene encodes transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in iron metabolism. Located on chromosome 7q22.1, TFR2 is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis through its interaction with iron-loaded transferrin and the modulation of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron regulation (Worthen2014The; Roetto2018The). TfR2 functions as an iron sensor and is integral to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signaling pathway, which influences hepcidin expression in response to iron levels (Worthen2014The). The protein exists in two isoforms, TfR2α and TfR2β, with TfR2α being a membrane-bound receptor and TfR2β a cytosolic form (Roetto2018The). Mutations in the TFR2 gene are linked to hereditary hemochromatosis type 3, a disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation, underscoring the clinical significance of this gene in maintaining iron balance (Worthen2014The; Hernández2021New).

## Structure
Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in iron metabolism. It is encoded by the TFR2 gene located on chromosome 7q22.1 and consists of 18 exons (Roetto2018The). TfR2 has two main isoforms, TfR2α and TfR2β, resulting from alternative splicing. TfR2α is a membrane-bound protein with a molecular weight of approximately 89 kDa, consisting of 801 amino acids. It features a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular domain that includes a protease-associated domain and two RGD motifs for binding di-ferric transferrin (Fe2Tf) (Roetto2018The). The extracellular domain of TfR2α shares 45% identity and 66% similarity with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and contains cysteine residues that suggest a homodimer configuration (Trinder2003Transferrin).

TfR2β, in contrast, lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, existing as a cytosolic protein identical to the extracellular domain of TfR2α (Roetto2018The). TfR2 is glycosylated at specific asparagine residues, which is crucial for its stabilization by holo-transferrin, although not necessary for transferrin binding or trafficking to the cell surface (Zhao2013NLinked). The glycosylation sites include Asn 240, 339, and 754 (Zhao2013NLinked). The protein forms disulfide-linked dimers, and its stability and trafficking are regulated by transferrin binding (Worthen2014The).

## Function
Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is a crucial protein in maintaining iron homeostasis in the human body. It is primarily expressed in the liver, where it acts as an iron sensor by binding to iron-loaded transferrin (holo-Tf) in the bloodstream. This interaction leads to the regulation of hepcidin, a hormone that controls iron absorption and distribution. TfR2's role in hepcidin regulation involves its interaction with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signaling pathway, which is essential for modulating hepcidin levels in response to iron levels (Worthen2014The).

TfR2 also forms a complex with the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE) and hemojuvelin (HJV), which is believed to be involved in iron sensing and hepcidin regulation. This complex is crucial for the body's response to changes in transferrin saturation, ensuring that iron uptake is appropriately adjusted to prevent both deficiency and overload (Worthen2014The; Roetto2018The).

In addition to its role in iron homeostasis, TfR2 is involved in erythropoiesis. It is a component of the erythropoietin receptor complex, necessary for the differentiation of erythroid progenitors, highlighting its importance in both iron metabolism and red blood cell production (Forejtnikovà2010Transferrin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TFR2 gene are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis type 3, a condition characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body. These mutations can lead to reduced hepcidin production, a hormone crucial for iron regulation, resulting in iron overload and associated complications such as cirrhosis, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy (Worthen2014The; Hernández2021New). Specific mutations, such as E60X and M172K, have been identified in patients with hemochromatosis who have wild-type HFE genes, indicating their potential pathogenic role (Roetto2001New). The presence of homozygous mutations in TFR2 is linked to the severity of the disease, with some mutations leading to a more severe phenotype due to the absence of the β-TFR2 transcript (Roetto2001New).

TFR2 mutations can also affect the interaction with transferrin, disrupting iron metabolism. For instance, the Asp680Tyr mutation alters the TFR2/transferrin interaction, potentially impacting iron homeostasis and contributing to hereditary hemochromatosis (Hernández2021New). Additionally, TFR2 mutations can lead to low or undetectable hepcidin levels, similar to those seen in juvenile hemochromatosis, further contributing to iron overload disorders (Nemeth2005Hepcidin).

## Interactions
Transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for iron homeostasis. TFR2 forms a membrane-associated complex with hemochromatosis protein (HFE) and hemojuvelin (HJV) on hepatocytes, which is essential for the regulation of hepcidin, a key hormone in iron metabolism. This complex activates the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, which is important for hepcidin transcription (D’Alessio2012The). The interaction between TFR2 and HFE is mediated by specific amino acids in the TFR2 extracellular domain, which are critical for binding both HFE and HJV (D’Alessio2012The).

TFR2 also interacts with transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and forms a sensor complex on the cell membrane that responds to elevated transferrin saturation (TS) by activating hepcidin expression through signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK kinase (Roetto2018The). However, some studies suggest that HFE and TFR2 do not interact directly, indicating that they may regulate hepcidin independently (Rishi2013In). Despite these findings, the exact mechanisms and roles of TFR2 in these interactions remain partially understood (Roetto2018The).
