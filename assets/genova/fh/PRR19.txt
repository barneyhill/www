# PRR19

## Overview
PRR19 is a gene that encodes the proline-rich protein 19, which plays a significant role in meiotic processes. The protein is characterized by its proline-rich domain, which is a common feature in proteins involved in signaling and structural functions (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). PRR19 is particularly important in the formation of meiotic crossovers, a critical step in genetic recombination during meiosis. It achieves this by forming a complex with the cyclin-like protein CNTD1, which is essential for the stability and function of recombination complexes (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). Although PRR19 does not directly interact with nucleic acids, its involvement in protein complexes is crucial for the regulation of other proteins, such as RNF212 and MutSγ, which are integral to recombination processes (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich).

## Interactions
The PRR19 protein is involved in several interactions crucial for meiotic crossover formation in mice. It forms a complex with the cyclin-like protein CNTD1, which is essential for the stability and function of crossover-specific recombination complexes during meiosis. PRR19 and CNTD1 co-localize on pachytene chromosomes and physically interact, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). This interaction is critical for the proper localization and function of other proteins involved in crossover formation, such as RNF212 and MutSγ, which are associated with recombination intermediates (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich).

While PRR19 does not directly interact with the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2, the PRR19-CNTD1 complex is suggested to regulate CDK2 activity, which is important for crossover differentiation (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). The interaction between CNTD1 and CDK2 is crucial, as a mutation in CNTD1 that disrupts this interaction affects crossover differentiation (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich). PRR19 does not show direct physical interactions with nucleic acids, but its role in protein complexes influences recombination processes (Bondarieva2020Prolinerich).
