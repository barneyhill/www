# GPR84

## Overview
GPR84 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 84, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically categorized as a Class A rhodopsin-like receptor. This receptor is predominantly expressed in immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, where it plays a significant role in mediating inflammatory responses. GPR84 is activated by medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways that influence immune cell functions such as chemotaxis, cytokine secretion, and phagocytosis. The receptor's structure is characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical bundle and a unique ligand-binding pocket, which is crucial for its interaction with specific ligands and G proteins. GPR84 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2020Modulation; Zhang2023Prophagocytic; Wang2006Mediumchain).

## Structure
The GPR84 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane helical bundle, typical of Class A rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Zhang2023Prophagocytic). The extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of GPR84 adopts a β-hairpin structure, extending towards transmembrane helix 1 and covering the ligand-binding pocket (Zhang2023Prophagocytic). This loop is stabilized by two disulfide bonds, one of which is highly conserved among Class A GPCRs (Zhang2023Prophagocytic).

The primary structure of GPR84 includes specific residues crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation, such as Arg172, which acts as a charge partner for fatty acid carboxylates (Mahmud2017Three). The tertiary structure involves a unique ligand-binding pocket that is occluded, similar to the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), and is unable to accommodate long-chain fatty acids (Zhang2023Prophagocytic).

The quaternary structure of GPR84 has not been fully detailed, but the receptor's interaction with the G i protein involves specific hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Zhang2023Prophagocytic). Post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation, are crucial for the proper folding and function of GPR84 (Zhang2023Prophagocytic). The receptor's structure and interactions are still under investigation, with ongoing studies aiming to clarify its conformations and ligand-binding sites (Chen2020Modulation).

## Function
GPR84 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily expressed in immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It is activated by medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) with carbon chain lengths ranging from C9 to C14, with C10 to C12 being the most potent activators (Chen2020Modulation; Wang2006Mediumchain). Upon activation, GPR84 triggers several intracellular signaling pathways, including the G-protein coupled PLC-IP3-Ca2+ signaling pathway, which mobilizes intracellular granules and promotes chemotactic migration in neutrophils (Sundqvist2018Similarities). This receptor also plays a role in the assembly of the ROS-generating NADPH-oxidase, contributing to the immune response by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species (Sundqvist2018Similarities).

In macrophages, GPR84 activation enhances cytokine secretion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, indicating its pro-inflammatory role (Chen2020Modulation). It is involved in promoting T helper 1 (Th1)-driven immunity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12 p40 (Wang2006Mediumchain). GPR84 is also expressed in brown adipose tissue, where it is associated with thermogenic regulation and mitochondrial activation, suggesting a role in energy expenditure and metabolic processes (Sun2023GPR84mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPR84 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammation and cancer. GPR84 is highly expressed in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), where it contributes to immunosuppression and tumor progression. In cancers such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high GPR84 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Targeting GPR84 in these contexts has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by reducing MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and promoting CD8+ T cell activity (Qin2023Overcoming).

In inflammatory diseases, GPR84 is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli and is involved in enhancing inflammatory responses in macrophages. This receptor is activated by medium-chain fatty acids and plays a role in conditions like atherosclerosis and diabetes, where its expression is elevated in affected tissues. GPR84 activation leads to increased cytokine secretion and immune cell migration, contributing to the progression of these diseases (Recio2018Activation).

Despite its role in promoting inflammation, GPR84 does not induce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in microglia, suggesting a complex role in immune regulation (Wei2017Agonists). These findings highlight GPR84 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
GPR84, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with the Gi protein in a canonical manner similar to other Gi-coupled GPCRs. The major interaction site is the C-terminal α-helix, α5, of Gαi, where specific residues such as I344, L348, L353, and F354 form hydrophobic interactions with residues I122, I201, V205, and V317 of GPR84. R118 of GPR84 mediates a hydrogen-bonding network with Y198 and Y370 of GPR84 and the main-chain carbonyl of C351 of Gαi. Q376 in helix 8 of GPR84 forms hydrogen bonds with K349 and D350 of Gi. The Gβ subunit of Gi also interacts with GPR84, with D312 of Gβ forming salt bridges with K50 and R387 from ICL1 and helix 8 of GPR84, and K386 from helix 8 forming a cation-π interaction with F292 of Gβ (Zhang2023Prophagocytic).

GPR84 is activated by medium-chain fatty acids and synthetic agonists like 6-OAU, which enhance macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells. The receptor's interaction with the anti-CD47 antibody disrupts the CD47-Sirpa binding, facilitating cancer cell phagocytosis (Zhang2023Prophagocytic). The receptor's activation involves interactions with G proteins, specifically Gαi and Gβ, which are crucial for receptor activation and signal transduction (Zhang2023Prophagocytic).
