# SEMA3E

## Overview
SEMA3E is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3E, a member of the semaphorin family, which is known for its role in axonal guidance and cellular signaling. Semaphorin 3E is a secreted protein that primarily interacts with the receptor Plexin-D1, distinguishing itself from other class 3 semaphorins by not requiring neuropilins for receptor binding (Gu2013The; Klagsbrun2010Semaphorin). This protein is involved in critical biological processes, including angiogenesis and neural development, where it functions as a guidance cue for axons and an inhibitor of blood vessel formation (Jongbloets2014Semaphorin; Sakurai2010Semaphorin). The SEMA3E-Plexin-D1 signaling pathway is also implicated in cancer progression, influencing tumor invasiveness and metastasis (Casazza2010Sema3E–Plexin). Additionally, mutations in the SEMA3E gene have been associated with congenital disorders, highlighting its importance in developmental biology (Masuda2015Congenital).

## Structure
SEMA3E, a member of the semaphorin family, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of SEMA3E consists of a sema domain, a PSI (plexin-semaphorin-integrin) domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, and a basic C-terminal tail (Jongbloets2014Semaphorin; Oh2013The). The sema domain is crucial for the protein's function, facilitating homodimerization and interactions with its receptor, Plexin-D1 (Jongbloets2014Semaphorin; Oh2013The).

The secondary structure of SEMA3E includes beta sheets and alpha helices, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact form, essential for its biological activity. SEMA3E can form a heterodimer complex with Plexin-D1, which undergoes conformational changes to transmit signals (Oh2013The).

Post-translational modifications of SEMA3E may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and interactions. SEMA3E is unique among class 3 semaphorins as it binds directly to Plexin-D1 without the involvement of neuropilins, highlighting its distinct functional mechanism (Gu2013The; Klagsbrun2010Semaphorin).

## Function
Semaphorin 3E (SEMA3E) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes, particularly in angiogenesis and neural development. In the context of angiogenesis, SEMA3E acts as a potent inhibitor by interacting with its receptor, plexin D1, on endothelial cells. This interaction leads to the inactivation of R-Ras and activation of Arf6, which disrupts integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM), causing endothelial cells to retract and inhibiting new blood vessel formation (Sakurai2010Semaphorin). SEMA3E also modulates the VEGF-induced Dll4-Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for determining the fate of endothelial cells during vascular development (Kim2011Semaphorin).

In neural development, SEMA3E is involved in axonal guidance, where it provides repulsive cues to prevent axons from entering inappropriate regions. This function is mediated through its interaction with plexin D1 and is modulated by co-receptors such as VEGFR2, which can alter the response from repulsion to attraction in certain neuronal contexts (Jongbloets2014Semaphorin). These activities highlight SEMA3E's critical role in maintaining proper vascular and neural patterning during development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEMA3E gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and congenital disorders. In cancer, high levels of SEMA3E expression are associated with increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis, notably in colon cancer, liver metastasis, melanoma, and breast cancer. The SEMA3E-Plexin-D1 signaling pathway promotes tumor cell survival and metastasis, and its suppression can induce apoptosis and reduce metastatic spread (Alamri2017View; Casazza2010Sema3E–Plexin). The prometastatic activity of SEMA3E is mediated through the transactivation of the Plexin D1-associated ErbB2 receptor, which is crucial for cancer cell migration and metastasis (Casazza2010Sema3E–Plexin).

In congenital disorders, SEMA3E has been linked to CHARGE syndrome, a condition characterized by a range of developmental anomalies. DNA sequence analyses have identified mutations in semaphorin genes, including SEMA3E, as contributing factors to these conditions (Masuda2015Congenital). Additionally, SEMA3E mutations can lead to developmental defects in axonal growth, resulting in behavioral deficits such as reduced anxiety levels and impaired working memory (Chauvet2007Gating).

## Interactions
SEMA3E interacts primarily with the receptor Plexin D1, forming a high-affinity complex that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. This interaction is central to SEMA3E's function in inhibiting angiogenesis and regulating cell migration. SEMA3E-Plexin D1 signaling can lead to the inactivation of R-Ras, affecting integrin function and causing cytoskeletal collapse, which reduces cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (Sakurai2010Semaphorin).

In the context of cancer, SEMA3E-Plexin D1 signaling is implicated in promoting cancer cell invasiveness and metastatic progression. This interaction is particularly significant in highly invasive and metastatic melanomas, where SEMA3E expression is elevated (Casazza2010Sema3E–Plexin).

SEMA3E also interacts with small GTPases such as Rac1 and RhoJ. It inhibits Rac1 activation, which suppresses JNK phosphorylation and down-regulates DLL4 expression, impacting endothelial cell motility and cytoskeleton dynamics (Zhou2019Sema3EPlexinD1). The activation of RhoJ by SEMA3E is mediated through the release of the RhoGEF Tuba from Plexin D1, which is essential for regulating cellular structures like filopodia and lamellipodia (Zhou2019Sema3EPlexinD1).
