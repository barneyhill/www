# SYT6

## Overview
SYT6 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 6, a member of the synaptotagmin family known for its role as a calcium sensor in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Synaptotagmin 6 is particularly involved in the activity-dependent release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at postsynaptic sites, playing a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. Unlike other synaptotagmin isoforms, synaptotagmin 6 specifically regulates the exocytosis of endocytosed BDNF-containing endosomes, rather than endogenously synthesized BDNF, highlighting its unique function in neuronal signaling pathways (Wong2015Activitydependent). The protein is localized in both axons and dendrites, with a more pronounced presence in axons, and is involved in calcium-dependent membrane fusion processes essential for synaptic modulation (Dean2012Axonal).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 6 (SYT6) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which functions as a calcium sensor involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. SYT6 plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity by facilitating the activity-dependent release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurons. This process is essential for synaptic modulation and plasticity, impacting neuronal survival and development (Wolfes2020The; Wong2015Activitydependent).

SYT6 is specifically involved in the exocytosis of endocytosed BDNF-containing endosomes at postsynaptic sites. It acts as a positive regulator of calcium-dependent membrane fusion, promoting the secretion of BDNF in response to neuronal activity, such as theta-burst stimulation (Wong2015Activitydependent). Unlike other synaptotagmin isoforms, SYT6 does not regulate the release of endogenously synthesized BDNF, highlighting its specific role in the release of endosomal BDNF (Wong2015Activitydependent).

In terms of cellular localization, SYT6 is found in both axons and dendrites, with a more pronounced effect in axons. It is present in a punctate pattern in dendrites, where it undergoes changes in fluorescence upon depolarization, suggesting its involvement in synaptic vesicle dynamics (Dean2012Axonal).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 6 (SYT6) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in regulating neurotransmitter release and membrane trafficking. SYT6 is known to bind the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2, which is important for its role in endocytosis (Wolfes2020The). It can also dimerize with other synaptotagmin isoforms, including Syt3, Syt5, Syt7, and Syt10, although the functional consequences of these dimerizations and whether they occur in vivo remain unclear (Wolfes2020The).

SYT6 plays a significant role in the activity-dependent release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via endocytic pathways in neurons. It acts as a specific calcium sensor for activity-induced BDNF secretion at postsynaptic dendritic sites, interacting with calcium and SNARE-mediated fusion mechanisms (Wong2015Activitydependent). The interaction with complexin (Cpx) is also notable, as down-regulation of Cpx reduces stimulation-induced secretion of BDNF, indicating that SYT6 and Cpx work together to facilitate the exocytosis of BDNF-containing endosomes in response to neuronal activity (Wong2015Activitydependent). These interactions highlight the critical role of SYT6 in synaptic modulation and BDNF signaling.
