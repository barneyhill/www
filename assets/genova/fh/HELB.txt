# HELB

## Overview
The HELB gene encodes the DNA helicase B protein, a member of the superfamily 1 helicases, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and repair processes. DNA helicase B is characterized by its central helicase domain, which includes conserved motifs essential for ATP hydrolysis, and is involved in the regulation of DNA end resection, a critical step in homologous recombination repair (Taneja2002A; Gu2004Cell). The protein's function is modulated by its interactions with replication protein A (RPA) and its subcellular localization, which is regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (Gu2004Cell; Tkáč2016HELB). HELB's activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysfunction has been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer susceptibility and reproductive traits (Osei2024Rare; Dicks2024Exome).

## Structure
The human DNA helicase B (HELB) protein is composed of 1087 amino acids and features a central helicase domain with seven conserved motifs characteristic of superfamily 1 helicases, including the Walker A and Walker B motifs essential for ATP hydrolysis (Taneja2002A; Gu2004Cell). The protein also contains an N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal domain with a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, which are regulated by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (Gerhardt2015Human; Gu2004Cell). 

HELB's tertiary structure is suggested by its ability to form discrete nuclear foci, particularly in response to DNA damage, indicating a role in DNA damage signaling or repair (Gu2004Cell). The C-terminal domain is crucial for cell cycle-dependent localization, with phosphorylation of serine 967 by CDKs influencing its subcellular distribution (Gu2004Cell). 

HELB interacts with replication protein A (RPA) through a conserved acidic motif, which is not necessary for helicase activity but may facilitate protein-protein interactions during the DNA damage response (Guler2012Human). The protein's subcellular localization is regulated by a functional nuclear export signal within the C-terminal domain (Gu2004Cell).

## Function
HELB (DNA helicase B) is a crucial protein involved in DNA replication and repair processes in human cells. It functions primarily as a feedback inhibitor of DNA end resection, a critical step in DNA repair, by limiting the activity of nucleases such as EXO1 and BLM-DNA2. HELB achieves this by translocating on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in the 5' to 3' direction, requiring interaction with replication protein A (RPA) for its activity (Tkáč2016HELB). 

HELB is active in the nucleus during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where it plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by inhibiting excessive DNA end resection. As cells transition to the S phase, HELB is exported to the cytoplasm, a process regulated by CDK2-dependent phosphorylation, which allows for increased resection activity necessary for DNA repair (Tkáč2016HELB). 

HELB's role in DNA replication includes interacting with DNA polymerase α-primase and stimulating RNA primer synthesis, which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. It also helps in the assembly of pre-replication complexes, facilitating the G1/S transition in the cell cycle (Taneja2002A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HELB gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In humans, non-synonymous mutations in HELB are associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group B, a disorder characterized by solar hypersensitivity and skin pigmentation abnormalities (NavalSánchez2020Selection). HELB's role in DNA repair processes is crucial, and its dysfunction can influence cancer susceptibility. Specifically, HELB has been identified as a novel susceptibility gene for non-mucinous, non-high-grade-serous epithelial ovarian cancer. Rare, loss-of-function variants in HELB are significantly associated with this cancer type, suggesting a potential link between HELB mutations and ovarian cancer risk (Dicks2024Exome).

The HELB gene also plays a role in reproductive traits. A rare SNP, rs75770066, resulting in a D506G substitution, affects HELB's interaction with replication protein A (RPA), impairing its function in DNA repair. This variant is associated with altered age at natural menopause, potentially impacting reproductive fitness and increasing the risk of genomic instability (Osei2024Rare). In BRCA1-deficient cells, loss of HELB leads to resistance to PARP inhibitors, a class of drugs used in cancer treatment, highlighting its significance in therapeutic contexts (Tkáč2016HELB).

## Interactions
HELB (DNA helicase B) is known for its interactions with replication protein A (RPA), a crucial protein complex involved in DNA replication and repair. HELB binds to the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and interacts with RPA, particularly the N-terminal domain of the RPA70 subunit (RPA70N). This interaction is essential for HELB's recruitment to sites of DNA damage and its role in inhibiting DNA end resection, a critical step in homologous recombination repair (Guler2012Human; Tkáč2016HELB).

HELB's interaction with RPA is mediated by a conserved acidic motif within its helicase domain, which includes residues E499, D506, and D510. These residues interact with the basic cleft of RPA70N, facilitating HELB's localization to chromatin and its function in DNA repair processes (Osei2024Rare). A rare SNP resulting in a D506G substitution in HELB disrupts this interaction, impairing its recruitment to DNA damage sites and affecting its ability to regulate homologous recombination (Osei2024Rare).

HELB also interacts with other RPA-interacting proteins and CDK complexes, although these interactions are independent of its catalytic activity (Tkáč2016HELB). These interactions highlight HELB's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic integrity through its involvement in DNA repair and replication stress response.
