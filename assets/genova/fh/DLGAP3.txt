# DLGAP3

## Overview
DLGAP3, also known as SAPAP3, is a gene that encodes the DLG associated protein 3, a scaffold protein predominantly expressed in the brain. This protein is a critical component of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in neurons, where it plays a vital role in synaptic signaling and plasticity. DLG associated protein 3 interacts with various other proteins, including DLG4, SHANK, and Homer, to regulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors such as NMDA and AMPA receptors. These interactions are essential for maintaining synaptic homeostasis and facilitating synaptic scaling, a process that adjusts synaptic strength in response to neuronal activity changes. The protein's involvement in synaptic function has been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia, as well as potential roles in tumorigenesis in colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (Rasmussen2017The; Choi2017Intratumoral; Hu2020Multiple).

## Structure
DLGAP3, also known as SAPAP3, is a protein encoded by the DLGAP3 gene in humans. It is part of the DLGAP family, which includes proteins with several characterized domains that facilitate interactions within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. DLGAP3 contains three primary domains: a 14-amino acid repeat domain, a dynein light chain (DLC) domain, and a GKAP homology (GH1) domain (Rasmussen2017The).

The 14-amino acid repeat domain allows DLGAP proteins to bind the GK domain of DLG1, DLG2, and DLG4, which are membrane-associated guanylate kinases involved in synaptic scaling (Rasmussen2017The). The DLC domain, located downstream of the repeats, interacts directly with the dynein light chain, a motor protein subunit found in dendrites and the PSD (Rasmussen2017The). The GH1 domain, found at the C-terminal, is composed of four alpha helices and shows high sequence homology among DLGAP proteins, although its specific role remains unknown (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP3 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions with other proteins (Rasmussen2017The). The protein is involved in synaptic scaling and interacts with other scaffold proteins like SHANK and Homer, contributing to the regulation of neurotransmitter receptors (Rasmussen2017The).

## Function
DLGAP3, also known as SAPAP3, is a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic signaling and plasticity within the brain. It is a crucial component of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in neurons, where it functions as a scaffold protein. This role involves facilitating interactions with glutamate receptors, which are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Rasmussen2017The). DLGAP3 interacts with other PSD proteins such as DLG4, SHANK, and Homer, forming complexes that regulate the activity of NMDA and AMPA receptors at the synapse (Rasmussen2017The).

In healthy cells, DLGAP3 is involved in synaptic scaling, a process that adjusts synaptic strength in response to changes in neuronal activity. This involves the modulation of neurotransmitter receptors, including AMPA and NMDA receptors, to maintain synaptic homeostasis (Rasmussen2017The). DLGAP3 also plays a role in endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression, where it regulates synaptic plasticity by inhibiting mGluR-mediated endocannabinoid signaling (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP3 is expressed at high levels in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, and is primarily localized in dendrites and postsynaptic sites of excitatory synapses (Rasmussen2017The). Its activity is crucial for maintaining synaptic function and has been linked to various psychiatric and neurological disorders (Rasmussen2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLGAP3 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. DLGAP3 is associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and trichotillomania, a hair-pulling disorder. In Dlgap3 knockout mice, increased self-grooming behavior leading to lesions, indicative of OCD-like symptoms, has been observed. These mice also show increased anxiety-like behavior, characteristic of OCD (Rasmussen2017The). Genetic studies have identified multiple and rare missense mutations in the DLGAP3 gene in patients with OCD and trichotillomania, suggesting a potential genetic susceptibility to these disorders (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP3 has also been linked to schizophrenia. Several rare missense mutations in the DLGAP3 gene, such as H22N, G352E, and S455R, have been identified in patients with schizophrenia. These mutations are absent in healthy controls, indicating their rarity and potential pathogenicity. The mutations may affect the posttranslational modification of the DLGAP3 protein and its interaction with kinases in the postsynaptic density, potentially impacting synaptic plasticity (Hu2020Multiple).

In colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability, DLGAP3 has been found to harbor frameshift mutations, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis through inactivation (Choi2017Intratumoral).

## Interactions
DLGAP3, also known as SAPAP3, is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. It interacts with several key proteins involved in synaptic signaling. DLGAP3 is part of the DLGAP protein family, which interacts with DLG4, SHANK, and Homer proteins. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of NMDA and AMPA receptors, as well as group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (Rasmussen2017The). DLGAP3 specifically is involved in endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic depression, and its absence in knockout mice leads to increased endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic depression in the striatum (Rasmussen2017The).

DLGAP3 binds to the GK domain of DLG proteins, such as DLG1, DLG2, and DLG4, through a 14-amino acid repeat domain. It also interacts with the SHANK family of proteins, which are important for PSD maturation. SHANK proteins link ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors through interactions with other scaffold proteins (Rasmussen2017The). Although DLGAP3 does not directly interact with Homer proteins, it connects to them through SHANK proteins, facilitating interactions with group I mGluRs (Rasmussen2017The). These interactions highlight DLGAP3's role in maintaining synaptic function and its involvement in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
