# CRHR2

## Overview
The CRHR2 gene encodes the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically within the class B subfamily. This receptor is integral to the body's response to stress, mediating the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides, such as urocortin, on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CRHR2 is expressed in both central and peripheral tissues, including the brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a crucial role in modulating stress-related behaviors, cardiovascular function, and energy homeostasis (Hillhouse2006The). The receptor's function is further diversified by its splice variants, which exhibit distinct tissue distributions and physiological roles. Research has linked CRHR2 to various psychiatric and physiological conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in stress-related disorders and cardiovascular diseases (Coste2000Abnormal; Bale2000Mice).

## Structure
CRHR2, a corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the stress response. It belongs to the class B family of GPCRs, which are characterized by their ability to bind polypeptide hormones (Sukhareva2021The). The primary structure of CRHR2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are typical of GPCRs (Flaherty2023Chronic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a transmembrane domain. CRHR2 may also form dimers or higher-order oligomers, indicating a quaternary structure.

CRHR2 has specific domains, including an extracellular N-terminal domain crucial for ligand binding (Sukhareva2021The). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation can affect its function. The receptor has three splice variants in humans: CRHR2α, CRHR2β, and CRHR2γ, each with different tissue distributions. CRHR2α is prevalent in the brain, CRHR2β in peripheral tissues, and CRHR2γ in specific brain regions like the septum and hippocampus (Sukhareva2021The). These splice variants contribute to tissue-specific differences in ligand binding and receptor function.

## Function
CRHR2 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in the stress response and various physiological processes. It is involved in the binding and signaling of urocortin, a peptide related to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. CRHR2 is expressed in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the brain, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, where it modulates stress-related behaviors, cardiovascular function, and energy homeostasis (Hillhouse2006The).

CRHR2 mediates the endocytosis and signaling of urocortin through a non-clathrin, non-caveolae mechanism, leading to the production of cAMP, a second messenger involved in various signaling pathways (Tu2007CorticotropinReleasing). The receptor's activity is linked to physiological responses such as stress adaptation, appetite regulation, and cardiovascular function. CRHR2 also influences glucose transporter expression in placental cells, where it generally acts to suppress the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3, indicating its role in metabolic regulation (Gao2012Differential). The receptor's diverse functions are attributed to its distinct splicing variants and tissue-specific expression patterns (Hillhouse2006The).

## Clinical Significance
The CRHR2 gene, encoding the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, has been implicated in various psychiatric and physiological conditions. Alterations in CRHR2 expression or mutations can influence anxiety and depression-related phenotypes. Studies on mice deficient in CRHR2 have shown increased anxiety-like behavior and heightened sensitivity to stress, suggesting a role in anxiety disorders (Bale2000Mice). In humans, certain CRHR2 variants have been associated with personality traits and behaviors, such as openness and the severity of suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder, although findings are mixed and sometimes contradictory (Binder2009The).

CRHR2 is also involved in cardiovascular function. Mice lacking CRHR2 exhibit elevated blood pressure and impaired cardiovascular responses to stress, indicating its role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis (Coste2000Abnormal). Despite its potential involvement in panic disorder, studies have not found significant associations between CRHR2 polymorphisms and the disorder, suggesting that while CRHR2 may influence stress response, it does not directly confer susceptibility to panic disorder (Tharmalingam2006Lack).

In the context of major depression, CRHR2 has been studied for genetic associations, with some SNPs showing borderline significance, though results have not been consistently replicated (Villafuerte2002Gene‐based). These findings highlight the complex role of CRHR2 in stress-related disorders and cardiovascular regulation.

## Interactions
CRHR2, or corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing its signaling pathways and functions. One significant interaction is with the corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein (CRF-BP), which acts as an escort protein for CRHR2, specifically the CRF 2α receptor isoform. CRF-BP facilitates the presence of CRF 2α R on the cell surface by forming a protein complex with it, but not with the CRF 2β R isoform. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain of CRF 2α R and is crucial for its trafficking to the plasma membrane (Slater2016CRF).

CRHR2 also interacts with its specific agonist, Urocortin 2 (Ucn2), which can lead to receptor internalization and affect downstream signaling pathways. This interaction is involved in modulating the expression of anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides and influences energy homeostasis and stress responses (AlcántaraAlonso2023CRHR2).

In the context of colorectal cancer, CRHR2 activation by Ucn2 has been shown to disrupt inflammatory signals and suppress oncogenic processes, indicating a potential therapeutic role for CRHR2/Ucn2 signaling in cancer treatment (Baritaki2019Chronic).
