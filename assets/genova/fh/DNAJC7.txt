# DNAJC7

## Overview
DNAJC7 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C7, which functions as a co-chaperone involved in protein folding and stabilization. This protein is characterized by its J-domain and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate interactions with Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing aggregation, particularly of tau proteins (Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Joachimiak2021DnaJC7). DNAJC7 is highly expressed in the brain and is implicated in the regulation of protein aggregation, with significant relevance to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Farhan2019Exome; Perez2023DnaJC7). The protein's ability to bind and stabilize tau proteins, preventing their aggregation into amyloid fibrils, underscores its potential protective role against neurodegenerative processes (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7). Mutations in the DNAJC7 gene have been associated with ALS, highlighting its clinical significance in the pathogenesis of this disorder (Farhan2019Exome).

## Structure
DNAJC7, also known as DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C7, is a co-chaperone protein characterized by its J-domain and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. The J-domain, approximately 70 amino acids long, is crucial for binding to Hsp70 proteins and contains a conserved histidine, proline, and aspartic acid (HPD) motif essential for its interaction with Hsp70 (Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Farhan2019Exome). DNAJC7 features three TPR domains: TPR1, TPR2a, and TPR2b, which facilitate interactions with Hsp90 and are involved in substrate binding and transfer (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7; Perez2023DnaJC7).

The TPR2b domain is particularly important for binding to tau protein, inhibiting amyloid formation by recognizing specific structural elements in tau (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7). DNAJC7's structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its secondary and tertiary structures, although specific details on these structures are not extensively documented in the provided context. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its function (Farhan2019Exome). DNAJC7 also has multiple splice variants, which can affect its functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Farhan2019Exome).

## Function
DNAJC7, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40), functions as a co-chaperone that plays a critical role in protein folding and stabilization within cells. It primarily operates by interacting with Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones to facilitate the folding and refolding of proteins, ensuring proper protein homeostasis and preventing aggregation, particularly of tau proteins (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7; Perez2023DnaJC7). DNAJC7 is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating protein aggregation, especially concerning the microtubule-associated protein tau. It binds preferentially to natively folded wild-type tau, inhibiting its aggregation into amyloid fibrils, which are linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7).

The protein uses its TPR2b domain to interact with specific sequences in tau, stabilizing its native conformation and preventing pathogenic seed formation (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7). DNAJC7 also plays roles in the maturation of glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors and in regulating gene activation by retaining the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) transcription factor in the cytosol (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7). In healthy human cells, DNAJC7 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by preventing the pathological aggregation of tau, thereby potentially protecting against neurodegenerative diseases (Perez2023DnaJC7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAJC7 gene have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons. Studies have identified several rare protein-truncating variants in DNAJC7 among ALS patients, suggesting that these mutations may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis through a loss-of-function mechanism (Farhan2019Exome). These variants are exceedingly rare or absent in the general population, indicating a strong association with ALS (Dilliott2022DnaJC7).

Research has also highlighted the ethnic heterogeneity in ALS-related genes, with certain DNAJC7 mutations being identified in specific populations. For instance, a novel variant, c.712A>G (p.R238G), was discovered in a sporadic ALS patient from Mainland China, suggesting that DNAJC7 mutations may contribute to ALS in the Chinese population (Wang2020A).

The DNAJC7 gene encodes a molecular chaperone involved in protein quality control, interacting with Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones. Disruptions in these interactions can affect protein folding and homeostasis, potentially leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases like ALS (Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Farhan2019Exome).

## Interactions
DNAJC7, also known as Tpr2 or CCRP, is a conserved J protein that interacts with several molecular chaperone systems, including Hsp70 and Hsp90. It physically interacts with Hsp70s such as HSPA2, HSPA4, and HSPA8, and Hsp90s like HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1. These interactions are mediated by DNAJC7's conserved J-domain, which stimulates the ATPase function of Hsp70s, facilitating stable polypeptide binding and protein folding. The TPR domains of DNAJC7 may stabilize these interactions (Dilliott2022DnaJC7).

DNAJC7 also plays a role in modulating the flow of substrates from Hsp70 to Hsp90, providing a control mechanism for proteins such as glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors. It has retention and co-activating capabilities with the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR), indicating a role in CAR-mediated gene activation (Dilliott2022DnaJC7).

In the context of tau protein interactions, DNAJC7 binds to natively folded structural elements in tau to inhibit amyloid formation. It interacts with tau through its TPR2b domain, showing a preference for binding to wild-type tau over aggregation-prone mutants like P301L tauRD. This binding helps prevent tau aggregation, a process linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Joachimiak2021DnaJC7; Perez2023DnaJC7).
