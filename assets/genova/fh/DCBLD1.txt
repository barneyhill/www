# DCBLD1

## Overview
DCBLD1 is a gene that encodes the protein discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in angiogenesis and cancer progression. The protein is characterized by its signal sequence and domains, including CUB, LCCL, and Discoidin, which contribute to its role in protein interactions and cellular signaling. DCBLD1 functions as a co-receptor in the VEGF signaling pathway, enhancing VEGFR-2 recycling and promoting endothelial cell activities such as proliferation and migration. It is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Fu2022DCBLD1; Feng2023DCBLD1; Cardin2021DCBLD1).

## Structure
The DCBLD1 protein is a highly conserved protein across vertebrates, consisting of 715 amino acids in humans. It features a signal sequence followed by CUB, LCCL, and Coagulation Factor V/VIII type-C (Discoidin) domains. The protein has a single-pass transmembrane region leading to an intracellular C-terminal scaffolding domain. Although the intracellular region lacks modular domains, it contains several phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation sites, as well as SH2 domain-binding motifs (Schmoker2019The).

The CUB domain, approximately 110 amino acids long, is involved in protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions and may prevent binding of extracellular interactors before cleavage. The LCCL domain, around 100 amino acids, is thought to contribute to structural integrity and immune function. The Discoidin domain, about 150 amino acids, is involved in focal adhesion dynamics and extracellular matrix degradation, although it is not conserved in rodent DCBLD1, suggesting possible functional compensation by other proteins (Schmoker2019The).

DCBLD1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation, with numerous phosphorylation sites identified. Lactylation, a novel post-translational modification, stabilizes DCBLD1 expression, with a predominant lactylation site at K172 (Meng2024Lactylation). Several splice variants of DCBLD1 exist, which may have functional implications (Schmoker2019The).

## Function
The DCBLD1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating angiogenesis, particularly in endothelial cells (ECs). It is involved in the regulation of VEGFR-2 endocytosis, a key receptor in the VEGF signaling pathway, which is crucial for EC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis (Feng2023DCBLD1). DCBLD1 acts as a co-receptor for VEGFR-2, promoting VEGF-induced signal transduction by limiting the dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and lysosomal degradation of VEGFR-2, thereby enhancing its recycling back to the cell membrane (Feng2023DCBLD1).

In healthy human cells, DCBLD1 is expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for maintaining proper VEGF signal transduction and angiogenic activities. It influences cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to VEGF (Feng2023DCBLD1). The protein is localized on the cell membrane, with higher expression levels in proliferating endothelial cells compared to growth-arrested ones (Feng2023DCBLD1). DCBLD1's structure resembles that of Neuropilins, which act as co-receptors for growth factors in angiogenesis, suggesting a similar role in facilitating growth factor signaling (Feng2023DCBLD1).

## Clinical Significance
The DCBLD1 gene is implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression levels linked to disease progression and prognosis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invasive breast carcinoma, high DCBLD1 expression is associated with worse overall survival and is linked to the upregulation of the integrin signaling pathway, which is involved in cell migration and poor prognosis (Cardin2021DCBLD1). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), DCBLD1 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-specific survival (Fu2022DCBLD1). 

In lung adenocarcinoma, DCBLD1 is overexpressed and negatively associated with survival, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Yang2018Positional). The SNP rs17079281 in the promoter region of DCBLD1 affects lung cancer risk by altering gene expression, with the T allele associated with reduced expression and lower cancer risk (Wang2020SNP). In cervical cancer, DCBLD1 promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and growth, with its expression activating the pentose phosphate pathway, crucial for cancer cell metabolism (Meng2024Lactylation). These findings highlight DCBLD1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
DCBLD1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the CRKL-SH2 domain, a process facilitated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within YxxP motifs. This interaction is essential for the binding of the signaling adaptor CRKL, and the phosphorylation is primarily driven by the kinases Fyn and Abl. Abl, in particular, has a more pronounced effect on DCBLD1 compared to its paralog DCBLD2 (Schmoker2017Dynamic).

DCBLD1 also plays a role in angiogenesis by interacting with VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells. It acts as a co-receptor, influencing VEGFR-2 endocytosis and promoting VEGF-induced angiogenesis. DCBLD1 knockdown leads to increased dephosphorylation and ubiquitination of VEGFR-2, enhancing its degradation and weakening the VEGF signaling pathway (Feng2023DCBLD1).

In cancer, DCBLD1 is associated with the integrin signaling pathway and focal adhesions, potentially playing an oncogenic role by activating pathways crucial for cell migration and tumor metastasis (Cardin2021DCBLD1). These interactions highlight DCBLD1's significant role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
