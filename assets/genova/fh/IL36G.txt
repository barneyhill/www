# IL36G

## Overview
IL36G is a gene that encodes the protein interleukin 36 gamma (IL-36γ), a member of the interleukin-1 cytokine family. This cytokine is primarily involved in mediating inflammatory responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis. IL-36γ is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes in the skin, and plays a crucial role in immune defense mechanisms, particularly against microbial infections. It functions by binding to the IL-36 receptor, which activates downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The protein is implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where it contributes to disease pathogenesis through its pro-inflammatory activities (Keller2024Molecular; Gabay2015Regulation; Han2020IL36).

## Structure


## Function
IL36G, or interleukin 36 gamma, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in immune defense and tissue homeostasis. It is prominently expressed in epithelial cells, such as those in the skin, and in dendritic cells. IL-36γ is involved in protective immune responses, particularly against microbial infections. For instance, it is induced during Candida albicans infection in human keratinocytes, suggesting a protective role against skin infections (Han2020IL36). During viral infections, IL-36γ is crucial for alveolar macrophage survival, which helps protect against lethal influenza challenges (Han2020IL36).

IL-36γ signals through the IL-36 receptor, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways in a MyD88-dependent manner, leading to pro-inflammatory responses (Han2020IL36). It also plays a role in the recruitment of neutrophils, aiding in tissue repair during inflammatory bowel disease and experimental colitis (Han2020IL36). In the skin, IL-36γ acts on keratinocytes and immune cells to induce inflammation and is implicated in psoriatic disorders (Gabay2015Regulation). The cytokine is synthesized without a signal peptide, and its release mechanism from cells is unclear, though post-translational processing is necessary for its activity (Gabay2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL36G gene, which encodes interleukin 36 gamma, have been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In psoriasis, IL36G expression is significantly upregulated in lesional skin, correlating with disease severity and activity. This cytokine is involved in the inflammatory response, interacting with the IL-23/Th17 axis, which is crucial in psoriasis pathogenesis (Traks2019Polymorphisms; Elias2021IL36). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL36G gene, such as rs7584409, have been associated with both protective effects against psoriasis and increased disease severity, including psoriatic arthritis (Moreira2022IL36G).

IL36G is also implicated in other inflammatory diseases. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), elevated IL-36γ levels correlate with disease activity, suggesting a role in promoting inflammatory cytokine production (Yuan2019Biology). In rheumatoid arthritis, IL-36γ is elevated in synovial tissues, indicating its involvement in joint inflammation (Swindell2018RNASeq). The dysregulation of IL-36γ contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Elias2021IL36; Buhl2019Interleukin36).

## Interactions
IL36G, or interleukin 36 gamma, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to mediate inflammatory responses. It binds to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R), also known as IL1RL2, and requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAcP) for effective signaling. This interaction activates downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, which are crucial for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Keller2024Molecular; Swindell2018RNASeq).

IL36G is also involved in a positive feedback loop where its expression is induced by cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-17A, which enhance its own production and that of other IL-36 family members (Carrier2011Inter-Regulation; Keller2024Molecular). The transcription factor KLF4 plays a significant role in regulating IL36G expression by binding to its promoter region, particularly in the context of EGFR/MEK pathway inhibition (Satoh2020IL36γ).

IL36G can be cleaved and activated by proteases such as neutrophil elastase and proteinase-3, which are essential for its full activity (Keller2024Molecular). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving IL36G in inflammatory and immune responses.
