# CCL19

## Overview
C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CC chemokine family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system by directing the migration of immune cells. The CCL19 protein is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the CCR7 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, facilitating the trafficking of dendritic cells and T cells to secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and the spleen. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses. Structurally, CCL19 is characterized by a sequence of 98 amino acids and features a conserved DCCL motif, which contributes to its stability and function. The protein functions as a monomer and is involved in various physiological processes, including the activation of integrins on lymphocytes and the enhancement of dendritic cell functions. CCL19's role extends to clinical significance, where it is implicated in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and atherosclerosis, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Yan2019CCL19; Vellanki2017Structural; Gowhari2021Does).

## Structure
The CCL19 protein is a member of the CC chemokine family and is characterized by a specific molecular structure that contributes to its function in immune cell trafficking. The primary structure of CCL19 consists of a sequence of 98 amino acids (Vellanki2017Structural). Its secondary structure includes three β-sheets and three α-helices, which are stabilized by two disulfide bridges between Cys29 and Cys55, and Cys30 and Cys71 (Vellanki2017Structural). These disulfide bridges are part of the hydrophobic core, contributing to the protein's stability.

The tertiary structure of CCL19 is further defined by the presence of a conserved DCCL motif (Asp, Cys, Cys, and Leu), which is a prominent structural feature of CC chemokine proteins. This motif aids in the formation of disulfide bridges, enhancing the protein's stability (Vellanki2017Structural). The 3D model of CCL19 was generated using homology modeling techniques, with a focus on optimizing the structure through energy minimization and evaluating its quality using tools like Ramachandran plots and ProSA energy plots (Vellanki2017Structural).

The CCL19 protein does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein's active site, crucial for binding interactions with the CCR7 receptor, includes N-terminal residues Gly22 to Leu31, which are important for its inflammatory activity (Vellanki2017Structural).

## Function
CCL19, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 19, is a chemokine that plays a significant role in the immune system by guiding the migration of immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells, to lymph nodes. It primarily interacts with the CCR7 receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, which is crucial for the trafficking of lymphocytes and DCs in secondary lymphoid tissues like lymph nodes and the spleen (Yan2019CCL19; Gowhari2021Does).

In healthy human cells, CCL19 is involved in the regulation of immune cell trafficking, which is essential for maintaining immune regulation and inflammatory responses. It is abundantly expressed in lymphoid organs such as the thymus and lymph nodes, where it performs physiological and homeostatic functions (Gowhari2021Does). CCL19 activates integrins on lymphocytes, promoting T-cell survival by protecting CD8+ T cells from apoptosis and maintaining naïve T-cell homeostasis (Gowhari2021Does).

CCL19 also enhances dendritic cell functions, such as endocytosis, co-stimulatory molecule expression, and cytokine production, while reducing DC apoptosis, thereby indirectly increasing T-cell proliferation and Th1 polarization (Gowhari2021Does). It activates the PI3K/GSK3/NF-κB pathway, inhibiting the pro-apoptotic transcription factor FoxO1 through CCR7-mediated Akt activation, which is crucial for the maturation of TLR-activated DCs and increases the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells (Gowhari2021Does).

## Clinical Significance
CCL19 plays a significant role in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, CCL19 exhibits a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter. It can suppress tumors by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses and inhibiting angiogenesis, but it can also promote tumor growth by supporting inflammation, cell growth, and metastasis (Gowhari2021Does). In gastric cancer, CCL19 expression is downregulated in progressive stages, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Gowhari2021Does). In triple-negative breast cancer, CCL19 contributes to a chronic inflammatory environment that supports tumor progression (Gowhari2021Does). 

CCL19 is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. In primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), elevated CCL19 expression is associated with increased immune cell activation and autoantibody production, indicating its role in disease pathogenesis (Liu2019Elevated). The CCL19/CCR7 axis is involved in immune cell migration and inflammation in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (Liu2019Elevated). 

In atherosclerosis, CCL19 is expressed in unstable atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting its role in plaque progression and instability (Akhavanpoor2014CCL19). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCL19 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CCL19 interacts primarily with the chemokine receptor CCR7, playing a crucial role in immune cell trafficking. This interaction is significant for the recruitment of naive T-cells to secondary lymphoid organs. CCL19 and CCL21 both activate CCR7, but CCL19 is noted for its higher potency in inducing CCR7 internalization and recruiting β-arrestin 2, which are critical for chemotactic signaling (Jørgensen2018CCL19).

The N-termini of PSGL-1 and CCR7 have overlapping binding sites on CCL19, suggesting competitive binding. This interaction is significant for the mechanism by which PSGL-1 enhances T-cell recruitment (Veldkamp2015Solution). NMR spectroscopy studies have shown that certain peptides derived from the CCR7 N-terminus bind to CCL19, with electrostatic interactions playing a key role in these bindings (Lewandowski2022Structural).

CCL19 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), although it lacks the extended C-terminus of CCL21, which is necessary for strong GAG binding. The transfer of the CCL21 C-terminus to CCL19 enhances its heparin binding through non-specific electrostatic interactions (Barmore2016Transferring). These interactions are crucial for its function in immune cell signaling and chemotaxis.
