# TAF15

## Overview
TAF15 is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15, a multifunctional RNA- and ssDNA-binding protein. This protein is a member of the FET protein family, which includes other notable RNA-binding proteins such as FUS and EWS. TAF15 is characterized by its modular domain organization, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a RanBP2 type zinc finger (ZnF) domain, which facilitate its interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. It plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, and microRNA processing, and is involved in maintaining genomic integrity. TAF15 is predominantly localized in the nucleus but also shuttles to the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. Clinically, TAF15 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Tang2023TAF15; Schatz2010Diagnostic; Tetter2023TAF15).

## Structure
TAF15 is a member of the FET protein family, characterized by a modular domain organization. It contains an N-terminal low-complexity domain (LCD) enriched in glycine, tyrosine, glutamine, and serine residues, which is involved in forming amyloid filaments in neurodegenerative diseases (Tetter2023TAF15). The central region of TAF15 includes an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which adopts a canonical fold with four anti-parallel β-strands and two α-helices arranged as an α/β sandwich (Kashyap2015Structural). This RRM is crucial for RNA binding, particularly with stem-loop RNA structures, and features a positively charged cleft formed by the α1-β2 loop (Kashyap2015Structural).

The C-terminal region of TAF15 includes a RanBP2 type zinc finger (ZnF) domain, which is involved in RNA binding and is a target for phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A at serine residue S375 (Feichtner2024Phosphorylation). TAF15 also contains RGG motif-rich segments flanking the RRM, contributing to its interactions with nucleic acids (Tetter2023TAF15). The protein's structure is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding networks, and its filamentous form is implicated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Tetter2023TAF15).

## Function
TAF15 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15) is a multifunctional RNA- and ssDNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is a member of the TET family, which includes other RNA-binding proteins such as FUS and EWS, and is involved in transcription, splicing, mRNA transport, microRNA processing, signaling, and maintenance of genomic integrity (Schatz2010Diagnostic). TAF15 is predominantly localized in the nucleus but also shuttles to the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Andersson2008The).

In healthy human cells, TAF15 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with RNA polymerase II and the TFIID complex, which are essential for transcription initiation (Law2006TLS). It also plays a role in mRNA stability and alternative splicing, particularly in neural cells, affecting the turnover of its RNA targets (Kapeli2016Distinct). TAF15 binds to specific RNA motifs, such as the GGUAAGU motif, which suggests a broader role in RNA processing (Kapeli2016Distinct).

TAF15 is also implicated in the cellular stress response, as it localizes to stress granules during environmental stress conditions, such as heat shock and oxidative stress, indicating a role in translational regulation during stress (Andersson2008The).

## Clinical Significance
TAF15 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15) has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TAF15 is associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In FTLD, TAF15 forms amyloid filaments, particularly in cases referred to as FTLD-FUS, where it was initially thought that the protein FUS was involved. These filaments are found in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, as well as the motor cortex and brainstem, suggesting a link to motor neuron pathology (Tetter2023TAF15). Although mutations in TAF15 have been identified in ALS, their pathogenicity remains unconfirmed, with some variants found in both patients and healthy controls (Kapeli2016Distinct; Ticozzi2011Mutational).

In cancer, TAF15 is significantly upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) and is associated with larger tumor size and higher pathological stages. Its overexpression promotes GC progression via the RAF1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, making it a potential molecular diagnostic marker or therapeutic target (Tang2023TAF15). TAF15's involvement in other cancers, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma, is also noted, where its overexpression correlates with worsened survival (Tang2023TAF15).

## Interactions
TAF15, a member of the FET protein family, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), creating a new chromatin-associated small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) distinct from the traditional U1-Sm snRNP. This interaction is crucial for recognizing and removing pre-messenger RNA introns, highlighting TAF15's role in RNA processing (Jobert2009Human). TAF15 is also associated with RNA polymerase II in transcription pre-initiation complexes and the U1 snRNP component of the spliceosome, playing a significant role in transcription and RNA processing (Kashyap2015Structural).

TAF15's RNA-binding properties are modulated by PKA phosphorylation, which affects its binding patterns and affinities to various RNA targets. This phosphorylation enhances TAF15's binding to exons and untranslated regions (UTRs) while reducing affinities to non-coding regions, indicating a regulatory role in RNA-protein interactions (Feichtner2024Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation occurs at the S375 site within the Zinc-finger domain, a conserved site across vertebrates, suggesting a functional role in RNA-protein interactions (Feichtner2024Phosphorylation).
