# SMIM38

## Overview
SMIM38 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 38, a microprotein characterized by its transmembrane properties. This protein is composed of 52 amino acids and is predicted to contain a central transmembrane helical region, which facilitates its integration into cellular membranes (Lafranchi2020Universal). The presence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motifs at the C-terminus suggests a specific localization within the cell, potentially influencing its functional role in membrane-related processes (Lafranchi2020Universal). Initially classified as a noncoding gene, SMIM38 was reclassified as protein-coding following proteomics analyses, underscoring its potential involvement in cellular functions such as signal transduction or cellular communication (Mudge2019Discovery). Despite its predicted roles, the precise biological functions of SMIM38 remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its contributions to cellular physiology and potential implications in human health (chauhan2021impact).

## Structure
SMIM38 is a microprotein composed of 52 amino acids and is predicted to have a transmembrane helix. The primary structure of SMIM38 includes a central transmembrane helical region, spanning amino acids 16 to 36, which is indicative of its role as a membrane protein (Lafranchi2020Universal). This transmembrane domain suggests that SMIM38 is likely to be embedded within cellular membranes, consistent with its classification as a small integral membrane protein. The protein is also predicted to have endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motifs at its C-terminus, which may play a role in its localization within the cell (Lafranchi2020Universal).

The secondary structure of SMIM38 is characterized by the presence of a transmembrane helix, a common feature in membrane proteins that facilitates their integration into lipid bilayers. The study confirmed that SMIM38 was exclusively found in the membrane fraction, supporting its predicted membrane localization (Lafranchi2020Universal). There is no detailed information available on the tertiary or quaternary structures of SMIM38, nor on any post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
SMIM38, or small integral membrane protein 38, is a microprotein that is associated with cellular membranes. It is a 52 amino acid protein with a predicted transmembrane helix, conserved across mammals, and is localized to the membrane fraction of cells, indicating its role as a membrane-associated microprotein (Lafranchi2020Universal). The protein is predicted to contain a central transmembrane helical region spanning amino acids 16 to 36, followed by predicted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention motifs, suggesting its involvement in membrane-related processes (Lafranchi2020Universal).

SMIM38 was initially considered a noncoding gene but was reclassified as protein-coding based on proteomics data, highlighting its potential functionality in cellular processes (Mudge2019Discovery). Although the specific molecular function of SMIM38 in cell biology remains uncharacterized, its membrane localization suggests a role in processes such as signal transduction or cellular communication. In the context of photobiomodulation, SMIM38 was identified as an up-regulated gene in lightly pigmented skin, indicating its involvement in processes related to protein synthesis, membrane integrity, and cell-cell interactions (chauhan2021impact). However, detailed functional studies are required to elucidate its precise role in healthy human cells.
