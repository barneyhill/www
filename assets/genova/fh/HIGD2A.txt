# HIGD2A

## Overview
HIGD2A is a gene that encodes the protein HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family member 2A, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function. This protein is primarily involved in the biogenesis and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (CIV), a critical component of the electron transport chain. HIGD2A functions as an assembly factor, facilitating the integration of CIV into supercomplexes and ensuring the proper assembly and stability of the respiratory complexes. It interacts with various mitochondrial proteins and subunits, such as COX1, COX4-1, and COX5B, and is essential for the maturation of the COX3 module. The protein's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and its role in diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma highlight its clinical significance (TimónGómez2020Distinct; Huang2023HIGD2A).

## Function
HIGD2A is a crucial factor in the biogenesis of mitochondrial respiratory complex IV (CIV) in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the assembly of the COX3 module, which is essential for forming the holo-CIV complex. HIGD2A interacts with various components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, including COX1, COX4-1, COX5A, COX5B, and COX6A1, as well as COX1-module assembly factors like CMC1, COA3, and MITRAC7 (TimónGómez2020Distinct). The protein is involved in the modular assembly of CIV by regulating the availability of key subunits until they are matured, ensuring proper assembly and function of the complex (TimónGómez2020Distinct).

HIGD2A also facilitates the integration of CIV into supercomplexes (SCs), such as SC I+III2+IV1, suggesting an alternative pathway for CIV biogenesis within the SC context (TimónGómez2020Distinct). The presence of HIGD2A in various complexes, including a 50-kDa complex, indicates its involvement in the assembly and stability of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes (TimónGómez2020Distinct). The QRRQ motif in HIGD2A is essential for its interaction with CIV and its role in CIV maturation, with mutations in this motif affecting the stability and function of CIV (TimónGómez2020Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
The HIGD2A gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions, rather than direct mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HIGD2A is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. Its elevated expression promotes cancer development by enhancing mitochondrial function and activating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Silencing HIGD2A in HCC cells reduces cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Huang2023HIGD2A).

HIGD2A is also significantly overexpressed in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and other cancers, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and uveal melanoma. High expression levels are associated with a downward trend in patient survival, although not always statistically significant (Salazar2020Biosystem).

In mitochondrial disorders, HIGD2A is crucial for the assembly of the COX3 module of mitochondrial complex IV. Alterations in HIGD2A expression can lead to complex IV deficiencies, as observed in a patient with multiple developmental and metabolic issues, where HIGD2A was the most upregulated mitochondrial protein in response to an isolated complex IV defect (Hock2020HIGD2A).

## Interactions
HIGD2A is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for mitochondrial function. It interacts with the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments where anti-HIG2A antibodies pulled down OPA1, indicating a physical interaction. This interaction suggests a role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in regulating cristae morphology and supercomplex assembly (Salazar2019The).

HIGD2A also plays a significant role in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (CIV), where it acts as an assembly factor. It interacts with the newly synthesized COX3 subunit, facilitating its incorporation into the holoenzyme. HIGD2A forms a complex with nucleus-encoded subunits COX4-1, COX5B, and COX6A1, which is essential for the assembly of the COX3 module and its integration into supercomplexes that include Complex I (CI) and Complex III (CIII2) (TimónGómez2020HIGDDriven).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, HIGD2A is implicated in mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative phosphorylation. Its depletion leads to changes in mitochondrial morphology and an increase in mitochondrial fusion-related proteins, such as MFN1 and OPA1, suggesting its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Huang2023HIGD2A).
