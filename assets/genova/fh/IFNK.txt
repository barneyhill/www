# IFNK

## Overview
The IFNK gene encodes interferon kappa (IFN-κ), a type I interferon protein primarily expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cells in the epidermis. As a cytokine, IFN-κ plays a pivotal role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense and immune modulation. It is involved in the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the regulation of cytokines and chemokines, which are crucial for initiating inflammatory responses in the skin. IFN-κ is essential for maintaining a basal level of interferon response, allowing for rapid activation upon infection. Its expression is regulated by transcription factors linked to keratinocyte biology and the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Clinically, alterations in IFNK expression are associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, where it contributes to disease pathogenesis and photosensitivity (Klein2020A; Hile2020The; Sarkar2018Photosensitivity).

## Function
The IFNK gene encodes the IFN-kappa protein, a type I interferon with antiviral and immune-modulating activities. It is constitutively expressed in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, and plays a crucial role in maintaining a basal interferon response in healthy skin (Klein2020A; Hile2020The). This basal expression allows for rapid induction of interferon signaling in response to infections, enabling keratinocytes to upregulate interferon responses in neighboring cells such as fibroblasts and dendritic cells (Hile2020The).

IFN-kappa is involved in the activation of various interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including pattern recognition receptors and components of interferon signaling pathways, supporting immediate reactions to infections (Klein2020A). It also regulates the production of cytokines like IL-6 and chemokines such as CXCL9 and CXCL10, which initiate inflammatory responses in the skin (Hile2020The). IFN-kappa plays a protective role against viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), by inducing SP100 proteins and modulating inflammatory infiltrates and IL-6 protein levels (Habiger2016Interferon; Hile2020The). The expression of IFN-kappa is regulated by an enhancer element that includes binding sites for transcription factors such as AP-2a/g, jun-B, SMAD3/4, and p63, indicating its involvement in keratinocyte biology and the TGF-beta signaling pathway (Klein2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IFNK gene, which encodes interferon kappa (IFN-κ), have been implicated in several autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Genetic polymorphisms in IFNK are associated with the pathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, with these variants potentially influencing type I interferon production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in affected skin, thereby increasing type I interferon activity in the circulation (Muskardin2018Type). IFN-κ is upregulated in CLE lesions and in keratinocytes from non-lesional SLE skin, contributing to the regulation of type I IFN responses and photosensitivity in lupus (Sarkar2018Photosensitivity).

Increased expression of IFN-κ in keratinocytes enhances responses to IFN-α and upregulates type I IFN-regulated gene expression in neighboring skin cells, contributing to CLE pathogenesis (Sarkar2018Photosensitivity). The overexpression of IFN-κ can induce autoimmune phenotypes in mice, and its expression is upregulated by UV light, a known trigger of CLE (Sarkar2018Photosensitivity). IFN-κ is also implicated in the photosensitivity observed in SLE, as chronic exposure to IFN-κ increases keratinocyte apoptosis after UVB exposure (Sarkar2018Photosensitivity). These findings suggest that IFN-κ plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CLE by amplifying basal IFN responses and promoting rapid responses to other type I IFNs.
