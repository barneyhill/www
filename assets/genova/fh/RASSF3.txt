# RASSF3

## Overview
RASSF3, or Ras association domain family member 3, is a gene located on chromosome 12q14.1 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. The RASSF3 protein is a member of the Ras association domain family and is characterized by the presence of a Ras-association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain, which facilitate interactions with Ras proteins and involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway, respectively (Richter2009The; van2007The). As a tumor suppressor, RASSF3 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by stabilizing the p53 protein, thereby preventing its degradation and promoting genomic stability (Kudo2012The; Volodko2014RASSF). The protein's expression is downregulated in several cancers, including lung, uterus, and colon tumors, highlighting its protective role against tumorigenesis (Kudo2012The). Despite its significant functions, the detailed molecular structure of RASSF3 remains to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The RASSF3 protein is encoded by the RASSF3 gene located on chromosome 12q14.1 and is known to produce three isoforms through alternative splicing: RASSF3A, RASSF3B, and RASSF3C. The most studied isoform, RASSF3A, consists of five exons and encodes a 238-amino acid protein. This isoform contains a Ras-association (RA) domain and a Salvador-RASSF-Hippo (SARAH) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and dimerization (Richter2009The; van2007The). The RA domain facilitates interactions with Ras proteins, while the SARAH domain is associated with the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting apoptosis (Richter2009The; Volodko2014RASSF).

RASSF3B and RASSF3C are shorter isoforms that lack the RA and SARAH domains, and their functional significance remains unclear (van2007The). RASSF3 shares approximately 60% homology with RASSF1 at the amino acid level, indicating a degree of structural similarity (Richter2009The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and has been shown to interact with MST1, although it cannot activate it (Zinatizadeh2019The). The exact molecular structure, including detailed secondary and tertiary structures, has not been fully characterized.

## Function
RASSF3 (Ras association domain family member 3) is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. In healthy human cells, RASSF3 functions as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing the p53 protein, a critical regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. RASSF3 achieves this by interacting with MDM2, an E3 ligase that targets p53 for degradation, thereby preventing p53's proteasomal degradation and maintaining its expression levels (Kudo2012The; Volodko2014RASSF).

RASSF3 is involved in inducing G1-S cell cycle arrest, a crucial checkpoint for DNA damage repair, which helps maintain genomic stability and prevent polyploidy, a condition associated with genomic instability (Kudo2012The). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is part of the Ras association domain family, which interacts with Ras-like GTPases, contributing to its role in tumor suppression and cellular regulation (Volodko2014RASSF).

RASSF3's expression is downregulated in various human cancers, including lung, uterus, and colon tumors, suggesting its protective role against tumorigenesis by regulating p53 activity and the cell cycle (Kudo2012The).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF3 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), RASSF3 expression is downregulated in a significant number of cases, although this is not attributed to DNA hypermethylation (Volodko2014RASSF). The loss of RASSF3 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced cell motility, contributing to more invasive and metastatic tumors (Donninger2016Ras). In breast cancer, RASSF3 expression is inversely correlated with HER2 protein levels, with lower expression in cell lines with high HER2 expression. This suggests a potential role in tumor resistance and a protective function against tumorigenesis (Chen1992Rassf3).

RASSF3 also plays a role in DNA repair, and its inactivation can lead to defects in DNA repair and increased genomic instability, which are critical factors in cancer development (Zinatizadeh2019The). Despite the presence of a CpG island in its promoter, RASSF3 promoter methylation is rarely detected in cancers, indicating that other mechanisms may be responsible for its downregulation (Volodko2014RASSF). The gene's expression is tumor-type specific, with variations observed across different cancer types (Chen1992Rassf3).

## Interactions
RASSF3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. One of its key interactions is with the p53 protein, where RASSF3-induced apoptosis and G1-S cell-cycle arrest are heavily dependent on the presence of functional p53. This interaction enhances p53 stabilization by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of MDM2, an E3 ligase that targets p53 for degradation (Kudo2012The). 

RASSF3 also interacts with MOAP1, which is known to activate Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, indicating that RASSF3-induced apoptosis partially depends on MOAP1 (Kudo2012The). Despite its interaction with MST1 and MST2 kinases, which are part of the Hippo pathway, RASSF3-induced apoptosis does not rely on this pathway (Kudo2012The).

In addition to these interactions, RASSF3 is involved in DNA repair processes. Its depletion leads to genomic instability and polyploidy, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic stability (Kudo2012The). These interactions highlight RASSF3's potential as a tumor suppressor through its complex network of protein interactions.
