# CFL2

## Overview
CFL2 is a gene that encodes the protein cofilin 2, a member of the actin depolymerization factor (ADF)/cofilin family, which is specifically expressed in muscle tissues. Cofilin 2 is a crucial actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, including severing and depolymerization, which are essential for muscle cell function and integrity (Papalouka2009Muscle). The protein is characterized by its unique structural features, such as an α/β domain fold and specific binding sites that facilitate its interaction with actin filaments (Kraus2022Magic; Yehl2017Structural). Mutations in the CFL2 gene have been linked to muscle disorders, including nemaline myopathy, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology and pathology (Agrawal2007Nemaline).

## Structure
Cofilin 2 (CFL2) is a muscle-tissue-specific isoform of the cofilin family, which plays a crucial role in actin filament severing and disassembly. The primary structure of CFL2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure of CFL2 is characterized by an α/β domain fold, consisting of five β-strands surrounded by six helices and loop regions (Kraus2022Magic). The tertiary structure of CFL2 forms a compact, globular shape, which is crucial for its interaction with actin filaments. This structure includes a unique network of hydrogen bonding interactions, particularly involving the α2 helix, which is rotated 30° compared to other cofilin isoforms due to a P26Q substitution (Kraus2022Magic).

CFL2 lacks a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate its activity and interaction with actin (Yehl2017Structural). The protein's interaction with actin involves specific binding sites, including the G/F-binding site and the F-binding site, which are crucial for its role in actin dynamics (Yehl2017Structural). The structural features of CFL2 contribute to its isoform-specific conformation and binding mode, distinguishing it from other cofilin isoforms (Kraus2022Magic).

## Function
Cofilin 2 (CFL2) is a muscle-specific isoform of the actin depolymerization factor (ADF)/cofilin family, playing a critical role in actin filament dynamics. In healthy human cells, CFL2 is involved in the severing and depolymerization of actin filaments, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of muscle cells (Papalouka2009Muscle). CFL2 preferentially binds to older actin filaments enriched in ADP-bound subunits, facilitating the recycling of aged actin filaments and promoting actin turnover (Yehl2017Structural).

CFL2 is predominantly localized between the Z-discs in muscle sarcomeres, where it regulates the length of actin filaments. It is more efficient at binding and disassembling ATP- or ADP-Pi-bound filaments compared to other cofilin isoforms, which is crucial for actin monomer exchange and length maintenance in sarcomeres (Kanellos2016Cellular). The interaction between CFL2 and muscle LIM protein (MLP) enhances F-actin depolymerization, a process modulated by pH and CFL2 phosphorylation (Papalouka2009Muscle).

CFL2's role in actin dynamics is vital for muscle development and maintenance, and its dysfunction can lead to muscle deficiencies and myopathies (Kanellos2016Cellular). The structural changes induced by CFL2 binding to actin filaments are crucial for its function in cellular processes such as cell motility and division (Galkin2011Remodeling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFL2 gene, which encodes the actin-binding protein cofilin-2, are associated with several muscle disorders, most notably nemaline myopathy. This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle fibers. A specific mutation, p.A35T, has been identified as a cause of nemaline myopathy with minicores, leading to reduced cofilin-2 stability and solubility, resulting in actin filament accumulation (Agrawal2007Nemaline). This mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and has been linked to early-onset muscle weakness and delayed motor milestones (Agrawal2007Nemaline).

Cofilin-2 deficiency also results in impaired muscle maintenance and regeneration. In cofilin-2 knockout mouse models, normal myofibrillar development is followed by progressive sarcomeric disruption and actin accumulation, leading to muscle weakness and early death (Agrawal2012Normal). The absence of cofilin-2 disrupts actin dynamics, which is crucial for muscle cell structure, and this disruption is implicated in both skeletal and cardiac myopathies (Papalouka2009Muscle).

Additionally, the p.A35T mutation in CFL2 causes a unique splicing defect, leading to reduced expression of functional cofilin-2 protein, further contributing to severe myopathy phenotypes (Rosen2020Knockin). These findings underscore the critical role of CFL2 in maintaining muscle integrity and highlight its clinical significance in muscle-related diseases.

## Interactions
Cofilin 2 (CFL2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in actin dynamics. One significant interaction is with Muscle LIM Protein (MLP), where MLP binds directly to CFL2 in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. This interaction is pH-sensitive and is enhanced by the phosphorylation of CFL2 at Ser3, which increases its binding affinity to MLP by approximately 40%. The MLP/CFL2 complex is involved in regulating F-actin depolymerization, a key process in actin dynamics, with the interaction being independent of calcium ion concentration changes (Papalouka2009Muscle).

CFL2 also interacts with filamentous actin (F-actin), where it binds in a nucleotide-state dependent manner, preferentially associating with older filaments enriched in ADP-bound subunits. This interaction is crucial for actin filament severing and turnover, facilitating cytoskeletal reorganization. Structural studies using magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy have provided atomic-resolution insights into the CFL2/F-actin complex, revealing specific residues involved in this interaction (Kraus2022Magic; Yehl2017Structural).

These interactions highlight CFL2's role in muscle physiology and its potential implications in muscle-related pathologies, as it regulates actin dynamics through its interactions with MLP and F-actin.
