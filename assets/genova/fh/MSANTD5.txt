# MSANTD5

## Overview
MSANTD5 is a gene that encodes the protein Myb/SANT DNA binding domain containing 5, which is characterized by the presence of a Myb/SANT domain, a motif known for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, and is categorized as a DNA-binding protein. The Myb/SANT domain is a conserved region that facilitates the interaction of the protein with specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. This gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in several biological pathways and may have potential clinical significance in understanding certain genetic disorders and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
