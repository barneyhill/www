# TAS2R41

## Overview
TAS2R41 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 41, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the perception of bitter tastes, playing a crucial role in the sensory system by detecting bitter compounds. The TAS2R41 gene is expressed in various tissues, including the taste buds, and is implicated in broader physiological processes beyond taste perception, such as immune response modulation and neuroinflammation. Variations in the TAS2R41 gene have been linked to several health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory biology and disease pathophysiology (Joseph2024Genomic; Carey2022Impact).

## Clinical Significance
The TAS2R41 gene, primarily recognized for its role in taste perception, has been implicated in several health conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11771145 and rs10228407 located upstream of TAS2R41, have been associated with AD in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These SNPs may influence the expression of TAS2R41, potentially affecting neuroinflammatory pathways and neuronal signaling, which are critical in AD pathophysiology (Joseph2024Genomic). The modulation of immune cell activity by TAS2R41 suggests its role in regulating neuroinflammation, a key factor in AD. Variations in TAS2R41 expression could alter receptor activation thresholds, impacting neuroprotection and the management of neuroinflammatory responses (Joseph2024Genomic).

In addition to its implications in AD, TAS2R41 has been studied in the context of cancer. The gene exhibits a nonsilent mutation rate of approximately 4.5% in skin melanoma, indicating a potential role in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Carey2022Impact). The expression levels of TAS2R41, along with other TAS2R genes, are associated with survival outcomes in various solid tumors, suggesting their potential as prognostic markers (Carey2022Impact).
