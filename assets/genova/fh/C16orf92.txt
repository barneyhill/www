# C16orf92

## Overview
C16orf92 is a gene located on chromosome 16, specifically within the 16p11.2 region, which is known for its involvement in various genetic disorders. The gene encodes a protein referred to as chromosome 16 open reading frame 92, although the precise biological function of this protein remains largely undefined. Current research suggests that C16orf92 may play a role in neurodevelopmental processes, as it is downregulated in models of early neural development with 16p11.2 deletions, which are linked to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (Roth202016p11.2; Roth2020Copy). Despite its association with these disorders, the specific molecular mechanisms and pathways involving the C16orf92 protein are not yet fully understood, necessitating further investigation to elucidate its functional significance (Giannuzzi2022Possible; AlQattan2015The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C16orf92, located within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, has been studied in the context of various genetic conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains unclear. Research has identified C16orf92 as one of the genes downregulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models of early neural development with 16p11.2 deletions. These deletions are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role in these conditions (Roth202016p11.2; Roth2020Copy).

In the context of hematological phenotypes, a variant in C16orf92 was identified in a study of a proband with 16p11.2 deletion, who exhibited neutropenia and lymphopenia. However, this variant was described as likely benign, with no established role in leukocyte biology (Giannuzzi2022Possible).

C16orf92 is also mentioned in studies of the 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, which is linked to obesity and other developmental disorders. However, the specific contribution of C16orf92 to these phenotypes is not detailed, and its role remains to be fully elucidated (AlQattan2015The). Overall, while C16orf92 is implicated in several conditions associated with 16p11.2 CNVs, its direct clinical significance requires further investigation.
