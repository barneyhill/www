# TCTA

## Overview
The TCTA gene, also known as the T-cell leukemia translocation associated gene, is located on chromosome 3p21 in humans and is expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the kidney. It encodes a protein of 103 amino acids, referred to as T cell leukemia translocation altered, although the protein's functional role remains largely undefined due to its lack of significant homology with other known proteins. The TCTA protein is hypothesized to be involved in cell signaling pathways, potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation, and may play a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite these potential functions, the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular activities of TCTA are not fully understood, and its classification as a pseudogene in some species raises questions about its functional significance in humans (Leeb2000Genomic).

## Structure


## Function
The TCTA gene, also known as the T-cell leukemia translocation associated gene, is located on human chromosome 3p21 and is expressed ubiquitously across various tissues, with the highest mRNA levels observed in the kidney (Leeb2000Genomic). The gene encodes a short open reading frame that translates into a protein consisting of 103 amino acids. However, the predicted protein does not exhibit significant homology to any other known proteins, and it remains unclear whether this protein is actively translated or if the TCTA mRNA serves a distinct physiological function (Leeb2000Genomic).

In healthy human cells, TCTA is implicated in cell signaling pathways, potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation. The protein may localize to specific cellular compartments, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite these potential roles, the exact molecular processes and cellular activities of the TCTA protein remain to be fully elucidated. The absence of a homologous coding open reading frame in the canine TCTA gene suggests that TCTA might function as a pseudogene, raising questions about its role in humans (Leeb2000Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
The TCTA gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations and expression alterations. In T-cell leukemias, particularly those involving the t(1;3)(p32;p21) translocation, TCTA is joined with the TALI/TCL1/SCL gene, suggesting a role in T-cell leukemogenesis. This translocation may contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the expression of oncogenes (Schwab1996Genomic).

TCTA is also associated with odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), where it shows increased expression. RNA sequencing analyses have revealed that TCTA is upregulated in OKCs compared to healthy gingival tissue, indicating its potential involvement in the development of these lesions. However, the specific implications of TCTA expression changes in OKCs are not fully understood (DuarteAndrade2020A).

While the exact function of TCTA in these conditions remains unclear, its involvement in significant chromosomal rearrangements and expression changes highlights its potential role in oncogenesis and tumor development. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which TCTA contributes to these diseases.
