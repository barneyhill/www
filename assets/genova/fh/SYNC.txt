# SYNC

## Overview
The SYNC gene encodes syncoilin, an intermediate filament protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity of muscle cells. Syncoilin is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it interacts with components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), such as desmin and α-dystrobrevin, to support muscle structure and function (McCullagh2008Analysis; Parlakian2016Intermediate). Unlike other intermediate filament proteins, syncoilin does not independently form a filamentous network but contributes to the cytoskeletal framework by linking the intermediate filament network to the sarcolemma via the DAPC (Brown2005Syncoilin). This interaction is crucial for muscle resilience and protection against mechanical stress. Syncoilin is also expressed in the nervous system, where it may play a role in motor neuron function (Parlakian2016Intermediate). Its involvement in neuromuscular disorders suggests a potential role in compensatory mechanisms to maintain muscle fiber integrity (Brown2005Syncoilin).

## Structure
Syncoilin (SYNC) is an intermediate filament protein characterized by its unique molecular structure. The primary structure of syncoilin includes a unique NH2-terminal region with no known homology to other proteins, which distinguishes it from other intermediate filament proteins (Wakayama2010Dysbindin). The secondary structure of syncoilin features alpha-helical coiled-coil rod domains, which are typical of intermediate filament proteins and are crucial for its structural properties (Parry2007Towards). These coiled-coil domains facilitate the formation of dimers and higher-order structures, although syncoilin itself does not form a filamentous network independently (McCullagh2008Analysis).

In terms of tertiary structure, syncoilin's coiled-coil domains contribute to its filamentous nature, allowing it to interact with other proteins such as desmin and α-dystrobrevin, which are part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) (Brown2005Syncoilin). Syncoilin's quaternary structure involves these interactions, potentially linking the intermediate filament network to the sarcolemma via the DAPC (McCullagh2008Analysis).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect syncoilin's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context (Saez2022Recent). Syncoilin also has splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their structural and functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
Syncoilin (SYNC) is an intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. It is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it interacts with desmin and the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) to support muscle structure and function (McCullagh2008Analysis; Parlakian2016Intermediate). Syncoilin is enriched at the sarcolemma, Z-lines, and neuromuscular junctions, indicating its involvement in linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, which is essential for muscle resilience and protection against mechanical stress (Brown2005Syncoilin; McCullagh2008Analysis).

In the nervous system, syncoilin is expressed and colocalizes with peripherin, suggesting a role in motor neuron function and possibly in the assembly of peripherin filament networks (Parlakian2016Intermediate). Syncoilin does not form a filamentous network by itself but may do so in certain myopathies, indicating its potential involvement in muscle pathology (McCullagh2008Analysis). The protein's interaction with desmin and dystrobrevin suggests that syncoilin helps maintain the link between the DAPC and the intermediate filament network, which is crucial for muscle fiber integrity (Brown2005Syncoilin).

## Interactions
Syncoilin (SYNC) is an intermediate filament protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in muscle structure and function. It is known to bind with α-dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and linking the intermediate filament network to the subsynaptic dystrophin protein complex (Newey2001Syncoilin). Syncoilin also interacts with desmin, another intermediate filament protein, and has been shown to inhibit desmin filament formation in transfection experiments (Brown2005Syncoilin). This interaction suggests that syncoilin may play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements within muscle fibers.

In addition to its interactions with α-dystrobrevin and desmin, syncoilin is associated with utrophin, a dystrophin-related protein, although this interaction appears to be limited (Newey2001Syncoilin). Syncoilin's expression is upregulated in various neuromuscular disorders, indicating its potential involvement in compensatory mechanisms to strengthen weakened muscle membranes (Brown2005Syncoilin). These interactions highlight syncoilin's role in linking the DAPC to the intermediate filament network, contributing to muscle fiber integrity and function.
