# SIK3

## Overview
Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) is a gene that encodes the protein SIK family kinase 3, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. This kinase plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation, insulin signaling, and inflammatory responses. The SIK3 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, such as the N-terminal serine-threonine kinase domain, a central sucrose non-fermenting homology domain, and a C-terminal domain with multiple phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for its function and regulation (Sun2020The). SIK3 is involved in the modulation of glucose homeostasis, gluconeogenesis, and macrophage polarization, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic balance and immune function (Säll2016Saltinducible; Sun2020The). Additionally, SIK3 has been implicated in tumorigenesis and is considered an oncogene in certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sun2020The; Sorrentino2022Saltinducible).

## Structure
Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family. It features a primary structure with a sequence of amino acids forming specific domains essential for its function. The protein includes an N-terminal serine-threonine kinase domain (KD) with a liver kinase B1 (LKB1) phosphorylation site, a central sucrose non-fermenting (SNF-1) homology (SNH) domain, and a C-terminal domain with multiple protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites (Sun2020The).

The SNH domain is distinct among SIKs, and the C-terminal domain is highly conserved between SIK1 and SIK2, indicating structural similarities within the family (Sun2020The). SIK3 contains an activation loop (T-loop) in the KD, which is phosphorylated and activated by LKB1. The UBA domain within the SNH domain is crucial for SIK phosphorylation and activation (Sun2020The).

SIK3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by PKA, PKC, and tyrosine kinase, which contribute to its rapid turnover (Sun2020The). The protein's structure and phosphorylation sites are essential for its role in metabolic homeostasis and potentially in tumorigenesis (Sun2020The).

## Function
SIK3 (SIK family kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in metabolic regulation and insulin signaling. In human adipocytes, SIK3 plays a crucial role in promoting glucose uptake by facilitating insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. This process is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and SIK3's activity is linked to the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a key regulator of GLUT4 translocation (Säll2016Saltinducible).

SIK3 is also involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis, where it inhibits the process by phosphorylating CRTC and class IIa HDACs, thereby retaining them in the cytoplasm and repressing gene expression. This action helps maintain metabolic balance by controlling glucose production from noncarbohydrate sources (Sun2020The).

In addition to its metabolic roles, SIK3 influences inflammatory responses by acting as a molecular switch in macrophage polarization. It regulates the transformation of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 type to an anti-inflammatory M2 type, impacting cytokine production and immune responses (Sun2020The). SIK3's activity is observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates transcription factors and signaling pathways, contributing to its diverse functional roles.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the SIK3 gene have been implicated in several metabolic disorders and cancers. In mice, SIK3 deficiency leads to a lipodystrophic phenotype characterized by reduced fat storage, hypolipidemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia, along with biliary disorders such as cholestasis and cholelithiasis. These conditions are linked to impaired energy storage and altered lipid metabolism (Uebi2012Involvement; Sun2020The). SIK3 is also associated with skeletal deformities and growth-related issues, as seen in knockout mice that exhibit dwarfism and expanded growth plates (Sun2020The).

In cancer, SIK3 is considered an oncogene, with high expression observed in approximately 55% of breast cancer patients. It regulates the G1/S cell cycle transition and enhances cancer cell migration, contributing to tumor progression (Sun2020The). SIK3 also plays a role in immune evasion by promoting TNF-induced NF-κB activation, protecting tumor cells from cytotoxic T-cell attack (Sorrentino2022Saltinducible). Additionally, SIK3 mutations have been linked to increased tumor size in non-small cell lung cancer models (Sun2020The). These findings suggest that SIK3 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and cancer-related diseases.

## Interactions
SIK3 (SIK family kinase 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In Drosophila models, SIK3 interacts with Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk), contributing to tumorigenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that SIK3 can physically interact with Hipk, although this interaction was initially not detected using anti-Hipk antibodies. However, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation using myc agarose beads revealed an enriched interaction between SIK3 and Hipk (Yu2023The). This interaction is significant in the context of tumorigenesis, as SIK3, when co-expressed with Hipk, leads to synergistic tissue overgrowth and developmental delays in Drosophila, indicating a role in regulating Hipk activity and stability (Yu2023The).

In osteoblastic cells, SIK3 is part of the signaling pathways modulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its analogs. SIK3, along with SIK2, is involved in the regulation of RANKL expression through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Knockdown of SIK3 affects RANKL mRNA levels, suggesting its role in the modulation of osteoblastic activity (Ricarte2018Parathyroid). These interactions highlight SIK3's involvement in both developmental and metabolic pathways.
