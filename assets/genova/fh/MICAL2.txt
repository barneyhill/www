# MICAL2

## Overview
MICAL2 is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule associated monooxygenase, calponin and LIM domain containing 2, which is a member of the MICAL family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its role as a monooxygenase, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics through its enzymatic activity. MICAL2 is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell morphology, motility, and growth by mediating actin filament disassembly. It is implicated in various signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Semaphorin/Plexin pathway. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the tumor suppressor p53 and the TGF-β signaling pathway, underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, particularly in cancer (Pu2021MICAL2; Cai2018Overexpression; Lu2018MICAL2).

## Structure
MICAL2 is a member of the MICAL family of proteins, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The protein contains an N-terminal flavoprotein monooxygenase (MO) domain, a calponin homology (CH) domain, and a LIM domain, but notably lacks a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Cai2018Overexpression). The MO domain is responsible for NADPH-dependent methionine sulfoxidase activity and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), playing a role in modifying F-actin's methionine residues (Cai2018Overexpression). The CH domain acts as an actin-binding protein, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the MO domain and is involved in muscle contractility and non-muscle cell motility (Cai2018Overexpression). The LIM domain, composed of zinc-finger structures, serves as a docking site for kinases and transcription factors, influencing cell adhesion and motility (Cai2018Overexpression).

MICAL2 is a large protein, approximately 127 kDa, and contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that facilitates its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Zhou2020MICAL2). It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. MICAL2's structure and domain composition are crucial for its role in actin filament disassembly and its involvement in various signaling pathways related to cancer progression.

## Function
MICAL2 is a microtubule-associated monooxygenase involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It functions by mediating actin filament disassembly, which is crucial for cell morphology, motility, and other cellular behaviors. MICAL2's activity is linked to its monooxygenase domain, which facilitates the oxidation of methionine residues, impacting the stability and function of target proteins (Cai2018Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, MICAL2 is involved in the regulation of cell growth, axon guidance, and vesicle trafficking. It plays a role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process important for development and wound healing, by regulating the SRF/MRTF-A signaling pathway and the Semaphorin/Plexin pathway (Cai2018Overexpression). MICAL2 is active in the cytoplasm and can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, a process that is dependent on nuclear export signals and interactions with proteins such as myosin-9 (Zhou2020MICAL2).

The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in maintaining cellular structure and function, as well as its potential impact on organismal outcomes such as tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MICAL2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it acts as a tumor-promoting factor. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MICAL2 is highly expressed and associated with poor patient outcomes. It interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its degradation and thereby facilitating cancer cell growth and survival (Lu2018MICAL2). In prostate cancer, MICAL2 variants are overexpressed and correlate with higher Gleason scores, indicating a role in cancer progression (Ashida2006Expression). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MICAL2 is overexpressed and linked to cancer invasion and metastasis, with its expression correlating with poor prognosis (Zhou2020MICAL2). MICAL2 also plays a role in pancreatic cancer, where high expression is associated with poor prognosis and involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix organization (Liu2024MICAL2). 

In gastric cancer, MICAL2 influences cell migration by modulating the E-cadherin/β-catenin signaling pathway, affecting EMT processes (Wang2022MICAL2). In glioblastoma, MICAL2 promotes cell proliferation and migration through the TGF-β/p-Smad2 signaling pathway (Pu2021MICAL2). These findings suggest that MICAL2 could serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention across various cancer types.

## Interactions
MICAL2 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It directly interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, affecting its stability and cellular localization. MICAL2 binds to the core domain of p53 (residues 100-300) and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated degradation by oxidizing methionine residues 40 and 160, which enhances p53 ubiquitination. This interaction is independent of MDM2, a known E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 (Lu2018MICAL2).

MICAL2 also interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway in glioblastoma cells. It binds to the type I TGF-β receptor (TGFRI), facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like process through the TGFRI/p-Smad2 signaling pathway. This interaction promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration (Pu2021MICAL2).

In gastric cancer, MICAL2 influences cell migration by modulating the activity of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase. It affects the degradation of E-cadherin and the interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Wang2022MICAL2). MICAL2's interactions with these proteins and pathways highlight its role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
