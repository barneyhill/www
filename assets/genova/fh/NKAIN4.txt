# NKAIN4

## Overview
NKAIN4 is a gene that encodes the protein sodium/potassium transporting ATPase interacting 4, which is a member of the NKAIN family of transmembrane proteins. This protein is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the regulation of ion transport across cellular membranes by interacting with the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase enzyme (Gorokhova2007A). The interaction with the Na,K-ATPase suggests a role in modulating neuronal excitability and cellular homeostasis, which are critical for processes such as nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction (Gorokhova2007A). NKAIN4's involvement in these fundamental cellular processes underscores its potential importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including its association with tumor progression and immune regulation in cancers such as colon adenocarcinoma (Zhang2023Identification).

## Function
NKAIN4 is a transmembrane protein expressed in the mammalian central nervous system, particularly in various regions of the mouse brain such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and brainstem (Gorokhova2007A). It is part of the NKAIN family, which interacts with the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining electrochemical gradients across cellular membranes (Gorokhova2007A). The interaction between NKAIN4 and the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit has been demonstrated through yeast-two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a role in modulating Na,K-ATPase activity (Gorokhova2007A).

The NKAIN proteins, including NKAIN4, are thought to be involved in forming or regulating ion channels or pore structures in neurons, potentially affecting neuronal excitability and function (Gorokhova2007A). Although the specific activity of NKAIN4 in cells is not detailed, its interaction with the Na,K-ATPase suggests it may influence ion transport and cellular homeostasis, impacting processes like nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction (Gorokhova2007A). The evolutionary conservation of NKAIN proteins across species underscores their potential importance in these cellular processes (Gorokhova2007A).

## Clinical Significance
NKAIN4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in ion transport regulation. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), NKAIN4 is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. It is involved in immune checkpoint alterations, showing significant co-occurrence with immune checkpoints such as OBSCN, MUC16, and MUC17. This suggests that NKAIN4 may act as a coregulator of immune checkpoints, influencing the tumor's immune environment and potentially impacting patient prognosis (Zhang2023Identification). NKAIN4 is also linked to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump, which is enhanced in various tumors, including colorectal cancer, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and progression (Zhang2023Identification).

In the context of congenital aniridia, NKAIN4 expression is altered in limbal stem cell deficiency, although the clinical significance of these changes is not fully detailed (Latta2021Abnormal). In leukemia, allele-specific expression patterns of NKAIN4, potentially influenced by CpG site methylation, have been observed, indicating a role in gene expression regulation in leukemic cells (Milani2008Allelespecific). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of NKAIN4 in various conditions, warranting further investigation.

## Interactions
NKAIN4 interacts with the β1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining cellular ion gradients. This interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells, where the β1 subunit co-immunoprecipitated with flag-tagged NKAIN1, suggesting a similar interaction for NKAIN4 (Gorokhova2007A). The interaction between NKAIN4 and the β1 subunit is significant because it may enhance the activity of the sodium-potassium pump, potentially promoting tumor proliferation and progression in colon adenocarcinoma (Zhang2023Identification).

NKAIN4 lacks the DSYG motif found in other NKAIN proteins, yet it still interacts with the β1 subunit, indicating that this motif is not essential for the interaction (Gorokhova2007A). The interaction sites of NKAIN proteins with the β subunits are distinct from those of the α subunit, suggesting a unique role in modulating the function of the Na,K-ATPase complex (Gorokhova2007A). These interactions may contribute to the regulation of ion transport and cellular signaling, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
