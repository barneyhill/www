# PLD5

## Overview
Phospholipase D family member 5 (PLD5) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the phospholipase D family, which is typically involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids. However, PLD5 is considered likely catalytically inactive due to the poor conservation of its catalytic domains, suggesting a non-enzymatic regulatory role in cellular processes (McDermott2020Mammalian). The protein encoded by PLD5 has been implicated in various biological interactions, notably with microRNA miR-145-5p, which influences its expression and has implications in cancer biology, particularly prostate cancer (liu2021MicroRNA). Despite its potential involvement in fibrotic and tumor-related conditions, as well as neurological disorders, the precise physiological and pathological roles of PLD5 remain to be fully elucidated (Frohman2015The; McDermott2020Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
PLD5 is associated with several clinical conditions, although its enzymatic activity is considered to be minimal due to poor conservation of its catalytic domains. In humans, PLD5 has been linked to a profibrotic uterine phenotype during childbearing years, suggesting a role in fibrotic conditions (McDermott2020Mammalian). Additionally, polymorphisms in the PLD5 gene may increase the risk of tumor progression in multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis syndrome, indicating a potential connection to tumorigenesis (McDermott2020Mammalian).

Despite these associations, PLD5 knockout mice do not exhibit significant abnormalities, which complicates the understanding of its clinical relevance (Frohman2015The; McDermott2020Mammalian). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PLD5 gene has been associated with verbal performance in autism patients, although the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear (Frohman2015The). The current research suggests that while PLD5 may not have significant enzymatic activity, its genetic variations and expression levels could have implications in certain fibrotic and tumor-related conditions, as well as in neurological disorders.

## Interactions
PLD5 interacts with microRNA miR-145-5p, which plays a significant role in prostate cancer by targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the PLD5 gene. This interaction results in the suppression of PLD5 expression, leading to decreased cell proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells. The binding of miR-145-5p to PLD5 was confirmed through dual-luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting, demonstrating that miR-145-5p directly targets PLD5 to exert its tumor-suppressing effects (liu2021MicroRNA).

The study also showed that the overexpression of PLD5 has oncogenic effects, which can be reversed by mimicking miR-145-5p, significantly inhibiting prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. This suggests that miR-145-5p modulates PLD5 activity to promote apoptosis and repress cancer progression (liu2021MicroRNA).

While PLD5 is part of the phospholipase D family, it is described as likely catalytically inactive due to poor conservation of its catalytic domains, lacking key residues in its motifs. This suggests that its interactions may not involve traditional enzymatic activity but rather regulatory roles in cellular processes (McDermott2020Mammalian).
