# UBA52

## Overview
UBA52 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin A-52 residue ribosomal protein fusion product 1, a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40). This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes, particularly in protein synthesis and ubiquitination, a post-translational modification essential for protein degradation and ribosomal biogenesis. The ubiquitin moiety of the fusion protein is involved in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kobayashi2016The). UBA52 is constitutively expressed across various tissues and is vital for embryonic development, as its deficiency leads to embryonic lethality due to ribosomal dysfunction (Kobayashi2016The). The protein also interacts with several cellular and viral proteins, influencing processes such as viral replication, cell cycle regulation, and neurodegenerative disease mechanisms (Wang2018Host; Tiwari2022UBA52). UBA52's involvement in diseases like Parkinson's and cancer underscores its clinical significance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Murali2024Searching; Tiwari2022UBA52).

## Structure
The UBA52 gene encodes a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin at the N-terminus and ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40) at the C-terminus. The primary structure includes a ubiquitin moiety linked to L40, which is essential for ribosomal function and protein synthesis (Kobayashi2016The). The secondary structure of ubiquitin features a β-grasp fold, while L40 contains α-helices, contributing to the protein's stability and function in the ribosome (Kobayashi2016The). 

UBA52 is involved in ubiquitination, a crucial post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation and ribosomal biogenesis. The ubiquitin domain facilitates the ubiquitination of ribosomal complexes, which is essential for maintaining protein synthesis and cell cycle progression (Kobayashi2016The). 

The protein is rapidly cleaved to release ubiquitin, which then forms a complex with RPL40, indicating its role beyond just being a ubiquitin supplier (Kobayashi2016The). This cleavage is necessary for maintaining protein synthesis, as RPL40 forms a ribosomal complex with ubiquitin cleaved from UBA52 (Kobayashi2016The). The UBA52 gene is expressed in various conditions, including human colorectal carcinoma and during hepatoma cell apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Kobayashi2016The).

## Function
UBA52 encodes a fusion protein consisting of ubiquitin and ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40), playing a crucial role in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. The ubiquitin moiety is involved in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, which is essential for proper cell cycle progression and protein biogenesis. This process is vital for maintaining protein synthesis and ribosomal function, which are critical for healthy cell function (Kobayashi2016The).

UBA52 is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of tissues, similar to ribosomal protein genes, and is involved in the regulation of the ribosomal protein complex. It provides both RPL40 and ubiquitin to the ribosome, suggesting its role as more than just a supplier of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin pool (Baker1991The; Kobayashi2016The). The gene is essential for embryonic development, as demonstrated by studies showing that UBA52-deficient mice exhibit embryonic lethality due to ribosomal dysfunction (Kobayashi2016The).

UBA52 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, interacting with cyclin-dependent kinases and modulating the expression of cyclin proteins, which are critical for cell cycle regulation (Kobayashi2016The). Its role in ubiquitin-dependent translation regulation is crucial for cell-fate determination (Kobayashi2016The).

## Clinical Significance
UBA52 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), UBA52 is crucial for the ubiquitylation of HSP90, a molecular chaperone involved in protein homeostasis. The gene is downregulated during the early phases of sporadic PD, which may lead to reduced proteasome activity and increased protein aggregation, contributing to neurodegeneration. Overexpression of UBA52 in neuronal cells has been shown to protect against PD pathology by maintaining tyrosine hydroxylase levels and preventing caspase-3 activation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tiwari2022UBA52).

In cancer, UBA52 is associated with glioma progression. Increased expression of UBA52 correlates with poor prognosis in glioma patients, as it promotes cell proliferation by stabilizing oncogenic proteins like c-Myc and cyclin D1. UBA52 also contributes to chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance by regulating apoptosis and DNA damage response (Murali2024Searching). Additionally, UBA52 has been identified as a protective factor against cancer progression in the context of alternative splicing, suggesting its complex role in cancer biology (Li2024The).

## Interactions
UBA52, a ubiquitin hybrid gene, encodes a fusion protein consisting of ubiquitin and ribosomal protein L40. It participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. UBA52 interacts with the viral proteins PA, PA-N155, and PA-N182 of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, facilitating viral replication in chicken cells (Wang2018Host). It also interacts with CDK6, a cyclin-dependent kinase, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Kobayashi2016The).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, UBA52 interacts with HSP90 and CHIP, leading to the ubiquitylation of HSP90, which is significant in the early phases of Parkinson's disease. This interaction helps maintain proteasome activity and prevents protein aggregation (Tiwari2022UBA52). UBA52 also interacts with α-synuclein, inhibiting its upregulation and fibril formation, which are associated with Parkinson's disease pathology (Tiwari2022UBA52).

UBA52's interaction with VDAC1, a protein involved in mitochondrial function, is crucial for regulating mitochondrial-mediated neuronal apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial health and cellular redox balance (Tiwari2023UBA52). These interactions underscore UBA52's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
