# AMFR

## Overview
The AMFR gene encodes the autocrine motility factor receptor, a multifunctional protein also known as gp78. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it facilitates the degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress (fairbank2012insight; Joshi2017Gp78). AMFR is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics, influencing processes such as mitophagy and ER-mitochondria interactions, which are crucial for cellular metabolism and calcium homeostasis (fairbank2012insight; Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B). Additionally, AMFR is implicated in cell motility and cancer progression, with its overexpression linked to increased tumor invasiveness and poor clinical outcomes (li2015unraveling). The gene's mutations are associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and increased susceptibility to viral infections (Thomsen2024Impaired; Deng2023AMFR).

## Structure
The AMFR protein, also known as gp78, is a seven-transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes several transmembrane regions located at amino acids 82-102, 122-142, 145-165, 186-206, 215-235, 276-296, and 429-449. The protein also features distinct domains such as a RING-type Zinc finger domain (amino acids 341-379), which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, a CUE domain (amino acids 456-498), and a VCP/p97-interacting motif (amino acids 622-640) (Nakajima2020Autocrine).

The secondary structure of AMFR includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of transmembrane proteins. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding necessary for its function as a receptor and ubiquitin ligase. AMFR's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are noted, which may affect its function and interaction with ligands like the autocrine motility factor (AMF) (Tanaka2002Inhibition). The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its role in cellular motility and protein degradation, impacting processes like tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Nakajima2020Autocrine).

## Function
AMFR, also known as the autocrine motility factor receptor, is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for tagging proteins for degradation. This activity is crucial for the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where AMFR helps in the recognition and degradation of misfolded proteins, thereby alleviating ER stress (fairbank2012insight; Joshi2017Gp78).

AMFR is involved in mitochondrial dynamics by regulating the degradation of mitofusins, proteins essential for mitochondrial fusion. This regulation promotes mitophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria, thus maintaining mitochondrial quality and function (Mookherjee2020RETREG1FAM134B; Joshi2017Gp78). AMFR is also implicated in the modulation of ER-mitochondria interactions, which are important for calcium homeostasis and cellular metabolism (fairbank2012insight).

In addition to its role in proteostasis, AMFR influences cell motility, proliferation, and apoptosis, impacting processes such as cancer progression and metastasis (Joshi2017Gp78). Its activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins and ubiquitin ligases, ensuring precise control over its functions in healthy cells (Joshi2017Gp78).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AMFR gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. AMFR dysfunction is linked to autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. This condition is caused by bi-allelic truncating variants in the AMFR gene, leading to disruptions in lipid homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology. These disruptions result in lipid droplet accumulation and motor neuron branching defects, which can be partially rescued by statin treatment in preclinical models (Deng2023AMFR).

In the context of viral infections, a specific missense variant in AMFR, R594C, has been identified in a patient with severe varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This variant impairs the cGAS-STING pathway, crucial for antiviral immune responses, by affecting STING polyubiquitination and activation. The mutation exerts a dominant-negative effect, leading to reduced antiviral interferon responses and increased susceptibility to viral infections (Thomsen2024Impaired).

In cancer, AMFR overexpression is associated with increased tumor cell motility and invasiveness. It plays a role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is linked to poor outcomes in cancers such as melanoma and bladder carcinoma (li2015unraveling).

## Interactions
AMFR, also known as gp78, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as motility and degradation. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and interacts with the autocrine motility factor (AMF), also known as phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). This interaction is crucial for tumor cell motility and metastasis, as AMF binding to AMFR stimulates cell motility through a signal transduction cascade (fairbank2012insight; li2015unraveling).

AMFR interacts with G protein subunits, including Gαi1 and Gαs, suggesting a role in cell motility pathways and the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. The interaction with Gαs is particularly notable, as it is consistently observed and may be influenced by the catalytic RING finger domain of AMFR (fairbank2012insight).

AMFR also colocalizes with the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) at ER-mitochondria contact sites, with their interaction regulated by calcium levels, which is important for intracellular calcium homeostasis (fairbank2012insight). Additionally, AMFR interacts with insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), which negatively regulates its activity (fairbank2012insight). These interactions highlight AMFR's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and protein degradation pathways.
