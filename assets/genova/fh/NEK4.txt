# NEK4

## Overview
NEK4 is a gene located on chromosome 3p21.1 that encodes the protein NIMA related kinase 4, a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. The NEK4 protein plays a significant role in the DNA damage response, particularly through its involvement in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, where it interacts with key proteins such as DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 to facilitate DNA repair and maintain genomic stability (Nguyen2012Nek4). Additionally, NEK4 is implicated in mRNA processing and primary cilia stability, interacting with various proteins to influence spliceosome-mediated splicing and cilia function (Basei2015New). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with several diseases, including ciliopathies and various cancers, highlighting its potential role in disease progression and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Nguyen2023NEK; Shaheen2016Characterizing).

## Structure
NEK4 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response and cilia maintenance. The NEK4 gene is located on chromosome 3p21.1 and encodes an 841-residue protein (Basei2015New). NEK4 has two isoforms, Nek4.1 and Nek4.2, which differ by a 46 amino acid insertion due to an Alu sequence in the regulatory domain of Nek4.1. This insertion does not cause a frame shift but may alter the protein's function and subcellular localization (Basei2015New).

The protein is localized in several cellular compartments, including the nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, and contains a nuclear localization sequence in its regulatory domain (Basei2015New). NEK4 is implicated in the DNA damage response, interacting with proteins such as Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKc, and is involved in the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway (Basei2015New). It also plays a role in mRNA processing, specifically spliceosome-mediated processing, with differences between the isoforms in RNA splicing control (Basei2015New). NEK4's involvement in cilia stability is suggested through its interaction with proteins associated with ciliopathies (Basei2015New).

## Function
NEK4 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair mechanisms, particularly through its involvement in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. NEK4 interacts with key proteins such as DNA-PK(cs), Ku70, and Ku80, facilitating the recruitment of DNA-PK(cs) to sites of double-stranded DNA damage, which is essential for proper DNA repair and genomic stability (Nguyen2012Nek4). 

NEK4 also regulates entry into replicative senescence by influencing the transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a crucial mediator of cell cycle arrest. Suppression of NEK4 extends the proliferative lifespan of fibroblasts, indicating its role in limiting cellular proliferation and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor (Nguyen2012Nek4).

In addition to its role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, NEK4 is involved in mRNA processing, particularly in spliceosome-mediated splicing. The isoform Nek4.2 influences splicing site selection, interacting with splicing regulators such as SRSF1, SRSF2, and SRPK1 (Basei2015New). NEK4 is also associated with primary cilia stability, interacting with proteins involved in cilia function and maintenance (Basei2015New).

## Clinical Significance
NEK4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. Mutations in NEK4 have been associated with ciliopathies, a group of disorders related to defects in primary cilia. These mutations can lead to conditions such as Joubert and Meckel-Gruber syndromes, characterized by symptoms like dysmorphic facies, renal agenesis, and polydactyly (Shaheen2016Characterizing).

In cancer, NEK4 expression is notably altered. It is upregulated in lung and colon cancer tumors and has been linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, where it is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer metastasis (Nguyen2023NEK; Ding2018NEK4; Gao2022Integrative). NEK4's expression also correlates with patient survival outcomes in various cancers, showing positive correlations in kidney renal cell carcinoma and negative correlations in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Nguyen2023NEK).

NEK4's role in DNA damage response and its interactions with proteins involved in apoptosis and DNA repair pathways suggest its involvement in maintaining genomic stability, with potential implications in cancer progression (Basei2015New). Despite these associations, further research is needed to fully elucidate NEK4's clinical significance.

## Interactions
NEK4, a serine/threonine kinase, is involved in various protein interactions critical for its role in DNA damage response and other cellular processes. NEK4 interacts with components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, including DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80, which are essential for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. These interactions are independent of DNA, as they persist even in the presence of ethidium bromide and following etoposide treatment (Nguyen2012Nek4). NEK4 suppression impairs the recruitment of DNA-PKcs to damaged DNA, affecting downstream signaling events such as p53 activation and H2AX phosphorylation (Nguyen2012Nek4).

NEK4 also interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial functions and apoptosis, such as TRAP1, AIFM1, and ANT3, suggesting a role in mitochondrial regulation (Basei2015New). Additionally, NEK4 is associated with proteins involved in primary cilium stability, including RPGRIP1 and RPGRIP1L, and is localized at the cilia root, indicating its importance in cilia stability (Basei2015New). The protein also interacts with components of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, such as PCNA, particularly after UV-induced DNA damage (Basei2015New).
