# PWWP2A

## Overview
PWWP2A is a gene that encodes the PWWP domain-containing protein 2A, a chromatin-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin dynamics. The protein is characterized by its ability to interact with various chromatin components, including H2A.Z and trimethylated H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), through its PWWP domain and other structural regions. PWWP2A plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by modulating chromatin structure and histone modifications, particularly at transcription start sites and regulatory regions of highly transcribed genes. It is also involved in essential cellular processes such as mitotic progression and neural crest differentiation. The gene's significance extends to clinical contexts, where alterations in its expression or function are linked to developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Link2018PWWP2A; Pünzeler2017Multivalent; Herchenröther2022The).

## Structure
The PWWP2A protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a C-terminal PWWP domain, which is crucial for its binding to chromatin, particularly recognizing the trimethylated H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3) through an aromatic cage formed by conserved residues F666, W669, and W695 (Link2018PWWP2A). This domain also exhibits low-affinity binding to DNA (Link2018PWWP2A).

The protein is highly disordered and includes two N-terminal proline-rich regions (P1 and P2), a serine-rich stretch (S), and an internal region (I) that is divided into IN and IC parts. The IN region interacts with linker DNA and nucleosomes, while the IC region shows specificity for H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes (Link2018PWWP2A). The PWWP2A protein also interacts with the MTA1-specific core NuRD complex, which includes HDAC1 and RBBP4/7, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Link2018PWWP2A).

PWWP2A is involved in chromatin modification processes and may undergo dynamic covalent modifications, such as lysine acetylation and phosphorylation, which could regulate its binding activity (Link2018PWWP2A). The protein's multivalent binding mode allows it to interact with various chromatin moieties, including H2A.Z and H3K36me3, contributing to its role in transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics (Link2018PWWP2A; Pünzeler2017Multivalent).

## Function
The PWWP2A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin structure and function in healthy human cells. It acts as a multivalent chromatin binder, interacting with various chromatin components such as H2A.Z, H3K36me3, and nucleic acids. PWWP2A is primarily found at transcription start sites and regulatory regions of highly transcribed genes, where it influences gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and histone modifications (Link2018PWWP2A; Pünzeler2017Multivalent).

PWWP2A interacts with the MTA1-specific core NuRD complex, which includes HDAC1/2 and RBBP4/7, but excludes other typical NuRD components. This interaction suggests that PWWP2A plays a role in recruiting histone deacetylases to specific chromatin regions, thereby regulating histone acetylation levels, particularly H3K27ac and H2A.Zac, and maintaining transcriptional balance (Link2018PWWP2A; Zhang2018A).

In terms of cellular processes, PWWP2A is involved in mitotic progression and neural crest differentiation. Its depletion leads to defects in mitosis, such as improper chromosome alignment and segregation, and affects neural crest cell differentiation and migration, which are crucial for cranial-facial development (Pünzeler2017Multivalent).

## Clinical Significance
The PWWP2A gene has been implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers due to its role in chromatin binding and gene regulation. Alterations in PWWP2A expression or function can lead to significant developmental defects. For instance, depletion of PWWP2A in Xenopus laevis results in severe craniofacial defects, likely due to impaired neural crest cell migration and differentiation, which are crucial for proper craniofacial development (Herchenröther2023The; Herchenröther2022The).

PWWP2A is also involved in neurodevelopmental diseases, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders. These conditions are associated with disruptions in the H3K4 methylation signature, which is crucial for normal brain development. Proteins in the PWWP2A complex, such as PHF14, RAI1, TCF20, and HMG20A, are often deregulated or mutated in these disorders, suggesting a potential link between PWWP2A and these conditions (Herchenröther2023The; Herchenröther2022The).

In cancer, the PWWP2A-ROS1 fusion has been identified in certain neoplasms, such as atypical Spitz tumors. This fusion involves the retention of only the first exon of PWWP2A while preserving the kinase domain of ROS1, although the specific function and implications of this chimeric protein remain unclear (Gerami2021Clinical; Uguen2016ROS1).

## Interactions
PWWP2A is a chromatin-binding protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. It binds to H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes through its C-terminal internal region, which is crucial for its specificity to H2A.Z (Link2018PWWP2A; Pünzeler2017Multivalent). PWWP2A also interacts with the MTA1-specific core NuRD complex (M1HR), which includes MTA1, HDAC1, and RBBP4/7, but excludes CHD, GATAD2, and MBD proteins (Link2018PWWP2A; Zhang2018A). This interaction suggests that PWWP2A acts as an adapter, recruiting the M1HR complex to H2A.Z chromatin and regulating histone acetylation levels (Link2018PWWP2A).

PWWP2A's PWWP domain binds to DNA and recognizes the trimethylated form of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification associated with active transcription (Link2018PWWP2A; Zhang2018A). The protein is enriched at transcription start sites of active genes, where it co-purifies with transcription factors such as ZFP423, ZFP521, TIF1β, SALL4, and chromatin-binding protein BEND3 (Zhang2018A). These interactions highlight PWWP2A's role in regulating transcription at active genes by interacting with specific components of the NuRD complex and other chromatin-associated proteins (Zhang2018A).
