# CUL4B

## Overview
CUL4B is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 4B, a member of the cullin protein family, which functions as a scaffold in cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes. These complexes are pivotal in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and transcription (Nakagawa2011XLinked; Hannah2015Distinct). Cullin 4B is distinguished by its nuclear localization signal, which facilitates its activity within the nucleus, unlike its paralog CUL4A, which is primarily cytoplasmic (Hannah2015Distinct). The protein is involved in critical cellular functions, including chromatin remodeling and DNA repair, and plays a significant role in neural progenitor cell growth and neuronal gene expression (Liu2012Cul4B; Nakagawa2011XLinked). Mutations in the CUL4B gene are linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other neurological and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in normal human development and cellular function (Kerzendorfer2010Mutations; Vultovan2014Variants).

## Structure
CUL4B is a member of the cullin protein family, which serves as a molecular scaffold in cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes. The protein is characterized by a long stalk-like amino-terminal domain (NTD) with three cullin repeats (CR1 to CR3) and a globular carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) containing a cullin homology domain (CH). This CH domain is crucial for binding to RING-finger proteins, such as ROC1 or ROC2, which recruit ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes for catalysis (Sarikas2011The). 

CUL4B features an elongated N-terminus that includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS), facilitating its nuclear localization, distinguishing it from CUL4A, which lacks an NLS and is primarily cytoplasmic (Hannah2015Distinct). Post-translational modifications, such as neddylation, are essential for CUL4B's function. NEDD8 is conjugated to specific lysine residues, with Lys873 being a key site on CUL4B, promoting CRL activity (Hannah2015Distinct). 

CUL4B is involved in forming CRL4 complexes, which include DDB1-CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) that enable interaction with a wide range of proteins (Hannah2015Distinct). The COP9 signalosome (CSN) negatively regulates CRL function by de-neddylating cullins, while the inhibitor protein CAND1 prevents NEDD8 conjugation and blocks interactions between cullins and substrate adaptors (Hannah2015Distinct).

## Function
CUL4B is a component of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex, which plays a critical role in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and transcription (Nakagawa2011XLinked; Hannah2015Distinct). CUL4B is involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell growth, particularly in the brain, where it stabilizes β-catenin during mitosis, crucial for cell cycle progression (Liu2012Cul4B).

CUL4B also targets specific proteins for degradation, such as Jab1/CSN5, influencing bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cellular signaling and preventing excessive BMP signaling (He2013Xlinked). In the nucleus, CUL4B targets WDR5 for ubiquitylation, impacting neuronal gene expression and chromatin-related functions (Nakagawa2011XLinked).

CUL4B is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences chromatin remodeling and DNA repair, essential for maintaining genomic stability and normal cellular function (Hannah2015Distinct). Its role in these processes underscores its importance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CUL4B gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). These mutations can lead to syndromic forms of intellectual disability, such as Cabezas syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly, tremor, and peripheral neuropathy (Kerzendorfer2010Mutations; Vultovan2014Variants). Patients with CUL4B mutations often exhibit cerebral malformations, including malformations of cortical development, ventriculomegaly, and diminished white matter volume, which contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in affected individuals (Vultovan2014Variants).

CUL4B mutations also result in increased sensitivity to camptothecin-induced topoisomerase I-dependent DNA breaks, indicating a role in DNA repair processes. This sensitivity is linked to neurological conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1 (SCAN-1) (Kerzendorfer2010Mutations; Lee2012Pathogenic). The gene's dysfunction is further implicated in growth retardation, motor neuron impairment, and other physical abnormalities, including short stature, hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphisms (Isidor2009Deletion; Kerzendorfer2011CUL4Bdeficiency).

CUL4B's role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is crucial for normal brain development, and its mutations disrupt this process, leading to the accumulation of substrates like WDR5, which affects neuronal gene expression and development (Lee2012Pathogenic; Nakagawa2011XLinked).

## Interactions
CUL4B is involved in various protein interactions, forming part of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with DDB1, which acts as an adaptor for recruiting substrate receptors, and RBX1 to form the core complex (Dar2021The). CUL4B associates with several substrate receptors, including DCAF1, AMBRA1, and DDB2, which are suggested to work with CUL4B in CD4+ T cells (Dar2021The). The interaction between CUL4B and DCAF1 is particularly significant for T cell survival, as evidenced by increased apoptosis in Cul4b-deficient T cells despite elevated DCAF1 levels (Dar2021The).

CUL4B also interacts with components of the DNA damage repair machinery, such as SMC1A, MRE11A, and RAD50, which are involved in the DNA damage response (Dar2021The). In breast cancer cells, CUL4B is associated with several transcriptional repressor complexes, including NuRD, SIN3A, CoREST, and NCoR/SMRT, interacting with proteins like HDAC1, HDAC2, and MTA1 (Huang2021CUL4B). These interactions are linked to CUL4B's role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling, contributing to processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis (Huang2021CUL4B).
