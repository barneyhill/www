# CEL

## Overview
The CEL gene encodes the carboxyl ester lipase, a crucial enzyme involved in the digestion and metabolism of dietary lipids. This enzyme is primarily expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and lactating mammary glands, where it plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and other lipid substrates. As a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family, carboxyl ester lipase is characterized by a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity. The enzyme's function is vital for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats, impacting energy homeostasis and nutrient assimilation. Mutations in the CEL gene have been linked to several pancreatic diseases, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 8 (MODY8) and hereditary pancreatitis, highlighting its clinical significance (Johansson2018The; El2021Two).

## Structure
The carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) protein is characterized by its membership in the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family, featuring a catalytic triad partially covered by a surface loop. This triad consists of Ser194, Asp320, and His435, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Holmes2011Comparative). The protein's structure includes a carboxyl terminus region that regulates enzymatic activity by forming hydrogen bonds with the surface loop, shielding the active site (Holmes2011Comparative). CEL also has a loop domain that binds bile salt, allowing the active site to access water-insoluble substrates (Holmes2011Comparative).

The primary structure of CEL includes 722 amino acids, with a 20 amino acid leader peptide. The protein is rich in proline, particularly in the final 25% of the sequence, due to a tandem repetition of a proline-rich sequence at the carboxyl terminus (Reue1991cDNA). This proline-rich domain contributes to the protein's nonglobular configuration and high molecular weight (Reue1991cDNA). CEL is a glycoprotein with a potential N-linked glycosylation site at Asn residue 187 (Reue1991cDNA). The protein forms dimeric subunit structures with active sites facing each other (Holmes2011Comparative).

## Function
The carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the digestion and metabolism of dietary lipids in healthy human cells. CEL is primarily expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and lactating mammary glands. In the pancreas, CEL is one of the major lipases secreted into the duodenum, where it requires bile salts for activation. It is involved in the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), which have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties (Johansson2018The; Kolar2016Branched).

CEL's enzymatic activity is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats, impacting energy homeostasis and nutrient assimilation. The enzyme has a globular N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal region with repeated 11-amino acid segments, which are important for its secretion and activity (Johansson2018The). In lactating mammary glands, CEL is secreted with milk, aiding in the digestion of milk triglycerides and cholesteryl/retinyl esters in breastfed infants (Johansson2018The).

CEL is also involved in the metabolism of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), products of the non-oxidative metabolism of ethanol and fatty acids, contributing to the hydrolysis of dietary lipids in the duodenum (Fjeld2016Length).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEL gene are linked to several pancreatic diseases, most notably maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 8 (MODY8) and hereditary pancreatitis. MODY8 is characterized by both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction, resulting from frameshift mutations in the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region of the CEL gene. These mutations lead to a dominant-negative, gain-of-function effect, causing the mutant CEL protein to aggregate and disrupt normal cellular functions (Johansson2011Diabetes; El2021Two). The aggregation of mutant proteins is associated with cellular stress responses, such as the unfolded protein response, and can lead to pancreatic lipomatosis and dysfunction (Johansson2011Diabetes; Torsvik2014Endocytosis).

Another variant, CEL-HYB, predisposes individuals to chronic pancreatitis by forming a CEL-CELP fusion protein with reduced lipolytic activity and increased autophagy induction (Dalva2020Pathogenic). The pathogenicity of CEL mutations is not due to reduced enzymatic activity but rather a dominant-negative gain-of-function effect, which affects protein secretion and causes endoplasmic reticulum stress (Gravdal2021The). These mutations have been identified in various populations, emphasizing the need for careful genetic screening to correctly diagnose MODY8 cases (El2021Two).

## Interactions
Carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) interacts with various proteins, influencing its function and stability. Pathogenic variants of CEL, such as CEL-MODY and CEL-HYB, have been shown to interact with the normal CEL protein (CEL-WT) in pancreatic cells, affecting its secretion and stability. CEL-MODY, in particular, leads to increased accumulation of CEL-WT in the insoluble fraction and reduces its secretion into the medium, suggesting a disruptive interaction that may contribute to disease pathology (Dalva2020Pathogenic).

CEL also interacts with glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), a molecular chaperone. This interaction is altered by certain CEL variants, such as the p.R540C variant, which changes the electrostatic potential of the CEL protein surface, potentially affecting its interactions with other macromolecules (Wu2023Identification).

The CEL-MUT protein, associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young (CEL-MODY), forms higher-order oligomeric forms and aggregates, which are not observed in the wild-type CEL protein. This aggregation is linked to amyloidogenic sequence motifs on the protein's surface, suggesting interactions with cell membranes similar to those seen in amyloid diseases (Johansson2011Diabetes). These interactions highlight the complex role of CEL in cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
