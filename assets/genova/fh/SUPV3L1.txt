# SUPV3L1

## Overview
The SUPV3L1 gene encodes the Suv3-like RNA helicase, a member of the SF2 helicase family, which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial RNA processing and degradation. This helicase is integral to the mitochondrial degradosome complex, where it collaborates with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) to maintain mitochondrial RNA integrity by degrading aberrant or unnecessary RNA molecules. The Suv3 protein is characterized by its ATP-dependent helicase activity, which enables it to unwind various nucleic acid structures, including double-stranded RNA, thus preventing the accumulation of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA that could otherwise trigger an antiviral immune response (Borowski2012Human; Borowski2010RNA). Beyond its mitochondrial functions, Suv3 is also involved in nuclear processes, interacting with proteins related to chromatin maintenance and DNA repair (Stepien2017Human). Mutations in the SUPV3L1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in cellular homeostasis and human health (Green2024Biallelic).

## Structure
The SUPV3L1 gene encodes the human Suv3 protein, a member of the SF2 helicase family, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and degradation. The molecular structure of the Suv3 protein is characterized by several distinct domains. It consists of four domains: the N-terminal domain A, RecA-like domains B and C, and the C-terminal domain D. Domain A is a left-handed three-helix bundle, while domains B and C have a fold typical of SF2 helicases, with domain B containing eight beta-strands and four helices, and domain C containing six beta-strands and four helices (Jedrzejczak2011Human). The C-terminal domain D consists of nine helices and a single beta-sheet, forming a ring structure with a tunnel at its center (Jedrzejczak2011Human).

The Suv3 protein interacts with ATP and RNA, with specific sequence motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as nucleic acid binding. These motifs include Q, I, Ia, Ib, II, and III in domain B, and IV, V, and VI in domain C (Jedrzejczak2011Human). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a unique mechanism of coupling ATPase and RNA-unwinding activities, distinct from other SF2 helicases (Jedrzejczak2011Human). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) in the mitochondrial degradosome complex, essential for mitochondrial RNA decay (Borowski2012Human).

## Function
The SUPV3L1 gene encodes the hSuv3 helicase, a crucial component of the mitochondrial degradosome, which is essential for mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) decay in human cells. This helicase, in conjunction with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), forms a complex responsible for the degradation of mtRNA, thereby regulating gene expression and removing RNA-processing by-products and malformed RNA molecules (Borowski2012Human). The hSuv3 helicase is ATP-dependent and can unwind various nucleic acid structures, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial RNA stability and integrity (Borowski2010RNA).

In healthy cells, the SUPV3L1 gene helps prevent the accumulation of mitochondrial dsRNA, which can activate an antiviral immune response if not properly degraded. This function is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and preventing neurodevelopmental disturbances (Green2024Biallelic). The hSuv3 helicase also plays a role in polyadenylation, affecting the length of poly(A) tails on mitochondrial transcripts, which may be linked to RNA degradation (Borowski2010RNA). Additionally, hSuv3 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity (Chen2023SUV3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SUPV3L1 gene, which encodes the SUV3 helicase, are associated with an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by variable leukodystrophy. This condition arises from aberrant mitochondrial double-stranded RNA processing, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the antiviral immune response. Patients with biallelic SUPV3L1 mutations exhibit a range of symptoms, including global developmental delay, microcephaly, motor delay, intellectual impairment, and spasticity. MRI findings often reveal abnormal white matter, cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, and abnormalities of the corpus callosum. Some patients experience episodes of developmental regression and seizures, with the severity of the condition varying among individuals (Green2024Biallelic).

The SUPV3L1 gene is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity by degrading double-stranded RNA molecules. Disruption in this gene leads to the accumulation of mitochondrial dsRNA, resulting in altered mitochondrial biogenesis and dysplastic microglia. This dysfunction can trigger immune responses, contributing to the disease pathology (Green2024Biallelic). Additionally, the SUV3 helicase is involved in RNA surveillance and degradation, and its dysfunction is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain cancers (Chen2023SUV3).

## Interactions
SUPV3L1, also known as Suv3 like RNA helicase, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), known as the mitochondrial degradosome, which is essential for mitochondrial RNA surveillance and degradation. This complex is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial RNA integrity by degrading aberrant or unneeded RNAs and processing primary transcripts into mature forms (Szczesny2009Human; Chen2023SUV3).

SUPV3L1 interacts with both double-stranded and single-stranded RNA, indicating its versatile role in RNA processing. It unwinds double-stranded nucleic acids in the 3' to 5' direction, which is vital for RNA degradation (Zhao2023Transcriptomewide; Szczesny2009Human). The helicase also participates in modulating mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation in response to cellular energy states, forming a transient complex with PNPase and mitochondrial polyadenylation polymerase (mtPAP) (Wang2014Helicase).

In addition to its mitochondrial functions, SUPV3L1 is found in the nucleus, where it interacts with proteins involved in chromatin maintenance and DNA repair, such as FEN1 and replication protein A (Stepien2017Human). These interactions highlight SUPV3L1's multifaceted role in cellular RNA and DNA metabolism.
