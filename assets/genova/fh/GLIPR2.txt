# GLIPR2

## Overview
GLIPR2, or GLI pathogenesis related 2, is a gene that encodes the protein GAPR-1, a member of the cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) superfamily. The GLIPR2 gene is involved in various cellular processes, including autophagy regulation and membrane dynamics. The protein GAPR-1 is characterized by its CAP domain, which facilitates its interaction with negatively charged lipids and its localization to the Golgi apparatus. GAPR-1 plays a significant role in cellular homeostasis by forming homo-dimers and amyloid-like assemblies, processes that are modulated by zinc ion binding. Functionally, GAPR-1 acts as a negative regulator of autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1, impacting cancer progression and fibrotic diseases. The expression of GLIPR2 is notably altered in pathological conditions, such as cancer and kidney fibrosis, where it is implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis (Sheng2019Zinc; Lin2024GLIPR2:; Baxter2007The).

## Structure
The GLIPR2 protein, also known as GAPR-1, is a member of the CAP superfamily and is characterized by the presence of a CAP domain. This domain is defined by four sequence motifs and exhibits a highly conserved tertiary structure with a unique α-ß-α sandwich fold (Sheng2019Zinc). The protein primarily localizes to lipid-enriched microdomains at the cytosolic leaflet of Golgi membranes and has a high affinity for membranes containing negatively charged lipids (Sheng2019Zinc).

GAPR-1 forms homo-dimers on liposomes and Golgi membranes, and its crystal structure reveals a dimeric arrangement with a near-continuous β-sheet that extends beyond the monomeric subunits (Sheng2019Zinc). Zinc binding to GAPR-1 induces conformational changes necessary for oligomer and amyloid-like assembly formation, with zinc ions coordinating through two conserved histidine residues, His54 and His103, in the CAP domain (Sheng2019Zinc). These structural changes are critical for the protein's function as a negative regulator of autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1 (Sheng2019Zinc).

The protein's secondary structure includes α-helical elements, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Sheng2019Zinc). The role of the CAP domain in the diverse functions of CAP proteins is suggested to involve protease activity, lipid binding, and regulation of protein oligomerization (Sheng2019Zinc). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of GAPR-1 are not provided in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
GLIPR2 (GLI pathogenesis related 2) has been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and kidney fibrosis. In kidney fibrosis, GLIPR2 is significantly upregulated in fibrotic tissues, especially in the glomeruli, proximal tubules, and collecting ducts. This upregulation is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to fibrosis by increasing the pool of activated fibroblasts. GLIPR2 expression correlates with areas of high α-smooth muscle actin expression, a marker of activated myofibroblasts, suggesting its role in the fibrotic process (Baxter2007The).

In cancer, GLIPR2 expression is generally reduced across various types, including lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. This reduction is linked to DNA methylation events that may lead to transcriptional silencing, contributing to tumorigenesis. In lung adenocarcinoma, higher GLIPR2 expression is associated with better prognosis and increased sensitivity to radiotherapy, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target. GLIPR2 is also involved in EMT in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, promoting tumor progression and metastasis (Lin2024GLIPR2:). These findings highlight GLIPR2's significance in both fibrotic and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
GLIPR2, also known as Golgi associated plant pathogenesis related protein-1 (GAPR1), is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Beclin 1, a key effector in the autophagy pathway, suggesting a role in negatively regulating autophagy by retaining Beclin 1 at the Golgi apparatus, thereby interfering with the initiation of autophagy (Sheng2019Zinc; Karanam2015miR551a). This interaction is crucial in the context of cancer, where GLIPR2 expression is inversely correlated with miR-551a and miR-551b-3p expression, impacting tumor growth and patient survival (Karanam2015miR551a).

GLIPR2 also has a high affinity for membranes containing negatively charged lipids and can form homo-dimers on liposomes and Golgi membranes. This property is linked to its ability to form amyloid-like fibrils upon prolonged incubation with negatively charged liposomes, a process regulated by zinc ion binding to specific histidine residues (Sheng2019Zinc). These interactions highlight GLIPR2's potential involvement in amyloid-related diseases and its structural role in cellular membranes. However, specific details on its interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond these contexts are not provided in the available literature.
