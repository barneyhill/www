# DOC2B

## Overview
DOC2B is a gene that encodes the protein double C2 domain beta, which is a member of the C2 domain-containing protein family. This protein functions primarily as a calcium sensor and plays a significant role in membrane trafficking and signal transduction. The DOC2B protein is characterized by its two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are crucial for calcium binding and membrane interactions, facilitating processes such as neurotransmitter release and vesicle priming (Giladi2013The; Xue2015Structural). Through its interactions with SNARE proteins and other molecular partners, DOC2B is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, as well as in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway (Houy2017Doc2B; Bhat2021Metastatic). Clinically, alterations in DOC2B expression have been associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2019DOC2B).

## Structure
The DOC2B protein is characterized by its two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are involved in calcium (Ca2+) sensing and membrane interactions. These domains are structurally similar, each consisting of approximately 130 residues organized in a sandwich of two 4-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (Giladi2013The). The C2B domain includes an additional α-helix between strands 7 and 8, distinguishing it from the C2A domain (Giladi2013The). 

The primary structure of DOC2B includes specific residues such as H158 and F222 in C2A, and A298 and I360 in C2B, which are important for membrane association and Ca2+ binding (Giladi2013The). The tertiary structure of the C2 domains is stabilized by Ca2+ binding, which occurs via conserved acidic residues in the inter-strand loops (Giladi2013The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the tandem C2AB domains exhibit a highly flexible orientation in solution, allowing for large conformational changes that facilitate membrane interactions (Giladi2013The). The presence of phospholipids stabilizes Ca2+ binding, slowing the dissociation rate and enhancing the protein's role in synaptic transmission (Giladi2013The). 

The DOC2B protein is involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction, with its structure playing a crucial role in its function as a Ca2+ sensor (Xue2015Structural).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DOC2B gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, particularly type 2 diabetes. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, DOC2B levels are reduced in skeletal muscle, which is associated with insulin resistance. This reduction in DOC2B impairs the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, a critical step for glucose uptake in cells (Zhang2019DOC2B). Overexpression of DOC2B in skeletal muscle has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, even in the context of a high-fat diet, suggesting that enhancing DOC2B levels could be a therapeutic strategy for combating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Zhang2019DOC2B).

Mutations in DOC2B can also disrupt its normal interactions, such as the Y301F mutation, which impairs the interaction between DOC2B and kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1). This disruption affects the insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4, further contributing to insulin resistance (Zhang2019DOC2B). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DOC2B in metabolic health and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in diabetes-related conditions.

## Interactions
DOC2B interacts with several proteins and possibly nucleic acids, primarily through its C2 domains. It binds to SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin-1, SNAP25, and VAMP2, facilitating neurotransmitter release and vesicle priming (Houy2017Doc2B; Bhat2021Metastatic). DOC2B also interacts with Munc13-1 and Munc13-2, which are crucial for synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release. This interaction is mediated by the Munc13-interacting domain (MID) in DOC2B, which is essential for recruiting Munc13-1 to the plasma membrane (Houy2017Doc2B; BourgeoisJaarsma2021Ca2+).

DOC2B's interaction with CDH1 and SNAI1 is calcium-dependent, and it localizes with CDH1 and CTNNB1 in the plasma membrane in DOC2B-overexpressing cells. This interaction represses β-catenin-induced TCF activation, part of the Wnt signaling pathway (Bhat2021Metastatic). DOC2B also interacts with the dynein light chain Tctex-1, although this interaction is not necessary for its inhibitory function on sustained release (Houy2017Doc2B).

The C2B domain of DOC2B has a poly-lysine stretch similar to synaptotagmin-1, crucial for its interaction with SNARE complexes and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Houy2017Doc2B). These interactions are vital for DOC2B's role in increasing the readily releasable pool of vesicles and its function as a calcium sensor.
