# TMEM238L

## Overview
TMEM238L is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 238-like, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and maintaining cellular structure. Transmembrane proteins like TMEM238L play crucial roles in facilitating communication between the cell's internal and external environments by spanning the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. The specific functions and interactions of TMEM238L are still under investigation, but it is believed to be part of complex signaling pathways that influence cellular behavior and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the role of TMEM238L and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease.
