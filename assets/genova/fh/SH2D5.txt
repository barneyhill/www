# SH2D5

## Overview
SH2D5 is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 5, which is involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its atypical SH2 domain, which suggests it may engage in unique interactions that do not rely on phosphotyrosine binding, potentially recognizing acidic residues instead (Gopalasingam2015SH2; Bajusz2023SH2db). SH2D5 has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in the context of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The protein's expression is upregulated by the Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and is involved in promoting HCC cell proliferation through interactions with transketolase (TKT) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Zheng2019Hepatitis). Due to its role in oncogenesis, SH2D5 is considered a potential therapeutic target for HBV-associated liver cancer.

## Clinical Significance
SH2D5 is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). The expression of SH2D5 is elevated in liver tissues of patients with HBV-associated HCC compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is induced by the Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) through the NF-κB and c-Jun kinase pathways, promoting HCC cell proliferation. SH2D5 interacts with transketolase (TKT), enhancing the interaction between TKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), leading to STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. This process contributes to the proliferation of HCC cells. High SH2D5 expression is correlated with poor overall survival in HBV-HCC patients and is associated with clinical features such as increased tumor size, metastasis, and malignant differentiation (Zheng2019Hepatitis).

The role of SH2D5 in oncogenesis highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Knockdown of SH2D5 using siRNA has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, suggesting that targeting SH2D5 could be a viable strategy for treating HBV-associated liver cancer (Zheng2019Hepatitis).

## Interactions
SH2D5 is involved in interactions that promote the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, particularly in the context of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The protein's expression is induced by the Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) through the NF-κB and c-Jun kinase pathways. SH2D5 interacts with transketolase (TKT), an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, facilitating the binding of TKT to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705, activating downstream signaling pathways that promote HCC cell proliferation (Zheng2019Hepatitis).

The SH2 domain of SH2D5 is atypical, containing a tryptophan residue in the βB5 position instead of the conserved arginine typically essential for phosphotyrosine binding. This suggests that SH2D5 may engage in non-phosphorylation dependent interactions, potentially recognizing acidic residues such as glutamate or aspartate, similar to other divergent SH2 domains (Gopalasingam2015SH2; Bajusz2023SH2db). These interactions highlight SH2D5's role in HBV-related HCC and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2019Hepatitis).
