# PGA3

## Overview
Pepsinogen A3 (PGA3) is a gene that encodes the precursor to the digestive enzyme pepsin, known as pepsinogen A3. This enzyme precursor is categorized as a zymogen, which is an inactive enzyme form that requires a biochemical change to become active. Pepsinogen A3 is synthesized and secreted by the chief cells of the gastric mucosa and is activated in the acidic environment of the stomach to form pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme crucial for protein digestion (Shen2020The). The activation of pepsinogen A3 involves a pH-dependent conformational change, which includes the removal of an activation peptide, allowing the enzyme to assume its active form (RICHTER1998Mechanism). The structure of pepsinogen A3 is characterized by a combination of β-sheets and α-helices, with a globular tertiary structure that facilitates its enzymatic function (Hartsuck1992The). Beyond its digestive role, PGA3 expression is linked to the differentiation of gastric mucosal cells and has potential implications in gastric cancer, making it a candidate for biomarker research (Shen2020The; Kouznetsova2011Selfrenewal).

## Structure
The PGA3 gene encodes pepsinogen A3, a precursor to the digestive enzyme pepsin. The primary structure of PGA3 includes specific amino acid sequences, with notable differences at positions 43 and 77, where PGA-3 has Glu and Val, respectively (Athauda1989A; Foltmann1988Activation). The secondary structure of pepsinogen A3 is characterized by a mix of β-sheets and α-helices, with the activation peptide being more helical and the pepsin part having more extended chains (Hartsuck1992The). The tertiary structure forms a globular shape, with the active site cavity formed by two compact domains exhibiting a twofold axis of symmetry (Hartsuck1992The). 

Upon activation, pepsinogen A3 undergoes a conformational change that involves the removal of the activation peptide, which is replaced by the mature N-terminus in a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (RICHTER1998Mechanism). This activation process is pH-dependent, occurring at low pH levels (RICHTER1998Mechanism). The quaternary structure involves the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin, which is facilitated by the cleavage of specific bonds, such as the Leu-Lys bond in PGA-3 (Athauda1989A).

## Function
Pepsinogen A3 (PGA3) is a precursor to the digestive enzyme pepsin, which plays a crucial role in the digestive processes of the stomach. In healthy human cells, PGA3 is primarily synthesized by the chief cells of the gastric mucosa. These cells store PGA3 in zymogen granules and secrete it into the gastric cavity, where it is activated into pepsin in the acidic environment of gastric juice. This activation is essential for the breakdown of proteins into peptides, facilitating nutrient absorption and overall digestive health (Shen2020The; Kouznetsova2011Selfrenewal).

PGA3 expression is associated with the differentiation and maturation of gastric mucosal cells, indicating its role in the maturity of digestive function (Shen2020The). The expression of PGA3 is enriched in specific regions of the gastric fundic units, particularly in mature mucous neck cells and chief cells, suggesting its involvement in the stepwise maturation of these cells (Kouznetsova2011Selfrenewal). While PGA3 is primarily known for its role in digestion, its expression in normal tissues also correlates with the occurrence of gastric cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for screening (Shen2020The).
