# KANTR

## Overview
KANTR is a gene that encodes the KANTR integral membrane protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The KANTR protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication across the cell membrane. It is implicated in several signaling pathways and is essential for the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions, although specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is necessary to understand the complete range of activities and regulatory mechanisms associated with KANTR (Qiu2020aarFDC).
