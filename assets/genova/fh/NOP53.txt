# NOP53

## Overview
NOP53 is a gene that encodes the NOP53 ribosome biogenesis factor, a protein primarily involved in the assembly and maturation of ribosomal subunits. This protein is categorized as a ribosome assembly factor and is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a critical role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. NOP53 facilitates the transition of ribosomal particles from the nucleolar to the nucleoplasmic stages, which is essential for the proper assembly of ribosomes. Structurally, the NOP53 protein contains a central coiled-coil domain and a leucine zipper motif, which are important for its interactions with other proteins and its function in ribosome biogenesis (SYDORSKYY2005Nop53p). Additionally, NOP53 is involved in maintaining chromosomal stability during cell division and has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and response to treatment (Lee2018Downregulation; Shi2022NOP53).

## Structure
The NOP53 protein, also known as Nop53p, is involved in ribosome biogenesis and is primarily localized to the nucleolus. It contains a large central coiled-coil domain, a structural feature commonly found in myosin heavy chains, which suggests a role in protein-protein interactions (SYDORSKYY2005Nop53p). The C-terminal region of Nop53p, spanning approximately amino acid residues 380-450, includes a leucine zipper motif (residues 402-434), which is important for its function, as deletion of this region results in a less severe growth defect compared to the complete deletion of the protein (SYDORSKYY2005Nop53p).

Structurally, Nop53 interacts with the nuclear exosome helicase Mtr4 through its AIM motif, which is located in the N-terminal region (residues 48-99). This interaction is crucial for the maturation of the 5.8S rRNA, linking the nuclear exosome to the pre-60S ribonucleoprotein particles (Falk2017Structural). The AIM motif of Nop53 binds to the KOW domain of Mtr4, forming a β-strand that interacts through hydrophobic and salt-bridge interactions (Falk2017Structural). This interaction highlights the specificity of Nop53 in ribosome assembly processes.

## Function
NOP53, also known as the NOP53 ribosome biogenesis factor, plays a crucial role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a key component of ribosome biogenesis. It is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it is involved in the transition from nucleolar to nucleoplasmic stages of ribosome assembly. NOP53 facilitates the transition from the nucleolar state E particle to the nuclear Nog2 particle, which is essential for the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit (Bagatelli2021The). 

NOP53 is also involved in the recruitment of the RNA exosome for the cleavage of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), a critical step for the disassembly of the pre-60S 'foot' structure (Bagatelli2021The). Its depletion leads to defects in ribosome biogenesis, including the accumulation of pre-rRNA intermediates and impaired recruitment of assembly factors such as Yvh1, which is crucial for late nuclear/cytoplasmic maturation events (Bagatelli2021The; SYDORSKYY2005Nop53p).

In addition to its role in ribosome assembly, NOP53 is implicated in maintaining chromosomal stability during cell division. It localizes to the nucleolus during interphase and associates with chromosomes during mitosis, contributing to proper mitotic progression and nuclear architecture (Lee2018Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NOP53 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC), a specific variant, c.91G > C; p. Asp31His, has been identified in affected family members, suggesting a potential oncogenic role. This variant was not found in unaffected spouses, indicating its possible association with the disease. Functional studies showed that knockdown of NOP53 reduced cell proliferation, while overexpression increased proliferation, supporting its oncogenic behavior in thyroid cancer (Orois2019NOP53).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), high expression of NOP53 is associated with poor prognosis and radio-resistance. NOP53 promotes tumor radio-resistance by suppressing the p53 pathway, which is crucial for DNA damage response. Silencing NOP53 sensitizes CRC cells to radiation, suggesting its role in enhancing tumor survival under radiotherapy (Shi2022NOP53).

In ovarian cancer, NOP53 is downregulated in invasive serous ovarian tumors compared to benign tissues, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role. Its expression is affected by treatments like olaparib, and its interactions with proteins such as HMGB2 may influence cancer progression and drug response (CámaraQuílez2020The).

## Interactions
NOP53, a ribosome assembly factor, plays a crucial role in the formation and maturation of pre-60S ribosomal subunits. It interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, facilitating various stages of ribosome biogenesis. NOP53 is known to interact with the RNA helicase Mtr4 through a specific motif called the arch-interacting motif (AIM). This interaction is essential for directing the nuclear exosome to preribosomal RNP substrates, aiding in the maturation of 5.8S rRNA (Falk2017Structural).

NOP53 also associates with multiple proteins within the pre-60S ribosomal particles, including Nop7, Rlp7, eL8, uL29, and uL23, suggesting its role as a scaffold connecting different regions of the pre-60S particle (Bagatelli2021The). The depletion of NOP53 affects the recruitment of several assembly factors, such as Rsa4 and Arx1, to the pre-60S intermediates, indicating its importance in the transition from nucleolar state E to the nuclear Nog2 particle (Bagatelli2021The).

Additionally, NOP53 is involved in the recruitment of the Mtr4-associated exosome complex for processing 7S pre-rRNA, highlighting its role in RNA processing and ribosome assembly (Bagatelli2021The). The interactions of NOP53 with these proteins and complexes underscore its critical function in ribosome biogenesis.
