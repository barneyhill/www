# CCL24

## Overview
CCL24, also known as eotaxin-2, is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 24, a member of the CC chemokine family. This protein is primarily involved in immune response regulation, functioning as a chemokine that binds to the CCR3 receptor on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells, thereby facilitating their recruitment to sites of inflammation (Zlotnik2012The). CCL24 plays a significant role in allergic reactions and asthma, as well as in reproductive biology, where it influences trophoblast proliferation and invasiveness during early pregnancy (Li2015Chemokine). Beyond its physiological roles, CCL24 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including fibrosis and cancer, through its interactions with CCR3 and involvement in signaling pathways that promote inflammation and tissue remodeling (Parthiban2024Macrophagederived; Greenman2023CCL24). The protein's structure, characterized by a conserved N-terminal region and a combination of α-helix and β-sheet formations, is crucial for its stability and function (Ge2017Kinetic).

## Structure
CCL24, also known as eotaxin-2, is a chemokine that plays a role in immune responses. It belongs to the CC chemokine family, characterized by two adjacent cysteines near the amino terminus. The tertiary structure of CCL24 is almost identical to that of CCL11, another member of the same family, despite having less than 40% sequence similarity. This structure includes an unstructured N-terminus, a C-terminal α-helix, and three anti-parallel β-sheets. The disordered N-terminal region and a groove structure formed by the β2 and β3 sheet regions are highly conserved and crucial for receptor binding and activation (Ge2017Kinetic).

Circular dichroism analysis indicates the presence of both α-helix and β-sheet structures in CCL24, with a stronger signal at 222 nm suggesting a slightly longer α-helix compared to CCL11 (Ge2017Kinetic). The folding and unfolding kinetics of CCL24 reveal different pathways compared to CCL11, with CCL24 being more thermodynamically stable. The presence of disulfide bonds is crucial for stabilizing the protein structure, and their removal leads to structural instability (Ge2017Kinetic). The study does not provide specific details on the primary structure, quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of CCL24.

## Function
CCL24, also known as eotaxin-2, is a chemokine involved in various molecular processes that regulate immune responses. It primarily functions by binding to the CCR3 receptor, which is expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 cells, facilitating the recruitment of these cells to sites of inflammation (Zlotnik2012The). This chemotactic activity is crucial in allergic reactions and asthma, where CCL24 directs eosinophils to inflamed tissues, contributing to the immune response (Dyer2015Physiologic).

In the context of human early pregnancy, CCL24 plays a significant role in promoting the growth and invasiveness of trophoblasts, which are essential for successful embryo implantation. It enhances trophoblast proliferation and viability through the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K signaling pathways, with Ki67 being a key protein involved in this process (Li2015Chemokine). CCL24 also increases the production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), aiding in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix and facilitating trophoblast invasiveness (Li2015Chemokine).

CCL24's involvement in these processes highlights its dual role in both immune regulation and reproductive biology, underscoring its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and supporting early pregnancy development.

## Clinical Significance
CCL24, also known as eotaxin-2, is implicated in several inflammatory and fibrotic diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. Overexpression of CCL24 is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), systemic sclerosis (SSc), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In these conditions, CCL24 promotes cell trafficking and regulates proinflammatory and profibrotic activities through the C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CCR3) (Mor2024Targeting).

In PSC, CCL24 is highly expressed in immune cells and bile duct epithelium, contributing to biliary inflammation and fibrosis. It activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and induces their transition to myofibroblasts, a key process in fibrosis (Greenman2024The; Greenman2023CCL24). Elevated serum levels of CCL24 are linked to cirrhosis in PSC patients, with higher levels indicating increased disease severity (Snir2024Machine).

In systemic sclerosis, CCL24 is elevated in circulation and skin, where it is associated with fibroblast activation and differentiation into myofibroblasts, contributing to skin and lung fibrosis (Mor2019Blockade). CCL24 is also involved in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where its expression correlates with liver fibrosis and inflammation (SegalSalto2020A). Blocking CCL24 with monoclonal antibodies like CM-101 has shown potential in reducing inflammation and fibrosis in these diseases (Greenman2024The; SegalSalto2020A).

## Interactions
CCL24, also known as eotaxin-2, primarily interacts with the CCR3 receptor, which is expressed on eosinophils, basophils, and Th2 lymphocytes. This interaction facilitates chemotaxis, particularly in the recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation (Dai2016A). In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCL24 is involved in the RhoB-VEGFA-VEGFR2 angiogenesis pathway, where it influences the expression of VEGFA and promotes neovascularization through interactions with RhoB (Jin2016CCL24). 

In primary sclerosing cholangitis, CCL24 is overexpressed in the liver and interacts with CCR3 on cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and macrophages. This interaction leads to the activation of hepatic stellate cells and their transition to myofibroblasts, contributing to fibrosis (Greenman2023CCL24). In heart failure, CCL24 interacts with CCR3 on cardiac fibroblasts and endothelial cells, promoting fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction through the activation of fibrotic markers and the involvement of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFß) (Parthiban2024Macrophagederived). 

These interactions highlight CCL24's role in various pathological processes, including inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer progression, through its binding to CCR3 and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways.
