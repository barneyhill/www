# NDUFB2

## Overview
NDUFB2 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B2, a transmembrane protein that is an integral component of mitochondrial complex I, the largest enzyme of the electron transport chain. This protein is located at the 'toe' of the complex I membrane arm and plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of the complex, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The NDUFB2 protein interacts with several other subunits within complex I, contributing to its structural integrity and function. The gene is also involved in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, as it contains a highly conserved CHOP element in its promoter that is upregulated in response to unfolded proteins (Padavannil2022The). Alterations in the expression of NDUFB2 have been associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and paranoid personality disorder, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Haghighatfard2017Gene).

## Structure
The NDUFB2 protein is a single transmembrane helix (TMH) subunit located at the 'toe' of the Complex I (CI) membrane arm. Its primary structure includes a specific sequence of amino acids that form a single TMH, which is crucial for its integration into the mitochondrial membrane (Padavannil2022The). The secondary structure of NDUFB2 involves the formation of this transmembrane helix, which interacts with other subunits within the complex. The N-terminal coil of NDUFB2 interacts with NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB3, and ND5 in the mitochondrial matrix, while its C-terminal coil interacts with ND5 and NDUFB7 in the intermembrane space (IMS) (Padavannil2022The).

In terms of tertiary structure, NDUFB2's TMH binds between TMH12 ND5 and TMH14 ND5, interacting with the extended loop of the broken TMH12 ND5, which is essential for its structural role within the complex (Padavannil2022The). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with other subunits, contributing to the assembly and stability of Complex I. NDUFB2 is also involved in supercomplex formation, interacting with Complex IV (CIV) via COX8B, which highlights its role in the biogenesis of Complex I (Padavannil2022The). The NDUFB2 gene contains a highly conserved CHOP element in its promoter, which is upregulated in response to unfolded proteins, indicating its involvement in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFB2 is a transmembrane subunit of mitochondrial complex I, located at the tip of the toe of the complex I membrane arm. It plays a crucial role in the assembly of the P_D-b subassembly by interacting with core subunit ND5 and accessory subunits such as NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB3, NDUFB7, NDUFB8, and NDUFB9. In the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal coil of NDUFB2 interacts with NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB3, and ND5, while its transmembrane helix binds between TMH12 ND5 and TMH14 ND5. In the intermembrane space, its C-terminal coil interacts with ND5 and NDUFB7 (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB2 is essential for the proper assembly and function of complex I, as knockout of NDUFB2 in HEK293T cells results in severe assembly defects and a decrease in the abundance of P_D-b and N subassembly subunits. The gene contains a highly conserved CHOP element in its promoter, which is upregulated in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, thereby inducing the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. These interactions and regulatory mechanisms are vital for maintaining complex I activity and stability, which are crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Padavannil2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The NDUFB2 gene, encoding a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of certain psychiatric disorders. Alterations in the expression of NDUFB2 have been linked to schizophrenia (SCZ) and paranoid personality disorder (PPD). In a study involving chronic patients with these conditions, NDUFB2 was found to be up-regulated, with a significant P-value of 0.0002, suggesting its involvement in the disorders' molecular mechanisms (Haghighatfard2017Gene). This up-regulation was observed in both SCZ and PPD patients compared to non-psychiatric controls, indicating a potential role in the etiology of these psychiatric conditions (Haghighatfard2017Gene).

While the study by Haghighatfard et al. highlights the gene's altered expression in psychiatric disorders, there is no direct evidence from the provided context linking NDUFB2 mutations to specific mitochondrial diseases. However, given the gene's role in mitochondrial complex I, it is plausible that mutations or dysfunctions could contribute to broader mitochondrial disorders, impacting energy production and leading to neurodegenerative conditions. The clinical significance of NDUFB2 in mitochondrial disorders remains an area for further research, as the current context does not provide detailed information on specific diseases caused by its mutations.

## Interactions
NDUFB2 is a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I (CI), specifically located at the 'toe' of the CI membrane arm. It is part of the P_D-b subassembly, interacting with other subunits such as NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB3, and ND5. In the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal coil of NDUFB2 interacts with NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB3, and ND5. Its transmembrane helix (TMH) is positioned between TMH12 ND5 and TMH14 ND5, engaging with the extended loop of the broken TMH12 ND5. On the intermembrane space (IMS) side, the C-terminal coil of NDUFB2 interacts with ND5 and NDUFB7 (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB2 is crucial for the assembly of complex I, as knockout studies in HEK293T cells have shown severe defects in CI assembly and a reduction in the abundance of P_D-b and N subassembly subunits. The interactions between NDUFB2 and NDUFB3 are particularly important for CI activity. A point mutation in NDUFB3 (W22R B3) disrupts these interactions, leading to CI deficiency (Padavannil2022The). NDUFB2 also contains a highly conserved CHOP element in its promoter, which is upregulated in response to unfolded proteins, indicating its involvement in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Padavannil2022The).
