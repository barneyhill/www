# ZSCAN25

## Overview
ZSCAN25 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 25 protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in binding to DNA, and a SCAN domain, which is implicated in protein-protein interactions. The ZSCAN25 protein plays a role in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and potentially influencing drug metabolism. It has been studied in the context of several clinical conditions, such as intellectual disabilities and melanoma, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological and pathological states (Mir2019Advances; Sohn2018Whole; Shi2023Distinct; Jacobs2021Differential).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN25 has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in transcriptional regulation. Alterations in DNA methylation at specific CpG-sites within ZSCAN25 have been associated with emotional and behavioral problems in children. A study found that early parenteral nutrition in the pediatric intensive care unit led to adverse DNA methylation changes at these sites, which were linked to emotional and behavioral issues four years later (Jacobs2021Differential).

In the context of intellectual disabilities, ZSCAN25 has been identified as a novel candidate gene for autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID) through whole exome sequencing in consanguineous families. However, the specific clinical significance or functional role of ZSCAN25 in ARID remains to be fully elucidated (Mir2019Advances).

ZSCAN25 has also been associated with tacrolimus dose-adjusted trough concentrations in kidney transplant patients. Variants of ZSCAN25, such as rs1859690 and rs3735453, have shown significant associations with tacrolimus concentrations at various time points post-transplantation, suggesting a potential role in drug metabolism (Sohn2018Whole).

Additionally, ZSCAN25 has been identified in a gene fusion with BRAF in acral melanomas, indicating its involvement in the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma subtypes (Shi2023Distinct).
