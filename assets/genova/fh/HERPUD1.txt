# HERPUD1

## Overview
HERPUD1 is a gene that encodes the homocysteine-inducible endoplasmic reticulum protein with ubiquitin-like domain 1, commonly referred to as Herp. This protein is a transmembrane component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for the removal of misfolded proteins from the ER. Herp is characterized by a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at its N-terminus, which is integral to its function in protein degradation processes (kny2010molecular). The protein is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by interacting with various ERAD components and is upregulated in response to ER stress, participating in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Kim2008Herp; Schulze2005The). Additionally, HERPUD1 has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including calcium homeostasis, autophagy regulation, and cellular stress responses, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Vargas2022Negative; Paredes2016HERPUD1).

## Structure
The HERPUD1 protein, also known as Herp, is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consisting of 391 amino acids. It features a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of ubiquitin domain proteins (UDPs) and is crucial for its role in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (kny2010molecular). The UBL domain is involved in the oligomerization and activation of the E3 ligase POSH upon calcium perturbation (kny2010molecular). Herp interacts with proteins such as p97 and Derlin-1, forming part of a complex with other ERAD components like HRD1 and VIMP (Schulze2005The).

Herp is ubiquitinated, with POSH adding K63-linked polyubiquitin, although the specific E2 or E3 enzymes responsible for other ubiquitination processes are not fully identified (kny2010molecular). The UBL domain does not interact with the 26S proteasome, unlike other UBL-containing proteins, suggesting a unique role within the ERAD pathway (schulze2007role). Herp is rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, indicating its instability and continuous exchange in Synoviolin-based complexes (kny2010molecular). A splice variant, Herp2, lacks amino acids 49-70, but further data on Herp2 is limited (kny2010molecular).

## Function
HERPUD1, also known as Herp, is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is primarily involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for the elimination of misfolded proteins. HERPUD1 interacts with components of the ERAD machinery, such as the ubiquitin protein ligase HRD1, to facilitate the retrotranslocation and degradation of these proteins (Kim2008Herp; Schulze2005The).

HERPUD1 is upregulated in response to ER stress and is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), helping to stabilize ER calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. It forms complexes with Ca2+ channels like the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RYR), promoting their degradation and thus regulating ER Ca2+ release (Chan2004Herp; Paredes2016HERPUD1). This regulation is crucial for preventing excessive Ca2+ influx, which can lead to cellular stress or apoptosis (Paredes2016HERPUD1).

HERPUD1 also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy by promoting the proteasomal degradation of Beclin-1, a key autophagy protein (Vargas2022Negative). Its role in cellular stress responses includes protecting against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by modulating Ca2+ signaling pathways (Paredes2016HERPUD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HERPUD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in cancer and cardiac health. In ovarian cancer, HERPUD1 is significantly expressed in cancer cell lines and is involved in promoting cell survival by sustaining autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Knockdown of HERPUD1 leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer cell survival (Nie2022HERPUD1). HERPUD1 mutations are present in a small percentage of ovarian cancer patients and are associated with longer progression-free survival, although they do not significantly affect overall survival (Nie2022HERPUD1).

In lung adenocarcinoma, HERPUD1 expression is downregulated, and low expression levels are associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. HERPUD1 overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Xiao2023HERPUD1).

HERPUD1 also plays a role in cardiac health by regulating intracellular calcium levels. It negatively regulates pathological cardiac hypertrophy by inducing the degradation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, which is involved in calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This regulation is crucial for preventing cardiac hypertrophy and maintaining myocardial function (Torrealba2017Herpud1).

## Interactions
HERPUD1, also known as Herp, is involved in several interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It forms a complex with key ERAD components such as HRD1, Derlin-1, VIMP, and p97, but does not directly associate with the proteasome or calnexin (Schulze2005The). HERPUD1 interacts with the 26S proteasome and ubiquitinated substrates, suggesting it may act as a bridge to direct proteins to ubiquitin ligases and/or the proteasome for degradation (OkudaShimizu2007Characterization). The protein also interacts with members of the ubiquilin family, including ubiquilin-1, ubiquilin-2, and ubiquilin-4, which function as shuttle factors to deliver ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome (Kim2008Herp).

HERPUD1 is polyubiquitylated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78, which is crucial for its degradation during ER stress recovery. This interaction involves the UBL domain of HERPUD1 and the CUE domain of gp78 (Yan2014Ube2g2gp78mediated). HERPUD1 also forms a complex with Derlin-1, Hrd1, and p97, which are components of the retrotranslocon involved in the degradation of certain substrates (OkudaShimizu2007Characterization). These interactions highlight HERPUD1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in protein degradation pathways.
