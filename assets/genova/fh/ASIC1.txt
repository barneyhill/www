# ASIC1

## Overview
The ASIC1 gene encodes the acid-sensing ion channel subunit 1, a critical component of the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which are proton-gated ion channels involved in detecting extracellular pH changes. These channels are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and play a vital role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The ASIC1 protein is a transmembrane receptor that forms a homotrimeric structure, essential for its function in responding to pH fluctuations by opening or closing the channel pore (Jasti2007Structure; Baconguis2014XRay). The protein's extracellular domain is crucial for proton sensing and interaction with various toxins, contributing to its role in neuronal signaling and potential involvement in neurological disorders (Wu2021Structure). ASIC1's interactions with other proteins and its regulation through post-translational modifications further underscore its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders (Zha2006Acid-sensing; Leonard2003cAMPdependent).

## Structure
The ASIC1 protein is a component of acid-sensing ion channels, which are involved in detecting extracellular pH changes. The primary structure of ASIC1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Jasti2007Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, ASIC1 forms a homotrimer, with each subunit contributing to the channel pore. This trimeric assembly is essential for the channel's function, allowing it to respond to changes in pH by opening or closing the pore (Baconguis2014XRay). The protein contains an extracellular domain (ECD) that is critical for proton sensing and toxin binding. This domain adopts a fist-like conformation with distinct subdomains, including the thumb, palm, and knuckle regions, which are involved in channel gating and interaction with toxins (Wu2021Structure; Baconguis2014XRay).

ASIC1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its function. Splice variant isoforms of ASIC1 may exist, potentially altering the channel's properties and its response to environmental changes (Jasti2007Structure).

## Function
ASIC1, specifically the ASIC1a subunit, functions as a proton-gated ion channel primarily involved in detecting extracellular pH changes. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and plays a significant role in synaptic function and plasticity. ASIC1a is localized in dendritic spines, where it acts as a postsynaptic proton receptor, influencing the density of these spines, which are crucial for excitatory neurotransmission (Zha2006Acid-sensing; Zha2013Acidsensing).

Activation of ASIC1a by protons leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, primarily through Na+ influx and subsequent activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. This calcium signaling is crucial for the phosphorylation of CaMKII, a kinase involved in spine formation and growth, thereby affecting synaptic plasticity and learning processes (Zha2006Acid-sensing; Zha2013Acidsensing).

ASIC1a also interacts with various proteins that regulate its function and expression, such as α-Actinin-4 and AKAP150, which modulate its current properties and synaptic localization (Zha2013Acidsensing). These interactions and the channel's activity are essential for maintaining normal neuronal signaling and may have implications in conditions characterized by altered spine density and synaptic dysfunction (Zha2006Acid-sensing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ASIC1 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, ASIC1a activation is associated with neuronal damage and protein aggregation. Blocking ASIC1a with inhibitors like amiloride has shown protective effects in models of these diseases, suggesting its involvement in their pathogenesis (Liu2015Acidsensing; Cherninskyi2022Triggering). In ischemic stroke, ASIC1a contributes to neuronal injury through calcium influx during acidosis, and its inhibition can reduce neuronal damage (Gao2005Coupling; Chu2013AcidSensing).

ASIC1 is also linked to psychiatric conditions. While direct evidence in humans is limited, ASIC1a inhibition has been shown to reduce depression-like behavior in animal models (Cherninskyi2022Triggering). Genetic variations in ASIC1a are associated with panic responses, indicating a potential role in anxiety disorders (Cherninskyi2022Triggering).

In spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), knocking down ASIC1a in mouse models improved motor deficits and reduced neuronal degeneration, highlighting its contribution to the disease phenotype (Vig2014Knockdown). These findings underscore ASIC1's potential as a therapeutic target in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
ASIC1, a subunit of acid-sensing ion channels, participates in several protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. In glioma cells, ASIC1 interacts with epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits, specifically ␣ENaC and ␥ENaC, to form a hybrid channel complex. This interaction is crucial for mediating an amiloride-sensitive cation current, which is significant in the pathology of glioblastoma multiforme (Kapoor2011Interaction).

ASIC1 also interacts with the protein interacting with C-kinase-1 (PICK1) through its C-terminal region, which contains a PDZ binding motif. This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation of ASIC1 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at the Ser-479 site, reducing PICK1 binding by 40% (Leonard2003cAMPdependent). In pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, ASIC1 forms a signaling complex with PICK1 and calcineurin, facilitating calcium influx and NFATc3 nuclear translocation, which are important for vascular remodeling (Gonzalez2016ASIC1mediated).

ASIC1a, a variant of ASIC1, has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with GABA A receptors, indicating a physical interaction that affects the function of both proteins. This interaction suggests a role in synaptic plasticity and pain sensation (Zhao2014Identification).
