# CSF1

## Overview
The CSF1 gene encodes the colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) protein, a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of macrophage production, differentiation, and function. As a member of the cytokine family, CSF1 typically forms a homodimer, characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, which is essential for its biological activity. The protein interacts with its receptor, CSF-1R, a tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene, to mediate various cellular processes, including the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. CSF1 is crucial for tissue homeostasis, development, and repair, influencing processes such as skeletal morphogenesis and vascular remodeling. Alterations in the CSF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including cancers and inflammatory disorders, underscoring its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Achkova2016Role; Mouchemore2012CSF-1).

## Structure
The CSF1 protein, also known as colony stimulating factor 1, is a cytokine that typically forms a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of a four-helix bundle, a structural motif common among cytokines (Zur2017Engineering). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function (Zur2017Engineering). 

The primary structure of CSF1 includes a cysteine at position 31, which is crucial for dimerization through the formation of a disulfide bond, stabilizing the dimeric form of the protein (Zur2017Engineering). The secondary structure is characterized by the four-helix bundle, which is a common feature in cytokines, providing a stable framework for receptor interaction (Zur2017Engineering).

In terms of quaternary structure, CSF1 typically exists as a homodimer, which is essential for its biological activity, particularly in binding to the c-FMS receptor and inducing receptor dimerization and activation (Zur2017Engineering). Alternative splicing of the CSF1 gene results in multiple isoforms, which may vary in their biological activity and cellular localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Zur2017Engineering).

## Function
CSF1, or colony stimulating factor 1, is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of macrophage production, differentiation, and function in healthy human cells. It operates through its receptor, CSF-1R, which is a tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene. This interaction is essential for the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts (Rettenmier1988The; Mouchemore2012CSF-1).

CSF1 is involved in various cellular processes, such as DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, particularly in bone marrow-derived macrophages. It is necessary for these cells to transition from a quiescent state to an active growth state, supporting their entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (Tushinski1985The). CSF1 also enhances macrophage functions like phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and cytokine production, contributing to immune responses and inflammation regulation (Chitu2006Colonystimulating).

In terms of organismal outcomes, CSF1 is vital for tissue homeostasis, development, and repair. It supports macrophage functions in development, tissue repair, and immune surveillance, and is involved in processes such as skeletal morphogenesis and vascular remodeling (Stanley1997Biology; Mouchemore2012CSF-1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CSF1 gene, which encodes the colony-stimulating factor 1, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and inflammatory disorders. In tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TSGCT), CSF1 gene fusions are prevalent and contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. These fusions are a common feature in TSGCT, with a high prevalence of CSF1 fusions identified in tumor samples (Tsuda2019Massively).

The CSF1/CSF1R axis is also implicated in several human cancers, including breast, ovarian, and other types. Elevated serum levels of CSF1 have been observed in breast, ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma. The oncogenic potential of the CSF1/CSF1R axis is attributed to the co-expression of the growth factor and its receptor, which can be activated in an autocrine or paracrine manner. This axis is linked to poor prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and survival rates in breast cancer, and it enhances tumor invasiveness and motility in ovarian cancer (Achkova2016Role).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of CSF1 gene alterations in the development and progression of various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CSF1, also known as Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF), interacts with its receptor CSF-1R, encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene, to form a multiprotein complex upon stimulation. This complex includes c-Cbl, PI 3-kinase, Crk-II, and Grb2. c-Cbl acts as a core protein, interacting independently with Crk, Grb2, and PI 3-kinase. The interaction between Grb2 and c-Cbl is mediated by a SH3/proline-rich interaction, while c-Cbl is phosphorylated to interact with PI 3-kinase and Crk-II via SH2 domains. Grb2 links to the phosphorylated Tyr 699 of CSF-1R (Husson1997CSF1).

CSF1 also forms a complex with the CSF-1R, where the receptor's D4 domains dimerize, forming salt bridges crucial for receptor activation. This interaction is similar to those seen in other receptor tyrosine kinases like KIT and VEGFR (Felix2015Structure). The structural plasticity of CSF1 allows it to adopt active and inactive conformations, influencing its binding to CSF-1R and the formation of the signaling complex (Felix2015Structure). The immunomodulatory viral protein BARF1 can bind to CSF1, preventing its interaction with CSF-1R, demonstrating an allosteric modulation mechanism (Felix2015Structure).
