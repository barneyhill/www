# NOS1

## Overview
The NOS1 gene encodes the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which is a member of the nitric oxide synthase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in neuronal tissues and plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), a critical signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. nNOS is characterized as a bidomain enzyme with distinct oxygenase and reductase domains, and it requires cofactors such as NADPH and tetrahydrobiopterin for its activity. The enzyme's function is modulated by calcium and calmodulin, as well as by interactions with other proteins through its PDZ domain, which influences its subcellular localization and activity. nNOS is involved in the regulation of blood flow and neural signaling, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders (Zhou2009Neuronal; Förstermann1998Expressional; ALDERTON2001Nitric).

## Structure
The NOS1 gene encodes neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key enzyme responsible for producing nitric oxide in neuronal tissues. The protein consists of 1434 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 160.8 kDa (Zhou2009Neuronal). Structurally, nNOS has a bidomain configuration with an oxygenase domain at the N-terminal and a reductase domain at the C-terminal, separated by a calmodulin-binding motif (Zhou2009Neuronal). The oxygenase domain binds L-arginine and contains sites for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and cytochrome P-450-type heme, as well as a zinc binding site that aids in dimerization (Zhou2009Neuronal). The reductase domain binds NADPH and contains sites for FMN and FAD (Zhou2009Neuronal).

nNOS also contains a PDZ domain, which allows interaction with other PDZ domain-containing proteins, influencing its subcellular localization and activity (Zhou2009Neuronal). The enzyme typically forms a homodimer, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Sharma2016Posttranslational). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and S-nitrosylation, regulate nNOS activity (Sharma2016Posttranslational). The NOS1 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including nNOSα, nNOSβ, nNOSγ, nNOSµ, and nNOS-2, each with distinct structural and functional properties (ALDERTON2001Nitric).

## Function
NOS1, also known as neuronal nitric oxide synthase, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the production of nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, NOS1 is primarily active in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it contributes to neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (Förstermann1998Expressional). The enzyme is constitutively expressed and regulated by calcium and calmodulin, which modulate its activity (Förstermann1998Expressional).

NOS1 is involved in the oxidation of L-arginine to produce NO and L-citrulline, a reaction that requires molecular oxygen and NADPH as cofactors (Michel1997Nitric). The NO produced by NOS1 acts as a neuromodulator, influencing neural activity by altering intracellular calcium levels through cyclic GMP-gated ion channels (Neufeld2000Cellular). This activity is crucial for processes such as vasodilation and neurotransmission, impacting blood flow regulation and synaptic signaling (Förstermann1998Expressional).

The enzyme's activity is also modulated by interactions with other proteins, such as PSD-95, which link NOS1 to NMDA receptor stimulation, further influencing synaptic function (ALDERTON2001Nitric). NOS1's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions in the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOS1 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. In schizophrenia, NOS1 is considered a risk gene, with genetic studies showing associations between NOS1 variants and the disorder. Altered NOS1 expression in the prefrontal cortex has been linked to cognitive impairments and schizophrenia, with some studies suggesting reduced expression as a compensatory mechanism (Shinkai2002Allelic; Freudenberg2015Neuronal). NOS1 is also associated with major depression, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), though evidence is mixed and often involves interactions with environmental factors (Freudenberg2015Neuronal).

NOS1 mutations have been identified in congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), leading to sensory and cognitive deficits. These mutations occur in critical sub-regions of the gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Chachlaki2022NOS1). In restless legs syndrome (RLS), variants in the NOS1 gene have been associated with the disorder, implicating the NO/arginine pathway in its pathogenesis (Winkelmann2007Variants). NOS1 is also linked to impulsivity and related disorders, with certain polymorphisms associated with impulsive behaviors and conditions like ADHD and Parkinson's disease (Freudenberg2015Neuronal).

## Interactions
NOS1, or neuronal nitric oxide synthase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It interacts with the adaptor protein CAPON, which facilitates its localization and function in cardiac tissues. This interaction is significant for the redistribution of NOS1 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane following myocardial infarction, where it plays a protective role by inhibiting L-type calcium currents (Beigi2009Cardiac).

In the central nervous system, NOS1 interacts with postsynaptic density proteins such as PSD-95 and PSD-93 through its PDZ domain. These interactions are essential for the subcellular localization of NOS1 and its association with the NMDA receptor complex, which is important for calcium influx and nitric oxide production (Brenman1996Interaction; Freudenberg2015Neuronal). NOS1 also binds to α1-syntrophin, linking it to the dystrophin complex in muscle tissues, which is crucial for its localization at the sarcolemma (Brenman1996Interaction).

In renal tissues, NOS1 interacts with dynamin isoforms, particularly DNM2 and DNM3, which regulate nitric oxide production in the inner medullary collecting ducts. This interaction is facilitated by the reductase domain of NOS1 and is important for renal functions such as natriuresis and diuresis (Hyndman2011Dynamin).
