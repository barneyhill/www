# DPH7

## Overview
DPH7 is a gene that encodes the protein diphthamide biosynthesis 7, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of histidine in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This protein is categorized as a demethylase, as it catalyzes the demethylation step necessary for converting methylated diphthine into diphthine, a precursor in the diphthamide synthesis pathway. The activity of DPH7 is essential for maintaining translational fidelity and proper protein synthesis, as diphthamide is crucial for preventing ribosomal frameshifting and ensuring accurate protein translation. In humans, the homolog of DPH7 is known as WDR85, which performs a similar function in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway (Uthman2013The; Zhang2022Translational; Schaffrath2014The).

## Function
The DPH7 gene encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a post-translational modification of histidine in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This modification is crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and proper protein synthesis. DPH7 specifically catalyzes the demethylation step required to convert methylated diphthine into diphthine, which is a precursor for diphthamide synthesis (Uthman2013The; Schaffrath2014The). 

In humans, the homolog of DPH7 is known as WDR85, which plays a similar role in the diphthamide pathway. The demethylation function of DPH7 is essential for the proper progression of diphthamide synthesis, allowing for the conversion of diphthine to diphthamide by amidation (Schaffrath2014The). DPH7 also regulates the interaction between Dph5 and eEF2, preventing excessive binding that could inhibit translation and lead to growth defects (Uthman2013The). 

The presence of diphthamide is associated with increased translational accuracy, and its absence can lead to increased ribosomal frameshifting and defects in protein synthesis, which are linked to severe developmental and physiological defects in humans (Zhang2022Translational).

## Interactions
DPH7, a gene involved in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway in yeast, participates in several protein interactions crucial for its function. DPH7 interacts with the translation factor eEF2, which is essential for its demethylase function in converting methylated diphthine into diphthine, a precursor for diphthamide synthesis. This interaction is supported by co-purification data, indicating a direct interaction necessary for the demethylation step (Schaffrath2014The).

DPH7 also plays a regulatory role by influencing the interaction between Dph5 and eEF2. In dph7 mutants, there is an increased binding of Dph5 to eEF2, suggesting that DPH7 regulates this interaction by promoting the dissociation of Dph5 from eEF2. This regulation is crucial for the amidation step of diphthamide synthesis, as DPH7 may displace DPH5 from diphthine-modified eEF2, allowing the amidation reaction to proceed (Uthman2013The).

Additionally, DPH7 interacts with Rrt4, a putative transcription factor, suggesting potential protein-protein interactions facilitated by the presence of WD40 repeats in DPH7, which are known to mediate such interactions (Schaffrath2014The). However, the precise functional characterization of these interactions requires further study.
