# HDAC2

## Overview
HDAC2 is a gene located on chromosome 6q21 that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 2, a member of the class I histone deacetylases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation by removing acetyl groups from histone tails, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. Histone deacetylase 2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and neuronal differentiation. It is a component of several corepressor complexes, such as Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST, which are essential for its function in modulating gene expression (Reichert2012Multiple; Jamaladdin2014Histone). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, and it interacts with numerous proteins to influence cellular responses to DNA damage and apoptosis (Brandl2012Dynamically; Schmidt1999Molecular). HDAC2's dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Xu2021Histone; Conte2023Targeting).

## Structure
The human HDAC2 protein is a member of the class I histone deacetylases and is encoded by the HDAC2 gene located on chromosome 6q21. The protein consists of 488 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 56.4 kDa (Shetty2021Histone). The primary structure of HDAC2 includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with specific residues such as Aspartate181, Histidine183, and Aspartate269 coordinating a zinc ion at the active site (Wagner2016Kinetic).

The secondary structure of HDAC2 features a single alpha/beta domain with eight beta sheets sandwiched between alpha helices (Wagner2016Kinetic). The tertiary structure includes a lipophilic channel leading to the active site and a hydrophobic cavity known as the 'foot pocket' (Wagner2016Kinetic). 

HDAC2 forms part of larger transcriptional repressor complexes, such as Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST, indicating its quaternary structure involves assembly into multi-protein complexes (Shetty2021Histone). Post-translational modifications of HDAC2 include phosphorylation at serine residues, such as Ser 394, Ser 411, Ser 422, and Ser 424, which influence its activity and localization (Tsai2002Regulation). These structural features and modifications are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.

## Function
HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) is a critical enzyme involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. It functions by removing acetyl groups from histone tails, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. HDAC2 is a component of several corepressor complexes, including Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST, which are essential for its role in modulating gene expression (Reichert2012Multiple; Jamaladdin2014Histone).

In healthy human cells, HDAC2 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by repressing the transcription of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p57. It is recruited to gene promoters by transcription factors like SP1 and interacts with p53 to counteract its activation of the p21 promoter (Reichert2012Multiple). HDAC2 is also involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in deacetylating histones near DNA double-strand breaks, which is crucial for nonhomologous end joining (Jamaladdin2014Histone).

HDAC2 is active in the nucleus and is essential for various cellular processes, including neuronal differentiation, oligodendrocyte specification, and Schwann cell differentiation. It also plays a role in memory formation and synaptic plasticity, where its overexpression can lead to memory impairment (Reichert2012Multiple). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which affects its interaction with p53 and its role in apoptosis (Brandl2012Dynamically).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), HDAC2 is implicated in immune regulation and therapeutic resistance. Mutations in HDAC2 can lead to increased infiltration of CD4+ Th2 T cells, influencing tumor promotion and progression, particularly in microsatellite-unstable colon carcinomas (Conte2023Targeting). Overexpression of HDAC2 is observed in 50% of colorectal tumors, suggesting its role in CRC development (Özdağ2006Differential).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), HDAC2 is overexpressed and associated with immune escape mechanisms. Its knockout can suppress tumor growth and PD-L1 production, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021Histone). HDAC2 is also overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where its downregulation inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis (Li2016HDAC2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HDAC2 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. Its downregulation through treatments like LukS-PV can inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis (Wang2020LukSPV). HDAC2's role in regulating the tumor suppressor p53 is critical in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, where its inhibition can lead to growth arrest and apoptosis (Wagner2014Histone).

## Interactions
HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. HDAC2 interacts directly with DNA topoisomerase II isoforms α and β, particularly forming a complex with Topo IIβ as part of the NuRD complex, which does not include the Sin3 complex (Tsai2000Histone). It also forms homo- and heterodimers with HDAC1, essential for their activity within corepressor complexes such as Sin3, NuRD, and CoREST (Khan2013Protein).

HDAC2 is part of a robust complex with ATR, a DNA-damage checkpoint protein, and CHD4, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylating complex. This interaction is significant for chromatin remodeling and deacetylation processes (Schmidt1999Molecular). HDAC2 also interacts with lamin A/C, a nuclear structural protein, influencing the DNA damage response and being modulated by statins and HDAC inhibitors (Mattioli2019Statins).

In squamous cell carcinoma cells, HDAC2 forms a trimeric complex with DNp63a and HDAC1, mediating transcriptional repression of proapoptotic genes like PUMA (Ramsey2011Physical). These interactions highlight HDAC2's role in transcriptional regulation and cellular response to DNA damage.
