# DMWD

## Overview
The DMWD gene encodes the protein DM1 locus, WD repeat containing, which is part of the WD repeat protein family. These proteins are characterized by their WD repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle control. The DMWD gene is located in close proximity to the DMPK gene, and its expression is implicated in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). While the precise function of the DMWD-encoded protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in modulating the expression of neighboring genes and may influence the clinical manifestations of DM1 through epigenetic mechanisms (J.2012Myotonic; Sztretye2020From; Visconti2021Epigenetics).

## Clinical Significance
The DMWD gene, located near the DMPK gene, is implicated in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Although the specific clinical significance of DMWD mutations is not fully detailed, alterations in its expression are suggested to contribute to DM1. The CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene can affect the chromatin structure, potentially leading to partial silencing of neighboring genes, including DMWD. This decreased expression of DMWD has been observed in patients with repeat expansions, indicating a possible role in DM1 pathogenesis (J.2012Myotonic). 

The DMWD gene may also act as an enhancer that influences the expression of the DMPK gene in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting that its epigenetic features could impact the clinical manifestations of DM1 (Visconti2021Epigenetics). Despite these associations, the exact role of DMWD in DM1 and its clinical significance remain unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate its contributions to the disease. The current understanding highlights the complex interplay between DMWD and the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying DM1 (Sztretye2020From).
