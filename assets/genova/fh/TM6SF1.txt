# TM6SF1

## Overview
The TM6SF1 gene encodes the protein transmembrane 6 superfamily member 1, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, suggesting a role in cellular processes that involve membrane transport or signaling. Although the precise biological function of TM6SF1 is not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various cellular pathways and may play a role in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential involvement in metabolic disorders and other clinical conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
