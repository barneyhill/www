# NTF4

## Overview
The NTF4 gene encodes neurotrophin 4, a protein that is part of the neurotrophin family, which is crucial for the development, survival, and function of neurons. Neurotrophin 4 is a growth factor that primarily interacts with the TrkB receptor, promoting neuronal differentiation and survival, and is involved in synaptic plasticity, which affects learning and memory (Patel2012Neurotrophin4). The protein is characterized by its ability to form both homodimers and heterodimers, sharing structural similarities with other neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Robinson1999The). While NTF4 is predominantly expressed during embryonic development, its role extends to various cellular processes, including interactions with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and autophagy regulation (Yang2020Upregulated). Clinically, mutations in the NTF4 gene have been linked to primary open-angle glaucoma, and its overexpression has been associated with colorectal cancer progression (Yang2020Upregulated; Pasutto2009Heterozygous).

## Structure
Neurotrophin 4 (NTF4) is a member of the neurotrophin family, characterized by a specific sequence of amino acids that form its primary structure. The mature protein is processed from a larger precursor, with the mature form being approximately 14 kDa in size (Ip1992Mammalian). NTF4 shares structural similarities with other neurotrophins, particularly around six invariant cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability (Ip1992Mammalian).

The secondary structure of NTF4 includes beta sheets, as seen in the crystal structure of the NT4 homodimer, which consists of a pair of eight beta-stranded protomers held together by a cystine knot (Robinson1999The). The tertiary structure is characterized by a common fold among neurotrophins, with structural homology in the beta-sheet regions forming the dimer interface (Robinson1999The).

NTF4 can form both homodimers and heterodimers, such as the BDNF-NT4 heterodimer, which reveals a common trk-binding site crucial for receptor interaction (Robinson1999The). The quaternary structure involves these dimeric forms, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface (Robinson1999The). NTF4 also features a unique seven-amino acid insertion that forms a loop structure, contributing to its distinct structural features (Robinson1999The).

## Function
Neurotrophin 4 (NTF4) is a member of the neurotrophin family that plays a critical role in the development and survival of neurons. It binds to the TrkB receptor, which is essential for promoting neuronal differentiation and survival. NTF4 is involved in synaptic plasticity, influencing processes such as learning and memory. In the development of the gustatory system, NTF4 is crucial for the survival of geniculate ganglion neurons during early embryonic stages. It prevents cell death in these neurons before they innervate their target tissues, indicating its role as a non-target-derived growth factor (Patel2012Neurotrophin4).

NTF4 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activate the same receptors, TrkB and p75, but they regulate different sets of genes and biological pathways. While BDNF prevents neuron apoptosis by blocking caspase-3 activation, NTF4 does not affect caspase-3 but may prevent activation of other caspases, suggesting a different pathway for regulating cell death (Patel2012Neurotrophin4; Huang2014BDNF). NTF4's expression is primarily during embryonic development, with its role diminishing postnatally in the gustatory system (Patel2012Neurotrophin4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NTF4 gene have been implicated in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Several heterozygous mutations, such as A88V, R90H, R206W, R206Q, and R209G, have been identified in patients with POAG, particularly among those of European origin, accounting for about 1.7% of cases (Pasutto2009Heterozygous). These mutations are predicted to decrease the affinity of the neurotrophin 4 protein (NT-4) for its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), leading to impaired signaling pathways that reduce neurotrophic support for RGCs (Pasutto2009Heterozygous). The R206W mutation, in particular, has been shown to impair TrkB signaling and neurite outgrowth (Takamoto2013Genetics).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), NTF4 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor mucosa. This upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and advanced disease stages. NTF4 promotes tumor development by regulating autophagy, influencing processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell invasion, and proliferation (Yang2020Upregulated).

## Interactions
NTF4 (neurotrophin 4) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), NTF4 has been shown to interact with Atg5, a key regulatory molecule in autophagy. This interaction was identified through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, suggesting that NTF4 may influence autophagy by modulating Atg5 activity (Yang2020Upregulated). 

NTF4 also interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically affecting the expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. These interactions indicate that NTF4 may regulate autophagy and cell signaling pathways through its influence on MAPK signaling (Yang2020Upregulated). 

In addition to its role in cancer, NTF4 is involved in neuronal development and survival. It binds to the TrkB receptor, a high-affinity receptor, to activate signaling pathways that promote neuronal survival and differentiation. NTF4 may also interact with the p75NTR receptor, a low-affinity neurotrophin receptor, which can influence cell survival and apoptosis (Huang2014BDNF). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of NTF4 in both cancer progression and neuronal development.
