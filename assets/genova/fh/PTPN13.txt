# PTPN13

## Overview
PTPN13, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 13, is a gene that encodes a large and complex protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, often referred to as FAP-1, is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which is characterized by its role in dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. This activity is crucial for modulating signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. PTPN13 contains several functional domains, including a FERM domain, multiple PDZ domains, and a C-terminal phosphatase domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function as a scaffold in cellular signaling (Dicks2019The; Wang2017The). The protein's ability to interact with key signaling molecules, such as PTEN and EphrinB1, underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Vermeer2012ErbB2; Sotelo2015PTEN–PDZ). PTPN13's involvement in various cancers, including stomach adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, highlights its clinical significance as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2020The; Sun2014Conserved).

## Structure
PTPN13, also known as FAP-1, is a large protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of several domains, including a kinase non-catalytic C-lobe (KIND) domain, a FERM domain, five PDZ domains, and a C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase domain (Dicks2019The; Wang2017The). The FERM domain is involved in binding to plasma membrane and cytoskeletal elements, playing a crucial role in the protein's localization and function (Dromard2007The; Wang2017The).

The PDZ domains are essential for protein-protein interactions, with PDZ2 and PDZ3 forming a tandem domain that exhibits allosteric modulation, affecting binding affinities for ligands such as the APC-derived peptide (Dicks2019The). The PDZ2 domain is particularly significant within the PDZ1-3 cassette, as it is regulated by adjacent PDZ domains and is crucial for the protein's scaffolding functions (Dicks2019The).

PTPN13 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. The protein also has splice variants that may result in different isoforms with distinct functions (S.2003The). These structural features and modifications contribute to PTPN13's role in signal transduction and its involvement in various cellular pathways.

## Function
PTPN13, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 13, is a phosphatase involved in regulating several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily by dephosphorylating target proteins, thereby modulating signaling pathways. PTPN13 contains multiple PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with various proteins, suggesting its role as a scaffold protein in cellular signaling (Vermeer2012ErbB2).

In healthy cells, PTPN13 is involved in the regulation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by dephosphorylating EphrinB1, a process that is crucial for controlling cell growth and proliferation (Vermeer2012ErbB2). This dephosphorylation activity helps terminate signaling pathways, preventing excessive cellular responses that could lead to tumorigenesis (Vermeer2012ErbB2).

PTPN13 also plays a role in maintaining cell polarity and proper cell movements by regulating RhoA activity. It acts as an inhibitor of RhoA, which is essential for convergence and extension cell movements, as demonstrated in studies using zebrafish embryos (van2012PairWise). This regulation of RhoA activity is critical for maintaining cell polarity and proper cellular organization (van2012PairWise).

Overall, PTPN13's phosphatase activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis, influencing processes such as apoptosis, cell adhesion, and migration (Hamyeh2020PTPN13).

## Clinical Significance
PTPN13, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 13, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and cell signaling. In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), decreased expression of PTPN13 is associated with worse overall survival and is correlated with clinicopathological parameters, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2020The). In colorectal cancer, PTPN13 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its expression patterns differing between gastric and colorectal cancers (Chen2020The).

In lung adenocarcinoma, particularly among never-smokers, PTPN13 is often inactivated due to loss of mRNA and protein expression or somatic mutations. Lower expression levels of PTPN13 in these tumors are linked to shorter survival, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Sun2014Conserved). The gene is part of a network involved in cancer, gastrointestinal disease, and respiratory disease, with higher expression predicting better survival outcomes (Sun2014Conserved).

Frameshift mutations in PTPN13 have been observed in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer cell lines, although these mutations were not found in primary colorectal tumors, suggesting a potential role in cultured cell lines (Korff2008Frameshift).

## Interactions
PTPN13, also known as FAP-1, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It contains several domains, including PDZ domains, which facilitate its interactions with a range of proteins. PTPN13 interacts with PTEN, a tumor suppressor, through its PDZ domains, particularly PDZ2, which is crucial for their binding. This interaction is significant for cell growth regulation and involves complementary phosphatase activities (Sotelo2015PTEN–PDZ).

PTPN13 also interacts with EphrinB1, acting as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate it, thereby modulating MAP kinase signaling pathways. This interaction is particularly relevant in breast cancer and other epithelial cancers, where PTPN13 expression levels influence EphrinB1 phosphorylation and downstream signaling (Vermeer2012ErbB2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PTPN13 interacts with IGF2BP1 via its fifth PDZ domain, affecting the stability of mRNA targets like c-Myc, which is crucial for its tumor-suppressing activity (Yan2020Antioncogene).

PTPN13 is also involved in interactions with calpain-2, where it is cleaved by calpain-2, leading to the inactivation of its phosphatase activity. This interaction is linked to tau phosphorylation and has implications for neurodegenerative diseases (Wang2017The).
