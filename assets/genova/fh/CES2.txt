# CES2

## Overview
Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxylesterase 2, a member of the serine esterase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds, playing a crucial role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. CES2 is predominantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, where it contributes to the breakdown of various xenobiotics and endogenous substrates, thereby influencing drug efficacy and toxicity (Ross2007Human; Wang2018Human). The enzyme is characterized by an α,β-hydrolase-fold structure and contains a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Hosokawa2008Structure; Satoh2006Structure). CES2's activity in lipid metabolism and its interactions with other metabolic enzymes underscore its significance in pharmacogenomics and its potential implications in metabolic diseases and cancer treatment (Capello2020CES2; Chalhoub2021Carboxylesterase).

## Structure
Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is a member of the serine esterase superfamily, characterized by an α,β-hydrolase-fold structure. This fold includes a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, forming a globular shape that is common among lipases (Hosokawa2008Structure; Satoh2010Carboxylesterases:). The active site of CES2 contains a catalytic triad composed of Serine 203, Glutamic acid 336, and Histidine 450, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hosokawa2008Structure; Satoh2006Structure). 

CES2 is glycosylated at specific sites, such as Asn 103 and Asn 267, which are important for enzyme stabilization (Hosokawa2008Structure; Satoh2010Carboxylesterases:). The enzyme is primarily expressed in the intestine but is also found in other tissues, including the liver and kidney (Holmes2008Mammalian). CES2 is transcribed into multiple alternatively spliced mRNAs, resulting in isoforms like CES2a, CES2b, and CES2c, which may have distinct functional properties (Holmes2008Mammalian; Chalhoub2021Carboxylesterase). These isoforms exhibit varying degrees of activity towards different lipid substrates, indicating a role in lipid metabolism (Chalhoub2021Carboxylesterase).

## Function
Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is an enzyme primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ester and amide bonds, playing a significant role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and small intestine, where it contributes to the breakdown of various xenobiotics and endogenous substrates, influencing drug efficacy and toxicity (Ross2007Human; Wang2018Human). CES2 is part of the α/β-fold serine hydrolase family and is involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG) to diglycerides (DG) and monoglycerides (MG), eventually leading to the production of glycerol and fatty acids (FAs). This process is crucial for lipid metabolism and signaling (Chalhoub2021Carboxylesterase).

In healthy human cells, CES2 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a role in lipid catabolism, preventing protein secretion and facilitating lipid droplet formation and incorporation into TG-rich lipoproteins (Chalhoub2021Carboxylesterase). CES2 also exhibits triacylglycerol and diacylglycerol hydrolase activity, with its expression and function in the liver being strongly related to metabolic diseases like obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Wang2018Human). The enzyme's activity and substrate specificity are crucial for understanding its function in drug metabolism and potential implications in pharmacogenomics (Satoh2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CES2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer treatment. The CES2 5'UTR 823 C/G polymorphism is associated with increased efficacy of the cancer drug capecitabine, as carriers of this polymorphism exhibit nearly double the response rate and longer time to disease progression compared to those with the wild-type sequence (Ribelles2008A). This polymorphism may affect enzyme levels in tissues, especially in hepatic tissue, leading to higher local concentrations of the active drug metabolite (Ribelles2008A).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high CES2 expression is linked to increased sensitivity to irinotecan therapy, suggesting that CES2 expression could serve as a predictive marker for treatment response (Capello2020CES2). CES2 expression is also associated with the pancreatic progenitor subtype of PDAC, which is linked to type 2 diabetes (Capello2020CES2).

In neuroblastoma, high CES2 RNA expression correlates with increased sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug CPT-11 and is associated with advanced disease characteristics, indicating its potential as a marker for disease progression and treatment response (Uchida2013Clinical). These findings underscore the importance of CES2 in modulating drug efficacy and toxicity in various cancers.

## Interactions
Carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) is involved in various interactions that influence its role in drug metabolism. CES2 interacts with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it produces hydrolyzed products that serve as substrates for UGT and organic anion transporters such as MRP2 and BCRP. This interaction is crucial for the metabolism of drugs, including prodrugs, and highlights CES2's role in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Hosokawa2008Structure; Satoh2006Structure).

CES2 expression is regulated by transcription factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), which is associated with the pancreatic progenitor subtype of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This regulation is linked to the response to irinotecan therapy, as high CES2 activity correlates with increased sensitivity to the drug (Capello2020CES2).

Inhibition of CES2 can occur through interactions with compounds like glabridin, which acts as a mixed-type inhibitor by binding to both the catalytic cavity and the regulatory domain of CES2. This dual binding affects substrate interactions and highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of CES2 inhibition (Song2019Discovery).
