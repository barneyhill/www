# YIPF4

## Overview
YIPF4 is a gene that encodes the protein Yip1 domain family member 4, which is a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus. This protein is characterized by its five transmembrane domains and plays a significant role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Yip1 domain family member 4 is involved in the process of Golgiphagy, a selective autophagy mechanism targeting the Golgi apparatus, and functions as a receptor in this process. It forms a complex with YIPF3, another Golgi membrane protein, which is essential for the selective degradation of the Golgi apparatus under cellular stress conditions such as starvation. The interaction between YIPF4 and YIPF3 is crucial for their stability and function, with YIPF4 stabilizing YIPF3 through specific transmembrane helices. Additionally, YIPF4 interacts with human papillomavirus (HPV) E5 proteins, although its role in HPV pathogenesis appears limited (Müller2015YIP1; Shaik2019Characteristics; Kitta2023Golgi).

## Structure
YIPF4 is a member of the Yip1 domain family and is characterized by having five transmembrane domains. The protein's N-terminus is cytosolic, while the C-terminus is luminal, with the first four helical domains embedded within the membrane. The fifth alpha-helical domain does not traverse the membrane and may function as an amphipathic helix (APH) domain (Angelotti2022Exploring). YIPF4 is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and function (Shaik2019Characteristics; Tanimoto2011Characterization).

YIPF4 can form heterodimers with YIPF3, and this interaction is crucial for the stability of both proteins. The interaction involves specific transmembrane helices, and the stability of YIPF3 is dependent on its association with YIPF4 (Hickey2023Proteome; Hickey2022Quantitative). YIPF4 contains LIR motifs in its cytosolic N-terminal tail, which are accessible for interactions with ATG8 proteins, playing a role in autophagic processes (Hickey2022Quantitative).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are suggested, particularly in the context of interactions with autophagy-related proteins (Kitta2023Golgi). The protein does not form oligomers in cells, unlike some of its interacting partners (Müller2015YIP1).

## Function
YIPF4 (Yip1 domain family member 4) is a Golgi membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Golgi apparatus turnover through a selective autophagy process known as Golgiphagy. YIPF4 forms a complex with YIPF3, another Golgi membrane protein, and this complex functions as a Golgiphagy receptor. The YIPF3-YIPF4 complex is essential for the selective degradation of the Golgi apparatus by autophagy, particularly under conditions of cellular stress such as starvation (Kitta2023Golgi).

YIPF4 is required to stabilize the YIPF3-YIPF4 complex, which interacts with ATG8 family proteins via the LIR motif in YIPF3. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation, which is necessary for the complex's function in Golgiphagy (Kitta2023Golgi). The absence of YIPF4 leads to a reduction in Golgiphagic activity, indicating its critical role in this process (Kitta2023Golgi).

In healthy human cells, YIPF4 is primarily localized to the cis-Golgi and is involved in maintaining the Golgi structure. It forms specific complexes with YIPF3, contributing to the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus (Shaik2019Characteristics).

## Clinical Significance
YIPF4 has been implicated in several cellular processes that may influence disease states, particularly in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. YIPF4 interacts with HPV E5 proteins, which are involved in modulating host pathways related to pathogenesis, such as growth factor receptor signaling and immune evasion. This interaction is mediated by the transmembrane domains of both YIPF4 and E5 proteins (Müller2015YIP1). Despite this interaction, the depletion of YIPF4 does not affect the expression of HPV early proteins or host proteins modulated by E5, such as EGFR and HLA class I molecules, suggesting that YIPF4's role in HPV-related pathogenesis may be limited (Müller2015YIP1).

YIPF4 is also involved in Golgiphagy, a selective autophagy process targeting the Golgi apparatus. It acts as a receptor for this process, and its deletion leads to the stabilization of Golgi-membrane proteins, indicating its role in their turnover during nutrient stress (Hickey2022Quantitative). The physiological significance of Golgiphagy, including its potential implications in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, remains to be fully understood (Kitta2023Golgi). However, the exact clinical significance of YIPF4 gene mutations or alterations in its expression in these contexts is not yet clear.

## Interactions
YIPF4 is known to form a complex with YIPF3, a process crucial for their localization and function in the Golgi apparatus. This complex formation is specific, as YIPF4 interacts only with the Golgi form of YIPF3, not in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells have shown that reducing YIPF4 levels also reduces YIPF3 levels, indicating that YIPF4 stabilizes YIPF3 (Tanimoto2011Characterization). The YIPF3-YIPF4 complex is essential for Golgiphagy, a form of autophagy specific to the Golgi apparatus, and their interaction is necessary for this process (Kitta2023Golgi; Hickey2022Quantitative).

YIPF4 also interacts with the E5 proteins of human papillomavirus (HPV), with the binding mediated by the transmembrane domains of each protein. This interaction is observed across various E5 proteins, suggesting a conserved function, although the specific role of this interaction in HPV pathogenesis is not fully understood (Müller2015YIP1). Despite this interaction, YIPF4 does not appear to play a critical role in the expression or trafficking of certain host proteins in the context of HPV infection (Müller2015YIP1).
