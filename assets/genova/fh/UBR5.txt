# UBR5

## Overview
UBR5 is a human gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation of various cellular processes. UBR5 is involved in critical functions such as DNA damage response, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression. The protein's structure includes a HECT domain, which is crucial for its ligase activity, and it forms a dimeric scaffold that facilitates ubiquitin chain formation. UBR5's interactions with various proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genome stability. Clinically, UBR5 is implicated in several cancers, where its dysregulation contributes to tumor progression, and it has been associated with neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Shearer2015Functional; MuñozEscobar2015The; Hehl2023Structural).

## Structure
UBR5 is a human gene encoding a protein that features a HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity. The molecular structure of UBR5 includes a C-lobe composed of four alpha-helices and four beta-strands, forming a mixed parallel/antiparallel sheet that caps a bundle of helices. This structure is similar to other HECT domains, but UBR5 has a unique four-residue insert in helix 2, affecting the orientation of loop L1 and potentially influencing E2 enzyme specificity (MattaCamacho2012Structure).

UBR5 forms a dimeric scaffold that supports HECT-mediated ubiquitin chain formation, with the HECT domain redefined to include specific residues stabilized by interactions with other domains within the UBR5 scaffold, such as the DSD (Domain Swap Dimerization) and HD (HECT Display) domains (Hehl2023Structural). The UBA domain within UBR5 binds ubiquitin, showing a preference for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which may play a role in nonproteolytic cellular processes and protein degradation (MattaCamacho2012Structure).

The UBR5 protein's structure is further characterized by its ability to form a ≈620 kDa dimer, with a scaffold comprising ubiquitin-binding UBA domains and HECT domains, facilitating K48-linked ubiquitin chain formation (Hehl2023Structural).

## Function
UBR5, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5, is a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination of proteins, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation of protein activity. UBR5 mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in translation regulation, DNA damage response, and gluconeogenesis (MuñozEscobar2015The). It also stabilizes transcriptional co-activators like Myocardin, influencing smooth muscle gene transcription, and is involved in the DNA damage response by interacting with ATM, CHK1, and CHK2, which are necessary for activating DNA damage response checkpoints (Shearer2015Functional).

UBR5 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. It plays a role in maintaining genome stability by regulating the ubiquitination of phosphorylated H2AX, thus restricting the recruitment of DNA repair machinery at double-stranded breaks (Shearer2015Functional). UBR5 also acts as a transcriptional cofactor and binding partner for various proteins, including GW182, p53, and CHK2, and is involved in cell cycle progression (MuñozEscobar2015The). Additionally, UBR5 is implicated in ciliogenesis, apoptosis, and glucose homeostasis, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Shearer2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The UBR5 gene, also known as ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In lung adenocarcinoma, UBR5 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression by interacting with proteins involved in apoptosis and the mTOR signaling pathway. Loss of UBR5 in these cancer cells leads to reduced tumor volume and decreased cell viability, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Saurabh2020UBRbox).

In colorectal cancer, UBR5 expression is often elevated, associated with poor prognosis, and linked to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Its high nuclear localization correlates with shorter disease-free and overall survival, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Xie2017Significance).

UBR5 is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it is associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of UBR5 in gastric cancer cells results in reduced proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Ding2020UBR5).

In addition to cancer, a mutation in the UBR5 gene has been associated with familial adult myoclonic epilepsy in a Japanese family, suggesting its involvement in neurological disorders (Kato2012UBR5).

## Interactions
UBR5, a human E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with CSPP-L, a centrosomal and ciliary protein, at centriolar satellites, which is essential for primary ciliogenesis. This interaction facilitates the localization of CSPP-L to centriolar satellites, contributing to centriolar satellite stability and proper ciliogenesis (Shearer2018The).

UBR5 also interacts with components of the DNA replication machinery. It associates with the replication fork and regulates the ubiquitylation of histone H2A, which is crucial for DNA damage response and replication. UBR5 prevents the recruitment of DNA polymerase η to chromatin, thereby protecting cells from replication stress and maintaining normal DNA replication (Cipolla2019UBR5).

In embryonic stem cells, UBR5 interacts with the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, which is involved in ribosomal RNA biogenesis. It binds to proteins such as DKC1, GAR1, NOP10, and NHP2, as well as specific small nucleolar RNAs, playing a role in rRNA maturation and ribosomal assembly (Saez2019The). These interactions highlight UBR5's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in various biological processes.
