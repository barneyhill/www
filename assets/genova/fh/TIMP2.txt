# TIMP2

## Overview
TIMP2, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, is a gene that encodes the TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 protein, a critical regulator of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These enzymes are involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix, a process essential for normal physiological functions such as tissue remodeling, wound healing, and embryonic development. The TIMP2 protein is categorized as an inhibitor and is characterized by its ability to bind and inhibit MMPs, thereby modulating extracellular matrix turnover. It plays a significant role in cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The protein's structure comprises two distinct domains, each contributing to its inhibitory function and interaction with MMPs. TIMP2 is also involved in various signaling pathways, influencing cell growth and angiogenesis, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases due to its regulatory effects on MMP activity (Tuuttila1998Threedimensional; Brew2010The; Muskett1998High).

## Structure
The TIMP2 protein is composed of 194 amino acids and is structured into two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain, consisting of residues 1-110, forms a β-barrel structure known as the OB fold, which is stabilized by disulfide bridges (Cys1-Cys72, Cys3-Cys101) (Tuuttila1998Threedimensional). This domain includes a β-hairpin and a β-loop-β motif, contributing to its stability and function (Tuuttila1998Threedimensional). The C-terminal domain, spanning residues 111-194, features a parallel stranded β-hairpin and a β-loop-β motif, with a unique folding topology not found in other proteins (Tuuttila1998Threedimensional).

The N-terminal domain of TIMP2 is crucial for binding to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), forming a stable, autonomously folded unit that retains full inhibitory activity (Muskett1998High). The protein's structure is characterized by a closed, five-stranded β-barrel, which is similar to the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding protein fold (Muskett1998High). TIMP2 can also form complexes with the inactive proform of MMP-2, involving binding sites in the C-terminal domains (Tuuttila1998Threedimensional). The protein's negatively charged C terminus is suggested to mediate specificity in complex formation with MMPs (Morgunova2002Structural).

## Function
TIMP2 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are enzymes responsible for the degradation of the extracellular matrix. In healthy human cells, TIMP2 is involved in various molecular processes, including the modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. It suppresses growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by activating adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular cAMP levels and activates SH2 protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1). This process dampens the activity of growth factor receptors and inhibits p42/44 MAPK activation (Brew2010The).

TIMP2 also interacts with α3β1 integrin, inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation stimulated by VEGF-A or FGF-2, and induces G1 growth arrest in endothelial cells by promoting the synthesis of p27 KIP1, leading to the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Brew2010The). In the context of neuronal development, TIMP2 is highly expressed in the amygdala and affects neuronal extracellular matrix turnover, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity associated with fear conditioning (Brew2010The). TIMP2-null mice exhibit motor dysfunction and defects in neuronal development, indicating its role in maintaining normal ECM turnover and nerve function (Brew2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TIMP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, TIMP2 expression is often dysregulated, with studies showing its upregulation in certain tumor types like lymphoma and downregulation in others such as leukemia. High TIMP2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers like uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), bladder cancer (BLCA), and mesothelioma (MESO) (Wang2021A). In breast cancer, specific polymorphisms in the TIMP2 gene, such as the rs2277698 T allele, have been linked to a reduced risk, suggesting a protective role against tumor development (Wang2019Association).

In cardiovascular diseases, TIMP2 plays a critical role in heart function under stress conditions. TIMP2 knockout mice exhibit worsened left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure under pressure overload, highlighting its importance in maintaining cardiac health. The absence of TIMP2 leads to decreased MMP-2 activity, increased fibrosis, and altered expression of connexins, which are crucial for myocardial function (Givvimani2013TIMP2). These findings underscore the significance of TIMP2 in both cancer progression and cardiovascular health, where its altered expression or function can exacerbate disease conditions.

## Interactions
TIMP2 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2) is known for its interactions with various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), playing a crucial role in regulating extracellular matrix degradation. TIMP2 binds to MMP-2, inhibiting its activity and facilitating the activation of pro-MMP-2 through interactions with membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) (Olson1997Kinetic; WORLEY2003Sequence). The N-terminal domain of TIMP2 is particularly important for binding to MT1-MMP, while the C-terminal domain is essential for interaction with pro-MMP-2, forming a trimolecular complex necessary for pro-MMP-2 activation (WORLEY2003Sequence).

TIMP2 also interacts with MMP-14, where the residue Tyr-36 in the AB loop of TIMP2 is critical for binding. This interaction is characterized by hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals contacts, contributing significantly to the binding affinity between TIMP2 and MMP-14 (Williamson2001Tyrosine). Additionally, TIMP2 can bind to a wide range of other MMPs, including MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -13, and -19, through conserved core interactions and diverse exosite interactions, which contribute to its binding selectivity and specificity (Batra2013Matrix).
