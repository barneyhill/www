# USP21

## Overview
USP21, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme belonging to the cysteine protease family. The protein, ubiquitin specific peptidase 21, plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. It is involved in key signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK and Hedgehog, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (An2022Insights). USP21 is also crucial in DNA repair mechanisms and immune response modulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (An2022Insights). The enzyme's interactions with various proteins, including those associated with the microtubular cytoskeletal network, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics (Urbé2012Systematic). Due to its involvement in cancer progression and immune regulation, USP21 is considered a potential therapeutic target in oncology and immunology (Li2018The; An2022Insights).

## Structure
USP21 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a relatively simple structure compared to other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The protein consists of an intrinsically disordered N-terminal region (1-212 amino acids) and a C-terminal region that contains the catalytic domain. The catalytic domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity and includes a conserved catalytic triad composed of Cys 221, His 518, and Asp 534, typical of cysteine proteases (An2022Insights). 

The N-terminal region of USP21 is involved in interactions with microtubule-affinity regulating kinase 2 (MARK2), microtubules, and centrosomes, while the C-terminal catalytic domain interacts with proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MEK2) and potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 6 (KCTD6) (An2022Insights). 

USP21 has at least three ubiquitin-binding sites: S1, S1', and S2, with the S2 site specifically targeting polyubiquitin chains (An2022Insights). The enzyme can cleave various ubiquitin chain linkages, including K27, K48, and K63, and exhibits cross-reactivity with ubiquitin-like modifications such as ISG15, although its deISGylating activity is significantly lower (Ye2011Polyubiquitin). 

The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and functions (An2022Insights).

## Function
USP21 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. In the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, USP21 stabilizes MEK2, leading to the activation of the MAPK/ERK branch, which is essential for cell proliferation and survival. It also promotes the expression of MAPK1 (ERK2) by interacting with the transcription factor GATA3 (An2022Insights). In the Hedgehog signaling pathway, USP21 is involved in microtubule regrowth and primary cilia generation, regulating the stability and transcriptional activity of Gli1, a key transcription factor in this pathway (An2022Insights).

USP21 is associated with microtubules and centrosomes, contributing to microtubule network regeneration, primary cilia formation, and neurite outgrowth (Urbé2012Systematic). It also plays a role in DNA repair by stabilizing BRCA2, promoting RAD51 accumulation at DNA double-strand breaks, which is crucial for homologous recombination repair (An2022Insights). In the immune system, USP21 acts as a negative regulator of the innate immune response by cleaving polyubiquitin chains from proteins like RIG-I and STING, affecting type I interferon signaling (An2022Insights). These functions highlight USP21's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
USP21 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in stabilizing proteins that promote tumor growth and progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), USP21 is highly amplified and overexpressed, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. It stabilizes MEK2, activating the ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor growth (Li2018The). USP21 also stabilizes BRCA2, promoting DNA repair and tumor growth in HCC (Liu2017Ubiquitinspecific).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), USP21 enhances cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumor growth by stabilizing TCF7, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway (Hou2019USP21). Its overexpression is associated with poor survival and disease progression in PDAC (Hou2019USP21).

USP21 is also involved in glioblastoma, where it promotes the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells by stabilizing FOXD1. Inhibition of USP21 reduces tumor growth and improves survival in mouse models (Zhang2022USP21).

Beyond cancer, USP21 plays roles in immune regulation and muscle dysfunction. It stabilizes PD-L1, contributing to immune escape in lung cancer, and is involved in immune-related diseases by affecting Treg cell function (An2022Insights).

## Interactions
USP21 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is associated with the microtubular cytoskeletal network, localizing to microtubules and centrosomes, and interacts with microtubule-affinity regulating kinases (MARKs) such as MARK2 and MARK3 (Urbé2012Systematic; An2022Insights). USP21 also binds to microtubule-associated proteins like MAP4, GEF-H1, and CKAP5 (Urbé2012Systematic).

In the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, USP21 interacts with Gli1, a transcription factor, stabilizing it and promoting its phosphorylation by PKA (Heride2016The). It also interacts with KCTD6, a BTB-domain containing protein, which modulates Hh signaling (Heride2016The). The interaction with KCTD6 involves a novel cryptic protein interaction domain in KCTD6 called Smrlike (SmrL) (Heride2016The).

USP21 is involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by interacting with and stabilizing MEK2, decreasing its K48-linked polyubiquitination (An2022Insights). It also interacts with histone H2A, influencing gene transcription by deubiquitylating it (An2022Insights). Additionally, USP21 interacts with EZH2 in bladder carcinoma, stabilizing it and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Chen2017USP21).
