# AIMP1

## Overview
AIMP1, or aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also known as p43, is a scaffold protein within the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in higher eukaryotes, playing a critical role in protein synthesis by facilitating interactions between tRNA synthetases and their substrates (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA). Beyond its structural role, AIMP1 is secreted as a cytokine, influencing immune responses, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA). It is involved in the regulation of cell growth through the TGF-β signaling pathway and plays a role in glucose homeostasis and pro-inflammatory responses (Lee2008AIMP1p43; Lee2008AminoacyltRNA). Mutations in the AIMP1 gene are linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in neuronal development and function (Gupta2020Rare).

## Structure
The AIMP1 protein, also known as p43, is a scaffold protein within the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) in higher eukaryotes. It features a coiled-coil domain approximately 70 amino acids long, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins in the complex. This domain is subdivided into an N-terminal part that interacts with the coiled-coil domain of AIMP2 and a distal part that interacts with RARS (Schwarz2018Aminoacyl). The N-terminal domain of AIMP1 forms a 70-amino acid helix, which is central to the assembly of a ternary complex with arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RRS) and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS) (Fu2014Structure).

AIMP1 lacks a GST-like domain found in its yeast homolog Arc1p but includes tRNA binding domains (TRBD) following the coiled-coil region (Schwarz2018Aminoacyl). The protein can form a hexameric structure in complex with RRS and QRS, with its N-terminal helices forming an X-shaped arrangement stabilized by leucine-zipper interactions (Fu2014Structure).

The C-terminal fragment of AIMP1 acts as an extracellular anti-angiogenic protein known as Endothelial Monocyte-Activating Peptide II (EMAP II) (Schwarz2018Aminoacyl). AIMP1 is also involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and immune responses, through its interactions with other MSC components (Han2006Structural).

## Function
AIMP1, also known as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 1, is a component of the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) complex, playing a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the interaction between tRNA synthetases and their substrates (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA). It is involved in the assembly and stability of the ARS complex, interacting with various enzymes to enhance their catalytic activities (Park2010Aminoacyl‐tRNA). AIMP1 is also secreted as a cytokine, influencing immune responses, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA).

In healthy human cells, AIMP1 regulates cell growth through the TGF-β signaling pathway by stabilizing Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby modulating TGF-β receptor turnover and signaling (Lee2008AIMP1p43). It is involved in immune regulation by interacting with gp96 in the endoplasmic reticulum to prevent autoimmune responses (Park2010Aminoacyl‐tRNA). AIMP1 also plays a role in glucose homeostasis, being secreted during hypoglycemia to induce glucagon secretion and aid in blood glucose level recovery (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA).

AIMP1's multifunctionality extends to its role in angiogenesis, where it exhibits a dose-dependent effect, promoting endothelial cell migration at low concentrations and inhibiting angiogenesis at high concentrations (Lee2008AminoacyltRNA). It also acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, activating monocytes and macrophages, and increasing the expression of inflammatory molecules (Kwon2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AIMP1 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily due to its role in protein synthesis and neuronal development. Severe mutations, such as frameshift and nonsense variants, can lead to significant neurodegenerative conditions characterized by symptoms like microcephaly, developmental delay, hypotonia, spastic paraparesis, and intractable seizures. These conditions often present with global cerebral atrophy and hypomyelination, as seen in cases of early onset epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression (EOEE-BS) (Gupta2020Rare).

AIMP1 mutations can also result in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease, a condition marked by hypomyelination secondary to neurodegeneration. This is due to the disruption of the neurofilament network, leading to axonal degeneration and decreased N-acetylaspartic acid levels, which are observable through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Feinstein2010PelizaeusMerzbacherlike; Khan2019AIMP1).

In some cases, missense variants in AIMP1 are linked to autosomal recessive intellectual disability without neurodegeneration, indicating a milder phenotype. These variants affect protein structure and function, potentially altering tRNA binding and impacting cell metabolism (Iqbal2015Missense).

## Interactions
AIMP1, also known as aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC). It interacts with AIMP3, a scaffold protein, through its full-length structure, suggesting that the entire AIMP1 protein is necessary for efficient binding (Schwarz2018Aminoacyl). AIMP1 also binds to Glutamyl-Prolyl-tRNA Synthetase (EPRS) via its N-terminus, with AIMP2 potentially facilitating this interaction (Schwarz2018Aminoacyl).

In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), AIMP1 interacts with the heat shock protein gp96, enhancing its dimerization and interaction with the KDEL receptor-1 (KDELR-1). This interaction is crucial for the ER retention of gp96, and AIMP1 deficiency leads to increased gp96 surface localization (Han2007AminoacyltRNA). AIMP1 also binds to CD23, a receptor in immune cells, mediating TNF-a secretion and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are part of its proinflammatory cytokine activities (Kwon2012Identification).

AIMP1's interactions extend to the nucleus, where it binds to Smurf2 to regulate TGF-β signaling, and it is secreted to act as a cytokine affecting various cell types (Kim2013Protein–Protein). These interactions highlight AIMP1's multifunctional role in cellular processes.
