# LRRC4C

## Overview
The LRRC4C gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 4C, also known as Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in synaptic cell adhesion and plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and neural development. NGL-1 is characterized by its structural components, including leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a PDZ domain-binding motif, which facilitate its interactions with other synaptic proteins. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and is integral to the formation and modulation of synaptic connections, influencing processes such as axonogenesis and synaptic membrane adhesion. The protein's interactions with presynaptic ligands like netrin-G1 and postsynaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 are essential for maintaining synaptic density and plasticity, which are vital for cognitive functions like learning and memory (An2024Genetic; Woo2009The; Choi2019NGL1LRRC4C).

## Structure
The LRRC4C protein, also known as NGL-1, is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein superfamily, characterized by its involvement in synaptic cell adhesion. The primary structure of LRRC4C includes nine leucine-rich repeats flanked by cysteine-rich capping domains (LRRNT and LRRCT), a C2-type immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region ending with a PDZ domain-binding motif (Woo2009The). The LRR domain forms a horseshoe-shaped solenoid structure, with stacked β-strands on the concave side and variable regions on the convex side, which is typical for ligand binding (Woo2009The).

The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, with some expression in the liver and heart, and is involved in synapse development by interacting with presynaptic ligands such as netrin-G1 (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4C). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, and alternative splicing can lead to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Woo2009The). The PDZ domain-binding motif of LRRC4C interacts with postsynaptic densities (PSDs)-95, a scaffolding protein, which is crucial for its synaptic localization (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4C).

## Function
The LRRC4C gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in synaptic organization and neural development. It is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, LRRC4C is involved in critical synaptic functions such as axonogenesis and synaptic membrane adhesion. It encodes netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), a post-synaptic adhesion molecule integral to the formation, development, and modulation of synaptic connections, affecting neurotransmitter signaling and neuronal network integrity (An2024Genetic).

LRRC4C is also implicated in neuronal plasticity and synaptic function, processes that are crucial for learning, memory, and emotional regulation, particularly in the hippocampus. This gene influences synaptic density and plasticity, suggesting a potential role in pain processing and migraine pathophysiology (An2024Genetic). Additionally, LRRC4C functions as a receptor for netrin-G2 and is involved in regulating excitatory synapse formation and promoting axonal differentiation (Shen2022Ancestral).

The protein encoded by LRRC4C binds intracellularly with PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, and extracellularly with netrin-G1, controlling the development of distinct populations of neuronal synapses and neural circuits (Clark2022Education).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRRC4C gene, which encodes the Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Variants in LRRC4C are associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delays. An exonic deletion in this gene is considered a genetic modifier for neurodevelopmental disorders, including sensory processing disorder and apraxia (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4CMutant). The gene is also weakly associated with temperaments that increase the risk of bipolar disorder (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4CMutant).

In studies involving Lrrc4c knockout mice, the absence of the LRRC4C gene led to hyperactivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, and impairments in spatial and working memory, suggesting a link between LRRC4C mutations and anxiety-related behaviors (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4CMutant). These mice also exhibited widespread suppression of neuronal activity in various brain regions, which may contribute to the observed behavioral phenotypes (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4CMutant).

Additionally, genetic variants near LRRC4C have been associated with an increased risk of myopia, particularly in the context of educational exposure, indicating a gene-environment interaction effect (Clark2022Education). This suggests that environmental factors, such as education, may influence the development of myopia in individuals with certain genetic predispositions.

## Interactions
The LRRC4C gene encodes the protein Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), which is involved in several critical protein interactions. NGL-1 interacts intracellularly with PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, and extracellularly with presynaptic adhesion molecules such as netrin-G1. These interactions are essential for synapse development and function, influencing the formation of neuronal synapses and neural circuits (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4CMutant; Choi2019NGL1LRRC4C).

In the hippocampus, NGL-1 is primarily located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) layer, where it interacts with netrin-G1 to regulate synaptic localization and function. The deletion of LRRC4C affects the density of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and alters the distribution of synaptic proteins, such as the translocation of NGL-2 from the stratum radiatum (SR) to the SLM layer (Choi2019NGL1LRRC4C).

LRRC4C is also part of a transcriptional module associated with schizophrenia, interacting with other genes like DLG2. This module is involved in cell-to-cell signaling and nervous system development, highlighting the gene's role in complex neural processes (yazdani2019transcriptomic).
