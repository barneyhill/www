# NABP1

## Overview
NABP1, or nucleic acid binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a single-stranded DNA-binding protein known as hSSB2. This protein is integral to the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly in the context of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage. NABP1 is characterized by an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold motif, which facilitates its binding to single-stranded DNA and RNA, but not to double-stranded DNA, categorizing it as a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein (Kang2006NABP1). The protein is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, where it aids in the recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) to sites of DNA damage, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability (Boucher2021hSSB2). NABP1 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is part of a high-molecular-mass protein complex, suggesting its interaction with other nuclear proteins and its importance in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation (Boucher2021hSSB2; Kang2006NABP1).

## Structure
NABP1 encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 22 kDa, featuring an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold motif at its N-terminus, which is crucial for nucleic acid recognition (Kang2006NABP1). The OB-fold is a compact structural domain characterized by a β-barrel formed by five β-sheets, although NABP1's OB-fold lacks the typical α-helix capping the β-barrel (Kang2006NABP1). This motif is highly conserved and is involved in binding single-stranded DNA and RNA, but not double-stranded DNA, indicating its role as a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein (Kang2006NABP1).

NABP1 is part of a high-molecular-mass complex, eluting at approximately 2000 kDa during size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting a multimeric quaternary structure (Kang2006NABP1). The protein exhibits high homology with its mouse counterpart and shares significant identity within the OB-fold domain with NABP2, another related protein (Kang2006NABP1). NABP1's expression is regulated by RORγ2, particularly in thymocytes, and it is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in transcripts with different 3'-UTRs (Kang2006NABP1).

## Function
NABP1, also known as hSSB2, is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to DNA damage, particularly damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is essential for repairing UV-induced DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (Boucher2021hSSB2). NABP1 facilitates the recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) to sites of DNA damage, a critical step in the DNA damage response and repair process (Boucher2021hSSB2). 

In healthy human cells, NABP1 is rapidly upregulated and binds to chromatin following UV exposure, indicating its active role in the early stages of DNA repair (Boucher2021hSSB2). It binds to single-stranded DNA with a footprint of 5-6 nucleotides, stabilizing damaged DNA regions and promoting the recruitment of other repair proteins (Boucher2021hSSB2). NABP1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it functions as part of a high-molecular-mass protein complex, suggesting interactions with other nuclear proteins (Kang2006NABP1). Its activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Boucher2021hSSB2).

## Interactions
NABP1, also known as hSSB2, is a single-stranded nucleic-acid-binding protein that participates in various interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. It is part of a high-molecular-mass protein complex, suggesting interactions with other nuclear proteins (Kang2006NABP1). NABP1 binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA, but not to double-stranded DNA, with a preference for longer oligonucleotides and specific sequences such as (dT)35 and (dC)35 (Kang2006NABP1; Vidhyasagar2016Ctermini).

NABP1 is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, where it plays a crucial role in the cellular response to UVB-induced DNA damage. It facilitates the recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) to sites of DNA damage, which is essential for the repair process (Boucher2021hSSB2). NABP1 also interacts with the Integrator complex Subunit 3 (IntS3) to form a complex, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Boucher2021hSSB2).

The protein's OB-fold motif at its N-terminus is crucial for nucleic acid recognition and nuclear localization, while its C-terminal region is essential for multimerization upon binding to ssDNA (Kang2006NABP1; Vidhyasagar2016Ctermini). These interactions highlight NABP1's significant role in DNA repair and maintenance processes.
