# FUNDC1

## Overview
FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in the regulation of mitophagy, a selective autophagy process that targets damaged mitochondria for degradation. The protein encoded by FUNDC1 is characterized by its role as a mitophagy receptor, interacting with LC3, a key protein in autophagosome formation, to facilitate the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Chen2017Mitochondrial; Mao2022FUN14). This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation at specific serine and tyrosine residues, which acts as a regulatory switch for mitophagy under various cellular conditions, such as hypoxia (Liu2021The; Mao2022FUN14). Beyond its role in mitophagy, FUNDC1 is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics, interacting with proteins like OPA1 and Drp1 to regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Tan2022The; Mao2022FUN14). The protein's function is critical for cellular energy production and stress response, impacting overall cellular and organismal health (Mao2022FUN14).

## Structure
FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in mitophagy. The primary structure of FUNDC1 includes specific amino acid residues that are crucial for its function, such as Ser13, Ser17, and Tyr18, which are subject to phosphorylation. These post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating FUNDC1's interaction with LC3B, a protein involved in autophagosome formation (Wu2014ULK; Lv2016Structural).

The secondary structure of FUNDC1 includes regions that form alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of many proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of FUNDC1 into a three-dimensional shape that allows it to interact with other proteins, such as LC3B. This interaction is facilitated by the LC3 interaction region (LIR) of FUNDC1, which binds to LC3B in an extended conformation (Lv2016Structural).

Phosphorylation at Ser17 by ULK1 kinase enhances the binding affinity of FUNDC1 to LC3B, while phosphorylation at Tyr18 disrupts this interaction. The reversible phosphorylation of these residues acts as a switch for selective mitophagy, highlighting the dynamic nature of FUNDC1's quaternary interactions with other proteins (Wu2014ULK; Lv2016Structural).

## Function
FUNDC1 (FUN14 domain containing 1) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a critical role in mitophagy, a selective autophagy process targeting damaged mitochondria for degradation. In healthy human cells, FUNDC1 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions such as hypoxia. It acts as a mitophagy receptor by interacting with LC3, a protein involved in autophagosome formation, to facilitate the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (Chen2017Mitochondrial; Mao2022FUN14).

The activity of FUNDC1 is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at specific serine and tyrosine residues. Under normal conditions, phosphorylation by kinases such as CK2 and Src inhibits its interaction with LC3, thus preventing mitophagy. During hypoxic stress, dephosphorylation by phosphatases like PGAM5 enhances FUNDC1's activity, promoting mitophagy (Liu2021The; Mao2022FUN14).

FUNDC1 also interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as OPA1 and Drp1, to regulate mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Tan2022The; Mao2022FUN14). These interactions are crucial for cellular energy production and stress response, impacting overall cellular and organismal health (Mao2022FUN14).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the FUNDC1 gene, which plays a critical role in mitophagy, have been linked to several diseases. In the context of obesity and metabolic syndrome, FUNDC1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial quality control, leading to increased body weight, larger adipocytes, and insulin resistance. This is particularly evident in high-fat diet-fed mice, where FUNDC1 knockout results in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance, indicating a significant role in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (Wu2019Deficiency).

In cardiovascular diseases, FUNDC1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Its deficiency is associated with cardiac dysfunction, including heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. The absence of FUNDC1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and increased mortality rates following myocardial infarction. FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy is protective against cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, particularly in conditions like pressure-overload-induced heart failure and obesity-induced cardiomyopathy (Li2021FUNDC1:; Liu2021The; Mao2022FUN14).

FUNDC1 is also implicated in diabetic nephropathy and septic cardiomyopathy, where its role in mitophagy and mitochondrial-associated membranes is crucial for cellular function. Disruptions in FUNDC1 can exacerbate inflammatory responses and contribute to disease progression (Tan2022The; Liu2021The).

## Interactions
FUNDC1 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a significant role in mitophagy through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with LC3 via its LIR motif, which is essential for its function in mitophagy. Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as Ser13, Ser17, and Tyr18, modulates its binding affinity to LC3, thereby influencing mitophagy (Li2021FUNDC1:).

FUNDC1 also interacts with the mitochondrial E3 ligase MARCH5, which mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation, particularly at lysine 119. This interaction is crucial for regulating mitophagy under hypoxic conditions (Chen2017Mitochondrial). MARCH5's interaction with FUNDC1 is enhanced under hypoxic stress, leading to increased degradation of FUNDC1 and modulation of mitophagic activity (Chen2017Mitochondrial).

In addition, FUNDC1 interacts with other mitochondrial proteins, such as OPA1 and DRP1, to coordinate mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. It also associates with LonP1, a protease involved in mitochondrial protein quality control, to maintain the stability and function of mitochondrial complex V (Wu2016FUNDC1; Li2020The). These interactions highlight FUNDC1's role in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular stress responses.
