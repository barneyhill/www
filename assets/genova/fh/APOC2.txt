# APOC2

## Overview
The APOC2 gene encodes apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), a critical protein in lipid metabolism, primarily functioning as a cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This protein is categorized as an apolipoprotein, which is involved in the regulation of lipid transport and metabolism. ApoC-II is synthesized in the liver and plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), facilitating the release of free fatty acids and glycerol for energy production or storage (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein; Liu2015Apoc2). The mature apoC-II protein consists of 79 amino acids and is characterized by its amphipathic alpha-helices, which are essential for its interaction with LPL (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein; Kei2012A). Mutations in the APOC2 gene can lead to lipid metabolism disorders, such as severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome, due to impaired LPL activation (Liu2015Apoc2; Yang2020AAVMediated).

## Structure
The human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) protein is a mature protein consisting of 79 amino acids with a molecular weight of 8916 daltons (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein; Kei2012A). Its primary structure is derived from a 101 amino acid precursor, which is processed to yield the mature form (Hegele2023Apolipoprotein). The secondary structure of apoC-II includes three amphipathic alpha-helices. The first helix spans residues 16 to 38, the second from 45 to 57, and the third from 65 to 74 (Kei2012A). The N-terminal region contains a lipid-binding domain, while the C-terminal helix is crucial for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activation, with specific residues such as 63, 66, 69, and 70 playing key roles (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein; Kei2012A).

The tertiary structure is predominantly helical, with the C-terminal helix forming a G-type helix similar to those in globular proteins (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein). The quaternary structure involves the interaction of apoC-II with LPL, where two apoC-II molecules bind per LPL dimer, facilitating triglyceride substrate guidance into LPL's active site (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein). ApoC-II can also form amyloid fibrils through self-assembly, with a cross-beta structure composed of two parallel beta sheets (Kei2012A). The protein does not undergo significant glycosylation (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein).

## Function
The APOC2 gene encodes apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), a protein that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. ApoC-II is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins such as chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein; Liu2015Apoc2). This process facilitates the release of free fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used for energy production or stored in adipose tissue (Liu2015Apoc2).

ApoC-II is synthesized with a 22-residue signal peptide that is cleaved in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a mature protein of 79 amino acids (Jong1999Role). The protein contains three helical regions, with the C-terminal helix being responsible for LPL activation (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein). ApoC-II binds to lipoproteins and LPL, facilitating the entry of triglyceride substrates into the enzyme's active site, which is crucial for maintaining normal triglyceride levels in the blood (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein).

In healthy human cells, APOC2 is necessary for proper LPL function, preventing the accumulation of triglycerides in the blood and reducing the risk of hypertriglyceridemia (Liu2015Apoc2). ApoC-II is active in the bloodstream, associated with lipoprotein particles, and its plasma levels can be influenced by factors such as age, sex, diet, and certain diseases (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the APOC2 gene are associated with several lipid metabolism disorders, most notably severe hypertriglyceridemia and familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). These conditions result from the impaired activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a crucial enzyme for triglyceride metabolism, due to dysfunctional apoC-II, the protein product of APOC2 (Liu2015Apoc2; Yang2020AAVMediated). Patients with APOC2 mutations often present with elevated plasma triglyceride levels, chylomicronemia, and recurrent acute pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening (Jiang2016A; Liu2015Apoc2).

APOC2 mutations are rare, with fewer than 30 known mutations, many of which are missense mutations that impair LPL activation (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein). These genetic defects can lead to conditions like hyperlipoproteinemia type IB, characterized by high triglyceride levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Talmud2001Genetic). The prevalence of certain mutations, such as K55Q and E38K, is higher in specific populations, indicating a potential genetic predisposition (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein).

Current treatments for APOC2 deficiency are limited, as conventional lipid-lowering drugs are largely ineffective. Novel therapies, including gene therapy and apoC-II mimetic peptides, are being explored to address these deficiencies (Liu2015Apoc2; Yang2020AAVMediated).

## Interactions
Apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) primarily interacts with lipoprotein lipase (LPL), serving as a crucial cofactor that enhances LPL activity. This interaction is essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). The COOH-terminal region of APOC2, particularly residues 56 to 79, is critical for this activation. Deletion of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide residues 76 through 79 impairs the protein's ability to activate LPL, highlighting the importance of these residues in the interaction (Jong1999Role). 

The interaction between APOC2 and LPL involves both the N- and C-terminal domains of LPL, with two APOC2 molecules binding per LPL dimer. This binding is thought to displace the lid region of LPL, facilitating triglyceride entry into the active site (Wolska2017Apolipoprotein). 

APOC2 also exhibits inhibitory interactions at high concentrations, where it can inhibit LPL activity, suggesting a complex regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Jong1999Role). Additionally, APOC2 can inhibit the apoE-mediated binding of VLDL to the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, indicating its involvement in multiple regulatory pathways (Jong1999Role).
