# DNAAF5

## Overview
The DNAAF5 gene encodes the dynein axonemal assembly factor 5 protein, which is integral to the assembly and function of motile cilia and flagella. As a scaffold protein, DNAAF5 is involved in the assembly of axonemal dynein arms, crucial for ciliary motility, by facilitating the formation of dynein motor complexes within the cytoplasm before their transport to cilia. This function is essential for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and fertility (Horani2023The). DNAAF5 also plays a role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by interacting with proteins involved in glycolysis, highlighting its significance beyond ciliary function (Liu2022DNAAF5). Mutations in DNAAF5 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, underscoring its clinical importance (Horani2023The).

## Function
The DNAAF5 gene, also known as HEATR2, plays a crucial role in the assembly of dynein arms, which are essential components of the ciliary axoneme responsible for ciliary motility. In healthy human cells, DNAAF5 functions as a dynein motor assembly factor, facilitating the proper assembly of axonemal inner dynein arms (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) motor complexes within the cytoplasm before they are transported to the cilia (Horani2023The). This assembly process is vital for the motility of cilia and flagella, which are involved in various physiological processes, including respiratory function and fertility (Horani2023The).

DNAAF5 is part of a complex with other proteins such as SPAG1 and DNAAF2, which are involved in the early steps of axonemal dynein assembly. This complex is crucial for the formation of dynein intermediate chains (DICs), independent of HSP70 or HSP90, ensuring the proper function of motile cilia (Smith2022The). The gene's activity is particularly important in tissues with motile cilia, such as the respiratory tract and sperm flagella, where it ensures the structural integrity and function of dynein motor complexes (Horani2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAAF5 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function. This condition leads to chronic respiratory tract infections, bronchiectasis, reduced fertility, and sometimes laterality defects with associated cardiac malformations. Variants in DNAAF5, including missense and null alleles, have been identified as causative of PCD. Homozygosity for null alleles in DNAAF5 is embryonic lethal, while compound heterozygous animals with missense and null alleles show severe disease phenotypes such as hydrocephalus and early lethality. Homozygous missense mutations result in milder disease with partially preserved cilia function (Horani2023The).

DNAAF5 is also implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of primary liver cancer. The gene is highly expressed in HCC tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and its increased expression is associated with poor prognostic outcomes. DNAAF5 promotes cancer progression by recruiting USP39 to stabilize the PFKL protein, which is involved in glycolysis, suggesting that DNAAF5 could be a potential therapeutic target for HCC (Liu2022DNAAF5).

## Interactions
DNAAF5, also known as dynein axonemal assembly factor 5, participates in several critical protein interactions. In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DNAAF5 interacts with the PFKL protein, a key enzyme in glycolysis. This interaction is significant as DNAAF5 enhances the stability of PFKL by inhibiting its polyubiquitination, thereby increasing its intracellular levels. DNAAF5 acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting USP39, a deubiquitination protein, to stabilize PFKL, promoting glycolysis and the malignant progression of HCC (Liu2022DNAAF5).

In the context of ciliary function, DNAAF5 is involved in the assembly of axonemal dyneins, particularly in the formation of outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs). It interacts with DNAI2 and forms a complex with SPAG1 and DNAAF2, which is crucial for axonemal dynein assembly. This complex is involved at an earlier step than other DNAAFs, and DNAAF5 co-localizes in Dynein Axonemal Particles (DynAPs) with DNAAF2 and SPAG1 (Huizar2018A; Smith2022The). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of motile cilia, as indicated by the co-localization of multiple DNAAFs and dynein subunits in these structures.
