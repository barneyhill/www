# AP1M2

## Overview
AP1M2 is a gene that encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit mu 2, a critical component of the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1B. This protein plays a pivotal role in the polarized sorting of membrane proteins, particularly in epithelial cells, by facilitating their transport from recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral membrane. The AP-1B complex, which includes the protein encoded by AP1M2, is essential for maintaining epithelial cell polarity and integrity, especially in tissues with high cell turnover such as the intestinal epithelium (Duclos2023The; Hase2013AP1B−Mediated). The protein's interactions with other components of the adaptor protein complexes, such as γ-adaptin and vacuolar sorting receptors, underscore its importance in vesicle trafficking and cellular processes (Nishimura2016The; Park2013Arabidopsis). Additionally, AP1M2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target in ovarian and bladder cancers (MuñozGalván2019New; Kałuzińska2021In).

## Function
The AP1M2 gene encodes the μ1B subunit of the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1B, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell polarity in the mammalian intestine. This complex is involved in the polarized sorting of membrane proteins, essential for the proper function and structure of intestinal epithelial cells (Duclos2023The; Hase2013AP1B−Mediated). AP-1B facilitates the transport of proteins from recycling endosomes and/or the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral membrane, ensuring the correct localization of proteins such as the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and EphB2 (Hase2013AP1B−Mediated).

In healthy cells, AP1M2 plays a significant role in the apical targeting of proteins and polarity determinants, such as Cdc42, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier and the vectorial absorption of nutrients (Duclos2023The). The AP-1B complex also regulates the trafficking of E-cadherin to adherens junctions, maintaining cell polarity and integrity. Its deficiency can lead to mislocalization of E-cadherin, destabilizing the E-cadherin-catenin complex and increasing nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which activates genes promoting cell proliferation (Hase2013AP1B−Mediated). This function is particularly important in tissues with rapid cell turnover, such as the small intestine (Hase2013AP1B−Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
AP1M2 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in ovarian cancer. The gene is notably upregulated in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, and its high mRNA levels have been associated with shorter survival in ovarian cancer patients, although statistical significance for AP1M2 specifically was not detailed (MuñozGalván2019New). AP1M2 is also linked to platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, suggesting its involvement in pathways related to DNA damage and repair, which are crucial for cancer stem cell phenotypes. These pathways, including MAPK/AKT and NOTCH, are potential therapeutic targets to restore platinum sensitivity in resistant ovarian tumors (MuñozGalván2019New).

In bladder cancer, AP1M2 expression is influenced by the WWOX gene, with a noted decrease in AP1M2 expression when WWOX is downregulated. This interaction suggests a role for AP1M2 in pathways affecting cell adhesion and migration, although specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from AP1M2 alterations in bladder cancer are not detailed (Kałuzińska2021In). Overall, AP1M2's role in cancer highlights its potential as a biomarker and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
AP1M2, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) in Arabidopsis, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for vesicle trafficking and cellular processes. AP1M2 interacts with γ-adaptin, a large subunit of the AP-1 complex, as demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Park2013Arabidopsis). This interaction is essential for its role in vesicle formation and trafficking pathways from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the vacuole and plasma membrane (Park2013Arabidopsis).

AP1M2 also interacts with the vacuolar sorting receptor VSR4, recognizing the tyrosine-sorting motif YMPL in VSR4's cytosolic tail. This interaction is crucial for the post-Golgi sorting of VSR4, as shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Nishimura2016The). Mutations in the tyrosine-sorting motif significantly reduce this interaction, highlighting its importance (Nishimura2016The).

Additionally, AP1M2 is associated with AP-2 subunits, indicating a connection between AP-1 and AP-2 complexes. This was identified through tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry experiments, suggesting AP1M2's involvement in broader protein interaction networks related to endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Wang2023Adaptor).
