# TIFAB

## Overview
TIFAB is a gene that encodes the TIFA inhibitor protein, which plays a critical role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in hematopoietic cells. The TIFA inhibitor is involved in the regulation of ubiquitin signaling, acting as a modulator of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing the stability of key proteins such as MDM2 and KEAP1, which are integral to the p53 signaling pathway. TIFAB is also a negative regulator of innate immune signaling, specifically by suppressing TRAF6-mediated NF-κB signaling, thereby modulating immune responses and cellular stress pathways. The gene's location on chromosome 5q makes it significant in the context of myeloid malignancies, as its deletion is associated with conditions such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Niederkorn2020TIFAB; Niederkorn2020TIFA).

## Function
TIFAB is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating USP15-mediated signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating p53 signaling pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to DNA damage (Niederkorn2020TIFAB). TIFAB enhances the deubiquitination activity of USP15, particularly affecting substrates like MDM2 and KEAP1, which are involved in p53 signaling. This interaction stabilizes MDM2, reducing its ubiquitination and subsequently influencing p53 expression levels (Niederkorn2020TIFAB).

In healthy human cells, particularly in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), TIFAB is vital for maintaining effective hematopoiesis by regulating TRAF6 protein levels. The absence of TIFAB leads to elevated TRAF6 levels, which can increase the intensity and duration of TLR inflammatory responses, potentially resulting in features similar to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Niederkorn2020TIFAB). TIFAB also acts as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling, suppressing TRAF6-induced NF-kB signaling, which is crucial for immune response regulation (Niederkorn2020TIFA). Through these mechanisms, TIFAB contributes to the regulation of immune responses and cellular stress pathways, playing a protective role in cellular stress responses (Niederkorn2020TIFAB).

## Clinical Significance
The TIFAB gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in myeloid malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). TIFAB is located on chromosome 5q, a region frequently deleted in these conditions. Its deletion is associated with significant changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), leading to hematopoietic defects such as cytopenias, myeloid dysplasia, and bone marrow failure (Niederkorn2020TIFA). TIFAB acts as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling, and its deletion results in increased expression of genes involved in interferon response, inflammation, and NF-kB activation (Niederkorn2020TIFA).

TIFAB is often co-deleted with miR-146a, exacerbating the dysregulation of TRAF6 signaling and contributing to the pathogenesis of del(5q) MDS (Niederkorn2020TIFA). The loss of TIFAB and miR-146a leads to increased p53 activation during inflammation, affecting the repopulating potential and quiescence of HSPCs (Muto2022Chronic). This dual deficiency results in more severe cytopenia and progression to a fatal bone marrow failure-like disease (Muto2022Chronic). The deletion of TIFAB sensitizes HSPCs to stressors like DNA damage and chemotherapy, impairing their function, which can be mitigated by suppressing p53 expression (Niederkorn2020TIFA). These findings underscore the potential of TIFAB as a therapeutic target in hematopoietic disorders.

## Interactions
TIFAB interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It binds to the catalytic domain of USP15, a deubiquitinating enzyme, enhancing its activity. This interaction is crucial for modulating ubiquitin signaling, which affects the stability of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, particularly in the context of p53 signaling pathways (Niederkorn2020TIFAB). TIFAB's interaction with USP15 is selective, as it does not increase the activity of other USP enzymes like USP7 (Niederkorn2020TIFAB).

TIFAB also interacts with TRAF6, a key adaptor protein in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Unlike its structural homolog TIFA, TIFAB suppresses TRAF6-mediated TLR-NF-κB signaling, indicating its role as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling (Niederkorn2020TIFAB; Niederkorn2020TIFA). This interaction is significant in the context of myeloid malignancies, where TIFAB's deletion leads to increased TRAF6 protein levels and enhanced inflammatory responses (Niederkorn2020TIFA).

In the context of hematopoietic cells, TIFAB's interaction with USP15 influences the deubiquitination of MDM2, a protein involved in p53 regulation, thereby affecting p53 expression levels and cellular stress responses (Niederkorn2020TIFAB). These interactions highlight TIFAB's role in regulating key signaling pathways involved in stress responses and hematopoietic cell function.
