# SPDYE8

## Overview
SPDYE8 is a gene that encodes the protein known as speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E8. This protein is part of the speedy/RINGO family, which is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. Members of this family are known to interact with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), playing a crucial role in cell cycle progression and regulation. The SPDYE8 gene, through its encoded protein, contributes to the intricate network of cell cycle control, potentially influencing cellular proliferation and differentiation processes. Understanding the function and interactions of SPDYE8 is essential for elucidating its role in normal cellular physiology and its implications in various pathological conditions.
