# TAF11L4

## Overview
TAF11L4 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 4, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is part of the transcription factor complex that interacts with the TATA-box, a DNA sequence found in the promoter region of genes, playing a crucial role in the initiation of gene transcription. TAF11L4 is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in modulating the transcriptional machinery. The precise biological functions and interactions of TAF11L4 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in various cellular processes through its participation in transcriptional regulation. Further research is needed to elucidate its specific roles and potential implications in health and disease.
