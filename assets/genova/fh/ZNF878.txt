# ZNF878

## Overview
ZNF878 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 878, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in DNA binding and play critical roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and development. The specific functions and interactions of zinc finger protein 878 remain to be fully elucidated, but like other zinc finger proteins, it is likely involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological pathways and clinical significance associated with ZNF878.
