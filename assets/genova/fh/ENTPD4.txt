# ENTPD4

## Overview
ENTPD4, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ENTPD family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates. This protein plays a critical role in nucleotide metabolism by regulating extracellular nucleotide levels, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. Unlike other members of its family that are expressed on the cell surface, ENTPD4 is primarily active within the Golgi apparatus, where it influences protein glycosylation and trafficking (Möller2007Monitoring). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper modification and sorting of proteins, impacting various cellular functions. Additionally, ENTPD4 has been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer through its involvement in the circATXN7/miR-4319/ENTPD4 axis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2020Circular).

## Function
ENTPD4, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 4, is an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates, playing a crucial role in nucleotide metabolism by regulating extracellular nucleotide levels. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. ENTPD4 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences processes such as protein glycosylation and trafficking (Möller2007Monitoring). The enzyme's activity in the Golgi is significant for the proper modification and sorting of proteins, which are critical for various cellular functions.

ENTPD4 is part of the ENTPD family, which includes enzymes with a structure similar to P2X purinoceptors, featuring cytosolic N-and C-terminal tails, two transmembrane domains, and an extracellular domain. While ENTPD1-3 and 8 are expressed as cell surface enzymes, ENTPD4 is a luminal enzyme of intracellular organelles, specifically the Golgi apparatus (Möller2007Monitoring). The enzyme's role in the Golgi apparatus suggests its involvement in the regulation of nucleotide levels within this organelle, impacting the efficiency of protein processing and transport. This function is vital for the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis, as it ensures the proper functioning of cellular pathways dependent on nucleotide signaling and metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
ENTPD4, or ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 4, has been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) through its involvement in the circATXN7/miR-4319/ENTPD4 axis. In gastric cancer, ENTPD4 is overexpressed and its expression is negatively correlated with miR-4319, a microRNA that is downregulated in GC. This axis plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. CircATXN7, a circular RNA, acts as a sponge for miR-4319, leading to the upregulation of ENTPD4, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (Zhang2020Circular).

The study suggests that alterations in the expression levels of ENTPD4, as part of this regulatory axis, are associated with the development and progression of gastric cancer. Silencing circATXN7, which indirectly affects ENTPD4 expression, has been shown to reduce tumor growth in vivo, indicating the potential of targeting this pathway for therapeutic interventions in gastric cancer (Zhang2020Circular). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in the ENTPD4 gene itself are not detailed in the provided context (Zhang2020Circular).
