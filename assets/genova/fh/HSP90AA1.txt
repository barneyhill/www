# HSP90AA1

## Overview
The HSP90AA1 gene encodes the heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (Hsp90α), a molecular chaperone that is integral to cellular homeostasis and stress response. Hsp90α is a cytosolic protein that assists in the proper folding, stabilization, and function of a wide array of client proteins, including kinases, transcription factors, and steroid hormone receptors. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein degradation, and cell cycle control. The protein functions as a dimer and is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as various post-translational modifications. Hsp90α also plays roles beyond the intracellular environment, participating in extracellular processes like wound healing and inflammation. Its involvement in numerous cellular pathways makes it a key player in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and viral infections (Prodromou2016Mechanisms; Hoter2018The; Zuehlke2015Regulation).

## Structure
The HSP90AA1 gene encodes the heat shock protein 90α (Hsp90α), a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. The protein is composed of three main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the middle domain (MD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD is responsible for ATP binding, which is crucial for the protein's ATPase activity, while the CTD is involved in dimerization, a key aspect of its quaternary structure (Prodromou2022Advances; Hoter2018The). 

Hsp90α functions as a dimer, with dimerization facilitated by the CTD. This dimerization is essential for its chaperone activity, allowing it to interact with a wide range of client proteins (Hoter2018The). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its function and interactions. Specific phosphorylation sites, such as Threonines 5 and 7, are involved in the DNA damage response, while acetylation affects its secretion and tumor invasiveness (Zuehlke2015Regulation).

Hsp90α is encoded by two distinct mRNA transcripts, resulting in two isoforms: one with 854 amino acids and another with 732 amino acids, differing by an additional 112 amino acids at the N-terminus of the longer isoform (Zuehlke2015Regulation).

## Function
The HSP90AA1 gene encodes the Hsp90α protein, a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. Hsp90α is involved in the proper folding and stabilization of a wide range of client proteins, including kinases, transcription factors, and steroid hormone receptors, which are essential for various cellular processes (Hoter2018The; Zuehlke2015Regulation). It interacts with approximately 10% of the eukaryotic proteome, highlighting its extensive involvement in cellular signaling and regulation (Prodromou2016Mechanisms).

Hsp90α is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it assists in the folding of nascent polypeptides and the refolding of misfolded proteins, particularly under stress conditions (Hoter2018The). It is also involved in the maturation of key signaling proteins and the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, contributing to processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Prodromou2016Mechanisms; Hoter2018The).

In addition to its intracellular functions, Hsp90α has extracellular roles, such as in wound healing and inflammation, where it can activate transcription programs that include pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zuehlke2015Regulation). This multifaceted role underscores its importance in both cellular homeostasis and organismal stress responses.

## Clinical Significance
The HSP90AA1 gene, encoding the Hsp90α protein, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in protein folding and stability. Alterations in its expression are linked to cancer progression, as Hsp90α stabilizes oncoproteins, promoting tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. It is overexpressed in many cancers, correlating with poor prognosis, although exceptions exist, such as in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where higher expression indicates better prognosis (Yuan2022Analysis). In some cancers, HSP90AA1 is associated with immune cell interactions, affecting chemotherapy and immunotherapy outcomes (Yuan2022Analysis).

Mutations within the HSP90AA1 gene, although not frequently altered in most tumors, are associated with cancer progression. Bladder and pancreatic cancers show the highest rates of HSP90AA1 alterations, with 115 known mutations within its open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on Hsp90α function remain unclear, but some tumors exhibit homozygous deletions of HSP90AA1, correlating with reduced malignancy and favorable outcomes, as seen in gastric cancer patients (Zuehlke2015Regulation).

Hsp90α is also implicated in non-cancerous conditions, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and asthma, where its levels correlate with disease severity. Inhibiting Hsp90α could be a therapeutic strategy for these conditions (Maiti2022Cytosolic).

## Interactions
HSP90AA1, also known as Hsp90α, is a molecular chaperone that interacts with a wide array of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of approximately 10% of the eukaryotic proteome, interacting with around 2,000 proteins in humans, including transcription factors, kinases, and E3-ligases (Zuehlke2015Regulation). Hsp90α forms complexes with co-chaperones such as Aha1, Cdc37, and CHIP, which modulate its ATPase activity and interactions with client proteins (Prodromou2016Mechanisms).

HSP90AA1 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza A virus, facilitating viral entry into host cells. This interaction is critical for the virus's attachment and entry, and blocking HSP90AA1 can inhibit viral infection (Wang2020Influenza). The binding of HA to HSP90AA1 induces autophagy by inactivating the AKT-mTOR pathway, which may aid in viral entry or immune evasion (Wang2020Influenza).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, significantly impact HSP90AA1's interactions. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Threonines 5 and 7, is involved in DNA damage response, while acetylation enhances its secretion and tumor invasiveness (Zuehlke2015Regulation).
