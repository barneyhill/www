# WDR1

## Overview
WDR1 (WD repeat domain 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. The protein, also named WD repeat domain 1, is characterized by its structural motifs known as WD repeats, which form β-propeller domains. These domains facilitate the protein's role as a co-factor for actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, enhancing their ability to sever and disassemble actin filaments, thereby influencing cell shape, movement, and division (Ono2018Functions; Montenont2016Platelet). WDR1 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and chemotaxis. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its interaction with other proteins and its role in cytoskeletal architecture (Mentel2018WDR1). Mutations in the WDR1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including immune system dysfunctions and blood cell anomalies, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions (Tangye2019Human).

## Structure
WDR1 (WD repeat domain 1) is a protein characterized by its molecular architecture, which includes approximately 600 amino acids and a molecular weight of 65-67 kDa. The protein contains multiple WD repeats, which are structural motifs that typically form a single β-propeller domain. In the case of WDR1, these repeats form two seven-bladed β-propeller domains, resulting in a total of 14 WD repeats. Each WD repeat forms a 'blade' consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Ono2018Functions). The two β-propeller domains are rigidly attached by multiple hydrogen bonds, creating concave and convex surfaces, although posttranslational modifications or binding partners might alter the angle between the propellers, potentially affecting the protein's function (Ono2018Functions).

WDR1 is involved in actin filament dynamics, interacting with actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin to promote actin filament disassembly. This interaction is facilitated by functional residues located on the concave surface of the β-propeller domains (Ono2018Functions). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its role in actin dynamics and cellular processes (Mentel2018WDR1).

## Function
The WDR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in actin filament dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, WDR1 functions as a co-factor for actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, enhancing their ability to sever and disassemble actin filaments. This activity is crucial for maintaining the actin cytoskeleton, which supports cell shape, movement, and division (Ono2018Functions; Montenont2016Platelet).

WDR1 is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton by promoting actin depolymerization, which affects cell spreading and the formation of structures like stress fibers, pseudopodia, and lamellipodia. This regulation is vital for maintaining normal cell shape and function (Montenont2016Platelet). In platelets, WDR1 suppresses activity by enhancing actin-depolymerizing factor activity, which is associated with reduced platelet activity in healthy individuals (Montenont2016Platelet).

WDR1 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and chemotaxis. It also plays a role in maintaining cellular structure and function across different tissues, including epithelial and hematopoietic systems (Ono2018Functions). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with cofilin and actin, affecting cytoskeletal architecture (Mentel2018WDR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the immune system and blood cell function. WDR1 deficiency, resulting from hypomorphic bi-allelic mutations, leads to significant defects in neutrophil function, characterized by impaired migration and chemotaxis, increased baseline superoxide production, and poor wound healing. Clinically, this manifests as severe systemic and respiratory tract infections, chronic stomatitis, and oral stenosis, a condition historically referred to as 'lazy leukocyte syndrome' (Tangye2019Human).

Patients with WDR1 mutations also experience macrothrombocytopenia and autoinflammatory disease, likely due to excessive IL-18 production by monocytes. These mutations can cause intermittent thrombocytopenia, periodic fever, and increased inflammasome activation (Standing2016Autoinflammatory; Tangye2019Human). The mutations affect both myeloid and lymphoid cells, leading to defective neutrophil and monocyte adhesion and motility, aberrant T-cell activation, and B-cell development issues (Pfajfer2018Mutations).

In mice, Wdr1 mutations result in autoinflammatory disease and macrothrombocytopenia, with symptoms such as inflammatory lesions and increased osteoclast activity (Kile2007Mutations). These findings underscore the critical role of WDR1 in maintaining normal immune and hematopoietic functions.

## Interactions
WDR1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in actin filament dynamics. It is known to enhance the activity of cofilin, a protein crucial for actin filament severing, which is essential for processes such as cell migration and cytokinesis (Luxenburg2015Wdr1mediated; LópezCoral2018A). WDR1 also interacts with EYA3, a member of the EYA family of phosphatases. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, particularly influenced by the Src kinase, and is specific to EYA3, as WDR1 does not interact with other EYA family members like EYA1 (Mentel2018WDR1). 

WDR1 is a substrate for EYA3, which dephosphorylates it, leading to modifications in the actin cytoskeleton (Mentel2018WDR1). The interaction between WDR1 and EYA3 is crucial for actin cytoskeleton modulation, affecting cell motility and directional migration (Mentel2018WDR1). Additionally, WDR1 interacts with phosphatases of regenerating liver (PRLs), which are involved in regulating actin rearrangements during T cell activation. This interaction is crucial for the organization of F-actin networks and is dependent on the farnesylation of PRLs (AguilarSopeña2023Phosphatases).
