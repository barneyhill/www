# PRDX3

## Overview
PRDX3 is a gene that encodes the protein peroxiredoxin 3, a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant enzyme belonging to the 2-Cys subclass of peroxiredoxins. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondrial matrix, thereby protecting mitochondrial DNA, lipids, and proteins from oxidative damage (Wu2016Downregulation). Peroxiredoxin 3 is characterized by its ability to form homodimers or decamers and contains a thioredoxin fold, which is crucial for its peroxidase activity (Moreira2008Peroxiredoxin). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation, energy metabolism, and cell proliferation, and interacts with several other proteins to maintain redox homeostasis (Wu2016Downregulation; Mukhopadhyay2006Defective). Alterations in the PRDX3 gene have been linked to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular health and disease (MartínezRubio2022Protein; Whitaker2013Peroxiredoxin3).

## Structure
Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) is a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant enzyme that plays a crucial role in protecting cells against oxidative damage. It is part of the 2-Cys subclass of peroxiredoxins, characterized by two reactive cysteines involved in its peroxidase activity (Moreira2008Peroxiredoxin). PRDX3 typically forms a homodimer or decamer, contributing to its quaternary structure, and contains a thioredoxin fold, a common structural motif in proteins of this family (Moreira2008Peroxiredoxin).

The primary sequence of PRDX3 includes unique residues near the GGLG motif and C-terminal region, which are suggested to contribute to its resistance to hyperoxidation. These regions interact with the Cys-SH residue and the YF motif, potentially altering the interaction with the rest of the Prx molecule and decreasing susceptibility to hyperoxidation (Haynes2013Molecular). The C-terminal YF-containing helix and the GGLG motif are important for stabilizing the active site and slowing the formation of intermolecular disulfide intermediates (Haynes2013Molecular).

PRDX3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its activity and stability (Moreira2008Peroxiredoxin). These structural features and modifications are essential for its function in the oxidative environment of the mitochondria.

## Function
Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis within cells. It is specifically localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it is essential for balancing intracellular oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Wu2016Downregulation). PRDX3 helps protect mitochondrial DNA, lipids, and proteins from oxidative damage, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function (Wu2016Downregulation).

In healthy human cells, PRDX3 is involved in regulating apoptosis and supporting cellular energy metabolism. It contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, which are vital for cellular energy and function (Wu2016Downregulation). PRDX3 is highly expressed in neurons, where it plays a significant role in regulating ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) levels, thus protecting against oxidative injuries and apoptosis (De2008Silencing).

PRDX3 is also involved in cell proliferation and preventing cellular senescence by regulating oxidative stress and cell cycle progression. Its activity is crucial for normal cell growth and function, particularly in trophoblast cells, where it helps protect against oxidative stress induced by toxic bile acids (Wu2016Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRDX3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, PRDX3 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to oxidative stress. This overexpression is observed in prostate cancer, where it is linked to antiandrogen resistance and failure to activate pro-apoptotic pathways, suggesting a role in cancer cell survival and resistance to treatment (Whitaker2013Peroxiredoxin3). PRDX3 is also associated with poor survival outcomes in uveal melanoma, where high expression correlates with metastasis (Ramasamy2019PRDX3). In breast cancer, PRDX3 regulates MMP-1 expression, promoting cell migration and invasion, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Chua2024Peroxiredoxin).

In neurodegenerative diseases, mutations in PRDX3, such as the p.D163E mutation, lead to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to conditions like infantile-onset cerebellar ataxia. This mutation results in protein misfolding and aggregation, triggering unfolded protein responses and impairing mitochondrial function (MartínezRubio2022Protein). These findings highlight the critical role of PRDX3 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that participates in various protein interactions crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance. PRDX3 interacts with the FANCG protein, a component of the Fanconi anemia pathway, within mitochondria. This interaction is essential for controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and its disruption, such as by the G546R mutation in FANCG, leads to increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in Fanconi anemia cells (Mukhopadhyay2006Defective).

PRDX3 also interacts with the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of PRDX3 by LRRK2, particularly at the Thr146 site, which is enhanced by the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. This phosphorylation is linked to decreased peroxidase activity and increased neuronal cell death, contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (Angeles2011Mutations).

Additionally, PRDX3 is involved in interactions with SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase. SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of PRDX3 helps alleviate mitochondrial oxidative damage and apoptosis, highlighting the protective role of PRDX3 in oxidative stress conditions (Wang2020SIRT3mediated). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of PRDX3 in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress.
