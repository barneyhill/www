# C1orf159

## Overview
C1orf159 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 159. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific functional class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated. However, emerging research suggests that C1orf159 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Mutations in the C1orf159 gene, including those in the 5' untranslated region, have been associated with cancer-related mutational signatures, indicating a potential involvement in early cancer development and progression (Juul2021The; Wang2022The). Further studies are required to better understand the functional implications of C1orf159 and its encoded protein in cellular processes and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf159 has been implicated in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Research indicates that C1orf159 is among the top ten mutated genes associated with ESCC, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression (Wang2022The). The study highlights that mutations in C1orf159, along with other genetic alterations such as copy number variations and methylation changes, may influence the expression of angiogenic genes, which are crucial in tumor development and metastasis (Wang2022The).

In cancer genomics, a hotspot mutation in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the C1orf159 gene has been identified. This hotspot is associated with mutational mechanisms linked to esophagus-related and APOBEC signatures, indicating that it may occur early in cancer development (Juul2021The). The presence of this hotspot in an optimal APOBEC3A binding site suggests a specific mutational mechanism that could contribute to cancer progression (Juul2021The).

While the clinical significance of C1orf159 mutations is still under investigation, these findings underscore the gene's potential involvement in cancer, particularly in ESCC, and highlight the need for further research to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms.
