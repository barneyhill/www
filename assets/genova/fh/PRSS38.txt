# PRSS38

## Overview
PRSS38 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 38, which is part of the serine protease family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to cleave peptide bonds in proteins, a function that is critical in various physiological processes, including digestion, immune response, and blood coagulation. Serine protease 38, like other serine proteases, contains a serine residue at its active site, which plays a crucial role in its enzymatic activity. The specific biological roles and mechanisms of PRSS38 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to be involved in complex cellular pathways and may have implications in certain pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
