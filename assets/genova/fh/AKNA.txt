# AKNA

## Overview
AKNA is a gene that encodes an AT-hook transcription factor, which is a type of protein known for its role in binding to A/T-rich DNA sequences. This transcription factor is involved in regulating gene expression, particularly within the immune system, by modulating the activity of genes such as CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) (Siddiqa2001Regulation). The AKNA protein is characterized by its AT-hook DNA-binding motif, which facilitates its interaction with DNA and influences various cellular processes, including immune response regulation and neurogenesis (RamírezGonzález2023Critical; Camargo2019The). AKNA's function extends to the regulation of inflammatory responses and centrosomal microtubule organization, with implications in both immune homeostasis and neural development (RamírezGonzález2021Functional). Additionally, alterations in AKNA expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, knee osteoarthritis, and primary microcephaly, underscoring its clinical significance (MartínezNava2014Cervical; Waseem2021A; MartínezNava2018The).

## Structure
The AKNA protein is a human AT-hook transcription factor characterized by its ability to bind A/T-rich DNA regulatory elements, particularly in the promoters of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) (Siddiqa2001Regulation). The primary structure of AKNA includes a 1.9-kb open reading frame encoding a 633-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of approximately 69,000 (Siddiqa2001Regulation). A notable feature of its sequence is the nine-amino-acid domain, RTRGRPADS, which serves as an AT-hook DNA-binding motif, with the tripeptide GRP at the center (RamírezGonzález2023Critical; Siddiqa2001Regulation).

AKNA contains multiple PEST protein-cleavage motifs, which are indicative of proteins with high turnover rates (Siddiqa2001Regulation). These motifs suggest that AKNA is subject to proteolytic degradation, a common post-translational modification in regulatory proteins (RamírezGonzález2023Critical). The gene encoding AKNA is located on chromosome 9 and comprises 24 exons, producing several isoforms, with A and F1 being the only proven functional variants in vitro (RamírezGonzález2023Critical).

While the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of AKNA have not been detailed, its role as a transcription factor and its involvement in immune response regulation are well-documented (RamírezGonzález2023Critical; Siddiqa2001Regulation).

## Function
The AKNA gene encodes an AT-hook transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the immune system. AKNA is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to AT-rich regulatory elements in the promoters of genes such as CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L), modulating their expression and influencing B-cell differentiation and maturation (Siddiqa2001Regulation; RamírezGonzález2021Functional). This regulation is crucial for the development and function of immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (RamírezGonzález2021Functional).

AKNA acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses, as evidenced by knockout mouse models that show exacerbated inflammation, indicating its role in maintaining immune homeostasis (RamírezGonzález2021Functional). It is also involved in the organization of centrosomal microtubules, which is essential for neural stem cell differentiation and migration, highlighting its role in neurogenesis (Camargo2019The).

In addition to its immune functions, AKNA is implicated in cancer biology, where its downregulation is associated with increased cancer risk, suggesting a protective role against cell transformation (RamírezGonzález2021Functional). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as pCREB and NF-κB, which influence its activity in various cellular processes (RamírezGonzález2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the AKNA gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cervical cancer, specific AKNA polymorphisms, such as -392C4T and -1372C4A, are negatively associated with the disease, suggesting a protective role. Lower AKNA expression in cervical cancer patients may compromise antitumor immunity, potentially promoting HPV persistence and increasing cancer risk (MartínezNava2014Cervical). 

In knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the Pro264Leu and -1372C > A polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk, particularly in individuals developing the condition before age 51. These polymorphisms may influence the inflammatory response, contributing to disease susceptibility (MartínezNava2018The).

AKNA is also linked to primary microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder. A frameshift variant in AKNA was identified in a Pakistani family, leading to microcephaly and mild intellectual disability. This variant affects AKNA's centrosomal localization, crucial for brain development (Waseem2021A).

In dogs, a frameshift variant in AKNA is associated with recurrent inflammatory pulmonary disease, resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia, highlighting its role in inflammatory conditions (Hug2019AKNA).

## Interactions
AKNA, an AT-hook transcription factor, is known for its ability to bind to AT-rich DNA sequences, influencing the transcription of various genes. This binding capability is facilitated by its AT-hook motif, which allows AKNA to interact with DNA and modulate gene expression (Siddiqa2001Regulation; Filarsky2015The). AKNA's interactions are crucial in regulating immune responses, as it can bind to the promoter regions of genes such as CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L), thereby upregulating their expression in B lymphocytes (Siddiqa2001Regulation).

AKNA is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, through its interaction with AT-rich motifs in their promoters (RamírezGonzález2023Critical; Liu2017PKACREB). In the context of T-cell activation, AKNA regulates the expression of genes like IL-2 and CD80, which are essential for immune response modulation (RamírezGonzález2023Critical). The transcription factor is influenced by signaling pathways such as PKA/CREB and NF-κB, which can modulate its expression and activity (Liu2017PKACREB). These interactions highlight AKNA's role in forming multiprotein complexes and participating in both activating and inhibitory interactions within the cell.
