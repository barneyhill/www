# CABYR

## Overview
CABYR (Calcium Binding Tyrosine Phosphorylation Regulated) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in sperm motility and capacitation, essential processes for fertilization. The protein, also named CABYR, is a calcium-binding protein regulated by phosphorylation events and is primarily localized in the fibrous sheath of the sperm flagellum. It functions as a scaffold for enzyme complexes that mediate energy production during glycolysis, contributing to the hyperactivation of sperm flagella (Pelloni2017Molecular). CABYR is characterized by its polymorphic nature, resulting from alternative splicing that produces multiple isoforms, each with distinct roles in calcium binding and localization within the sperm structure (Kim2005Translation). The protein interacts with other fibrous sheath proteins, such as AKAP3 and ropporin, playing a critical role in the assembly and function of the fibrous sheath and in calcium signaling transduction (Li2011CABYR). Beyond its reproductive functions, alterations in CABYR expression have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, where it acts as an oncogenic factor and potential biomarker (Yu2019Upregulated; Luo2007CABYR).

## Structure
The CABYR protein is characterized by its polymorphic nature, resulting from alternative splicing that produces multiple isoforms. It has six known splice variants, CABYR I-VI, involving two coding regions, CR-A and CR-B, separated by a stop codon (Kim2005Translation). The primary structure of CABYR includes a proline-rich extensin-like domain, which is significant for its interaction with proteins like GSK3β (Hsu2005Characterization). The N-terminus of CABYR contains a domain homologous to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), which includes a dimerization interface and a binding site for A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (Sen2003Splicing).

CABYR-A contains a putative EF-hand-like domain, which may mediate calcium binding, although calcium binding persists even when this motif is deleted, indicating it is not essential (Kim2005Translation). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation on tyrosine and serine/threonine residues during capacitation, which increases its acidity (Kim2005Translation). CABYR forms dimers due to its proline-rich extensin-like domain, contributing to its quaternary structure (Kim2005Translation). The protein is primarily localized to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, specifically in the fibrous sheath (Li2011CABYR).

## Function
The CABYR gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm motility and capacitation, processes essential for fertilization. CABYR is located in the sperm flagellum, where it functions as a calcium-binding protein regulated by tyrosine, serine, and threonine phosphorylation events during capacitation (Pelloni2017Molecular). It acts as both a calcium carrier and a scaffold for enzyme complexes that mediate energy production during glycolysis, leading to hyperactivation of the sperm flagella (Pelloni2017Molecular). 

CABYR is a component of the fibrous sheath in human sperm, a structure that provides mechanical support and plays a role in regulating sperm motility (Li2011CABYR). The protein interacts with other fibrous sheath proteins, such as AKAP3 and ropporin, through its RII-like domain, suggesting its involvement in the assembly and function of the fibrous sheath (Li2011CABYR). CABYR's interaction with AKAP3 is significant for calcium signaling transduction, which is crucial for sperm motility (Li2011CABYR). 

CABYR has multiple isoforms, with CABYR-A being responsible for calcium binding, while CABYR-B is localized in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, co-localizing with CABYR-A sequences (Kim2005Translation). The presence of CABYR in the fibrous sheath and its interactions with other proteins highlight its critical role in maintaining sperm structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CABYR gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer. In HCC, the CABYR-a/b isoforms are significantly overexpressed, with studies showing a 2.11-fold increase in HCC tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, poorer differentiation, and worse overall and disease-free survival, suggesting that CABYR-a/b acts as an oncogenic factor in HCC development and progression (Yu2019Upregulated). Knockdown of CABYR-a/b in HCC cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in regulating these processes (Yu2019Upregulated).

In lung cancer, CABYR is identified as a cancer-testis antigen, with its expression found in lung tumor tissues but not in adjacent noncancerous tissues. This makes CABYR a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. The presence of CABYR antibodies in lung cancer patients' sera further supports its role as a biomarker (Luo2007CABYR). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), knockdown of CABYR-a/b increases chemosensitivity to drugs like cisplatin and paclitaxel by inactivating the Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Qian2014Knockdown).

## Interactions
CABYR, a calcium-binding protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins within the sperm fibrous sheath (FS). It binds to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), specifically AKAP3 and AKAP4, through its RII domain. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the FS and is believed to play a role in calcium signaling pathways that influence sperm motility and energy metabolism (Li2010CABYR; Li2011CABYR). CABYR also interacts with ropporin, although this interaction is weaker and occurs through a different region than the RII domain (Li2010CABYR; Li2011CABYR).

In human sperm, CABYR forms a complex with AKAP3 and ropporin, contributing to the structural and functional dynamics of the FS. The interaction with AKAP3 is particularly strong and is mediated by the RII-like domain of CABYR, as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Li2011CABYR). CABYR's interaction with AKAP3 and ropporin suggests its involvement in assembling protein complexes related to calcium signaling pathways, which are essential for sperm motility (Shen2019Testis‐specific).
