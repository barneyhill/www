# ATG7

## Overview
ATG7 is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7), which is a crucial component of the autophagy pathway, a cellular process responsible for degrading and recycling cellular components. The ATG7 protein functions as an E1-like enzyme, playing a pivotal role in the conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins, such as Atg8 and Atg12, to their respective E2 enzymes, facilitating autophagosome formation (Pattison2011Atg7; Collier2021ATG7). Structurally, ATG7 is a multidomain homodimer with distinct domains that enable its interaction with other autophagy-related proteins, thereby regulating cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Popelka2015Analysis; Hurley2014Atomistic). The gene's expression and function are critical in various physiological processes, including neural integrity and endothelial cell function, and its dysregulation is implicated in several diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and autoimmune diseases (Fraiberg2020Genetic; Singh2015The; Greer2022Germline).

## Structure
The ATG7 protein is a multidomain homodimer involved in the activation of autophagy-related ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) such as Atg8 and Atg12. It has a unique structure that includes an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a central adenylation domain, which resembles the adenylation domain of canonical E1 enzymes. The NTD is crucial for engaging with E2 enzymes Atg10 and Atg3, facilitating the exposure of their catalytic cysteine residues (Kaiser2013Structures; Hurley2014Atomistic).

The central domain of ATG7 is a symmetric homodimer, allowing each protomer to activate a UBL molecule. This domain binds to Atg8, positioning its C terminus near the ATP phosphate, and a conserved E1 aspartate coordinates a magnesium ion to promote the transfer of AMP from ATP to Atg8's C terminus. The central domain also contains a 'crossover/catalytic Cys' loop that adopts different conformations for distinct functions, such as clamping Atg8's C terminus in the adenylation active site and facilitating the formation of a thioester-bonded Atg7-Atg8 intermediate (Hurley2014Atomistic).

ATG7's C-terminal domain (CTD) is involved in homodimerization and contains an AIM-like motif required for interaction with Atg8, located within an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) (Popelka2015Analysis). The protein's structure is likened to a bird, with the CTD dimer resembling the body and the NTDs resembling wings (Kaiser2013Structures).

## Function
The ATG7 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the autophagy process, a critical cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cellular components. ATG7 functions as an E1-like enzyme, facilitating the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 and the lipidation of LC3-I to LC3-II, which are crucial steps in autophagosome formation (Pattison2011Atg7; Collier2021ATG7). This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper autophagic flux, which is necessary for the degradation of damaged proteins and organelles (Singh2015The).

In healthy human cells, ATG7 is involved in various physiological processes. It plays a significant role in maintaining neural integrity and preventing neurodegenerative conditions by ensuring proper autophagic activity (Collier2021ATG7). In endothelial cells, ATG7 helps maintain cellular identity and function, preventing pathological changes such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with organ fibrosis (Singh2015The). ATG7 is also crucial for the turnover of cytoplasmic components, particularly under stress conditions, contributing to cellular survival and function (Komatsu2005Impairment). Overall, ATG7 is integral to cellular maintenance and stress response, highlighting its importance in various cellular and systemic functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ATG7 gene are linked to several diseases. In neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, deregulation of ATG7 is implicated in disease progression. Novel heterozygous variants in the ATG7 promoter have been identified in sporadic Parkinson's disease patients, leading to decreased transcription and suggesting ATG7 levels as a risk factor (Fraiberg2020Genetic). In autoimmune diseases, ATG7 is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, potentially due to its role in mitochondrial quality control (Yamamoto2023Autophagy).

ATG7 mutations are also linked to cancer. In familial cholangiocarcinoma, a germline nonsense mutation of ATG7 results in autophagy inhibition, which may contribute to tumorigenesis (Greer2022Germline; Yamamoto2023Autophagy). The p.Arg659* mutation in ATG7 is associated with cholangiocarcinoma, leading to a loss of autophagic function and accumulation of p62, which can activate cancer-promoting pathways (Greer2022Germline; Greer2019Genetic). Additionally, ATG7 deletion is considered a potential driver event in renal cell carcinoma, acting as a tumor suppressor (Muller2023The).

In celiac disease, reduced ATG7 expression correlates with decreased autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Fraiberg2020Genetic).

## Interactions
ATG7 is a homodimeric E1 enzyme that plays a crucial role in the autophagy pathway by interacting with several proteins. It activates the ubiquitin-like proteins Atg8 and Atg12, transferring them to their respective E2 enzymes, Atg3 and Atg10 (Kaiser2012Noncanonical; Noda2011Structural). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of ATG7 is essential for binding Atg3, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) interacts with Atg8 (Noda2011Structural). The interaction between ATG7 and Atg3 involves a highly basic surface on the ATG7 NTD, which recognizes a negatively charged region on Atg3 (Noda2011Structural). 

ATG7 forms a thioester-linked conjugate with Atg8, facilitating its transfer to Atg3. This process involves a unique 'trans' E1-to-E2 mechanism, where Atg3 bound to one ATG7 NTD accepts Atg8 from the catalytic cysteine of the opposite ATG7 protomer (Taherbhoy2011Atg8). ATG7 also interacts with Atg10 for the activation of Atg12, using the same surfaces to recognize distinctive features of these E2 enzymes (Kaiser2012Noncanonical). The interaction with Atg10 involves a β-hairpin binding to the shoulder groove of ATG7, stabilized by salt bridges and a 10-stranded interprotein β-sheet (Kaiser2012Noncanonical).
