# LRIG3

## Overview
LRIG3, or leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The LRIG3 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases such as the ErbB family (Cheng2019The; Simion2014The). Unlike its homolog LRIG1, which promotes receptor degradation, LRIG3 stabilizes these receptors, indicating a unique regulatory role (Stevenson2022Lrig3). Functionally, LRIG3 is implicated in neural crest formation and inner ear development, where it modulates signaling pathways like Wnt and FGF (Simion2014The). Clinically, alterations in LRIG3 expression are associated with various cancers, including glioma and colorectal cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor and influences tumor progression and metastasis (Peng2021LRIG3; Zeng2020LRIG3). These attributes make LRIG3 a significant focus for understanding cellular signaling and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
LRIG3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its domain organization, which includes a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich N-flanking domain, 15 leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail (Cheng2019The). The extracellular domains of LRIG3, which include the LRR and Ig domains, are involved in protein-protein interactions and show homology with other LRIG family members (Simion2014The). The LRR domains are known for their role in facilitating interactions with other proteins, such as receptor tyrosine kinases, including the ErbB family (Abraira2010Vertebrate).

The intracellular tail of LRIG3 contains putative SH2 and SH3 domains, which may interact with activated receptors, although the specific signaling pathways influenced by these interactions remain unclear (Abraira2010Vertebrate). The cytoplasmic domain of LRIG3 shows little homology to LRIG1, suggesting potential differences in their signaling mechanisms (Abraira2010Vertebrate). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may affect the function and stability of LRIG3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The presence of splice variants or isoforms of LRIG3 is not mentioned in the context.

## Function
LRIG3 is a transmembrane protein involved in regulating various cell signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases. It has been shown to interact with ErbB receptors, such as EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, in vitro, although its role in vivo remains less clear (Abraira2010Vertebrate). Unlike LRIG1, which promotes the degradation of ErbB receptors, LRIG3 appears to stabilize these receptors, suggesting a distinct mechanism of action (Stevenson2022Lrig3). 

LRIG3 is also implicated in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signaling pathways. In Xenopus, LRIG3 is necessary for neural crest formation, where it enhances canonical Wnt signaling and inhibits FGF signaling by interacting with and decreasing the expression of FGFR1 (Simion2014The). 

In the context of inner ear development, LRIG3 is essential for the proper formation of the lateral canal, where it restricts the expression of Netrin1, a protein involved in axon guidance (Simion2014The). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner ear, as evidenced by developmental defects observed in Lrig3-null mice (del2013In).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRIG3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including glioma and colorectal cancer. In gliomas, LRIG3 acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the PI3K/AKT/VEGFA signaling pathway, which is crucial for angiogenesis. Knockdown of LRIG3 in glioma cells leads to increased VEGFA expression, promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression, while overexpression of LRIG3 results in decreased VEGFA levels, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Peng2021LRIG3). Additionally, LRIG3 expression is lower in high-grade gliomas compared to low-grade ones, and higher expression levels are associated with better survival outcomes, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Cheng2019The).

In colorectal cancer, LRIG3 expression is significantly downregulated, which is associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. This downregulation is often due to copy number variations and promoter hypermethylation. LRIG3 influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, particularly affecting the expression of slug, a key EMT-related transcription factor. Knockout of LRIG3 enhances cell migration and invasion, while overexpression inhibits these processes, highlighting its role in cancer metastasis (Zeng2020LRIG3). These findings suggest that LRIG3 could be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
LRIG3, a member of the LRIG family, is known to interact with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. In vitro studies have demonstrated that LRIG3 can bind to ErbB receptors, including EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4, through its ectodomain, which shares a high degree of homology with LRIG1. This interaction has been observed in HEK293T cells via coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Abraira2010Vertebrate). Despite these interactions, LRIG3's role in modulating ErbB signaling in vivo, particularly in inner ear morphogenesis, remains uncertain (Abraira2010Vertebrate).

LRIG3 also interacts with the Ret receptor, where it restricts GDNF-induced Ret signaling, affecting downstream pathways such as Erk1/2 and Akt activation. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, and LRIG3's role in modulating Ret signaling is similar to that of LRIG1 (De2021Lrig1).

In the context of glioblastoma, soluble LRIG3 (sLRIG3) interacts with NETO2 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This interaction influences the polarization of TAMs, suppressing the M2-like phenotype associated with tumor progression and thereby modulating the tumor microenvironment (Li2023Gliomaderived). The interaction between sLRIG3 and NETO2 is significant for its potential therapeutic implications in glioblastoma treatment (Li2023Gliomaderived).
