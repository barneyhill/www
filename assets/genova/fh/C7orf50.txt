# C7orf50

## Overview
C7orf50 is a gene located on chromosome 7 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 7 open reading frame 50. This protein, referred to as cholesin, is a hormone secreted by the intestine in response to cholesterol absorption, playing a significant role in cholesterol metabolism by influencing cholesterol synthesis in the liver and reducing circulating cholesterol levels (Grunin2024Genome). While the specific functions of the C7orf50 protein in healthy human cells remain largely uncharacterized, it is hypothesized to be involved in cellular signaling, structural roles, or enzymatic activities (Grunin2024Genome). Epigenetic studies have linked C7orf50 to various health-related traits, including type 2 diabetes and body mass index, suggesting its potential involvement in metabolic processes and disease pathogenesis (Ammous2020Epigenomewide; Seo2023Epigenetic). Further research is required to fully understand the molecular activities and cellular locations of the C7orf50 protein.

## Structure


## Function
The C7orf50 gene encodes a hormone called cholesin, which is secreted from the intestine in response to cholesterol absorption. This hormone plays a crucial role in cholesterol synthesis in the liver and helps reduce circulating cholesterol levels, potentially linking it to conditions like age-related macular degeneration (Grunin2024Genome). Despite its involvement in cholesterol metabolism, the specific functions of the C7orf50 protein in healthy human cells remain largely uncharacterized. It is suggested that proteins encoded by open reading frames, such as C7orf50, may participate in cellular signaling, structural roles, or enzymatic activities, although these roles have not been explicitly detailed for C7orf50 (Grunin2024Genome).

Research has also associated C7orf50 with various health-related traits through epigenetic studies. For instance, DNA methylation near C7orf50 has been linked to type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and target organ damage, indicating its potential involvement in metabolic processes and disease pathogenesis (Ammous2020Epigenomewide; Seo2023Epigenetic). However, the precise molecular activities and cellular locations of the C7orf50 protein in healthy cells are not well-defined, necessitating further research to elucidate its biological functions.
