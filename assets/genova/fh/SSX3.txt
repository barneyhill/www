# SSX3

## Overview
SSX3 is a gene that encodes the protein SSX family member 3, which is part of the synovial sarcoma X (SSX) gene family. This family is characterized by its involvement in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. The SSX3 protein is primarily expressed in the testis and is implicated in transcriptional regulation, potentially playing a role in spermatogenesis. It contains several functional domains, including the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain and the SSX repression domain (SSXRD), which contribute to its function as a transcriptional repressor. The SSX3 protein is localized in the nucleus and interacts with polycomb group proteins, which are essential for modulating gene expression through chromatin structure changes. Although the specific physiological role of SSX3 is not fully understood, its expression pattern and involvement in transcriptional repression suggest it may be significant in cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, SSX3 is associated with various malignancies, particularly synovial sarcoma, and is considered a cancer-testis antigen, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (de2002The; Zöllner2015Synovial; Bodey2002Cancertestis).

## Structure
The SSX3 protein is a member of the SSX gene family, characterized by its involvement in transcriptional repression. It is composed of 188 amino acids and shares high homology with other SSX family members, with protein-level similarity ranging from 88% to 95% (de2002The; dos2000Molecular). The protein contains several functional domains, including the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain, which is a strong transcriptional repressor encoded by exons 4 and 5 (Zöllner2015Synovial). The SSX3 protein also features the SSXRD (SSX repression domain), responsible for nuclear localization and interaction with polycomb group proteins, which modulate gene expression through chromatin structure changes (Zöllner2015Synovial; dos2000Molecular).

SSX3 is rich in charged amino acids and has an acidic C-terminal tail, which includes motifs for tyrosine phosphorylation and N-glycosylation, suggesting potential post-translational modifications (de2002The; Zöllner2015Synovial). The protein is localized in the nucleus, exhibiting a diffuse pattern and colocalizing with condensed chromosomes during mitosis (dos2000Molecular). SSX3 interacts specifically with SSX2IP, indicating a degree of specificity in its functional interactions despite high homology with other SSX proteins (de2002The).

## Function
The SSX3 gene is part of the SSX gene family, which is known for its role in transcriptional regulation. SSX3 proteins are primarily expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in spermatogenesis (de2002The). These proteins are localized in the nucleus and may function as transcriptional repressors, despite lacking a DNA-binding domain. This repressive activity is attributed to the conserved C-terminal domain known as the SSXRD domain, which is responsible for their nuclear localization and interaction with mitotic chromosomes and polycomb-group nuclear bodies (de2002The).

SSX3 proteins have a high content of charged amino acids and contain consensus sequences for N-glycosylation and tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating their involvement in post-translational modifications that could influence chromatin remodeling and gene expression (de2002The). Although the specific function of SSX3 in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its restricted expression pattern to the testis and its potential role in transcriptional repression suggest it may be involved in regulating gene expression during cell proliferation and differentiation (de2002The; Güre2002The).

## Clinical Significance
The SSX3 gene, a member of the SSX family, is implicated in various malignancies, particularly synovial sarcoma. Although SSX3 is not directly involved in the characteristic t(X;18) translocation of synovial sarcoma, it is part of the gene expression signature associated with this cancer type (terry2008synovial). The SSX proteins, including SSX3, are known for their role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling, which are significant in cancer development (Zöllner2015Synovial). 

SSX3, along with other SSX family members, is expressed in normal testis and thyroid tissues but shows aberrant expression in various cancers, such as melanoma and synovial sarcoma (de2002The). The SSX proteins interact with polycomb group proteins, which modulate gene expression through chromatin remodeling, a process crucial for their role in cancer (Zöllner2015Synovial). 

While specific mutations or expression alterations of SSX3 in cancer are not detailed, its involvement in the broader context of cancer-testis antigens suggests potential as a target for immunotherapy (Bodey2002Cancertestis). The clinical significance of SSX3 lies in its potential role in transcriptional dysregulation and its expression pattern in malignancies.

## Interactions
SSX3, a member of the SSX protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator. SSX3 contains three functional domains: the KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domain, the SSX repression domain (SSXRD), and the SSX divergent domain (SSXDD). The KRAB domain is known for its role in transcriptional repression and interacts with proteins such as RAB3IP and SSX2IP. Specifically, SSX2IP has been shown to interact with SSX3, suggesting a degree of specificity in its functional partnerships despite the high homology among SSX proteins (de2002The; Zöllner2015Synovial).

The SSXRD domain, encoded by exon 9, is responsible for nuclear localization and is a stronger repressor. SSX proteins, including SSX3, colocalize with polycomb group proteins (PcG) such as HPC2, BMI1, and RING1/2, which are essential for modulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Zöllner2015Synovial). The amino-terminal domain of SSX is necessary for recruiting BMI1, highlighting the importance of intact SSX proteins for these interactions (Zöllner2015Synovial). These interactions are significant in the context of cancer, particularly synovial sarcoma, where SSX proteins play a role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.
