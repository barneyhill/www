# CETN1

## Overview
CETN1 is a gene that encodes the protein centrin 1, a member of the centrin family of calcium-binding proteins. Centrins are characterized by their EF-hand motifs, which are essential for calcium ion binding and subsequent protein interactions. Centrin 1 is primarily localized to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells, where it plays a critical role in centrosome function and microtubule organization, processes vital for cell division. The protein is intrinsically disordered, allowing it to participate in complex protein interaction networks, particularly in cancer contexts. CETN1 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is classified as a Cancer/Testis Antigen (CTA) due to its expression in normal testis and certain tumor tissues. Its expression is regulated by promoter methylation, and it has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and potentially in cancer cell stemness (Kim2013CETN1; Manoharan2023KRas).

## Structure
CETN1, or centrin 1, is a calcium-binding protein characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that facilitate calcium ion binding. These motifs are crucial for the protein's function, as they undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, transitioning from a closed to an open state. This change exposes a hydrophobic surface that allows CETN1 to interact with various protein partners (Pedretti2021Structural).

The protein is approximately 170 amino acids in length and has a dumbbell shape, consisting of two lobes: the C-terminal and N-terminal domains, separated by a linker region. Each lobe contains two EF-hand motifs, which coordinate calcium ions through a specific configuration involving carboxylate oxygens and a bridged water molecule (Pedretti2021Structural).

CETN1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, suggesting a flexible structure that enables it to interact with multiple protein partners, potentially serving as a hub in protein interaction networks, particularly in cancer contexts (Kim2013CETN1). The protein's structure includes a non-structured, positively charged N-terminal region, which may be involved in calcium-induced polymerization and self-assembly (Pedretti2021Structural). Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of CETN1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CETN1, or Centrin 1, is a member of the centrin family of calcium-binding proteins that localizes to the centrosome in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in centrosome function and microtubule organization, which are crucial for cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis (Kim2013CETN1). Although the specific function of CETN1 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is known to be involved in cytokinesis and cell cycle progression. CETN1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, suggesting it may participate in complex protein interaction networks within the cell (Kim2013CETN1).

CETN1 is primarily expressed in the testis and is considered a Cancer/Testis Antigen (CTA) due to its expression pattern in normal testis and certain tumor tissues (Kim2013CETN1). In the context of photoreceptor cells, CETN1 has been observed to accumulate in the connecting cilium, potentially stabilizing the structure in the absence of other centrin proteins like CETN2 and CETN3, although its specific role in healthy human cells remains less defined (Ying2019Deletion). The expression of CETN1 in cancer cells is thought to be regulated by promoter methylation (Kim2013CETN1).

## Clinical Significance
CETN1, a cancer testis antigen, is notably overexpressed in prostate and pancreatic cancers, with a 10-fold increase in prostate cancer and a 25-fold increase in pancreatic cancer compared to normal tissues (Kim2013CETN1). This overexpression is regulated by promoter methylation, as treatment with the DNA demethylation agent 5'AZA-2'Deoxycytidine (AZA) can increase CETN1 expression in cancer cell lines (Kim2013CETN1). The gene's expression is also linked to ovarian cancer, where it is frequently expressed in serous ovarian cancer samples, suggesting a potential role in the lineage of origin for these cancers (Rohozinski2017Do).

In the context of obesity, reduced expression of CETN1 in sperm is associated with increased sperm deformity and lower sperm quality, indicating a link between CETN1 expression and male fertility issues (Peng2019Proteomic). Additionally, a deletion in the CETN1 gene was identified in a patient with Kabuki syndrome, although it was inherited from an unaffected parent, suggesting it may not be pathogenic in this context (Kuniba2009Molecular). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of CETN1 expression and mutations across different conditions.

## Interactions
Centrin 1 (CETN1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. CETN1 interacts with the mitotic spindle regulator Sfi1, showing a nanomolar affinity for a specific target peptide derived from Sfi1, which indicates its role in centrosome duplication and microtubule organization (Manoharan2023KRas). CETN1 also interacts with K-Ras, a protein involved in cell signaling, particularly in its oncogenic form K-RasG12V, which shows a higher interaction with CETN1 compared to the wild-type K-Ras. This interaction is modulated by calmodulin (CaM) inhibitors, suggesting that CETN1 may play a role in K-Ras-driven cancer cell stemness (Manoharan2023KRas).

CETN1 is part of multiprotein complexes involved in genome maintenance and cellular organization. It interacts with proteins such as the xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein and yeast spindle pole body proteins Kar1p and Sfi1p, which are essential for processes like DNA repair and centriole duplication (Dantas2012Such). These interactions highlight CETN1's role in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential implications in cancer biology.
