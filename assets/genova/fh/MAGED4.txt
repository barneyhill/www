# MAGED4

## Overview
MAGED4 is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member D4, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family of proteins is known for its involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. MAGE family member D4 is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which is typically expressed in a range of tumors and in normal testis tissue, but not in other normal tissues. The expression of MAGED4 and its encoded protein has been linked to the progression and prognosis of several cancers, including breast cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for disease outcome (Li2020A; Jia2019Prognostic; Arora2020Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
MAGED4 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, high mRNA expression levels of MAGED4 are associated with a worse prognosis, particularly in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS). This association is significant in both lymph node-positive and lymph node-negative breast cancer cases, indicating that increased expression of MAGED4 correlates with poorer outcomes regardless of lymph node status (Jia2019Prognostic).

In glioma, MAGED4 expression patterns differ, with reduced expression observed in advanced grades of the malignancy. This downregulation is linked to immune infiltration in glioma tissues and is associated with poor overall survival, suggesting a complex role in glioma progression (Arora2020Downregulation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAGED4 overexpression has been suggested as a predictive marker for early recurrence and mortality, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Li2020A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAGED4 expression alterations in various cancers, although the specific mechanisms and interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
