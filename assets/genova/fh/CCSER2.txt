# CCSER2

## Overview
CCSER2, or coiled-coil serine rich protein 2, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to microtubule dynamics and cell migration. The protein encoded by CCSER2 is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and SxIP motifs, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins, such as Ndel1 and EB1, classifying it as a plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) (Shirai2023Characterization; Zang2024CCSer2). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in regulating dynein activity at the cell periphery, impacting processes like centrosome positioning and retrograde trafficking of early endosomes (Zang2024CCSer2). The gene's expression and function are significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and alterations in CCSER2 have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zang2024CCSer2).

## Structure
The CCSER2 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as Ndel1. This interaction involves a specific region forming a four-helix bundle, comprising amino acids 657-687 in CCSER2 (Zang2024CCSer2). The coiled-coil domain is also important for the protein's localization to the microtubule plus-end, where it functions as a plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) (Zang2024CCSer2).

CCSER2 contains multiple SxIP motifs, which are essential for its association with microtubules. These motifs bind to the hub protein EB1, a common feature among +TIPs, and their mutation significantly reduces CCSER2's plus-end localization (Shirai2023Characterization; Zang2024CCSer2). The protein's intracellular localization is observed at the cell periphery, suggesting a role in cell projections and microtubule reorganization (Shirai2023Characterization).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function and interactions. Although alternative splice variants of CCSER2 are listed in public gene databases, their presence was not confirmed in the experiments (Shirai2023Characterization). The protein's dynamic, comet-like structures at the microtubule plus-end are indicative of its role in microtubule dynamics (Zang2024CCSer2).

## Function
The CCSER2 protein plays a crucial role in regulating dynein activity at the cell periphery, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell migration, centrosome positioning, and retrograde trafficking of early endosomes. CCSER2 achieves this by modulating the interaction between dynein and Ndel1, a protein that inhibits dynein activation. By binding directly to Ndel1, CCSER2 reduces its inhibitory effect, promoting the formation of active dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes on cargos near the cell periphery (Zang2024CCSer2).

CCSER2 is also identified as a microtubule-associated protein that tracks the plus-ends of microtubules, similar to other plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs). It localizes to the microtubule plus-end and cell periphery, colocalizing with microtubules and the master plus-end regulator, EB1. This localization is dependent on EB1-binding motifs within CCSER2, which are crucial for its association with microtubules (Shirai2023Characterization; Zang2024CCSer2).

In healthy cells, CCSER2 is important for maintaining proper cell shape and directional persistence during migration. Its depletion can lead to impaired dynein function, reduced directional persistence, and defects in centrosome positioning and early endosome trafficking (Zang2024CCSer2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CCSER2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers and neurological disorders. Changes in the normal interactions of the CCSER2 protein can disrupt cellular functions, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions. In cancer, aberrant expression or mutations in CCSER2 may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor development. The disruption of cellular processes due to altered CCSER2 function can facilitate the progression of malignancies by affecting cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In neurological disorders, alterations in CCSER2 expression or function may impact neuronal cell signaling and maintenance, potentially leading to neurodegenerative conditions or developmental abnormalities. The precise mechanisms by which CCSER2 mutations contribute to these diseases are still under investigation, but the gene's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis is considered critical. Understanding the clinical significance of CCSER2 mutations and expression changes is essential for developing targeted therapies and improving diagnostic strategies for associated diseases.

## Interactions
CCSER2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It directly binds to Ndel1, a protein involved in dynein regulation. This interaction was confirmed through proximity-dependent biotinylation coupled with mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The binding involves a four-helix bundle formed by specific amino acids in both proteins. A construct of CCSER2 lacking the coiled coil containing the Ndel1 binding site failed to co-immunoprecipitate Ndel1, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Zang2024CCSer2).

CCSER2 also interacts with EB1, a microtubule-associated protein, through its SxIP motifs, which are crucial for its localization to microtubule plus-ends. This interaction classifies CCSER2 as a plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) and is essential for its role in microtubule dynamics and cell migration (Shirai2023Characterization).

CCSER2 modulates dynein activity by reducing Ndel1's affinity for dynein, facilitating dynein activation and recruitment to the cell periphery. This interaction does not affect the Lis1-Ndel1 interaction but promotes the formation of active dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes, crucial for cellular trafficking processes (Zang2024CCSer2).
