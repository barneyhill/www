# A1BG

## Overview
A1BG is a gene that encodes the alpha-1-B glycoprotein, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is predominantly found in human plasma. This glycoprotein is characterized by its five immunoglobulin-like domains, which contribute to its structural stability and functional capabilities (Guselnikov2019Unraveling). The protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and is known to form a stable non-covalent complex with cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP-3), suggesting a role in modulating immune responses or other plasma-related functions (Udby2004CysteineRich; Udby2010Human). Although the precise physiological role of A1BG remains largely undefined, it has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiac dysfunction and cancer, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research (Cordeiro2021Proteomic; Emerson2024SexSpecific).

## Structure
The human gene A1BG encodes the alpha-1-B glycoprotein, a soluble component of mammalian blood plasma. This protein is composed of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, which are characteristic of the immunoglobulin superfamily and contribute to its stability and function (Guselnikov2019Unraveling). The A1BG protein is known to form stable non-covalent complexes with CRISP-3, a small polypeptide involved in innate immunity, in human plasma (Udby2010Human). 

The evolutionary analysis suggests that A1BG evolved from an ancestral two-domain protein by losing the transmembrane region and quadruplicating its C-terminal domain, indicating a complex evolutionary history that has shaped its current structure (Guselnikov2019Unraveling). Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of A1BG are not provided, its classification within the immunoglobulin superfamily implies a typical Ig-like domain structure, which often includes beta-sheets forming a sandwich-like configuration. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in proteins of this family, although specific modifications for A1BG are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's ability to bind CRISP-3 across different species suggests a conserved functional role, potentially linked to its structural features (Udby2010Human).

## Function
The function of the A1BG (alpha-1-B glycoprotein) in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is known to be a plasma glycoprotein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. A1BG is primarily produced in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it is present at levels of approximately 0.22 mg/mL (Clerc2015Human). It forms a noncovalent complex with cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP-3) in human plasma, with a 1:1 stoichiometry, suggesting a potential role in modulating immune responses or other plasma-related functions (Udby2004CysteineRich). The complex is held together by strong electrostatic forces, and its formation is not dependent on glycosylation or divalent metal ions (Udby2004CysteineRich).

The interaction between A1BG and CRISP-3 may protect the circulation from potentially harmful effects of free CRISP-3, similar to how A1BG-like proteins in opossums inactivate toxic components in snake venom (Udby2004CysteineRich). Despite these insights, the overall function of A1BG in healthy human cells remains largely unknown, and it has been associated with various diseases, including cancers and autoimmune conditions (Clerc2015Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the A1BG gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cardiac and cancer pathologies. In cardiac function, A1BG is crucial for maintaining proper heart health in females. Loss of A1BG expression in female mice leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, which is not observed in males. This sex-specific requirement suggests that A1BG plays a significant role in energy metabolism and the structural integrity of cardiac tissues in females (Emerson2024SexSpecific).

In cancer, A1BG expression has been linked to tumor heterogeneity and malignancy. In a canine model of breast cancer, A1BG was found to have higher expression in malignant phenotypes, particularly in poorly differentiated tumor regions. This suggests a role in tumor progression and potential as a prognostic marker. In human breast cancer, low A1BG expression is associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival, indicating its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Cordeiro2021Proteomic).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of A1BG in both cardiac and cancer-related conditions, emphasizing the importance of its expression and interactions in disease progression.

## Interactions
A1BG (alpha-1-B glycoprotein) is known to interact with cysteine-rich secretory protein 3 (CRISP-3) in human plasma. This interaction forms a noncovalent complex characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry, primarily held together by strong electrostatic forces or steric complementarity. The complex formation is not dependent on glycosylation of A1BG, as both glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of A1BG can bind CRISP-3. The interaction is also independent of calcium or other divalent metal ions, as evidenced by the presence of EDTA not affecting the complex formation. The binding affinity between CRISP-3 and A1BG is high, with a low dissociation constant in the nanomolar range, indicating a strong interaction (Udby2004CysteineRich).

The interaction between A1BG and CRISP-3 was confirmed through various experimental techniques, including size-exclusion chromatography, native PAGE, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. These methods demonstrated that CRISP-3 forms a complex with A1BG, and the presence of A1BG prevents the excretion of CRISP-3 in urine, suggesting a protective role in circulation (Udby2004CysteineRich). The specificity of this interaction is highlighted by the fact that CRISP-3 does not form complexes with other proteins like albumin, despite similar charges (Udby2004CysteineRich).
