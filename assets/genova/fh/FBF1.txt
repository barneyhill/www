# FBF1

## Overview
FBF1 (Fas binding factor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of cilia gating and spindle assembly. The FBF1 protein is a key component of the ciliary gate, a structure essential for the trafficking of proteins between the cytoplasm and the ciliary compartment, and is categorized as a ciliary protein. It localizes to transition fibers at the ciliary base, forming a conserved protein module with TALPID3 and ANKRD26, which is vital for proper cilia formation and function (Yan2020TALPID3). Additionally, FBF1 plays a significant role in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during meiosis, interacting with proteins such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and BubR1 to ensure proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Xu2021Fbf1). Mutations in the FBF1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including ciliopathies and conditions affecting neurological function, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological integrity (Wei2013Transition; Huang2019The).

## Function
FBF1 (Fas binding factor 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cilia gating and spindle assembly in healthy human cells. It is a key component of the ciliary gate, which is essential for controlling the trafficking of proteins between the cytoplasm and the ciliary compartment. FBF1 localizes to transition fibers at the ciliary base, forming a conserved protein module with TALPID3 and ANKRD26, which is vital for proper cilia formation and function (Yan2020TALPID3). This module facilitates the selective import of sensory receptors and signaling molecules into cilia, ensuring the structural and functional integrity of these organelles (Yan2020TALPID3).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, FBF1 is involved in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during meiosis. It colocalizes with spindle microtubules and poles, influencing microtubule dynamics and the organization of the microtubule organizing center (Xu2021Fbf1). FBF1's interaction with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 is crucial for proper chromosome alignment and segregation, impacting oocyte maturation and successful sexual reproduction (Xu2021Fbf1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Disruptions in the TALPID3-ANKRD26-FBF1 protein module, which is crucial for cilia gating, can lead to defective cilia function. This has been associated with diseases such as thrombocytopenia and myeloid malignancies, as the module is essential for the selective import of proteins into cilia (Yan2020TALPID3). The FBF1 gene is also involved in the ciliary entry of intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes, and its dysfunction can contribute to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction (Wei2013Transition).

In a study investigating genetic associations with leukoaraiosis (LA), a condition characterized by white matter changes in the brain, the FBF1 variant rs2305913 was initially found to have a significant association with LA. However, this association was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons, suggesting that while FBF1 variants may play a role, their clinical significance in LA requires further investigation (Huang2019The). These findings highlight the potential role of FBF1 in various pathological conditions, particularly those related to ciliary function and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
FBF1, a key component of the ciliary gate, interacts with several proteins to facilitate the ciliary entry of intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes. It directly interacts with the IFT-B component IFT54, the mouse orthologue of DYF-11, through its carboxy terminus, providing a docking site on transition fibers (TFs) for assembled IFT particles (Wei2013Transition). This interaction is crucial for the transit of IFT particles through the ciliary base, highlighting FBF1's role in ciliogenesis (Wei2013Transition).

FBF1 also forms a module with TALPID3 and ANKRD26, which is essential for cilia gating. This module is localized on TFs and is involved in the selective import of cilia cargoes, indicating that TFs may act as a functional gate for ciliary import/export (Yan2020TALPID3). The interaction between TALPID3, ANKRD26, and FBF1 is conserved from C. elegans to humans, underscoring its fundamental role in cilia function (Yan2020TALPID3).

In mammalian cells, FBF1 is recruited to the distal appendages of centrioles, where it partially overlaps with TALPID3 and ANKRD26, forming a spatially coordinated complex (Yan2020TALPID3). This recruitment is crucial for the proper formation of the ciliary gate and is regulated by the distal centriole wall and DA blades (Yan2020TALPID3).
