# KLK6

## Overview
KLK6, or kallikrein-related peptidase 6, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. The protein, characterized by its trypsin-like catalytic activity, plays a significant role in tissue homeostasis, particularly within the central nervous system and skin. KLK6 is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components, contributing to tissue remodeling and neural plasticity. It is predominantly expressed in brain cells and is implicated in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein, suggesting a role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Additionally, KLK6 is associated with various cancers, where its overexpression can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. The enzyme's activity is modulated by natural inhibitors, and its interactions with other proteins, such as α1-antitrypsin and amyloid precursor protein, underscore its importance in both health and disease (Bayani2012The; Debela2008Structures; Korbakis2017Study).

## Structure
KLK6, a serine protease, is characterized by a trypsin-like catalytic domain and is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage (Debela2008Structures). The primary structure of KLK6 consists of 223 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 25,866 Da, and includes a pro-peptide sequence adding five additional amino acids (Blaber2007The). KLK6 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation at Asn132, contributing to its mass heterogeneity (Blaber2007The).

The tertiary structure of KLK6 features a catalytic triad composed of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, which is typical of serine proteases (Debela2008Structures). The S1 subsite of KLK6 is similar to those of KLK4, KLK5, and bovine trypsin, with a wedge-shaped pocket formed by the imidazole groups of His99 and His57, and a significant negative electrostatic potential generated by Asp102 (Debela2008Structures). The S2 subsite is selective for Arg and Lys at the P2 position, allowing adaptation to larger substrates (Debela2008Structures).

KLK6 is known to exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and regulation (Debela2008Structures). The protein is implicated in various physiological processes and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Debela2008Structures).

## Function
KLK6, also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 6, is a serine protease involved in several physiological processes, primarily within the central nervous system and skin. In healthy human cells, KLK6 plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating the extracellular matrix by degrading components such as fibrinogen and collagen types I and IV, which suggests its involvement in tissue remodeling (Magklara2003Characterization). It is predominantly expressed in brain cells, including oligodendrocytes, pyramidal cells, astrocytes, and glial cells, where it contributes to neural plasticity and the turnover of neural proteins (Bayani2012The; Kalinska2016Kallikreins).

KLK6 is also implicated in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein, indicating a role in neurodegenerative processes (Magklara2003Characterization). Its enzymatic activity is characterized by a preference for cleaving after arginine residues, and it can autoactivate, which is a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Debela2008Structures). In the skin, KLK6 is involved in desquamation and is associated with keratinocyte proliferation and wound healing, highlighting its role in skin physiology (Bayani2012The). The enzyme's activity is modulated by natural inhibitors, such as serpins, which help maintain its function within physiological limits (Magklara2003Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
KLK6 (kallikrein-related peptidase 6) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, KLK6 is overexpressed in several types, including ovarian, colorectal, and breast cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by degrading extracellular matrix components, promoting invasion, and affecting cell adhesion through E-cadherin down-regulation (Bayani2012The; Vakrakou2014Kallikreinrelated). In colorectal cancer, high KLK6 expression is associated with advanced tumor stages, poor prognosis, and increased risk of metastasis (Christodoulou2014Kallikreinrelated; Ogawa2005Clinical). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, KLK6 is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In Alzheimer's, decreased KLK6 expression correlates with amyloid β accumulation, while in Parkinson's, it affects α-synuclein degradation (Bayani2012The). 

KLK6 also plays a role in inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, where its elevated levels contribute to inflammation and myelin degradation (Bayani2012The). In skin disorders like psoriasis, KLK6 expression is increased, correlating with disease severity (Bayani2012The). These findings highlight KLK6's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
KLK6, or kallikrein-related peptidase 6, is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its physiological and pathological roles. KLK6 forms a complex with α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) in biological fluids, which is significant in the context of ovarian cancer, as this complex can improve diagnostic sensitivity (Korbakis2017Study). The interaction with A1AT suggests that KLK6 is primarily bound to this inhibitor rather than other molecules (Korbakis2017Study).

KLK6 is also involved in a protein-protein interaction network, known as the KLK6 interactome, which includes interactions with proteins such as vimentin, calreticulin, and keratin 8. These interactions were identified through proteomic analysis and suggest that KLK6 may regulate cell migration and motility by modulating the expression of keratin 8 and vimentin (Pampalakis2008Identification).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, KLK6 interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and α-synuclein, suggesting its involvement in protein turnover and degradation processes in the brain. These interactions are particularly relevant in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where KLK6 is implicated in the cleavage of APP and the degradation of α-synuclein (Bayani2012The).
