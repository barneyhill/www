# GIMAP2

## Overview
GIMAP2 is a gene that encodes the protein GTPase, IMAP family member 2, which is part of the GTPases of immunity-associated proteins (GIMAP) family. This protein is characterized by its GTP-binding capability, although it lacks intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity, and is primarily expressed in immune-related tissues such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. GIMAP2 is involved in immune cell functions, particularly in T cell survival, and is implicated in various diseases, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression levels are altered. The protein's structure includes a unique C-terminal double hydrophobic domain that facilitates its localization to lipid droplets, and it can interact with other GIMAP family members, influencing immune cell survival and apoptosis (Komatsu2021Aberrant; mukadam2019investigation; Limoges2021The).

## Structure
GIMAP2 is a protein consisting of 337 amino acids with a molecular weight of 38 kDa. It is predominantly expressed in the spleen, lymph nodes, peripheral blood leukocytes, and the thymus (mukadam2019investigation). The protein contains a unique C-terminal double hydrophobic domain that localizes it to lipid droplets, as observed in JURKAT cells (Limoges2021The). This localization is facilitated by two hydrophobic domains at its COOH-terminus, which are essential for its association with lipid droplets in cells (mukadam2019investigation).

GIMAP2's structure is characterized by its GTP-binding capability, which is crucial for its dimerization. GTP binding induces the release of the amphipathic helix a7 from the G domain, potentially allowing interactions with other proteins, such as other GIMAPs or Bcl-2 family members (mukadam2019investigation). The nucleotide-binding domains of GIMAP2 are related to those found in dynamin, chloroplast proteins Toc, and septin-GTPases (Limoges2021The). Despite its strong GTP binding, GIMAP2 lacks intrinsic GTP hydrolytic activity (mukadam2019investigation). The protein's oligomerization is also linked to GTP association, suggesting a role in forming scaffolds in its GTP-associated form (Limoges2021The). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available sources.

## Clinical Significance
GIMAP2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and potential mutations. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), GIMAP2 is significantly upregulated, promoting cancer progression by enhancing cell cycle progression and inhibiting apoptosis. Knockdown studies in OSCC cells have shown that reducing GIMAP2 expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth and survival (Komatsu2021Aberrant).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GIMAP2 is also overexpressed and is associated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. This overexpression correlates with better overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is linked to immune cell interactions, particularly with macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, which are crucial for the prognosis of ccRCC patients (Zhang2023Prognostic).

GIMAP2 has also been associated with Behçet's disease (BD), an inflammatory disorder. Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GIMAP2 region that are significantly associated with BD, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis through its involvement in T-cell survival (Lee2012Genomewide).

## Interactions
GIMAP2, a member of the GTPases of immunity-associated proteins (GIMAP) family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune cell functions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), GIMAP2 is associated with T cell survival and is significantly upregulated in OSCC-derived cell lines and primary OSCC specimens. The knockdown of GIMAP2 in these cells leads to decreased cell growth and affects the expression of several cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins, such as CDK4, CDK6, phosphorylated Rb, p53, p21, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak, indicating its role in promoting cell cycle progression and inhibiting apoptosis (Komatsu2021Aberrant).

GIMAP2 also interacts with other GIMAP family members. It has been noted that GIMAP7 can stimulate the GTPase activity of GIMAP2 in vitro through heterodimerization, suggesting a potential interaction between these two proteins (Webb2014Generation). However, specific physical interactions of GIMAP2 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond these family interactions are not detailed in the available literature. The interactions within the GIMAP family, including those involving GIMAP2, are crucial for regulating immune cell survival and apoptosis.
