# FHOD3

## Overview
FHOD3 is a gene that encodes the protein formin homology 2 domain containing 3, a member of the formin family of proteins. Formins are known for their role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as shape maintenance, motility, and division. The FHOD3 protein is particularly significant in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, where it contributes to muscle contraction and structural integrity by organizing myofibrillogenesis during cardiogenesis and maintaining the contractile filaments of cardiomyocytes (Yu2020FHOD3). Unlike other diaphanous-related formins, FHOD3 lacks a GTPase binding domain but includes a spectrin repeat binding module, which facilitates interactions with nuclear envelope proteins (Antoku2023FHODs:). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation and is involved in key signaling pathways such as MAPK/RhoA/ROCK, which are essential for actin assembly and cell motility (Yu2020FHOD3). Mutations in FHOD3 have been linked to cardiac diseases, including hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its critical role in cardiac health (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Arimura2013Dilated).

## Structure
The FHOD3 protein is a member of the formin family, characterized by the presence of formin homology domains FH1, FH2, and FH3, as well as the diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) (Antoku2023FHODs:). The FH1 domain is shorter than in other formins and contains three polyproline clusters that bind to profilin:G-actin complexes, facilitating actin polymerization by the FH2 domain (Antoku2023FHODs:). The FH2 domain is crucial for actin filament nucleation and polymerization, interacting with the barbed end of actin filaments (Fujimoto2016Transgenic). FHOD3 lacks the GTPase binding domain (GBD) found in other diaphanous-related formins, but it includes a spectrin repeat binding module (SRBM) that binds to specific spectrin repeats in outer nuclear membrane proteins (Antoku2023FHODs:).

FHOD3 is subject to alternative splicing, with a cardiac-specific isoform containing a 175-residue insert that binds to cardiac myosin binding protein C, essential for its localization in cardiac sarcomeres (Antoku2023FHODs:). The protein's actin polymerization activity is relatively weak, potentially requiring mechanical force for enhancement (Antoku2023FHODs:). Phosphorylation by kinases such as ROCK and ERK1/2 regulates its activity, influencing both actin polymerization and bundling (Antoku2023FHODs:).

## Function
FHOD3, also known as Formactin2, is a member of the formin homology proteins, which are crucial regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein plays a significant role in the organization and assembly of actin filaments, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. In healthy human cells, FHOD3 is primarily active in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, where it contributes to muscle contraction and structural integrity by organizing myofibrillogenesis during cardiogenesis and maintaining the contractile filaments of cardiomyocytes (Yu2020FHOD3).

FHOD3 is involved in regulating actin assembly and sarcomere organization in striated muscle, which is vital for proper heart function. Its activity is linked to the MAPK/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, which is important for actin spike assembly and cell motility (Yu2020FHOD3). Aberrant expression of FHOD3 can lead to cardiac diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cardiac health (Yu2020FHOD3). The protein's function as an actin nucleator allows it to promote the polymerization of actin filaments, thereby supporting the structural and functional integrity of muscle tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FHOD3 gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, primarily hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). FHOD3 is crucial for actin assembly in cardiomyocytes, and its dysfunction can lead to significant cardiac pathologies. In HCM, mutations in FHOD3, including specific intronic variants and deletions involving exons 15 and 16, have been identified as disease-causing. These mutations are linked to the thickening of heart walls, reducing the heart's ability to pump blood effectively (LabatdeHoz2021Formins; Ochoa2020Deletions). A novel splice-site variant, c.1646+2T>C, has been found to be a common cause of HCM in the Balkan population, suggesting a founder effect (Vodnjov2023A).

In DCM, mutations in the FH2 domain of FHOD3 impair actin dynamics, leading to ventricular dilation and decreased contractility. The Y1249N variant, in particular, has been associated with familial DCM, affecting the activation of the serum response factor, a transcription factor crucial for cardiac function (Arimura2013Dilated). FHOD3's role in maintaining cardiac structure and function underscores its clinical significance in these cardiomyopathies.

## Interactions
FHOD3, a member of the formin family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiac muscle cells. One significant interaction is with the protein p62/SQSTM1, which occurs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The interaction is mediated by the PB1 domain of p62 and is influenced by the presence of the T(D/E)5XE exon in FHOD3. CK2 phosphorylation of FHOD3 reduces its interaction with p62, affecting its localization to autophagosomes and myofibrils (Iskratsch2010Formin).

FHOD3 also interacts with nesprin-1G and nesprin-2G, proteins associated with the nuclear envelope. This interaction is facilitated by a spectrin repeat binding module in FHOD3, which binds to specific spectrin repeats in nesprins. This connection is part of the LINC complex, which plays a role in mechanotransduction and nuclear positioning (Antoku2023FHODs:).

Additionally, FHOD3 interacts with cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBCP), which localizes FHOD3 to the M band in cardiac sarcomeres. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of FHOD3, although it is not required for sarcomere formation itself (Antoku2023FHODs:).
