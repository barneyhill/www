# MYBL2

## Overview
The MYBL2 gene encodes the MYB proto-oncogene like 2 protein, a transcription factor that is part of the MYB family, which also includes MYB (c-Myb) and MYBL1 (A-Myb). This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly during the G1/S transition and S phase progression, by controlling the expression of genes essential for cell division and genomic stability (Musa2017MYBL2; Papetti2010MYBL2). MYBL2 is characterized by a multi-domain structure, including a DNA-binding domain with a helix-turn-helix motif, which facilitates its function as a transcription factor (Bayley2020MYBL2). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with various protein complexes, such as the DREAM complex, which are crucial for its role in transcription regulation and DNA repair (Bayley2020MYBL2). MYBL2 is expressed in proliferating cells and is essential for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, while its dysregulation is associated with oncogenic potential and poor prognosis in several cancers (Musa2017MYBL2; Bayley2020MYBL2).

## Structure
The MYBL2 gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the MYB family, which includes MYB (c-Myb) and MYBL1 (A-Myb). The MYBL2 protein is characterized by a multi-domain structure that facilitates its diverse functions in cellular processes. It contains a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with a helix-turn-helix motif, which is crucial for its role as a transcription factor regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell survival (Lim2021Functional; Bayley2020MYBL2). The carboxy-terminal domain of MYBL2 is essential for interactions with various protein complexes, such as the DREAM complex, STRAP, and MRN, which are involved in gene transcription regulation and DNA repair (Bayley2020MYBL2).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, play a significant role in modulating MYBL2's function, stability, and cellular localization (Bayley2020MYBL2). Phosphorylation by Cyclin A/E-CDK2 enhances MYBL2's transactivation activity and facilitates its degradation, ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Musa2017MYBL2). The protein's interaction with STRAP involves the DBD, influencing TGF-β signaling pathways and p53-mediated apoptosis (Musa2017MYBL2). While the context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, these domains and modifications highlight the functional complexity of MYBL2.

## Function
The MYBL2 gene, also known as B-Myb, encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G1/S transition and the progression through the S phase. MYBL2 is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, such as those encoding cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Musa2017MYBL2; Papetti2010MYBL2).

MYBL2 is expressed in nearly all proliferating cells and is crucial for the maintenance of an undifferentiated, pluripotent state in embryonic stem cells. It regulates key pluripotency factors like POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG, supporting self-renewal and pluripotency (Musa2017MYBL2). In colon epithelial cells, MYBL2 modulates the expression of genes that control cell cycle progression, linking proliferation with differentiation processes (Papetti2010MYBL2).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other proteins to regulate late cell cycle genes. Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation and interactions with co-activators and co-repressors, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Musa2017MYBL2; Tarasov2008BMYB). The deregulation of MYBL2 can lead to oncogenic potential, contributing to cancer progression by promoting proliferation and therapy resistance (Musa2017MYBL2).

## Clinical Significance
The MYBL2 gene, also known as B-MYB, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Overexpression of MYBL2 is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, bladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Musa2017MYBL2). In breast cancer, MYBL2 overexpression is associated with enhanced invasiveness and poor therapeutic response, particularly in basal-like, HER2+/ER-, and luminal B subtypes (Bayley2020MYBL2). MYBL2 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where high expression correlates with genomic instability and poor survival outcomes (Morris2021MYBL2Driven).

In myeloid malignancies, MYBL2 acts as a dosage-dependent tumor suppressor. Reduced expression of MYBL2 is common in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), contributing to clonal dominance and disease progression (Heinrichs2013MYBL2). MYBL2 haploinsufficiency increases susceptibility to hematologic disorders, and its downregulation is often due to mechanisms such as miRNA repression (Heinrichs2013MYBL2). In acute myeloid leukemia, MYBL2 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and lower expression of certain microRNAs (Fuster2013Adverse).

## Interactions
MYBL2, also known as B-MYB, is a transcription factor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cell cycle regulation. It is a key component of the MuvB complex, which interacts with FOXM1 to regulate the expression of late cell cycle genes during the G2/M phase. This interaction is essential for FOXM1 to bind to target promoters, indicating a dependency on MYBL2 for FOXM1's function (Ahmed2019Integrated; Musa2017MYBL2).

MYBL2 also forms a complex with E2F2 in colorectal cancer cells, mediated by their N-terminal regions. This interaction is significant in accelerating colorectal cancer progression (Fan2021BMyb). In addition, MYBL2 interacts with the MuvB complex components LIN9 and RBBP4, and a new partner TAF15, to activate RRM2 transcription, which is crucial for DNA synthesis and cancer proliferation (Liu2021A).

MYBL2 binds to zinc finger proteins ZMYM2 and ZMYM4, with ZMYM4's interaction being enhanced upon DNA damage. These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional repression and cell cycle transitions (Cibis2020Characterization). Additionally, MYBL2 interacts with Clathrin and Filamin, contributing to genomic stability (Musa2017MYBL2).
