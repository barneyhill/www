# RAD52

## Overview
RAD52 is a gene that encodes the RAD52 homolog, a DNA repair protein that plays a pivotal role in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, a critical mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells. The RAD52 protein is categorized as a DNA-binding protein and is essential for facilitating the annealing of complementary DNA strands, thereby enhancing the efficiency of DNA repair processes. Although not indispensable for HR in mammals, RAD52 is involved in alternative repair pathways such as single-strand annealing (SSA) and break-induced replication (BIR), particularly in HR-deficient cells (Gottifredi2020Current; Muhammad2022Human). The protein's structure includes a conserved N-terminal domain responsible for oligomerization and DNA binding, forming an undecameric ring structure crucial for its function (Balboni2023Novela; Balboni2024An). RAD52's interactions with other proteins, such as RAD51 and replication protein A (RPA), are vital for its role in DNA repair, and its activity is modulated by interactions with proteins like DSS1 (Stefanovie2019DSS1). Alterations in the RAD52 gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ho2020Aberrant; Lieberman2015Functional).

## Structure
The RAD52 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly through homologous recombination. It is composed of 418 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa (Balboni2023Novela). The primary structure of RAD52 includes a conserved N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-208) responsible for oligomerization and DNA binding, sharing over 70% sequence homology with yeast Rad52 (Balboni2023Novela). The N-terminal domain forms an undecameric ring structure, which is crucial for its function in DNA repair (Balboni2023Novel; Balboni2024An).

The secondary structure of RAD52 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the N-terminal domain forming a β-β-β-α fold (Balboni2023Novel). The tertiary structure of RAD52 is characterized by a mushroom-like closed ring with a stem and domed cap, facilitating DNA binding (Balboni2023Novel). The quaternary structure of RAD52 involves the formation of undecameric rings, contrary to the previously assumed heptameric arrangement (Balboni2024An).

The C-terminal domain of RAD52 is intrinsically disordered and contains binding sites for RAD51 and Replication Protein A (RPA), playing a role in protein-protein interactions (Balboni2023Novel). This domain is highly flexible and dynamic, contributing to the formation of high-molecular-weight superstructures (Balboni2024An).

## Function
RAD52 is a DNA repair protein that plays a significant role in homologous recombination (HR), a critical mechanism for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. Although RAD52 is not essential for HR in mammals, it enhances the efficiency of DNA repair processes by facilitating the annealing of complementary DNA strands and forming mixed filaments with RAD51, which are more efficient in homology search and synaptic complex formation (Muhammad2022Human). RAD52 also plays a role in alternative repair pathways such as single-strand annealing (SSA) and break-induced replication (BIR), particularly in HR-deficient cells (Gottifredi2020Current; Muhammad2022Human).

In the presence of replication stress, RAD52 helps stabilize replication forks and prevent excessive fork regression, which can lead to fork breakage (Gottifredi2020Current). It also interacts with RNA-DNA hybrids, suggesting a role in RNA-templated repair processes (Jalan2019Emerging). RAD52 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and compacts it, protecting it from nucleases and facilitating the recruitment of other repair proteins (Muhammad2022Human). These functions are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the RAD52 gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have been linked to various cancers. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), RAD52 is often overexpressed, which correlates with increased cell proliferation and tumorigenic phenotypes. This overexpression is associated with increased lung cancer risk, particularly in smokers, and is linked to specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the gene (Lieberman2015Functional). 

RAD52's role in DNA repair through homologous recombination is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Its overexpression can lead to hyperrecombination, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting genomic instability (Lieberman2015Functional). In rectal cancer, high RAD52 expression is associated with poor disease-free and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Ho2020Aberrant).

In cervical cancer, certain RAD52 variants are linked to resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and lower progression-free survival, indicating a role in chemoresistance (Shi2012RAD52). These findings highlight RAD52 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancers where its expression or function is altered.

## Interactions
The RAD52 protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA repair processes. RAD52 interacts with RAD51, a key protein in homologous recombination, facilitating its recruitment to DNA damage sites. This interaction is species-specific, with the human RAD52 protein interacting with RAD51 through a region comprising amino acids 291-330, which shows no homology with the yeast RAD52 protein (Shen1996Specific). RAD52 also interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a single-stranded DNA binding protein, to stimulate DNA strand exchange by targeting RAD51 to a complex with RPA and single-stranded DNA (Hays1998Studies; New1998Rad52).

In addition to these interactions, RAD52 forms a complex with the small acidic protein DSS1, which enhances RAD52's activities by altering its conformation and modulating its DNA binding properties. This interaction stimulates RAD52's single-strand annealing activity and promotes strand invasion, suggesting a collaborative role in DNA repair pathways such as single-strand annealing and break-induced replication (Stefanovie2019DSS1). DSS1 enhances RAD52's binding affinity for single-stranded DNA and increases the efficiency of D-loop formation, crucial for DNA repair (Stefanovie2019DSS1).
