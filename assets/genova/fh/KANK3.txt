# KANK3

## Overview
KANK3 is a gene that encodes the protein KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 3, which is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling. The KANK3 protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin-repeat domains and coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and contribute to its function in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell motility (Kim2017A; Zhu2008Kank). It is a substrate for the enzyme HIF1AN, which hydroxylates KANK3, indicating its involvement in oxygen-dependent cellular processes (Kim2017A). KANK3 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, and is considered a potential tumor suppressor due to its role in inhibiting cell migration and invasion (Kim2017A; Preston2017Genetic). Additionally, KANK3 is involved in vertebrate vascular development, highlighting its significance in both developmental and disease contexts (Hensley2016Evolutionary).

## Structure
KANK3 is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin-repeat domains and coiled-coil motifs, which are integral to its structure and function. The ankyrin-repeat domain in KANK3 consists of five repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and typically form alpha-helical motifs (Kim2017A; Zhu2008Kank). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain (CCD) and a conserved N-terminal KN motif, which includes leucine-rich and arginine-rich regions involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Kim2017A; Zhu2008Kank). The KN motif in KANK3 is located between amino acids 33-77 (Zhu2008Kank).

KANK3 is a substrate for HIF1AN, which hydroxylates it at specific asparagine residues, indicating its involvement in oxygen-dependent cellular processes (Kim2017A). This post-translational modification may influence its interactions and function. The protein's tertiary structure likely involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape that allows interaction with other proteins, such as HIF1AN, contributing to its role in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell motility (Kim2017A). The quaternary structure of KANK3 is not explicitly detailed, but it may involve forming complexes with other proteins.

## Function
KANK3 (KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell signaling. The KANK3 protein contains ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in cytoskeletal dynamics (Zhu2008Kank). It plays a role in the formation of actin stress fibers, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cell shape and motility (Zhu2008Kank). KANK3 is also implicated in the regulation of the F-actin network, which is essential for cell motility and adhesion (Kim2017A).

In healthy human cells, KANK3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with actin filaments and microtubules, contributing to processes such as cell adhesion and migration (Tian2022The). This interaction is vital for tissue development and repair, as it influences cell movement and structural integrity. The protein's role in cytoskeletal organization is further supported by its involvement in the crosstalk between actin and microtubules, which is essential for cellular functions like migration and proliferation (Tian2022The). Despite its established roles in these processes, the specific functions of KANK3 in healthy human cells remain less detailed compared to its roles in pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
KANK3 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily due to its role in cancer progression and its potential as a tumor suppressor. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low expression of KANK3 is significantly correlated with shorter survival, particularly in late-stage HCC and in patients with vascular invasion. This suggests that KANK3 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell migration and invasion, with its overexpression diminishing these behaviors in HCC cell lines (Kim2017A). KANK3 is also identified as a hypoxia-induced proapoptotic target for p53, indicating its potential role in cancer therapy (Tian2022The).

Beyond cancer, KANK3 mutations have been associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a condition characterized by resistance to steroid treatment. Mutations in KANK3, along with other KANK family genes, may contribute to the development of SRNS, highlighting the importance of genetic testing for personalized management and treatment (Preston2017Genetic).

KANK3 is also involved in vertebrate vascular development, with its expression noted in zebrafish blood vessel primordium, suggesting a developmental role in vascular tissues (Hensley2016Evolutionary).

## Interactions
KANK3, a member of the KANK protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly through its ankyrin repeat domains. It has been identified as a substrate for the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor (HIF1AN), an enzyme that hydroxylates proteins at asparagine residues. KANK3 interacts physically with HIF1AN, and this interaction is enhanced by hydroxylation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may influence cellular processes such as tumor cell migration and invasion (Kim2017A).

Experiments have shown that KANK3 has the highest binding affinity for endogenous HIF1AN among the KANK proteins. This interaction was confirmed through various assays, including immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, which demonstrated a direct interaction between KANK3 and HIF1AN in vitro (Kim2017A). The interaction is further validated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK 293T cells overexpressing full-length Myc-tagged KANK proteins (Kim2017A).

KANK3's role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization is also linked to its interactions with components of the actin cytoskeleton, potentially participating in multiprotein complexes that regulate cell shape and motility (Kim2017A).
