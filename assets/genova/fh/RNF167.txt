# RNF167

## Overview
RNF167 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 167, a type I transmembrane protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a RING domain, which is essential for its role in facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to specific substrate proteins, thereby regulating their degradation and function (Deshar2016RNF167; Lussier2012Ubiquitin). RNF167 is involved in various cellular processes, including lysosome positioning, endocytic trafficking, and synaptic transmission, by modulating the ubiquitination of key proteins such as Arl8B and the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 (Deshar2016RNF167; Lussier2012Ubiquitin). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its influence on lysosomal exocytosis and synaptic balance (Nair2020Naturally; Zhu2020Ubiquitination).

## Structure
RNF167 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains a signal peptide, a central membrane-spanning region, and a C-terminal RING domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Deshar2016RNF167; Lussier2012Ubiquitin). The RING domain facilitates interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, promoting the ubiquitination of substrates such as the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 (Ghilarducci2021Functional; Lussier2012Ubiquitin).

The protein also features two putative N-terminal glycosylation sites, which influence its molecular mass and mobility, as demonstrated by changes in its migration pattern upon deglycosylation (Lussier2012Ubiquitin). Glycosylation may play a role in the sorting and intracellular trafficking of RNF167, potentially protecting it from proteolysis (Lussier2012Ubiquitin).

RNF167 is associated with endosomal and lysosomal compartments, and its RING domain is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity. The protein's structure is stabilized by zinc ions, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the RING domain and its interaction with E2 enzymes (Ghilarducci2021Functional). Mutations affecting zinc ion coordination can destabilize the protein's structure and function (Ghilarducci2021Functional).

## Function
RNF167 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of lysosome positioning and endocytic trafficking in human cells. It targets the protein Arl8B for degradation, which is crucial for the subcellular distribution of lysosomes. Arl8B is involved in lysosome motility along microtubules, facilitating anterograde transport through its interaction with kinesin. By modulating Arl8B levels, RNF167 influences lysosome positioning and the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby affecting endocytic trafficking (Deshar2016RNF167).

RNF167 also plays a significant role in synaptic transmission by regulating the surface expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), particularly the GluA2 subunit. It ubiquitinates GluA2, influencing its surface expression and synaptic strength. Mutations in RNF167 can lead to increased AMPAR surface expression, highlighting its role in excitatory neurotransmission (Lussier2012Ubiquitin).

In addition, RNF167 is involved in lysosomal exocytosis, a process important for plasma membrane repair. It regulates lysosomal movement towards the plasma membrane, with its depletion resulting in increased lysosomal exocytosis, which may impact cellular integrity and contribute to tumor progression (Nair2020Naturally; Nair2019Naturally).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF167 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. RNF167 is involved in lysosomal exocytosis and plasma membrane resealing, processes that are crucial for tumor cell survival and progression. The K97N mutation in RNF167-a disrupts lysosomal clustering, leading to increased lysosomal exocytosis and enhanced plasma membrane repair, which can promote tumor progression by providing a survival advantage to cancer cells (Nair2020Naturally). 

RNF167 also plays a role in the regulation of mTORC1 activity through the ubiquitination and degradation of CASTOR1. High expression of RNF167 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. This is due to RNF167's ability to decrease CASTOR1 levels, thereby promoting mTORC1 activation and cancer cell proliferation (Li2021RNF167). 

In the brain, RNF167 is involved in the ubiquitination of the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs. Dysregulation of this process may contribute to neurological conditions such as epilepsy, highlighting the importance of RNF167 in maintaining synaptic balance (Zhu2020Ubiquitination).

## Interactions
RNF167, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that facilitate its role in ubiquitination processes. It interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2D1 and UBE2N, promoting the ubiquitination of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of AMPAR synaptic targeting, affecting membrane trafficking, endocytosis, and degradation of AMPARs (Ghilarducci2021Functional). RNF167 also self-ubiquitinates in the presence of these E2 enzymes, indicating strong functional interactions (Ghilarducci2021Functional).

In addition to its role in AMPAR regulation, RNF167 interacts with Rab7, a small GTPase involved in lysosomal positioning. RNF167 modulates Rab7 function by reducing its localization in Lamp1-positive vesicles, which is significant for vesicle size regulation (Ghilarducci2022Membrane). RNF167 also targets CASTOR1 for K29-linked polyubiquitination and degradation, which is essential for mTORC1 activation. This interaction is regulated by AKT-mediated phosphorylation of CASTOR1, highlighting a complex regulatory loop involving RNF167, AKT, and mTORC1 (Li2021RNF167). These interactions underscore RNF167's role in cellular processes such as protein turnover and signal transduction.
