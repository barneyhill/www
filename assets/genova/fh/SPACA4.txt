# SPACA4

## Overview
The SPACA4 gene encodes the sperm acrosome associated 4 protein, which is integral to the fertilization process in mammals. This protein is specifically expressed in spermatogenic cells and is localized in the acrosome region of sperm cells, where it plays a pivotal role in the acrosome reaction. This reaction is essential for the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida of the oocyte, facilitating successful fertilization (Chen2023Spermatogenic). SPACA4 is not involved in the morphological transformation of sperm during spermiogenesis, but it remains active in the equatorial segment of the sperm after the acrosome reaction, indicating its continued importance in sperm function (Chen2023Spermatogenic). Alterations in SPACA4 expression have been linked to reproductive health issues, such as idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia and globozoospermia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for impaired spermatogenesis (Cheung2021Singlecenter; Malcher2013Potential). Despite its critical role in fertilization, no specific mutations in the SPACA4 gene have been directly associated with human diseases (Chen2023Spermatogenic).

## Function
The SPACA4 gene encodes a protein that is specifically expressed in spermatogenic cells and plays a crucial role in the fertilization process. This protein is localized in the acrosome region of sperm cells, where it is involved in the acrosome reaction, a critical step for sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida of the oocyte (Chen2023Spermatogenic). During the acrosome reaction, SPACA4 is released from the outer acrosomal membrane and acrosomal matrix, facilitating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida, which is essential for successful fertilization (Herberg2021The; Chen2023Spermatogenic).

SPACA4 is not involved in the morphological transformation of sperm during spermiogenesis, as its absence does not affect sperm morphology in mice (Chen2023Spermatogenic). The protein is retained in the equatorial segment of the sperm after the acrosome reaction, indicating its continued role in sperm function beyond the initial binding to the zona pellucida (Chen2023Spermatogenic). Although SPACA4 is essential for sperm-zona pellucida interaction, its expression levels do not correlate with fertilization or cleavage rates in in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes, suggesting that its function in fertilization is not dose-dependent (Chen2023Spermatogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPACA4 gene have been linked to several reproductive health issues. SPACA4 is significantly downregulated in patients with idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this condition and as an indicator of impaired spermatogenesis (Malcher2013Potential; Chen2023Spermatogenic). This downregulation is also observed in infertile men with nonobstructive azoospermia, where SPACA4 is among the most significantly down-regulated genes, indicating its role in spermatogenic failure (Malcher2013Potential).

In mice, the absence of SPACA4 results in sub-fertility due to reduced sperm binding to the zona pellucida, a critical step in fertilization. This suggests that similar mechanisms may affect human fertility, although direct evidence of SPACA4 mutations causing human diseases is not yet established (Herberg2021The). In men with complete globozoospermia, SPACA4 protein is significantly downregulated, which may contribute to the impaired reproductive potential observed in these individuals (Cheung2021Singlecenter). Despite these associations, no specific mutations in the SPACA4 gene have been reported in humans, and its role in diseases remains unclear (Chen2023Spermatogenic).
