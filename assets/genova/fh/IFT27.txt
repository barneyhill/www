# IFT27

## Overview
IFT27 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 27 (IFT27) protein, a small GTPase that plays a pivotal role in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, particularly within the IFT-B complex. The IFT27 protein is homologous to Rab GTPases and is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, which is essential for its function in ciliary trafficking and cell-cycle regulation (Qin2007Intraflagellar; Zhang2017Intraflagellar). As part of the IFT-B complex, IFT27 is involved in the regulation of the BBSome complex, facilitating the trafficking of signaling receptors into and out of cilia, and impacting critical signaling pathways such as the Hedgehog pathway (Liew2014The). Beyond its role in ciliary function, IFT27 is also implicated in cell division and immune synapse formation, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Baldari2010Intraflagellar). Mutations in the IFT27 gene have been linked to Bardet-Biedl Syndrome, underscoring its clinical relevance (Schaefer2019Identification).

## Structure
IFT27 is a small GTPase protein that is part of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. It exhibits homology to Rab GTPases and contains all five Ras-GTPase consensus sequences essential for GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activity, indicating its role as a small GTPase (Qin2007Intraflagellar; Zhang2017Intraflagellar). The protein displays the fold characteristic of Rab-like small guanosine triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) (Zhang2017Intraflagellar).

IFT27 forms a stable heterodimer with IFT25, which is considered a single structural module, indicating a quaternary structure aspect (Taschner2012Architecture; Bhogaraju2013Intraflagellar). This interaction is mediated via a conserved interface, suggesting a quaternary structure where these proteins likely form a subcomplex in vivo (Zhang2017Intraflagellar). The IFT27/25 complex associates with the IFT-B complex upon entry into the cilium, suggesting a regulatory function in IFT initiation (Taschner2012Architecture).

IFT27 is not lipid-modified, as indicated by its presence in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 partitioning, despite containing a prenylation motif (Qin2007Intraflagellar). The protein's interaction with other IFT proteins is facilitated by conserved surface residues adjacent to the GTP-binding site, which could mediate binding to other IFT proteins (Zhang2017Intraflagellar).

## Function
IFT27 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically associated with IFT complex B, and plays a crucial role in ciliary trafficking. In healthy human cells, IFT27 is involved in the regulation of the BBSome complex, which is essential for the trafficking of signaling receptors into and out of cilia. IFT27 interacts with the GTPase ARL6/BBS3, stabilizing its nucleotide-free form and promoting its activation, which is necessary for the assembly of the BBSome coat on membranes. This interaction facilitates the export of signaling proteins from cilia, impacting pathways such as the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Liew2014The).

IFT27 also plays a role in cell-cycle control, as its partial knockdown results in defects in cytokinesis and elongation of the cell cycle, while complete knockdown is lethal. This indicates that IFT27 is involved in cell division and cell-cycle progression, beyond its role in flagellar assembly (Qin2007Intraflagellar). Additionally, IFT27 is implicated in exocytosis and cytokinesis in non-ciliated cells, such as T lymphocytes, where it is crucial for vesicle fusion and immune synapse formation (Baldari2010Intraflagellar).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT27 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a rare ciliopathy characterized by a range of developmental and physical abnormalities. These include retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, and kidney dysfunction (Schaefer2019Identification). In a study, two compound heterozygous mutations in IFT27 were identified in a patient with BBS: c.104A > G (p.Tyr35Cys) and c.349 + 1G > T. The first mutation affects a conserved position in the protein's switch I region, while the second mutation is predicted to abolish the donor splice site of exon 5, leading to alternative splicing and in-frame deletions in the protein (Schaefer2019Identification).

IFT27 has also been investigated in the context of bipolar disorder. A study found a significant association of bipolar disorder with a haplotype near the IFT27 gene, although this association was not consistently replicated across all datasets (Nissen2012Evidence). The study suggests the presence of a bipolar disorder susceptibility gene in the 22q12.3 region, where IFT27 is located, but does not conclusively establish IFT27 as a causative gene for the disorder (Nissen2012Evidence).

## Interactions
IFT27, a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, engages in several critical protein interactions. It directly interacts with IFT25, forming a subcomplex within the IFT-B complex. This interaction has been demonstrated in Chlamydomonas, where IFT25 and IFT27 co-localize at transition zones and basal bodies, and bind directly in vitro (Wang2009Intraflagellar). The IFT27/25 complex is thought to play a regulatory role in IFT initiation, as it associates with the IFT-B complex upon entry into the cilium (Taschner2012Architecture).

IFT27 also interacts with the GTPase ARL6 (BBS3), particularly in its nucleotide-free state. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking of the BBSome, a complex involved in ciliary function, and is proposed to occur at the distal tip of cilia. IFT27 may act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL6, stabilizing its nucleotide-free form and facilitating BBSome exit from cilia (Liew2014The).

Additionally, IFT27 interacts with LZTFL1 (BBS17), a protein involved in ciliary trafficking and immune synapse formation. This interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a role in maintaining the ciliary signaling compartment (Huang2021Leucine).
