# LRP5

## Overview
The LRP5 gene encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5, a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for bone mass regulation and various developmental processes. The LRP5 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple β-propeller domains that facilitate interactions with ligands and inhibitors, such as Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) and sclerostin (SOST), thereby modulating Wnt signaling activity (Johnson2005Parameters; Cnossen2014Wholeexome). Functionally, LRP5 is integral to osteoblast metabolism, influencing both bone formation and energy utilization (Frey2015WntLrp5). Mutations in the LRP5 gene are associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, including osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, underscoring its significance in both skeletal and ocular health (Boyden2002High; Qin2005Complexity).

## Structure
The LRP5 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, crucial for bone mass regulation. Its primary structure consists of 1,615 amino acids, featuring a long extracellular region, a single-span transmembrane region, and a relatively short intracellular region (Cnossen2014Wholeexome). The extracellular domain includes four β-propeller domains, each containing six YWTD sequences, separated by epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, and three LDL receptor type A (LA) repeats (Johnson2005Parameters; Cnossen2014Wholeexome). These β-propeller domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions and ligand binding, playing a significant role in Wnt signaling (Johnson2005Parameters).

The secondary structure of LRP5 includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the β-propeller domains forming prominent folds necessary for their function (Li2023Genetic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, which is essential for the protein's interaction with other molecules in the signaling pathway (Li2023Genetic). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, such as Frizzled and Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which are crucial for the regulation of bone density (Johnson2005Parameters).

Post-translational modifications of LRP5 include glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function (Johnson2005Parameters). Splice variants of LRP5 can lead to different isoforms, potentially influencing its role in various physiological processes (Johnson2005Parameters).

## Function
The LRP5 gene encodes a protein that functions as a coreceptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for bone density regulation in healthy human cells. This pathway plays a critical role in bone formation and maintenance by mediating the effects of Wnt signaling, which influences osteoblast metabolism and bone mass (Frey2015WntLrp5; Boyden2002High). LRP5 interacts with proteins such as Dickkopf (Dkk), which inhibits Wnt signaling, thereby maintaining a balance crucial for normal bone density (Boyden2002High).

In addition to its role in bone density, LRP5 is involved in the regulation of osteoblast metabolism, particularly in the utilization of fatty acids as a fuel source. This function is vital for energy production required for bone matrix synthesis and mineralization (Frey2015WntLrp5). LRP5 also influences glucose metabolism, affecting glycolytic gene expression and lactate production (Frey2015WntLrp5).

Mutations in LRP5 can lead to significant changes in bone mass, with loss-of-function mutations associated with conditions like osteoporosis-pseudoglioma, characterized by low bone mass, and gain-of-function mutations leading to high bone density (Joiner2013LRP5; Boyden2002High).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRP5 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions due to their impact on the Wnt signaling pathway. One significant condition linked to LRP5 mutations is familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), a genetic disorder affecting retinal vascular development. Mutations in LRP5 can lead to both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of FEVR, with symptoms ranging from mild vision impairment to severe retinal detachment and blindness (Qin2005Complexity). 

LRP5 mutations are also implicated in bone density disorders. Inactivating mutations can result in osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG), characterized by low bone mass and vision problems (Zhao2023Novel). Conversely, activating mutations in LRP5 can cause autosomal dominant osteosclerosis type I (ADO I), leading to increased bone mineral density and thickened bone cortex (Zhao2023Novel).

Additionally, LRP5 mutations have been identified in patients with polycystic liver disease (PCLD), where they contribute to hepatic cystogenesis through altered Wnt signaling (Cnossen2014Wholeexome). These mutations highlight the gene's role in diverse pathologies, affecting both ocular and skeletal systems.

## Interactions
LRP5 interacts with several proteins that play significant roles in the Wnt signaling pathway. It forms complexes with LRP6 and Frizzled receptors, which are crucial for the activation of β-catenin signaling. LRP5 binds to Wnt proteins, facilitating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes (Joiner2013LRP5).

LRP5 also interacts with inhibitors such as DKK1 and SOST. These inhibitors bind to the extracellular domain of LRP5, affecting its interaction with Wnt ligands. The binding sites for these inhibitors are located on the β-propeller domains of LRP5, which are crucial for its regulatory functions (Joiner2013LRP5).

During human respiratory syncytial virus infection, LRP5 interacts with human beta defensin-3 (HBD3), which acts as a ligand to activate β-catenin signaling. This interaction occurs at the PE3 domain of LRP5 and is involved in forming a ternary complex with the FZD8 receptor, contributing to a pro-inflammatory response (Pokharel2023Human).

LRP5 also binds to apolipoprotein E, which is involved in lipoprotein metabolism and endocytosis, highlighting its role in metabolic processes (Joiner2013LRP5). These interactions underscore LRP5's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
