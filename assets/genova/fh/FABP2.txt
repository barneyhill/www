# FABP2

## Overview
FABP2, or fatty acid binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a small intracellular protein primarily expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine. This protein, categorized as a fatty acid-binding protein, plays a pivotal role in the absorption and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules. The protein's structure, characterized by a beta-barrel formation, facilitates the binding and trafficking of fatty acids, which is crucial for lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. FABP2's function extends beyond the cytoplasm, as it is also involved in the translocation of fatty acids to the nucleus, potentially influencing gene expression. Variations in the FABP2 gene, such as the Ala54Thr polymorphism, have been linked to metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic health (Suárez2020Identification; Smathers2011The; Storch2008The).

## Structure
FABP2, or fatty acid binding protein 2, is a small intracellular protein involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids. Its primary structure consists of 127-134 amino acids, forming a sequence that is highly conserved among the fatty acid-binding protein family (Suárez2020Identification; Smathers2011The). The secondary structure of FABP2 is characterized by ten antiparallel beta strands that form a beta-barrel, which is a common feature among FABPs (Zimmerman2002New; Suárez2020Identification). This beta-barrel structure creates a central, water-filled cavity that facilitates the binding of fatty acids (Zimmerman2002New).

The tertiary structure of FABP2 is compact and stable, allowing for the specific binding of long-chain fatty acids. The binding cavity is capped by two short alpha-helices, which play a role in regulating ligand binding (Suárez2020Identification; Smathers2011The). FABP2 does not typically form quaternary structures, as it generally functions as a monomer (Smathers2011The).

FABP2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interaction with other cellular components (Zimmerman2002New). The protein also contains a non-classical nuclear localization signal, involving specific lysine and arginine residues, which facilitates its translocation to the nucleus (Suárez2020Identification).

## Function
FABP2, also known as intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), is primarily expressed in the enterocytes of the small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in the absorption and intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and other hydrophobic molecules. This protein is involved in the binding and trafficking of these fatty acids within the cytosol, facilitating their uptake and metabolism in the intestine (Smathers2011The; Storch2008The). FABP2 binds saturated LCFAs with higher affinity than unsaturated ones, and its structure allows it to bind fatty acids in a slightly bent conformation, which is essential for its function in lipid metabolism (Smathers2011The; Storch2008The).

The protein's activity is not limited to the cytoplasm; it is also involved in the translocation of fatty acids to the nucleus, potentially influencing gene expression through interactions with nuclear receptors. This nuclear translocation is facilitated by a non-classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) within FABP2, which is activated upon ligand binding (Suárez2020Identification). FABP2's role in lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism is significant, impacting processes such as lipid signaling and storage, and contributing to the overall metabolic health of the organism (Smathers2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FABP2 gene, particularly the Ala54Thr polymorphism, have been associated with several metabolic disorders. The Thr54 allele is linked to an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceridemia, as observed in a South Indian population. Individuals carrying the Thr54 allele exhibit higher levels of 2-hour plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, 2-hour insulin, fasting serum triglycerides, and fasting LDL cholesterol, suggesting a role in insulin resistance and lipid metabolism (Vimaleswaran2006Thr54).

In dyslipidemic men with type 2 diabetes, the Thr54 polymorphism is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, likely due to its effect on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein profiles (Georgopoulos2007Codon). The polymorphism is also linked to increased fatty acid binding and fat oxidation, contributing to insulin resistance, particularly in populations with a high prevalence of obesity, such as the Pima Indians (Baier1995An).

The TT genotype of the A54T polymorphism is associated with higher triglyceride levels and an increased risk of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, indicating its potential role in diabetic nephropathy (Canani2005The).
