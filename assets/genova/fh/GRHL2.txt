# GRHL2

## Overview
The GRHL2 gene encodes the grainyhead-like transcription factor 2, a member of the grainyhead-like (Grh/CP2) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its conserved DNA-binding domain, which shares structural similarities with the tumor suppressor protein p53, despite limited sequence identity (Ming2018Structural). GRHL2 functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in regulating epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and maintaining epithelial integrity. It is involved in various cellular processes, including telomerase activity regulation, cell adhesion, and chromatin remodeling (Chen2010Grainyheadlike; Werth2010The). GRHL2 interacts with several proteins and transcription factors, influencing gene expression and chromatin dynamics, particularly in the context of estrogen receptor signaling (Reese2022GRHL2). Clinically, GRHL2 is implicated in conditions such as age-related hearing impairment, non-syndromic hearing loss, and various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Van2007The; Gasperoni2022Grainyhead-like). Additionally, its overexpression is linked to neural tube defects, highlighting its significance in developmental processes (Brouns2011Overexpression).

## Structure
The GRHL2 protein is a member of the grainyhead-like (Grh/CP2) transcription factor family, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) with an immunoglobulin-like core. This core consists of two long, twisted antiparallel β sheets and three α helices, forming a structure similar to that of the tumor suppressor protein p53, despite only 10% sequence identity (Ming2018Structural). The GRHL2 DBD was crystallized and its structure determined at 2.5 Å resolution, showing a high degree of structural similarity to the GRHL1 DBD, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 Å between 160 matching Cα positions (Ming2018Structural).

GRHL2 contains specific domains, including a transactivation domain, a conserved DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization domain. The protein binds to DNA as a dimer, specifically recognizing the consensus sequence 5'-AACCGGTT-3' (Ming2018Structural). The DNA-binding domain of GRHL2 interacts with DNA through electrostatic interactions, with sequence recognition mediated by conserved arginine residues (Ming2018Structural).

GRHL2 also has splice variant isoforms, such as the GRHL2v isoform, which is an N-terminally truncated version with a disrupted transactivation domain. This variant acts in a dominant negative fashion, contrasting with the canonical GRHL2 isoform, which exhibits oncogenic potential (Werner2013Dual).

## Function
GRHL2 (grainyhead-like transcription factor 2) is a crucial regulator of epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. In healthy human cells, GRHL2 enhances the expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene by inhibiting DNA methylation at the 5′-CpG island of the hTERT promoter. This regulation is essential for maintaining telomerase activity, which prolongs the replicative lifespan of keratinocytes by allowing more population doublings before senescence (Chen2010Grainyheadlike).

GRHL2 also plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial integrity by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and junction formation. It is essential for the expression of E-cadherin and claudin 4 (Cldn4), which are critical components of the epithelial apical junctional complex. GRHL2 facilitates chromatin looping at the E-cadherin locus, maintaining active chromatin marks and ensuring proper gene expression (Werth2010The).

In addition to its role in cell proliferation and adhesion, GRHL2 is involved in inhibiting keratinocyte differentiation through epigenetic mechanisms. It suppresses the expression of genes within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) by modulating histone modifications, thereby maintaining the undifferentiated state of keratinocytes (Chen2012Grainyheadlike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GRHL2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. GRHL2 is associated with age-related hearing impairment (ARHI), where specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene are linked to the condition. These SNPs are primarily located in intronic regions, suggesting that regulatory changes may contribute to ARHI (Van2007The). GRHL2 is also linked to non-syndromic hearing loss, with variants often introducing premature termination codons or resulting in exon deletions, leading to progressive, bilateral, and late-onset hearing loss (Trebusak2021Novel).

In cancer, GRHL2 acts as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cancer type. It functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric and bladder cancers by inhibiting proliferation and invasion, while in colorectal cancer, it has oncogenic roles, with higher expression levels associated with poor survival outcomes (Gasperoni2022Grainyhead-like). In hepatocellular carcinoma, a gain in GRHL2 copy number is linked to larger tumor size and poor differentiation, serving as a predictive marker for recurrence (Tanaka2008Gain).

GRHL2 overexpression is also associated with neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in mouse models, indicating its critical role in neural tube closure (Brouns2011Overexpression).

## Interactions
GRHL2 (grainyhead-like transcription factor 2) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It interacts with the estrogen receptor (ER), particularly the phosphorylated form pS118-ER, enhancing its chromatin binding and regulating ER-mediated transcriptional activation and repression. This interaction is crucial for ER's recruitment to chromatin and is often found in active enhancer regions marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (Reese2022GRHL2).

GRHL2 also interacts with transcription factors such as FOXA1 and coactivators like p300, which enhance ER transcriptional activity. These interactions are significant at co-occupancy sites where GRHL2 and pS118-ER bind together, suggesting a collaborative role in transcriptional regulation (Reese2022GRHL2a; Reese2022GRHL2). GRHL2 can modulate ER transcriptional activity by recruiting or repressing additional coregulators, and it is involved in chromatin priming for ER binding (Reese2022GRHL2).

In breast cancer, GRHL2 acts as a co-regulator of ER at enhancers, influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and eRNA production. It can function as a co-repressor in ER signaling, affecting histone acetylation and chromatin structure (Holding2019VULCAN).
