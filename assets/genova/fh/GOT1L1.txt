# GOT1L1

## Overview
GOT1L1, or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in amino acid metabolism, specifically functioning as an aminotransferase. The protein encoded by GOT1L1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in the transamination process, facilitating the conversion of L-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. This activity is crucial for the malate-aspartate shuttle, a metabolic pathway important for transferring reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane, thereby supporting cellular energy production (TanakaHayashi2014Is). Although initially thought to be involved in D-aspartate production, research indicates that GOT1L1 does not significantly contribute to the synthesis of D-aspartate or D-glutamate (TanakaHayashi2014Is). The gene is notably expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in amino acid metabolism within this tissue, although its precise function in human physiology remains to be fully understood (TanakaHayashi2014Is).

## Function
GOT1L1 (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in amino acid metabolism, specifically exhibiting L-aspartate aminotransferase activity. This activity suggests that GOT1L1 may play a role in the transamination process, where it facilitates the conversion of L-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate to oxaloacetate and L-glutamate (TanakaHayashi2014Is). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, contributing to metabolic pathways and energy homeostasis within cells (TanakaHayashi2014Is).

Despite initial hypotheses suggesting its involvement in D-aspartate production, studies have shown that GOT1L1 does not significantly contribute to the synthesis of D-aspartate or D-glutamate under tested conditions (TanakaHayashi2014Is). Instead, its role appears to be more aligned with L-aspartate aminotransferase activity, which is crucial for the malate-aspartate shuttle, a process important for transferring reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane and supporting cellular energy production (TanakaHayashi2014Is).

The expression of GOT1L1 mRNA is notably high in the testis, indicating a potential role in amino acid metabolism in this tissue, although its exact function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (TanakaHayashi2014Is).
