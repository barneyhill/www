# LDAF1

## Overview
LDAF1, or lipid droplet assembly factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of lipid droplets (LDs) within cells. The protein encoded by LDAF1 is integral to the formation and organization of LDs, which are essential for cellular energy storage and lipid metabolism. LDAF1 functions as a part of a complex with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein seipin, facilitating the transition of triglycerides into droplet form at specific ER sites. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and has implications for understanding metabolic disorders and potential industrial applications related to lipid storage (Chung2019LDAF1; Goodman2019LDAF1). The LDAF1 protein is categorized as a lipid droplet assembly factor, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Choudhary2021A; Bohnert2020New).

## Function
LDAF1, also known as lipid droplet assembly factor 1, plays a crucial role in the formation of lipid droplets (LDs) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. It forms a complex with the ER protein seipin, which is essential for determining the specific sites where LDs form. This complex is a 600 kDa oligomeric structure that facilitates the transition of triglycerides from a membrane-soluble state to a droplet form, marking the initial stages of LD formation (Chung2019LDAF1).

The interaction between LDAF1 and seipin is mediated by a hydrophobic helix in seipin, which is highly conserved across species. The absence of seipin results in abnormal LD formation, characterized by an increased number of small LDs that eventually coalesce into larger ones. This indicates that the LDAF1-seipin complex acts as a machinery to ensure organized LD formation, which is important for energy storage and membrane synthesis (Chung2019LDAF1).

LDAF1 is essential for the proper orchestration of LD formation at specific sites in the ER, impacting cellular energy balance and metabolic processes. Its function has implications for understanding metabolic diseases and industrial applications related to lipid storage (Chung2019LDAF1).

## Interactions
LDAF1, also known as Lipid Droplet Assembly Factor 1, interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein seipin to form a complex crucial for lipid droplet (LD) formation. This interaction is mediated by a hydrophobic helical domain in seipin, which is evolutionarily conserved. The LDAF1-seipin complex is a large oligomeric structure that facilitates the transition of triglycerides from a membrane-soluble state to forming droplets, ensuring organized LD formation and preventing disorganized growth (Chung2019LDAF1; Goodman2019LDAF1).

LDAF1 dissociates from seipin and relocates to the surface of growing lipid droplets, a process that occurs in response to triacylglycerol accumulation. This translocation suggests that LDAF1 exists in two forms: a seipin-bound ER form and a seipin-free LD form (Choudhary2021A; Bohnert2020New). The interaction between LDAF1 and seipin is essential for LD biogenesis, as newly forming LDs preferentially emerge from seipin foci that are also LDAF1-positive (Choudhary2021A).

The absence of seipin affects the stability and localization of LDAF1, indicating that seipin deficiency may lead to the absence of both proteins, affecting their functions in LD formation (Kumar2024The; RakotonirinaRicquebourg2022Hello).
