# BCHE

## Overview
The BCHE gene encodes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a member of the serine hydrolase family, which plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of ester-containing compounds. BChE is primarily expressed in the liver and plasma, where it functions in the detoxification of various substances, including drugs and toxins, by hydrolyzing them into inactive metabolites. This enzyme also serves as a bioscavenger for organophosphates and carbamates, providing protection against these toxic agents. In addition to its detoxifying functions, BChE is involved in the regulation of acetylcholine levels, particularly in conditions where acetylcholinesterase activity is compromised, such as in Alzheimer's disease. The enzyme's activity extends to metabolic regulation, influencing processes like neurogenesis and the hydrolysis of octanoyl ghrelin, a peptide involved in appetite and weight regulation. Mutations in the BCHE gene can lead to butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, affecting drug metabolism and posing clinical risks during anesthesia (Lockridge2015Review; Masson2009Structure; Hartmann2006Excessive).

## Structure
The BCHE gene encodes the butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) protein, a member of the serine hydrolase family. The primary structure of human BChE consists of a single polypeptide chain with 602 amino acids, including a 28-residue signal peptide and a 574-residue mature protein (Lockridge2015Review). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its globular tertiary structure. The protein's quaternary structure is a tetramer, with four identical subunits interacting via a four-helix bundle at the C-termini, stabilized by a central polyproline-rich peptide (Lockridge2015Review; Xing2020Structure).

BChE's catalytic activity is facilitated by a triad of amino acids: Ser 198, Glu 325, and His 438 (Lockridge2015Review). The enzyme is highly glycosylated, with the native form containing nine asparagine-linked glycans, although recombinant forms have been engineered to reduce this number (Lockridge2015Review). BChE is a soluble protein found in plasma, with the same mRNA encoding both soluble and membrane-bound forms in muscle and brain tissues (Lockridge2015Review). There are no alternatively spliced forms of the BCHE mRNA (Lockridge2015Review).

## Function
The BCHE gene encodes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a significant role in the detoxification and metabolism of various ester-containing compounds in healthy human cells. BChE is primarily found in the liver and plasma, where it hydrolyzes substances such as cocaine, heroin, and aspirin into inactive products, thus providing protection against their toxicity (Lockridge2015Review; Masson2009Structure). It also acts as a natural bioscavenger for organophosphates and carbamates, offering protection against these toxic agents (Masson2009Structure).

BChE is involved in the hydrolysis of acetylcholine, particularly in conditions where acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is reduced, such as in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests a compensatory role in regulating acetylcholine levels in the brain (Hartmann2006Excessive). The enzyme is also implicated in the hydrolysis of octanoyl ghrelin, a peptide influencing feeding and weight gain, indicating a role in metabolic regulation (Lockridge2015Review).

BChE's activity is not limited to detoxification; it is also involved in neurogenesis and neural differentiation, particularly in the retina, where it influences cell lineage decisions and photoreceptor development (Mack2000The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCHE gene can lead to butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) deficiency, which is clinically significant due to its impact on drug metabolism, particularly neuromuscular blocking agents like succinylcholine and mivacurium. Individuals with BChE deficiency are at risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, resulting in postanesthetic apnea, which can lead to severe complications such as prolonged coma or death (Yu2018A; Genetic; Zhu2020&lt; p&gt). The condition is often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with common mutations including the dibucaine and K-variant (Yen2003Butyrylcholinesterase).

The BCHE gene is also associated with other health conditions. Variants in BCHE have been linked to a delayed onset and slower progression of Alzheimer's disease (Mikami2008Five). Additionally, there is suggestive evidence that BCHE gene deletions may be associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), potentially due to its role in the cholinergic system, which influences attention and movement control (Jacob2013Acetylcholinemetabolizing).

Genetic testing for BCHE variants is important for identifying individuals at risk of prolonged neuromuscular blockade, allowing for alternative anesthetic strategies to be employed (p&gt; Genetic; Zhu2020&lt).

## Interactions
Butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) interacts with various proteins in human serum, forming complexes larger than its tetrameric form. It is known to associate with high-density lipoproteins (HDL), particularly through interactions with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), a major component of HDL. This interaction is supported by evidence of BCHE co-purification with ApoA-I in HDL fractions (Jasiecki2021Butyrylcholinesterase–Protein). BCHE also interacts with other proteins such as clusterin (ApoJ) and vitronectin, which are associated with HDL and have roles in lipid transport and inflammation regulation (Jasiecki2021Butyrylcholinesterase–Protein).

BCHE forms tetramers through the interaction of four identical subunits, facilitated by a polyproline-rich peptide that is central to the assembly process. This peptide is hydrogen-bonded to specific tryptophan residues and other hydrophobic residues, ensuring the stability of the tetrameric structure (Lockridge2015Review). BCHE's interaction with polyproline-rich peptides may prevent unregulated interactions with other proteins, suggesting a protective role in cellular processes (Lockridge2015Review).

BCHE also interacts with albumin, forming a specific band on electrophoresis gels, and is likely to bind to dipeptidyl amino peptidase DPPIV, as indicated by its activity in highly purified samples (Marchot2012Enzymatic).
