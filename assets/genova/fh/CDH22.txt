# CDH22

## Overview
CDH22 is a gene that encodes cadherin 22, a type II classical cadherin protein involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Unlike type I cadherins, type II cadherins, including cadherin 22, lack the HAV tripeptide motif and are characterized by specific structural features such as conserved tryptophan residues (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). Cadherin 22 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of neural and non-neural tissues, particularly within the central nervous system, where it contributes to synaptic connections and neural differentiation (Mayer2010Expression; Kelly2017Hypoxia). The protein is also involved in several signaling pathways, including the Wnt, JAK-STAT, and PI3K-AKT pathways, which are essential for cell adhesion, signaling, and stem cell maintenance (Zhang2017Cadherin; Zhang2019AKT3). Additionally, CDH22 has clinical significance in cancer progression and metastasis, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various cancers (MartínSánchez2017CDH22; Kelly2017Hypoxia).

## Structure
CDH22, or cadherin 22, is a member of the type II classical cadherins, characterized by the presence of two conserved tryptophan residues at the second and fourth positions in the most distal domain, EC1 (Hulpiau2009Molecular; Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). Unlike type I cadherins, type II cadherins, including CDH22, lack the HAV tripeptide motif (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The protein structure of CDH22 includes extracellular cadherin repeats, which are typical of cadherins and are involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

The primary structure of CDH22 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the protein chain, which is organized into multiple extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's adhesive functions. The secondary structure likely includes beta strands, as seen in other cadherins, forming a beta-sandwich fold (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable conformation, facilitated by calcium binding, which is essential for maintaining the protein's structural integrity and function (Tiwari2018StructuralMechanical).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications for CDH22 are not detailed in the available context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is possible, contributing to functional diversity, but specific isoforms of CDH22 are not mentioned in the provided sources.

## Function
CDH22, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is primarily involved in morphogenesis and tissue formation in the brain and neuroendocrine organs. In healthy animals, CDH22 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of neural and non-neural tissues, particularly in the brain, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections (Kelly2017Hypoxia). The protein is expressed in specific and partially overlapping groups of neurons in various areas of the central nervous system, including the cerebellum, neocortex, and hippocampus, suggesting its involvement in CNS development and function (Mayer2010Expression).

In the developing and adult mouse brain, CDH22 is expressed in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1/CA3 regions and the granular layer of the dentate gyrus, indicating its role in neural differentiation and function (Mayer2010Expression). The expression patterns of CDH22 in the brain suggest that it may play significant roles during development and in adult CNS function, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the available studies (Mayer2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
CDH22, a member of the cadherin superfamily, plays a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. Alterations in CDH22 expression are linked to various cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and metastatic melanoma. In breast cancer, CDH22 is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with shorter progression-free and overall survival, making it an independent prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes (MartínSánchez2017CDH22). This hypermethylation can be reversed with epigenetic drugs, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies (MartínSánchez2017CDH22).

In hypoxic tumor environments, CDH22 expression is upregulated, promoting cancer cell migration, invasion, and adhesion. This process is mediated by eIF4E2, independent of mTORC1, and is crucial for tumor progression, particularly in breast carcinoma and glioblastoma (Kelly2017Hypoxia). Blocking CDH22 impairs these processes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent metastasis (Kelly2017Hypoxia).

CDH22's role in cancer is complex, as its expression levels and regulatory mechanisms vary across different cancer types and stages, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target (Kelly2017Hypoxia).

## Interactions
Cadherin 22 (CDH22) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. CDH22 interacts with β-catenin, a key component in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for the self-renewal of mouse female germ line stem cells (FGSCs). This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that CDH22 binds to β-catenin, influencing the expression of downstream targets like Cyclin D1, which is important for cell cycle progression and FGSC proliferation (Zhang2017Cadherin).

CDH22 also interacts with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by binding to JAK2, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3. This interaction is critical for maintaining FGSCs, as it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival (Zhang2017Cadherin).

In addition, CDH22 is involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It binds directly to PI3K, which results in the phosphorylation and activation of AKT3, promoting the expression of genes like N-myc and members of the Cyclin family, thereby supporting FGSC self-renewal (Zhang2019AKT3). These interactions highlight CDH22's role in regulating cell adhesion and signaling pathways critical for stem cell maintenance and proliferation.
