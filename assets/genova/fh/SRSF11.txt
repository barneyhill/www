# SRSF11

## Overview
SRSF11 is a gene that encodes the serine and arginine rich splicing factor 11, a member of the SR protein family, which is integral to RNA splicing and telomere maintenance. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins. SRSF11 plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle, by acting as a scaffold that interacts with both the telomerase RNA component (TERC) and telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) (Lee2015Involvement). Beyond its role in telomere biology, SRSF11 is involved in cognitive functions and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence survival outcomes and drug resistance (Yuan2022Comprehensive; Raihan2019SRSF11).

## Structure
SRSF11, a member of the SR protein family, is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain. These domains are crucial for its function in RNA splicing and interactions with other proteins. The RRM domain is essential for binding to the telomerase RNA component (TERC), while the RS domain facilitates interaction with TRF2, a component of the shelterin complex (Lee2015Involvement). 

The primary structure of SRSF11 includes sequences rich in serine and arginine, which are typical of SR proteins. These sequences are likely involved in post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is common in SR proteins and affects their splicing activity and protein interactions (Lee2015Involvement). 

Although specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SRSF11 are not provided, the presence of the RRM and RS domains suggests a structure that supports RNA binding and protein-protein interactions. SRSF11 may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could influence its functional diversity and interaction capabilities (Lee2015Involvement).

## Function
SRSF11 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 11) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. It acts as a scaffold by interacting with both TERC (telomerase RNA component) and TRF2 (telomeric repeat-binding factor 2), facilitating the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres at nuclear speckles. This interaction is essential for telomere maintenance, as depletion of SRSF11 leads to reduced telomere length (Lee2015Involvement).

SRSF11 is also involved in the assembly and trafficking of telomerase, influencing telomere maintenance. It associates with catalytically active telomerase in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with its activity peaking during the S phase. This association is crucial for the proper loading of telomerase onto telomeres, which is necessary for maintaining telomere length and genomic stability (Lee2015Involvement).

In addition to its role in telomere biology, SRSF11 is involved in cognitive functions by regulating the stability of mRNAs for proteins like LRP8 and apoE, which are important for neuronal health and cognitive processes (Raihan2019SRSF11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF11 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of cognitive function, SRSF11 deficiency is associated with aging-related cognitive decline. This is due to its role in modulating the levels of LRP8 and apoE, which are crucial for cognitive processes. A deficiency in SRSF11 leads to decreased levels of these proteins, resulting in enhanced JNK signaling, a pathway associated with cognitive decline and aging-like phenotypes (Raihan2019SRSF11).

In cancer, SRSF11 expression levels have significant implications. Decreased expression of SRSF11 is linked to poor survival outcomes in various cancers, including breast, colon, lung, and stomach cancers. This is potentially due to its involvement in carcinogenesis-related pathways such as the p53 pathway and apoptosis (oh2023mettl3). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high SRSF11 expression is associated with increased resistance to the drug sorafenib, suggesting a role in drug resistance and tumor progression. Knockdown of SRSF11 in HCC cells has been shown to suppress proliferation, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Yuan2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
SRSF11, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It specifically interacts with TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, through its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for binding to TERC, the RNA component of telomerase (Lee2015Involvement). SRSF11 also forms a stable complex with TRF2, a component of the shelterin complex, through its RS domain, although it does not interact with other shelterin components (Lee2015Involvement). This interaction is independent of the cell cycle phase, suggesting a consistent presence of telomeres at nuclear speckles (Lee2015Involvement).

SRSF11 is essential for the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres at nuclear speckles during the S phase of the cell cycle. It associates with active telomerase, directing it to nuclear speckles, and facilitates the translocation of telomerase to telomeres through its interactions with TERC and TRF2 (Lee2015Involvement). The depletion of SRSF11 disrupts telomerase recruitment, leading to telomere shortening, highlighting its role in telomere maintenance (Lee2015Involvement). These interactions underscore SRSF11's critical function in telomerase assembly and telomere length regulation.
