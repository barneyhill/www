# CDH8

## Overview
CDH8 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 8, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is integral to calcium-dependent cell adhesion processes. Cadherin 8 is categorized as a type-II classic cadherin and is characterized by its transmembrane nature, featuring five extracellular cadherin repeats that facilitate homophilic cell-cell adhesion interactions (Pokutta2007Structure; Lin2008Molecular). This protein plays a significant role in neural development, particularly in synaptic function and organization, by contributing to the formation and maintenance of neural circuits. The expression of CDH8 is notably high in specific neuronal populations, such as corticostriatal projection neurons and medium spiny neurons, where it influences dendritic arborization and synaptic targeting (Friedman2014Cadherin‐8; Bekirov2007Cadherin‐8). Alterations in the CDH8 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in brain development and function (Pagnamenta2010Rare).

## Structure
The CDH8 protein, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is characterized by its structure, which includes several key domains and features. The primary structure of CDH8 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with the longest isoform containing 799 amino acids (Lin2008Molecular). The secondary structure includes five extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a hallmark of classical cadherins, which are involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion (Lin2008Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of CDH8 involves the folding of these EC repeats into a stable conformation, which is crucial for its adhesive functions. The quaternary structure may involve homophilic interactions with other cadherin molecules, facilitating cell-cell adhesion (Pokutta2007Structure). CDH8 contains a single transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail, which are essential for its role in cell signaling and adhesion (Lin2008Molecular).

CDH8 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its function and interactions (Pokutta2007Structure). The gene also produces splice variant isoforms, including Cdh8-1, Cdh8-2, and Cdh8-3, which differ in their domain structures and potential functions (Lin2008Molecular).

## Function
CDH8, or cadherin 8, is a type-II classic cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in neural development and synaptic function. It is highly expressed in corticostriatal projection neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and medium spiny neurons in the dorsal striatum, with its expression peaking during early postnatal synaptogenesis. CDH8 is concentrated at excitatory synaptic junctions and is equally expressed by neurons forming direct and indirect pathways, contributing to the generation of cortical neuron dendritic arbors and dendrite self-recognition (Friedman2014Cadherin‐8).

In the hippocampus, CDH8 regulates mossy fiber fasciculation and targeting, influencing axonal growth and synaptogenesis. It is involved in the stabilization of presynaptic vesicle aggregates, ensuring proper synaptic development and function (Bekirov2007Cadherin‐8). In sensory pathways, CDH8 is essential for synaptic transmission related to cold sensation, facilitating synaptic coupling between cold-sensitive sensory neurons and their targets in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Suzuki2007Cadherin8). The protein's role in synaptic organization and function is critical for maintaining proper neural circuitry and sensory processing.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDH8 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and learning disabilities. Rare familial microdeletions in the 16q21 region, which disrupt the CDH8 gene, have been associated with increased susceptibility to these conditions. These microdeletions are not fully penetrant, indicating that other genetic factors may influence the expression of ASD and learning disabilities in individuals with CDH8 deletions (Pagnamenta2010Rare).

The CDH8 gene is expressed in various parts of the human brain, particularly during early brain development, and is involved in synaptic localization and dendritic arborization. Disruptions in CDH8 can lead to defects in synapse assembly and plasticity, which are critical for proper neuronal development and function. This disruption is thought to contribute to the cognitive abnormalities observed in ASD and learning disabilities (Friedman2014Cadherin‐8).

In addition to genetic deletions, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDH8, such as rs145143780 (Y572C), have been identified as potentially damaging, affecting protein stabilization and function. These SNPs may further contribute to the risk of developing ASD (Rezaeirad2024Evaluation).
