# TRPT1

## Overview
The TRPT1 gene encodes the enzyme tRNA phosphotransferase 1, which is a critical component in the tRNA splicing pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphotransferase and is involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, facilitating their maturation and functionality in protein synthesis. The TRPT1 gene is expressed primarily in the nucleus, where it executes its role in tRNA processing, although its activity is also observed in the cytoplasm. The enzyme's function is NAD-dependent, linking it to the broader ADP-ribosylation system, which is implicated in various cellular processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Despite its essential role in tRNA maturation, studies suggest that TRPT1 may not be indispensable for organismal viability, hinting at possible compensatory mechanisms within mammalian systems (Yang2020The; Schmidt2019tRNA).

## Function
The TRPT1 gene encodes the tRNA phosphotransferase 1 enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the final step of tRNA splicing in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for transferring the 2'-phosphate from ligated tRNA to NAD+, resulting in the formation of ADP-ribose 1''-2'' cyclic phosphate and the release of mature tRNA. This process is essential for the maturation of tRNA molecules, which are critical for protein synthesis as they serve as carriers of amino acids and facilitate the translation of mRNA into proteins (Yang2020The).

TRPT1 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it participates in tRNA processing, although its activity is also noted in the cytoplasm, where tRNA maturation occurs (Yang2020The). Despite its significant role in tRNA splicing, knockout studies in mice suggest that TRPT1 may not be essential for viability, indicating potential redundancy or compensatory mechanisms in mammals (Schmidt2019tRNA). The enzyme's activity is NAD-dependent, and it is involved in the ADP-ribosylation system, a post-translational modification that regulates various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair and cell cycle progression (Yang2020The).
