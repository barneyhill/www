# USP27X

## Overview
USP27X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 27 X-linked, a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. This protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, which is essential for its role in removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability and function. USP27X is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, immune response, and signal transduction, by modulating the ubiquitination status of key proteins. It interacts with several proteins, such as Bim and RIG-I, influencing pathways related to cell death and antiviral signaling. The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its interactions and stability. Mutations in the USP27X gene have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in both neurodevelopmental and oncogenic contexts (Weber2016The; Koch2024USP27Xvariants; Xing2023Phosphorylation).

## Structure
The USP27X protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, which is crucial for its function as a deubiquitinating enzyme. This domain is composed of three subregions: the fingers, the palm, and the thumb. These subregions are involved in accommodating ubiquitin, with the palm and thumb playing a key role in catalyzing ubiquitin cleavage (Koch2024USP27Xvariants). The protein's structure is conserved within the USP family, although individual members can exhibit modulated deubiquitinating activity due to specific allosteric regulation (Koch2024USP27Xvariants).

The USP27X protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interactions and stability. For instance, phosphorylation by GSK3β enhances USP27X's interaction with CBX2, stabilizing the CBX2 protein, which is significant in cancer progression (Xing2023Phosphorylation). The protein is also known to interact with other proteins, such as Bim, where it stabilizes the phosphorylated form of Bim EL, reducing its ubiquitination and enhancing apoptosis (Weber2016The).

Variants in USP27X, such as those associated with X-linked intellectual disability, can disrupt its structure and function, affecting protein-protein interactions and catalytic activity (Koch2024USP27Xvariants). These disruptions highlight the importance of the USP domain and its structural integrity for the protein's biological roles.

## Function
USP27X is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins. In healthy human cells, USP27X is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and modulating signal transduction pathways. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular functions (Weber2016The).

One of the primary functions of USP27X is its role in the innate immune response. It acts as a negative regulator of antiviral signaling by deubiquitinating RIG-I, a receptor that requires K63-linked ubiquitination for activation. By removing these polyubiquitin chains, USP27X attenuates RIG-I-mediated signaling, helping to maintain immune homeostasis (Tao2020USP27X).

USP27X also plays a significant role in apoptosis by stabilizing the BH3-only protein Bim. It counteracts the degradation of Bim induced by the ERK signaling pathway, enhancing its pro-apoptotic effects. This stabilization is crucial in regulating cell death pathways, particularly in the context of oncogenic signaling (Weber2016The).

Additionally, USP27X interacts with TRIM28 to regulate cFLIP L protein levels, influencing apoptosis through the death-receptor-induced pathway. This interaction enhances caspase-8 activation, promoting apoptosis in certain cellular contexts (Dold2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USP27X gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. In breast cancer, USP27X plays a significant role in tumor progression by stabilizing chromobox protein homolog 2 (CBX2) through deubiquitination. The phosphorylation of USP27X by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) enhances its stability and oncogenic functions, leading to increased CBX2 levels. This interaction is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, suggesting that the GSK3β-USP27X-CBX2 axis is a critical driver of malignant progression (Xing2023Phosphorylation).

In the realm of neurodevelopmental disorders, mutations in USP27X are implicated in X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Specific variants, such as missense and stop-gain mutations, disrupt the protein's function, affecting its catalytic activity and protein-protein interactions. These mutations are linked to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other behavioral issues, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of disorders associated with USP27X (Koch2024USP27Xvariants). The clinical significance of these mutations underscores the importance of USP27X in both cancer biology and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
USP27X is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with various proteins, influencing their stability and function. It interacts with the E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM28, which is crucial for regulating cFLIP L levels and apoptosis induction. This interaction is confirmed in WM1158, 1205Lu, and 293FT cells (Dold2022The). USP27X also interacts with RIG-I, a key protein in antiviral signaling, through its CARDs. This interaction is essential for inhibiting the activation of IFNβ, ISRE, and NF-κB following viral infection (Tao2020USP27X).

USP27X forms complexes with ATXN7L3, which is important for histone H2B deubiquitylation and cell proliferation. Variants in USP27X can impair this interaction, affecting its function (Koch2024USP27Xvariants). It also interacts with the BH3-only protein Bim, stabilizing it by reducing its ubiquitination, which enhances apoptosis (Weber2016The).

In breast cancer, USP27X interacts with CBX2, enhancing its stability through deubiquitination. This interaction is regulated by GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of USP27X, which is crucial for CBX2's oncogenic functions (Xing2023Phosphorylation).
