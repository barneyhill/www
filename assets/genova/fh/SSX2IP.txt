# SSX2IP

## Overview
SSX2IP, or SSX family member 2 interacting protein, is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes a centriolar satellite protein involved in critical cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and centrosome regulation. The SSX2IP protein, characterized by its coiled-coil domains and various post-translational modification sites, plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of primary cilia by interacting with proteins like PCM-1 and Cep290, which are essential for ciliary membrane protein targeting and ciliary structure maintenance (de2002The; Klinger2014The). Beyond its role in ciliogenesis, SSX2IP is also implicated in centrosome maturation and spindle assembly during cell division, contributing to genomic stability (Chang2020Expression). Clinically, alterations in SSX2IP expression have been linked to various cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hwang2024Discovery; Chang2020Expression).

## Structure
The SSX2IP protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 1 and consists of 614 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 71 kDa (de2002The). The protein is rich in glutamic acid, leucine, and serine residues, which contribute to its potential to form alpha helices and coiled-coil domains (de2002The). Specifically, four potential coiled-coil domains are identified at positions 117-229, 258-287, 373-410, and 423-456 (de2002The). 

SSX2IP contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) between amino acids 285 and 300, and a phosphate-binding motif (P-loop) between amino acids 240 and 247 (de2002The). The protein also has potential sites for N-glycosylation, various protein kinase phosphorylations, N-myristoylation, and amidation, indicating a range of post-translational modifications that may regulate its function (de2002The).

In terms of its quaternary structure, SSX2IP interacts directly with the SSX2 protein, and this interaction is crucial for its localization and function within the nucleus (de2002The). The SSX2IP protein is also involved in interactions with other proteins such as PCM-1, which is important for its role in ciliogenesis (Klinger2014The).

## Function
SSX2IP (SSX family member 2 interacting protein) is a centriolar satellite protein that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and centrosome regulation in healthy human cells. It localizes to the basal body of primary cilia, where it is essential for the recruitment of the ciliopathy-associated protein Cep290, which is crucial for gating proteins to the ciliary compartment (Klinger2014The). SSX2IP interacts with the centriolar satellite protein PCM-1, and its stability is dependent on PCM-1, highlighting an interdependent relationship crucial for cilia assembly and function (Klinger2014The).

SSX2IP is involved in the targeting and accumulation of ciliary membrane proteins, such as the somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), and is necessary for the proper assembly and function of the BBSome complex, which targets membrane proteins to primary cilia (Klinger2014The). It also facilitates the ciliary entry of Rab8, a key regulator of ciliary targeting, and is implicated in the maintenance of ciliary structure and function (Klinger2014The).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, SSX2IP is involved in centrosome maturation and spindle assembly during cell division, contributing to accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability (Chang2020Expression). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may also play a role in nuclear architecture (de2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SSX2IP gene have been implicated in several cancers. In papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), mutations in SSX2IP are associated with a 100% frequency of metastasis, indicating a strong link to poor clinical outcomes and higher mortality rates (Hwang2024Discovery). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), SSX2IP is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes. High SSX2IP expression is an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival and metastasis-free survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chang2020Expression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SSX2IP overexpression enhances cell migration, invasion, and chemotherapeutic resistance, contributing to metastasis and reduced drug sensitivity. This overexpression is linked to larger tumor size and shorter survival times in patients (Li2013SSX2IP). SSX2IP is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it counteracts the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-338-3p, promoting cancer progression (Li2013Epigenetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SSX2IP in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SSX2IP, also known as SSX family member 2 interacting protein, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the Wilms tumor-1-interacting protein (Wtip), specifically binding to the N-terminal domain of Wtip. This interaction is important for cell junction remodeling and morphogenetic processes during neural tube closure (Reis2021Identification). SSX2IP also interacts with the SSX2 protein, a member of the SSX gene family, through its N-terminal domain. This interaction is characterized by a fine-speckled nuclear pattern, suggesting a specific subcellular localization and potential involvement in nuclear processes (de2002The).

SSX2IP is a centriolar satellite protein that plays a role in ciliogenesis. It interacts with PCM-1, another centriolar satellite protein, and this interaction is essential for the localization and stability of both proteins at basal bodies. SSX2IP also facilitates the recruitment of Cep290 to the ciliary transition zone, which is crucial for the assembly and function of primary cilia (Klinger2014The). These interactions highlight the role of SSX2IP in maintaining proper ciliary function and protein targeting within the ciliary compartment (Klinger2014The).
