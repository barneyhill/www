# MYO9A

## Overview
MYO9A is a gene that encodes the unconventional myosin IXA protein, a motor protein involved in various cellular processes. Myosin IXA is characterized by its actin-based motor activity and ATPase function, which are essential for regulating actin filament organization and intracellular transport. This protein is distinguished by its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain, which plays a critical role in modulating RhoA activity and, consequently, actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell signaling pathways (Omelchenko2012MyosinIXA; Li2021RhoGTPase). MYO9A is implicated in maintaining cell-cell junctions, particularly in epithelial cells, and is crucial for processes such as morphogenesis and synaptic function. The gene's mutations have been linked to various diseases, including congenital myasthenic syndrome and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, underscoring its clinical significance (O’Connor2016Identification; Li2021RhoGTPase).

## Structure
The MYO9A gene encodes the unconventional myosin IXA protein, which is characterized by a unique molecular structure. The protein is composed of 2548 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 283 kDa (Gorman1999The). MYO9A features a conserved head domain that binds actin filaments and hydrolyzes ATP, generating force for movement (O’Connor2016Identification). This head domain shares 82% identity with myosin IXb and rat myr5, but includes unique insertions such as an 18-residue insertion in the head domain and a 32-residue insertion in the second flexible loop (Gorman1999The).

The neck region of MYO9A contains IQ motifs, which are sites for binding light chains like calmodulin, suggesting the potential to bind six light chains (Gorman1999The). The tail region is highly divergent and includes a Rho-GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) domain, which is crucial for inactivating small GTPases of the Rho family, such as RHOA (O’Connor2016Identification; Folci2016Myosin). This domain allows MYO9A to regulate actin dynamics and cell signaling pathways (Li2021RhoGTPase).

MYO9A is known to undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including a truncated version lacking the ATP binding domain (Gorman1999The). These structural features enable MYO9A to perform its roles in cellular processes such as axonal transport and synaptic function (Folci2016Myosin).

## Function
MYO9A, also known as myosin IXA, is a motor protein that plays a critical role in cellular processes by functioning as an actin-based motor with ATPase activity. It is involved in the regulation of actin filament organization and intracellular transport, impacting cell morphology and movement. MYO9A is particularly active at cell-cell junctions, where it regulates the assembly and stability of these structures by modulating RhoA activity through its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain (Omelchenko2012MyosinIXA; Liu2012Myosins).

In epithelial cells, MYO9A is essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesions during migration, contributing to processes such as morphogenesis, repair, and renewal. It localizes to nascent cell-cell contacts and is involved in the formation of junction-associated actin bundles, which are crucial for sustaining collective cell migration (Omelchenko2012MyosinIXA). MYO9A's Rho-GAP activity negatively regulates RhoA, preventing excessive contractility and ensuring proper actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Omelchenko2012MyosinIXA).

In the brain, MYO9A is crucial for the maturation of ependymal epithelial cells, and its deletion can lead to hydrocephalus due to ventricular system stenosis (Masters2016Myosins:). In the kidney, MYO9A is involved in maintaining the cytoskeletal structure and function of podocytes, which are essential for kidney function (Li2021RhoGTPase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO9A gene have been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its clinical significance. In congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS), MYO9A mutations disrupt neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function, leading to fatigable muscle weakness. These mutations affect motor neuron guidance and synaptic recycling, impacting acetylcholine release and contributing to CMS pathogenesis (O’Connor2016Identification). MYO9A is also associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease characterized by podocyte dysfunction. A specific nonsense mutation, p.Arg701*, results in Myo9A haploinsufficiency, disrupting actin dynamics and increasing RhoA activity, which impairs podocyte function and leads to FSGS (Li2021RhoGTPase).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), MYO9A expression levels are linked to prognosis, with lower expression associated with poorer outcomes. MYO9A is involved in maintaining epithelial cell polarity, and its downregulation may contribute to tumorigenesis by inducing loss of polarity and epithelial architecture (Zhan2024Integrated). These findings underscore the importance of MYO9A in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
MYO9A, also known as myosin IXA, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts with actin filaments, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell morphology. This interaction is crucial for maintaining podocyte function and glomerular permeability, as MYO9A regulates actin dynamics through its Rho-GTPase activating protein (Rho-GAP) domain (Li2021RhoGTPase).

In neurons, MYO9A localizes to the postsynaptic density (PSD) and directly interacts with the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR). This interaction is essential for synaptic structure and function, as demonstrated by increased PSD thickness and elevated levels of PSD95 and surface AMPARs in MYO9A-deficient mice (Folci2016Myosin). The binding of MYO9A to GluA2 was confirmed through biochemical assays, highlighting its role in synaptic signaling and plasticity (Folci2016Myosin).

MYO9A also interacts with calmodulin, which, along with actin, is crucial for actin cross-linking and bundling. Mutations in MYO9A can disrupt these interactions, leading to increased RhoA activity and impaired cellular functions, such as in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (Li2021RhoGTPase). These interactions underscore MYO9A's role in regulating cellular processes through its influence on the actin cytoskeleton and RhoA signaling pathways.
