# F2

## Overview
The F2 gene encodes prothrombin, a precursor to the serine protease thrombin, which plays a pivotal role in the blood coagulation process. Thrombin is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade, responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin, thereby forming the structural framework of blood clots. It also activates several other coagulation factors, amplifying the coagulation response and stabilizing the clot. Thrombin's activity extends beyond coagulation, influencing platelet activation and fibrinolysis, and is tightly regulated by inhibitors to prevent excessive clotting. Mutations in the F2 gene, such as the G20210A mutation, are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in thrombotic disorders (Seligsohn2001Genetic; Wolberg2007Thrombin; Neubauer2021Endothelial).

## Structure
The F2 gene encodes human α-thrombin, a serine protease crucial for blood coagulation. The molecular structure of thrombin is characterized by a prolate ellipsoid shape with dimensions of approximately 45 Å x 45 Å x 50 Å. It consists of A- and B-chains forming a single contiguous body with a highly furrowed surface. The structure includes two interacting six-stranded barrellike domains linked by four transdomain 'straps', five helical segments, and various surface-located turn structures (Bode1992The).

The primary structure of thrombin includes a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences, and its secondary structure features six antiparallel strands in each barrellike domain. The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, with a prominent active-site cleft running perpendicular to the junction between the barrels. The catalytic triad, consisting of Ser 195, His 57, and Asp 102, is located at this junction (Bode1992The).

Thrombin also contains a secondary binding exosite for fibrin(ogen), which is crucial for its function in coagulation. The structure is stabilized by electrostatic interactions, with a high proportion of charged residues forming a sandwichlike electrostatic potential (Bode1992The). The kringle domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are potential targets for developing anticoagulants (Chinnaraj2018Structure).

## Function
The F2 gene encodes prothrombin, which is converted into thrombin, a serine protease that plays a central role in the coagulation cascade. Thrombin is responsible for converting fibrinogen into fibrin, forming the structural basis of blood clots, which is crucial for hemostasis and wound healing (Wolberg2007Thrombin; Neubauer2021Endothelial). Thrombin also activates several other coagulation factors, including factors V, VIII, and XI, which amplify the coagulation response and stabilize the clot (Wolberg2007Thrombin; Neubauer2021Endothelial).

In addition to its role in coagulation, thrombin influences platelet activation by interacting with protease-activated receptors (PAR1 and PAR4) on platelets, promoting platelet aggregation and the release of von Willebrand factor, which is essential for stable clot formation (Neubauer2021Endothelial). Thrombin also plays a role in fibrinolysis by activating factor XIII, which cross-links fibrin, enhancing clot stability and elasticity (Wolberg2007Thrombin).

Thrombin's activity is tightly regulated by inhibitors such as antithrombin III and thrombomodulin, which prevent excessive coagulation and maintain vascular integrity (Neubauer2021Endothelial). This regulation is crucial for preventing thrombotic diseases and ensuring proper blood flow (Neubauer2021Endothelial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F2 gene, which encodes prothrombin, are clinically significant due to their association with increased risk of thrombosis. The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene is a well-documented risk factor for venous thrombosis. This mutation leads to elevated plasma prothrombin levels, enhancing thrombin generation and impairing the inactivation of factor Va by activated protein C, which can result in venous thrombosis (Poort1996A; Seligsohn2001Genetic). The G20210A mutation is particularly prevalent among individuals of European descent and is rare in Asian and African populations (Doggen1998Geographic).

Individuals with the G20210A mutation are at increased risk for conditions such as deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially when combined with other risk factors like surgery, immobilization, or pregnancy (Seligsohn2001Genetic). The mutation also interacts with hyperhomocysteinemia, further elevating the risk of thrombosis (Seligsohn2001Genetic). In women, the use of oral contraceptives or hormone-replacement therapy can significantly increase the risk of venous thrombosis if they carry the G20210A mutation (Seligsohn2001Genetic).

Other mutations, such as the F2 20209*T mutation found in Jewish-Moroccan individuals, are associated with thrombophilia and obstetric complications, including fetal loss and infertility (DANCKWARDT2006The). These mutations affect the 3' end processing of the F2 gene, leading to increased prothrombin expression and contributing to the risk of thrombosis and related complications (DANCKWARDT2006The).

## Interactions
The F2 gene encodes prothrombin, which is converted into thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. Thrombin interacts with several proteins to regulate blood coagulation. It binds to fibrinogen, converting it into fibrin to form blood clots. Thrombin also activates factors V, VIII, and XI, which further enhance the coagulation process. Additionally, thrombin interacts with thrombomodulin, a receptor on endothelial cells, to initiate the activation of protein C, an anticoagulant pathway (Chinnaraj2018Structure).

Prothrombin fragment 2 (F2) retains the ability to bind thrombin after cleavage, influencing thrombin's function by slowing its inactivation by antithrombin and altering its catalytic site environment. This interaction modulates thrombin's activity, including its esterolytic and clotting activities, and affects calcium dependence in protein C activation (Liaw1998Localization).

Mutations in the F2 gene, such as p.R541W, can lead to antithrombin resistance, increasing the risk of thrombosis by impairing thrombin inactivation. This mutation affects the sodium binding region of thrombin, which is crucial for its interaction with antithrombin (Tang2020A).
