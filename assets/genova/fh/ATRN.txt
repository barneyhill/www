# ATRN

## Overview
The ATRN gene encodes the attractin protein, a multifunctional type I glycosylated transmembrane protein involved in various biological processes, including immune modulation and neural development. Attractin is characterized by its complex structure, which includes domains such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) sequences, CUB domains, and C-type lectin domains, contributing to its role in cell signaling and immune responses (Nakadate2008Attractinmahogany; Li2009Attractin). The gene produces two isoforms: a secreted form and a transmembrane form, with the latter being highly conserved across species (Walker2007Genetic). Attractin is implicated in the regulation of melanocortin signaling pathways, affecting pigmentation and energy homeostasis, and is essential for myelination in the nervous system (Gunn2000MahoganyAttractin; Kuramoto2001AttractinMahoganyZitter). Mutations in ATRN are associated with neurological disorders and pigmentation changes, highlighting its significance in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and immune function (Ehara2021Attractin; Walker2007Genetic).

## Structure
The Attractin (ATRN) protein is a type I glycosylated transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes several important motifs: epidermal growth factor (EGF) sequence, CUB domain, cytokine receptor signature motif, C-type lectin domain, and laminin-type EGF domains (Li2009Attractin). The protein is heavily glycosylated, with 26 potential N-glycosylation sites, contributing to its molecular weight of approximately 134 kDa (DukeCohan1998Attractin). 

The ATRN gene encodes two isoforms: a secreted form and a transmembrane form. The secreted form results from splicing into a LINE-1 retrotransposon element, a feature not found in mice (Walker2007Genetic). The transmembrane form is conserved across species, with the mouse Atrn protein being 93% identical to the human transmembrane form (Li2009Attractin). 

The tertiary structure of ATRN includes domains such as the serine protease catalytic domain, EGF-like motifs, and a C-type lectin domain, which are crucial for its function in cell signaling and immune response (Nakadate2008Attractinmahogany). The protein's structure is similar to the nematode F33C8.1 perlecan-like protein, although it lacks certain motifs present in F33C8.1 (DukeCohan1998Attractin).

## Function
Attractin (ATRN) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune cell interactions and neural development. In the immune system, ATRN is secreted by activated T lymphocytes and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. It enhances the proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to recall antigens and facilitates the attachment of lymphocytes to macrophage-like cells, promoting cell-cell interactions essential for immune function (DukeCohan1998Attractin).

ATRN is also implicated in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and proteoglycan deposition. In attractin-deficient mice, there is a significant loss of ECM components, suggesting that ATRN is involved in the secretion and deposition of these materials, which are vital for maintaining organ structure and function (Azouz2020Postdevelopmental).

In the nervous system, ATRN is essential for myelination, a process critical for proper nerve function. Mutations in the ATRN gene can lead to hypomyelination and neurodegeneration, highlighting its role in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and protecting against oxidative stress (Ehara2016The; Kuramoto2001AttractinMahoganyZitter). ATRN's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both immune regulation and neural health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATRN gene have been linked to several neurological and physiological conditions. In rats, the zitter (zi) mutation, characterized by an 8-base pair deletion at a splice donor site of the ATRN gene, leads to hypomyelination and vacuolation in the central nervous system (CNS). This results in early-onset tremor and progressive flaccid paresis, highlighting the gene's critical role in myelination (Kuramoto2001AttractinMahoganyZitter). Similarly, mahogany (mg) mice with mutations at the ATRN locus exhibit CNS hypomyelination and body tremor, suggesting a shared pathway in myelination disorders (Kuramoto2001AttractinMahoganyZitter).

In humans, ATRN mutations are associated with pigmentation changes and neurological issues. ATRN null mutant mice display a pleiotropic phenotype, including dark fur, juvenile-onset spongiform neurodegeneration, hypomyelination, tremor, and reduced body weight, indicating the gene's involvement in neuronal homeostasis and energy metabolism (Walker2007Genetic). The absence of ATRN can lead to neurodegeneration, which can be partially rescued by over-expression of the related ATRNL1 gene, suggesting some functional redundancy (Walker2007Genetic).

ATRN deficiency also affects muscle morphology and metabolism, particularly in slow-twitch muscles, leading to muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ehara2021Attractin). These findings underscore the gene's broad impact on both neurological and muscular systems.

## Interactions
Attractin (ATRN) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its biological functions. ATRN is suggested to act as a low-affinity co-receptor for the Agouti signaling protein (ASP), which binds to the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r). This interaction is implicated in the regulation of melanocortin signaling pathways, affecting pigmentation and energy homeostasis (Gunn2000MahoganyAttractin). ATRN may also interact with melanocortin receptors Mc3R and Mc4R in the hypothalamus, influencing feeding behavior and energy metabolism (Nakadate2008Attractinmahogany).

In the immune system, ATRN is secreted by activated human T lymphocytes and modulates immune cell interactions. It binds specifically to leukocytes, with a higher affinity for activated T cells, and facilitates the clustering of nonproliferating T lymphocytes and the spreading of monocytes (DukeCohan1998Attractin). ATRN's structure includes several domains that suggest potential interactions with other proteins, such as a serine protease catalytic motif and EGF-like domains, which may be involved in its role in immune responses (DukeCohan1998Attractin).

These interactions highlight ATRN's role in both immune modulation and melanocortin signaling, suggesting its involvement in complex multiprotein networks and signaling pathways.
