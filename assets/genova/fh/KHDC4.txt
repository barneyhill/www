# KHDC4

## Overview
KHDC4 is a gene that encodes the KH domain containing 4, a pre-mRNA splicing factor protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of RNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression. The protein is characterized by the presence of a KH domain, which facilitates RNA binding and is integral to the assembly of spliceosomes, the complexes responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. This splicing activity is essential for the production of mature mRNA molecules, which are subsequently translated into proteins, thereby influencing cellular function and homeostasis. KHDC4 is predominantly active in the cell nucleus, where it ensures the fidelity of gene expression through its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing. Research has highlighted its significance in cancer biology, particularly in prostate cancer, where it has implications for prognosis and immunotherapy (Wang2024Multiomics). Additionally, KHDC4's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids suggest its participation in complex regulatory networks within the cell (Shan2021SNORA42; Hadarovich2023PICNIC).

## Function
KHDC4, also known as the pre-mRNA splicing factor, plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression. It contains a KH domain, which is known for its ability to bind RNA, facilitating its involvement in the assembly of spliceosomes. This assembly is essential for the maturation and stability of mRNA, influencing the proper expression of genes within the cell.

KHDC4 is active in the cell nucleus, where it participates in the intricate process of pre-mRNA splicing. This process is vital for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts, allowing for the generation of mature mRNA molecules that can be translated into functional proteins. By influencing spliceosome assembly, KHDC4 ensures the accurate processing of pre-mRNA, which is critical for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis.

While the primary focus of research has been on KHDC4's role in cancer, particularly in prostate cancer prognosis and immunotherapy, its fundamental function in healthy cells involves maintaining the integrity of gene expression through its splicing activities (Wang2024Multiomics). The protein's activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in the regulation of gene expression at the molecular level.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KHDC4, also known as a pre-mRNA splicing factor, is involved in RNA processing and splicing. It contains a KH domain, which is known for binding RNA. KHDC4 interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, participating in multiprotein complexes essential for pre-mRNA splicing and regulation of gene expression. The PICNIC model has predicted KHDC4's localization to nuclear bodies, suggesting its potential involvement in nuclear condensates, which are dynamic assemblies of proteins and nucleic acids (Hadarovich2023PICNIC).

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), KHDC4 is the host gene for SNORA42, an H/ACA box snoRNA. Although SNORA42 overexpression or knockdown has limited effects on KHDC4 mRNA and protein levels, both are increased in ESCC tissues. This indicates a potential interaction between KHDC4 and the DHX9 protein, as DHX9 is involved in the transcription process of KHDC4. KHDC4 pre-mRNA and mRNA are enriched by DHX9 protein, suggesting a transcriptional interaction, although the direct interaction of KHDC4 protein with other proteins is not detailed (Shan2021SNORA42).
