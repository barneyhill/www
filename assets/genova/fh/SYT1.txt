# SYT1

## Overview
The SYT1 gene encodes synaptotagmin 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. Synaptotagmin 1 is characterized by its two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are essential for its function as a calcium sensor in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. These domains facilitate the rapid fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, a process critical for efficient synaptic transmission (Maximov2005Autonomous; Geppert1994Synaptotagmin). The protein's ability to bind calcium ions through its C2 domains triggers neurotransmitter release, making it integral to both synchronous and asynchronous synaptic activity (Maximov2005Autonomous; Xu2009Synaptotagmin1). Mutations in the SYT1 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal synaptic function (Melland2021Expanding; Cornelisse2023A).

## Structure
Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) is a protein characterized by a transmembrane domain, a linker region, and two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are crucial for its function in neurotransmitter release. The C2 domains are connected by a flexible linker, allowing them to adopt various orientations relative to each other (Herrick2009Solution). These domains bind calcium ions, with C2A binding three and C2B binding two, facilitating interactions with anionic phospholipids in membranes (Evans2016Functional).

The C2 domains exhibit a β-sandwich structure, with loops at the top and bottom, similar to the C2 domain of phospholipase C-δ1 (Shao1998Solution). The Ca2+-binding site is a cup-like cavity formed by loops, with key acidic residues such as Asp-178, Asp-230, and Asp-232 playing a crucial role in binding (Sutton1995Structure). The C2 domains can exist in 'open' or 'closed' conformations, with the 'closed' state involving inter-domain interactions (Evans2016Functional).

In the membrane-bound state, the C2 domains of SYT1 are oriented such that their Ca2+ and membrane-binding surfaces face opposite directions, suggesting a role in bridging vesicle and plasma membranes (Herrick2009Solution). The protein's structure is maintained by a conserved core motif, termed the C2 key, which is a signature of the C2 domain family (Sutton1995Structure).

## Function
Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) is a critical protein involved in neurotransmitter release at synapses, acting primarily as a calcium sensor. It facilitates the rapid fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, a process essential for efficient synaptic transmission. SYT1 is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it plays a vital role in both synchronous and asynchronous neurotransmitter release (Maximov2005Autonomous; Geppert1994Synaptotagmin).

SYT1's function is highly dependent on its ability to bind calcium through its C2 domains, which triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to neurotransmitter release. This calcium-dependent mechanism is crucial for the fast, synchronous release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Maximov2005Autonomous; Xu2009Synaptotagmin1). In addition to its role in evoked release, SYT1 also regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release, acting as a negative regulator to clamp spontaneous release events (BouazzaArostegui2022Deconstructing).

SYT1 interacts with other synaptic proteins, such as SNARE complexes, to mediate vesicle docking and exocytosis, although it is not essential for the basic exocytotic machinery or calcium-independent release mechanisms (Geppert1994Synaptotagmin). Its expression levels are critical for maintaining normal synaptic function, with alterations leading to impaired synaptic release efficiency (BouazzaArostegui2022Deconstructing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYT1 gene, which encodes synaptotagmin-1, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders are characterized by symptoms such as severe intellectual disability, movement disorders, behavioral disturbances, and EEG abnormalities (Melland2021Expanding). Specific missense mutations in the C2B domain of SYT1, such as Pro401Leu (P401L), have been linked to developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. This mutation leads to increased asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release, disrupting the precise timing of neurotransmission (Cornelisse2023A).

The SYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder, also known as Baker-Gordon syndrome, includes symptoms like infantile hypotonia, ophthalmic abnormalities, sleep disturbances, and hyperkinetic movements (Cesaroni2023Expanding). Mutations in SYT1 can impair synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis, affecting synaptic function and leading to clinical phenotypes such as developmental delays and motor deficits (Riggs2022SYT1Associated; Baker2018SYT1-associated).

Research has shown that these mutations can act in a dominant-negative manner, disrupting neurotransmitter release even when mutant SYT1 is expressed alongside the wild-type protein (Bradberry2020Molecular). Understanding these genotype-phenotype correlations is crucial for targeted clinical management of patients with SYT1-associated disorders (Riggs2022SYT1Associated).

## Interactions
Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) is known to interact with presenilin 1 (PS1), a component of the γ-secretase complex, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction is particularly significant at synaptic terminals, where PS1 co-localizes with SYT1. The interaction is enhanced by calcium influx, which modulates PS1 conformation and activity, linking calcium signaling, synaptic function, and amyloid beta production (Kuzuya2016Identification). The N-terminal fragment of PS1 serves as the primary binding site for SYT1, and this interaction is crucial for maintaining synaptic vesicle exocytosis and trafficking (Kuzuya2016Identification; Zoltowska2017Dynamic).

Inhibition of the PS1-SYT1 interaction affects synaptic vesicle morphology and reduces dendritic spine density, which is particularly relevant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, where a decrease in SYT1 levels and disrupted PS1-SYT1 interactions are observed (Zoltowska2017Dynamic). SYT1 also plays a role in modulating the γ-secretase complex's activity, influencing amyloid precursor protein processing and amyloid beta production (Kuzuya2016Identification). These interactions highlight SYT1's role in synaptic physiology and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.
