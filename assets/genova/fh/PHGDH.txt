# PHGDH

## Overview
The PHGDH gene encodes the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which is a key player in the phosphorylated pathway of L-serine biosynthesis. This enzyme is classified as an oxidoreductase and is primarily located in the cytosol, where it catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, the first committed step in L-serine production. L-serine is a non-essential amino acid that is vital for numerous cellular processes, including protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and the synthesis of other amino acids and nucleotides (Tabatabaie2009Novel; Yoshida2004Targeted). The enzyme's activity is particularly crucial in the central nervous system, where it supports the synthesis of L-serine in glial cells, which is then supplied to neurons (Yang2010Brainspecific). PHGDH's role extends beyond metabolism, as it interacts with other proteins to influence cell fate under metabolic stress, such as low glucose conditions (Wu2023Low). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurometabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2016High; Pind2002V490M).

## Structure
The human PHGDH protein is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the phosphorylated pathway for de novo L-serine synthesis. Its primary structure consists of 533 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 56.8 kDa (Murtas2021Biochemical). The secondary structure of PHGDH is predominantly composed of α-helices, accounting for about 62% of its structure, with a smaller proportion of β-sheets (5%) (Murtas2021Biochemical). 

PHGDH's tertiary structure includes several domains: the substrate-binding domain, the cofactor-binding domain, and two additional regulatory domains at the C terminus, known as the ACT (aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA prephenate dehydrogenase) and ASB (allosteric substrate-binding) domains (Murtas2021Biochemical). These domains contribute to the enzyme's function and stability, with the ACT domain in some species acting as a serine binding site for feedback inhibition, although this is not evident in human PHGDH (Murtas2021Biochemical).

In terms of quaternary structure, PHGDH functions as a homotetramer, with the potential to form octamers in the presence of phosphate ions (Murtas2021Biochemical). The enzyme's activity and stability are influenced by its oligomeric state, with dimerization being crucial for its enzymatic function (Xu2021Dimerization). The dimeric form is essential for catalytic activity, as it facilitates substrate binding and maintains the correct conformation for catalysis (Xu2021Dimerization).

## Function
The PHGDH gene encodes the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, which plays a critical role in the phosphorylated pathway of L-serine biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, marking the first committed step in the production of L-serine, an amino acid essential for various cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cell proliferation, and the production of other amino acids and nucleotides (Tabatabaie2009Novel; Yoshida2004Targeted).

In healthy human cells, PHGDH is primarily active in the cytosol and is crucial for rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the brain. It is particularly important in the central nervous system, where L-serine does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier, necessitating its synthesis within the brain. Glial cells, especially astrocytes, express PHGDH, providing L-serine to neurons, which rely on this supply for survival and function (Yang2010Brainspecific).

PHGDH also interacts with other proteins under specific conditions, such as low glucose availability, where it forms a complex with AXIN, HIPK2, and p53, leading to the activation of p53 and promoting apoptosis. This highlights its role in regulating cell fate in response to metabolic changes (Wu2023Low).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PHGDH gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurometabolic disorders. In cancer, PHGDH is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in various types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. In NSCLC, high PHGDH expression is linked to advanced stages and reduced survival rates (Zhu2016High; Li20213Phosphoglycerate). In pancreatic cancer, PHGDH overexpression is associated with larger tumor size and metastasis, serving as an independent prognostic marker (Song2018PHGDH). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative subtypes, PHGDH is linked to poor outcomes (Zhao2021A).

PHGDH mutations, such as the V490M mutation, are associated with 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency, a condition characterized by congenital microcephaly, severe psychomotor retardation, and seizures. This mutation leads to decreased enzyme activity due to impaired folding and increased degradation of the enzyme (Pind2002V490M). These findings underscore the importance of PHGDH as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment and highlight the need for genetic screening in suspected cases of serine biosynthesis deficiency.

## Interactions
PHGDH (phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase) is known to form oligomeric structures, including monomers, dimers, and tetramers, with its enzymatic activity being highly dependent on the dimeric form. The dimerization of PHGDH is crucial for its catalytic function, as it facilitates substrate binding and maintains the correct conformation for enzyme catalysis. Mutations that disrupt dimer formation result in a significant loss of enzymatic activity, highlighting the importance of intersubunit interactions for the enzyme's function (Xu2021Dimerization).

The enzyme's dimer interface contains hotspot residues that are essential for dimer stability and enzymatic function. These residues are involved in forming conserved salt bridges that stabilize the dimeric structure and may play a role in catalysis by stabilizing transition-state conformations (Xu2021Dimerization).

PHGDH also interacts with the compound withaferin A (WA), which covalently binds to the Cys295 residue of PHGDH. This interaction induces an allosteric effect, affecting the enzyme's substrate-binding domain and increasing its flexibility. The binding of WA to PHGDH has been shown to inhibit its enzymatic activity, suggesting a regulatory interaction that could be exploited for therapeutic purposes (Chen2022Identification).
