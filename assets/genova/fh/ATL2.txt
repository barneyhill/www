# ATL2

## Overview
ATL2, or atlastin GTPase 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases, specifically involved in the maintenance and dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. The protein product, atlastin GTPase 2, is characterized by its role in homotypic membrane fusion, which is essential for forming and stabilizing the tubular ER network. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane GTPase due to its structural features, including an N-terminal GTPase domain, a middle domain, and two transmembrane segments (Hu2015Human; MorinLeisk2011An). Atlastin GTPase 2 is crucial for various cellular processes, such as protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, by ensuring proper ER morphology and function. It also plays a role in maintaining Golgi apparatus morphology and is implicated in calcium signaling regulation in neurons (Ramírez2021Ryanodine; Rismanchi2008Atlastin). Mutations and alterations in ATL2 have been associated with diseases such as breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Reynisdottir2023High; Liu2022MiR30e5p).

## Structure
ATL2 (atlastin GTPase 2) is a member of the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases, characterized by a specific domain structure that includes an N-terminal GTPase domain, a middle domain forming a three-helix bundle, two transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal tail (Hu2015Human). The GTPase domain is globular and similar to that of GBP1, facilitating nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, which are crucial for its function in membrane fusion (Byrnes2011Structural; MorinLeisk2011An).

The middle domain of ATL2 is essential for its activity, with specific residues such as E380, L384, K433, K434, M435, F440, and Y444 playing critical roles in its function (MorinLeisk2011An). These residues are involved in forming a head-to-head dimer interface, stabilized by an intramolecular salt bridge between K372 and E380, which is crucial for the postfusion conformation necessary for membrane fusion (MorinLeisk2011An).

ATL2 undergoes conformational changes upon GTP binding, transitioning from a prefusion to a postfusion state, which involves a 90° rotation and crossover of the middle domains (MorinLeisk2011An). This structural transition is essential for its role in maintaining the endoplasmic reticulum network morphology (MorinLeisk2011An).

## Function
ATL2 (atlastin GTPase 2) is a crucial protein involved in the maintenance and dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network in human cells. It plays a significant role in the homotypic fusion of ER membranes, which is essential for forming and stabilizing the tubular ER network. This process is dependent on GTP hydrolysis, which facilitates the fusion of ER membranes and maintains the integrity of the ER network (Hu2015Human; Wang2016Cooperation).

In healthy cells, ATL2 is predominantly localized to the tubular ER, where it interacts with other ER-shaping proteins such as reticulons and DP1. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the ER network, as they help form interconnections within the tubular ER (Hu2009A). The protein's activity is vital for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, by ensuring proper ER morphology and function (Pawar2017Efficient).

ATL2's role extends to the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in maintaining Golgi morphology. Knockdown of ATL2 leads to significant changes in Golgi structure, although it does not impair protein trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, indicating its specific role in organelle morphology rather than general trafficking (Rismanchi2008Atlastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATL2 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. High expression of the ATL2-2 variant is linked to a worse prognosis in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. This overexpression is associated with shorter breast cancer-specific survival and is correlated with aggressive tumor characteristics such as larger size, higher grade, and basal-like molecular subtype (Reynisdottir2023High). The ATL2-2 variant is also involved in the upregulation of cancer driver pathways, including MYC targets, E2F targets, and G2M checkpoint genes, which promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Reynisdottir2023High).

In rheumatoid arthritis, the microRNA miR-30e-5p regulates ATL2 expression. Increased miR-30e-5p levels in rheumatoid arthritis tissues lead to higher ATL2 expression, contributing to inflammation. Knockdown of miR-30e-5p reduces inflammatory markers, suggesting that miR-30e-5p and ATL2 interactions play a role in the inflammatory response associated with this condition (Liu2022MiR30e5p).

ATL2 has also been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, where increased expression has been observed in both mouse models and patients (Reynisdottir2023High). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ATL2 in various diseases.

## Interactions
ATL2 (atlastin GTPase 2) is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. It forms homomeric complexes in vivo, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies, where antibodies specific to atlastin-2 co-precipitate only atlastin-2, indicating strong homomeric interactions (Rismanchi2008Atlastin). Although atlastin-2 does not interact with the microtubule-severing AAA ATPase spastin, unlike atlastin-1, it is involved in ER and Golgi morphology, suggesting interactions with other proteins that influence these structures (Rismanchi2008Atlastin).

ATL2 is also implicated in the regulation of calcium signaling in neurons. Mutations in ATL2, such as ATL2-L384D and ATL2-Y444A, affect the localization and function of IP3R1 and RyR2 channels, which are involved in calcium release from the ER. These mutations lead to altered distribution and clustering of RyR2 channels, indicating that ATL2's GTPase activity is crucial for maintaining proper ER morphology and the spatial arrangement of calcium channels (Ramírez2021Ryanodine).

The protein's role in ER network branching is supported by its ability to form dimers in a GTP-bound state, facilitated by a critical intramolecular salt bridge between residues K372 and E380, which is essential for its function in ER network branching (MorinLeisk2011An).
