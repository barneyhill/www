# C2orf76

## Overview
C2orf76 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 76. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely undefined. However, emerging research suggests that the C2orf76 protein may play a role in cancer biology, particularly in the context of pancreatic cancer, where it has been associated with promoting cell invasion and proliferation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite its potential clinical significance, the protein's structure and interactions are not well-documented, posing challenges for therapeutic targeting and necessitating further investigation to elucidate its function and involvement in disease processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C2orf76 has been implicated in the progression of aggressive pancreatic cancer phenotypes. It is described as a dimeric protein that contributes to cancer progression by inducing cell invasion and proliferation, suggesting its potential as a drug target in pancreatic cancer (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). However, the lack of crystallographic data poses challenges for in silico drug design, which could hinder the development of targeted therapies (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The gene's expression and regulation are critical in cancer, as ORF genes like C2orf76 can be involved in upstream cancer-associated tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, impacting cell viability (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite its potential clinical significance, there is limited information on specific diseases directly linked to mutations or alterations in C2orf76 expression. The research emphasizes the need for further functional and disease-specific characterization of ORF genes, including C2orf76, as many remain poorly annotated (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Overall, while C2orf76 shows promise as a target in pancreatic cancer, more research is needed to fully understand its role and potential in other diseases or conditions.
