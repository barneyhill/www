# ETV4

## Overview
ETV4, or ETS variant transcription factor 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, specifically categorized within the PEA3 subfamily. The ETV4 protein is characterized by its ETS DNA-binding domain, which is essential for recognizing specific purine-rich DNA motifs, thereby influencing the transcription of target genes. This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in various developmental processes, including motor axon guidance and branching morphogenesis in organs such as the mammary gland, lung, and kidney. ETV4 is also involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, through its ability to act as both an activator and repressor of gene expression. The protein's function is modulated by its structural domains, including the C-terminal and N-terminal inhibitory domains, which regulate its DNA-binding activity through autoinhibition mechanisms. ETV4's involvement in cancer progression, particularly in prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, underscores its clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Pellecchia2012Overexpression; Cosi2023Identification; Currie2017Structured).

## Structure
The ETV4 protein, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, is characterized by its conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. This domain is crucial for recognizing purine-rich DNA motifs and is encoded by exons 11, 12, and 13 of the ETV4 gene (Cosi2023Identification). The protein also contains a C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID) and an N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID), both of which play roles in autoinhibition of DNA binding. The CID includes an α-helix (H4) that interacts with the ETS domain, forming a hydrophobic cluster that inhibits DNA binding (Currie2017Structured). The NID is intrinsically disordered and interacts transiently with the DNA-recognition helix of the ETS domain, contributing to autoinhibition (Currie2017Structured).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation of lysine residues within the NID, can relieve autoinhibition by disrupting interactions with the ETS domain (Currie2017Structured). ETV4 also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in several splice variant isoforms, including ETV4-∆4, ETV4-∆7, and ETV4-∆6-8, which have different effects on cell proliferation and transcriptional activity (Cosi2023Identification). These variants highlight the complexity and regulatory potential of ETV4 in various biological processes and diseases.

## Function
ETV4, also known as PEA3 or E1AF, is a member of the ETS transcription factor family, specifically the PEA3 subfamily. In healthy human cells, ETV4 is involved in various developmental processes. It is expressed during embryogenesis and contributes to motor axon guidance. ETV4 also plays a role in branching morphogenesis in organs such as the mammary gland, lung, and kidney, as well as in the formation of limb buds (Cosi2023Identification).

ETV4 proteins are characterized by the presence of the ETS domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognizes specific DNA motifs. These proteins can act as activators or repressors of their gene targets and are involved in regulating various signaling cascades that control biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, development, transformation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (Cosi2023Identification). The activity of the ETS domain and the activation domains in ETV4 are regulated by their flanking sequences (Cosi2023Identification).

In the cellular context, ETV4 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes, influencing developmental and physiological processes (Cosi2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ETV4 (ETS variant transcription factor 4) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In prostate cancer, ETV4 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to increased cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to tumor aggressiveness and metastasis (Pellecchia2012Overexpression; Qi2014Overexpression). ETV4 rearrangements occur in approximately 2% of prostate cancers, affecting cellular signaling pathways such as androgen receptor signaling and MAPK/NF-kB signaling, which are crucial for cancer progression (Shin2022Portrait).

In colorectal cancer, ETV4 is overexpressed in adenocarcinoma compared to adenoma, playing a significant role in the transition from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. This overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and migration, highlighting its importance in tumorigenic processes (Fonseca2021ETV4). ETV4 also contributes to pancreatic cancer by upregulating Cyclin D1, facilitating cell-cycle progression and uncontrolled cell proliferation (Tyagi2018ETV4).

ETV4's involvement in the tumor microenvironment is marked by its correlation with immune checkpoint genes and immune cell infiltration, suggesting it may promote tumorigenesis by disrupting immune balance (Zhang2023Oncogenic). These findings underscore ETV4's clinical significance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers.

## Interactions
ETV4, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in gene regulation. ETV4 directly binds to the promoter of the CDKN1A gene, which encodes the p21 protein, at a specific binding site, leading to the downregulation of CDKN1A expression. This interaction was confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and dual luciferase reporter assays (Cosi2020ETV4). ETV4 also interacts with the promoter regions of the MMP1 gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma, positively regulating its expression and potentially promoting cancer progression (Yu2020CRLF1–MYH9).

In terms of protein interactions, ETV4 is involved in a complex interplay of structured and disordered regions that mediate its autoinhibition and DNA binding capabilities. The N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID) and the C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID) of ETV4 interact with the DNA-recognition helix H3, influencing its conformation and DNA-binding ability. These interactions are characterized by small NMR spectral perturbations and involve multiple regions of the NID, with key residues such as Tyr401 and Tyr403 playing a critical role in NID-mediated autoinhibition (Currie2017Structured).
