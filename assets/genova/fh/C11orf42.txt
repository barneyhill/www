# C11orf42

## Overview
C11orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 42. This protein is a putative member of the gasdermin (GSDM) pore-forming protein family, although it exhibits only 1% sequence identity with known GSDMs. Despite this low sequence similarity, C11orf42 shares predicted structural features with GSDMs, suggesting it may have similar functions, such as oligomerization and membrane interaction. However, unlike typical GSDMs, C11orf42 lacks membrane-penetrating regions, indicating it may function as a scaffold rather than directly forming pores in lipid bilayers (BaylyJones2021Mining). The protein is expressed in the testis and is highly expressed in thyroid tumors, with implications in cancer cell proliferation and spermatogenesis (Jamin2021Combined). C11orf42 interacts with the protein transporter SNX5, which is involved in stabilizing growth factor receptors, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Jamin2021Combined). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the functional roles and clinical significance of C11orf42.

## Function
C11orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes a protein potentially involved in various cellular processes. Although the specific functions of C11orf42 in healthy human cells are not fully characterized, it is identified as a likely new member of the gasdermin (GSDM) pore-forming protein family. Despite having only 1% sequence identity with known GSDMs, C11orf42 shares predicted conservation of tertiary structure, suggesting it may have GSDM-like functions such as oligomerization and membrane interaction. However, unlike other GSDMs, C11orf42 lacks membrane-penetrating regions, implying it may function as a scaffold rather than perforating lipid bilayers (BaylyJones2021Mining).

C11orf42 is expressed in the testis and is highly expressed in thyroid tumors. It has been identified as contributing to fitness and proliferation in lymphoma, glioblastoma, and leukemia cell lines (BaylyJones2021Mining). The protein physically interacts with the protein transporter SNX5, which is expressed in the male germline and is involved in stabilizing growth factor receptors, potentially contributing to pathological processes in cancer (Jamin2021Combined). The expression pattern of C11orf42 suggests a role in spermatogenesis, particularly in spermatids, indicating its involvement in the later stages of sperm development (Jamin2021Combined).

## Interactions
C11orf42 is known to physically interact with the protein transporter SNX5. This interaction is significant as SNX5 is expressed in the male germline and is a negative prognostic marker for liver cancer. SNX5 also promotes thyroid cancer progression by stabilizing growth factor receptors, suggesting that C11orf42 may contribute to these pathological processes through its interaction with SNX5 (Jamin2021Combined).

Additionally, C11orf42 has been identified as a likely new member of the GSDM pore-forming family in humans. Despite having only 1% sequence identity with known GSDMs, C11orf42 shares predicted structural features with them, suggesting potential GSDM-like functions such as oligomerization and membrane interaction. However, it lacks membrane-penetrating regions, implying a potential role as a scaffold rather than directly forming pores (BaylyJones2021Mining).

These interactions and structural predictions indicate that C11orf42 may play a role in cellular processes related to cancer progression and cell proliferation, although its exact functional partnerships and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify the full spectrum of C11orf42's interactions and their implications in cancer biology.
