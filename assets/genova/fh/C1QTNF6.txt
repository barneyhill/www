# C1QTNF6

## Overview
C1QTNF6 is a gene that encodes the protein C1q and TNF related 6, which is a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family. This protein is characterized as a secreted glycoprotein with a modular structure, including a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain. The protein is involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism and inflammation, and is known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle cells, thereby influencing fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, C1q and TNF related 6 modulates inflammatory responses by increasing the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in macrophages. The protein forms oligomeric complexes, which are crucial for its biological activity, and interacts with other proteins, such as the relaxin receptor RXFP1, playing a role in wound healing. Clinically, C1QTNF6 is implicated in several cancers, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics, making it a potential therapeutic target (Nicolaus2023C1q/TNF-Related; Kim2010C1qTNFRelated; Lee2010C1qTNF‐related; Qu2018C1QTNF6; Wong2008Molecular).

## Structure
C1QTNF6, a member of the C1q/TNF-related protein family, is characterized by a modular structure that includes a signal peptide, a collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal globular C1q domain (Kim2010C1qTNFRelated; Wong2008Molecular). The globular domain of C1QTNF6 shares structural similarities with adiponectin, featuring a jelly-roll folding topology with a central hydrophobic core formed by invariant aromatic residues (Tom2005The). This protein forms trimers as its basic structural unit and can assemble into higher-order oligomeric complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonding, facilitated by cysteine residues at the N-terminus (Wong2008Molecular).

C1QTNF6 is a secreted glycoprotein, and its glycosylation is confirmed by the presence of functional N-linked glycosylation sites (Wong2008Molecular). The protein is involved in cytokine production, specifically inducing the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in macrophages, which is mediated by the globular domain (Kim2010C1qTNFRelated). The conservation of specific residues within the C1q domain is crucial for the structural stability of C1QTNF6 (Tom2005The).

## Function
C1QTNF6, also known as C1q/TNF-related protein 6 (CTRP6), is a member of the CTRP family involved in various biological processes, including metabolism and inflammation. In healthy human cells, CTRP6 plays a role in fatty acid metabolism by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle cells. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), promoting fatty acid oxidation, which is crucial for energy homeostasis and metabolism (Lee2010C1qTNF‐related).

CTRP6 is also involved in modulating inflammatory responses. It can increase the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, in macrophages through the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This suggests a role for CTRP6 in regulating inflammation, potentially compensating for the absence of adiponectin in certain conditions (Kim2010C1qTNFRelated).

CTRP6 is expressed in various tissues and is secreted as a glycoprotein that circulates in the blood, potentially functioning as an endocrine hormone. It forms oligomeric complexes, which may be important for its biological activity (Wong2008Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
C1QTNF6 is implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics. In gastric carcinoma, C1QTNF6 is significantly overexpressed, contributing to increased cell proliferation, migration, and reduced apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth and spread (Qu2018C1QTNF6). In lung adenocarcinoma, high C1QTNF6 expression correlates with poor prognosis and lymph node metastasis, acting as an independent predictor of patient outcomes (Han2019C1QTNF6). The gene is also overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, promoting tumor growth (Song2021C1QTNF6).

C1QTNF6 is involved in the activation of oncogenic pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma, and is linked to immune regulation and drug sensitivity across various cancers (Liu2022C1QTNF6; Han2019C1QTNF6). Its expression is associated with immune checkpoint pathways and immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in the tumor microenvironment (Liu2022C1QTNF6). These findings suggest that C1QTNF6 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
C1QTNF6, also known as CTRP6, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily within the C1q/TNF-related protein family. It forms higher-order oligomeric complexes through intermolecular disulfide bonding, including trimers and potentially larger structures, although its precise oligomeric form in serum remains unresolved (Wong2008Molecular). C1QTNF6 can also form hetero-oligomers with other CTRP family members, such as CTRP1, when co-expressed in the same cells. This interaction likely occurs during biosynthesis or transit through the Golgi compartment, as mixing supernatants of individually expressed proteins did not result in co-immunoprecipitation (Wong2008Molecular).

C1QTNF6 interacts with the relaxin receptor RXFP1, playing a role in corneal epithelial wound closure. While its effects on wound closure are not fully attenuated by RXFP1 inhibition, suggesting additional pathways or interactions, it may act as a competitive antagonist at the RXFP1 receptor (Nicolaus2023C1q/TNF-Related). The protein is also involved in metabolic functions and has been associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its role in inflammation and wound healing processes (Nicolaus2023C1q/TNF-Related). However, specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies.
