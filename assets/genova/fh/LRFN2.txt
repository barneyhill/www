# LRFN2

## Overview
LRFN2, or leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a synaptic adhesion protein known as SALM1. This protein is integral to the development and function of synapses, particularly in the central nervous system. As a transmembrane protein, SALM1 is involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking, which is crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity. It interacts with key synaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and Sorting nexin-27, facilitating the clustering and surface expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. These interactions are vital for synaptic maturation, maintenance, and plasticity, processes that are essential for learning and memory. Dysregulation of LRFN2 has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive function and synaptic integrity (Morimura2017Autismlike; Lie2018SALMLrfn; McMillan2020Sorting).

## Function
The LRFN2 gene encodes a synaptic adhesion protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic development and function. It is involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking, particularly influencing the surface expression of the GluA2 subunit, which is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation in the hippocampus (McMillan2020Sorting). LRFN2 interacts with postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 through a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which is critical for the maturation and maintenance of excitatory synapses (Morimura2017Autismlike). This interaction is important for the recruitment and clustering of AMPA and NMDA receptors at the synapse, contributing to synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Morimura2017Autismlike).

In the retina, LRFN2 is expressed in cone synapses and is thought to play a role in synaptic function, although its precise function in healthy human cells requires further research (Hasan2024Cone). The protein is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, with its dysfunction linked to conditions such as autism and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal synaptic activity and cognitive function (Morimura2017Autismlike; McMillan2020Sorting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRFN2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. LRFN2 has been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, with specific missense mutations such as R274H and E462D identified in patients. These mutations result in impaired interactions with PSD-95, a critical synaptic protein, leading to synaptic dysfunction (Morimura2017Autismlike). LRFN2 is also associated with learning disabilities, particularly affecting working memory and executive function, as observed in individuals with chromosomal microdeletions involving this gene (Thevenon2015Heterozygous). 

In addition to cognitive impairments, LRFN2 mutations have been implicated in antisocial personality disorder and are linked to altered synaptic plasticity and behavioral abnormalities in animal models (Lie2018SALMLrfn; McMillan2020Sorting). LRFN2's role in synaptic adhesion and AMPA receptor trafficking is crucial for maintaining synaptic function, and its dysfunction can lead to various neurological conditions (McMillan2020Sorting). The gene's involvement in erythropoiesis and NMDA receptor function further suggests its broader impact on neurodevelopmental processes (Maekawa2021Dysregulation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LRFN2 in understanding and potentially treating related disorders.

## Interactions
LRFN2, also known as SALM1, is a synaptic adhesion protein that participates in several key interactions crucial for synaptic function. It interacts with Sorting nexin-27 (SNX27) through its PDZ-binding motif, a connection essential for the trafficking of AMPA receptors. This interaction is confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, which shows high-affinity binding between SNX27's PDZ domain and LRFN2's PDZ-binding motif (McMillan2020Sorting). LRFN2 also associates with AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 via its extracellular LRR and Ig domains, facilitating their surface expression and synaptic activity (McMillan2020Sorting).

LRFN2 acts as a 'bridge' linking SNX27 to AMPA receptors, indirectly regulating their trafficking and synaptic clustering (McMillan2020Sorting). It also interacts with PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, through its PDZ-binding motif, contributing to the clustering of NMDA receptors at the synaptic surface (Lie2018SALMLrfn). These interactions underscore LRFN2's role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, with implications for various neurological conditions (McMillan2020Sorting). The protein's involvement in these interactions highlights its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function.
