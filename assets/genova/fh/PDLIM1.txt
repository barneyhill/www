# PDLIM1

## Overview
PDLIM1 is a gene that encodes the PDZ and LIM domain protein 1, a cytoplasmic protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. The protein is characterized by the presence of PDZ and LIM domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins, such as α-actinin, and play a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and regulating cell motility (Liu2014PDZ). PDLIM1 is particularly significant in the regulation of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling, where it acts as a negative regulator by sequestering the p65 subunit of NF-κB in the cytoplasm, thus preventing its nuclear translocation and activation of proinflammatory cytokines (Ono2015PDLIM1). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions have implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels and interactions influence tumor progression and metastasis (Chen2016PDLIM1; Jiang2023PDZ).

## Function
PDLIM1, also known as PDZ and LIM domain protein 1, plays a significant role in regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling in healthy human cells. It functions by sequestering the p65 subunit of NF-κB in the cytoplasm, preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of proinflammatory cytokine production. This mechanism is independent of IκBα and involves interaction with the actin-binding protein α-actinin-4 (Ono2015PDLIM1). PDLIM1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in immune cells, including dendritic cells, where it acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling (Ono2015PDLIM1).

In addition to its role in inflammation, PDLIM1 is involved in maintaining cell structure and regulating cell motility. It interacts with α-actinin, which is crucial for cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. This interaction is essential for processes such as cell migration and invasion, particularly in the context of cancer cell biology (Liu2014PDZ). PDLIM1's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on organismal outcomes, such as immune response regulation and cancer progression.

## Clinical Significance
PDLIM1 plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, PDLIM1, also known as CLP36, is highly expressed and promotes cell migration, invasion, and metastasis by interacting with α-actinin, particularly α-actinin-4, which is crucial for cell polarization and Cdc42 activation (Liu2014PDZ). Conversely, in colorectal cancer (CRC), PDLIM1 is downregulated, which destabilizes the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex, leading to enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased metastatic potential. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation (Chen2016PDLIM1). High PDLIM1 expression in CRC correlates with better overall survival and reduced tumor invasiveness (Chen2016PDLIM1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDLIM1 is poorly expressed, and its overexpression inhibits metastasis by preventing F-actin overgrowth and Hippo signaling activation (Jiang2023PDZ). In gastric cancer, low PDLIM1 expression is linked to disease progression and cisplatin resistance (Jiang2023PDZ). PDLIM1 also acts as a tumor antigen in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, though the specificity of the immune response remains uncertain (Jiang2023PDZ). These findings underscore the tissue-specific roles of PDLIM1 in cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker.

## Interactions
PDLIM1, also known as CLP36, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. It interacts with α-actinin, particularly α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4, forming complexes that are essential for cell migration and invasion, especially in the context of breast cancer. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ domain of PDLIM1 and is critical for promoting cell migration and metastasis (Liu2014PDZ).

PDLIM1 also interacts with FHL1, potentially targeting it to actin stress fibers through LIM-LIM domain interactions, and may shuttle FHL1 out of the nucleus, influencing its cellular localization and function (Sharma2011Identification). In addition, PDLIM1 interacts with Clik1 kinase, facilitating its relocation to actin stress fibers (Zhou2021PDLIM1:).

In the context of inflammatory signaling, PDLIM1 interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its nuclear translocation. This interaction is dependent on α-actinin-4 and is crucial for regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses (Ono2015PDLIM1).
