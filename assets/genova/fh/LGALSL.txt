# LGALSL

## Overview
The LGALSL gene encodes a protein known as galectin-like, which is part of the galectin family, a group of proteins characterized by their ability to bind Î²-galactoside sugars. Unlike classical galectins, the galectin-like protein encoded by LGALSL lacks the typical carbohydrate recognition domain, suggesting it may have distinct biological roles. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and modulation of immune responses. Although the precise functions of the galectin-like protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in these processes indicates potential significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
