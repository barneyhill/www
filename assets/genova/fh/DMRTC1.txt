# DMRTC1

## Overview
DMRTC1, or Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription Factor C1, is a gene that encodes the DMRT-like family C1 protein, which is a member of the DMRT family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a conserved DM domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The DMRT-like family C1 protein plays a significant role in the regulation of sexual development and differentiation, as well as in various other developmental processes. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes that are critical for these biological functions. The precise mechanisms by which DMRTC1 influences these pathways are still under investigation, but its role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway has been highlighted in recent studies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
