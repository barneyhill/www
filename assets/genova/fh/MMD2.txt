# MMD2

## Overview
The MMD2 gene encodes the protein monocyte to macrophage differentiation associated 2, which plays a crucial role in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. This protein is involved in the regulation of immune responses and cellular differentiation processes. MMD2 is particularly significant in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation, influencing the development of granulocytes and other immune cells. Mutations in the MMD2 gene have been implicated in certain pathological conditions, such as aggressive periodontitis with neutropenia, due to their impact on neutrophil function and differentiation (Mizuno2019Aggressive). The study of MMD2 and its encoded protein is essential for understanding immune system disorders and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMD2 gene have been linked to aggressive periodontitis with neutropenia, a condition characterized by severe periodontal destruction and a reduced number of neutrophils. The specific mutation identified is a heterozygous variant c.347 C>T, p. A116V, which impairs the differentiation and function of neutrophils, leading to a decreased protective response against chronic bacterial infections (Mizuno2019Aggressive). This mutation results in the failure of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to differentiate into granulocytes, causing neutrophil dysfunction and contributing to the pathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis (Mizuno2019Aggressive).

The MMD2 mutation is rare and not found in Japanese databases, though it appears at low frequencies in European and Latino populations (Mizuno2019Aggressive). Studies using a mouse model with the corresponding mutation (Mmd2 A117V/A117V) have shown severe alveolar bone loss and abnormal granulocyte differentiation, supporting the mutation's role in aggressive periodontitis (Mizuno2019Aggressive). These findings suggest that MMD2 mutations may help differentiate between chronic and aggressive periodontitis and highlight the need for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches (Mizuno2019Aggressive).
