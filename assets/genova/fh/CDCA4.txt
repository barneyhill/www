# CDCA4

## Overview
CDCA4, or cell division cycle associated 4, is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly influencing the G1/S transition. The CDCA4 protein is a member of the SERTA domain-containing family, characterized by its conserved domains, including a SERTA domain, a cyclin A-binding motif, and a PHD bromodomain-binding domain, which are integral to its role in cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). CDCA4 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting its involvement in hematopoiesis and immune function (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). The protein interacts with key cellular components such as the E2F transcription factor family and CREB-binding protein (CBP), enhancing the transactivating function of the tumor suppressor p53 and influencing cell proliferation (Fang2022A). CDCA4's role extends to DNA damage response and mitotic spindle formation, highlighting its importance in proper cell division and growth. Its expression patterns and interactions suggest potential implications in cancer biology, making it a subject of interest for therapeutic research (Xu2021CDCA4).

## Structure
The CDCA4 gene encodes a protein that is 237 amino acids long and contains several conserved domains, including a SERTA domain, a cyclin A-binding motif, and a PHD bromodomain-binding domain (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). The SERTA domain, approximately 48 amino acids in length, is highly conserved across species and features four invariant residues crucial for its function (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). This domain is essential for cyclin-dependent kinase binding activity and is implicated in cell cycle control, chromatin remodeling, and gene regulation (Bennetts2006Evolutionary).

The cyclin A-binding motif includes a sequence of three basic residues (KRK) and is also highly conserved (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). CDCA4 is a nuclear protein, and its localization remains consistent throughout the cell cycle (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). The protein is known to interact with CBP (CREB-binding protein) and stimulate the transactivating function of the tumor suppressor p53, as well as induce p53-independent growth inhibition (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). The predicted size of the CDCA4 protein is 26 kDa, but it is detected at approximately 28-29 kDa, possibly due to post-translational modifications (Bennetts2006Evolutionary).

## Function
CDCA4, also known as Hepp, encodes a protein that is part of the SERTA domain-containing family, which is evolutionarily conserved. This protein is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly influencing the G1/S transition. CDCA4 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and various lymphoid and myeloid cell lines, with high expression levels in the thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, suggesting a significant role in hematopoiesis and immune function (Bennetts2006Evolutionary).

The CDCA4 protein contains a SERTA domain, a cyclin A-binding motif, and a PHD bromodomain-binding domain, which are linked to cell cycle progression and chromatin remodeling (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). It localizes in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, indicating its role in nuclear processes such as transcriptional regulation (Bennetts2006Evolutionary). CDCA4 is implicated in stimulating p53 transactivating function, affecting cell proliferation, and potentially acting as a transcriptional co-activator (Bennetts2006Evolutionary).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, CDCA4 is involved in DNA damage response and mitotic spindle formation, contributing to proper cell division and growth. Its expression pattern during embryogenesis suggests a role in development, particularly in neural and craniofacial regions (Bennetts2006Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
CDCA4 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In breast cancer, particularly in the MCF-7/ADM cell line, CDCA4 is a downstream gene of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Its suppression through RNA interference leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in enhancing tumor growth and survival (Xu2017CDCA4). CDCA4 is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, and ovarian cancer, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Fang2022A; Tan2022CDCA4).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CDCA4 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis, serving as an independent adverse prognostic factor. Its upregulation is associated with unfavorable clinicopathological features and poor survival outcomes (Tan2022CDCA4). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CDCA4 suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis by modulating autophagy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021CDCA4).

CDCA4 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression in various cancers, indicating its role in tumor immune response regulation (Fang2022A). High CDCA4 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival across multiple cancer types (Fang2022A).

## Interactions
CDCA4 is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the E2F transcription factor family, which is crucial for controlling E2F-dependent transcriptional activation and cell proliferation (Fang2022A). CDCA4 also interacts with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and enhances the transactivating function of the tumor suppressor p53, while also inducing p53-independent growth inhibition (Fang2022A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CDCA4 interacts with Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1). This interaction is significant as CDCA4 suppresses the expression of CARM1, which in turn modulates autophagy and inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells (Xu2021CDCA4). The interaction between CDCA4 and CARM1 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a physical interaction between these proteins (Xu2021CDCA4).

CDCA4 is also involved in spindle organization during mitosis, interacting with microtubules, microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and motor proteins, which are essential for spindle dynamics (Fang2022A). These interactions highlight CDCA4's role in chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis during cell division.
