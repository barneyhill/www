# TENM3

## Overview
TENM3, also known as teneurin transmembrane protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the teneurin family of cell adhesion molecules. The protein encoded by TENM3 is characterized by its transmembrane nature, featuring a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. Teneurin-3 plays a crucial role in synaptic organization and neural connectivity, particularly in the formation and maintenance of excitatory synapses. It is involved in neuronal recognition and synaptic specificity, forming nanoclusters in presynaptic active zones and interacting with postsynaptic ligands such as latrophilins. The protein's structure, including its EGF-like repeats and YD-repeat region, is essential for its function in cell-cell adhesion and neural circuit wiring. Mutations in the TENM3 gene have been linked to developmental abnormalities, particularly affecting ocular development and potentially contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Jackson2018Structures; Zhang2022Teneurins; Cheung2022Teneurin).

## Structure
The TENM3 gene encodes the teneurin-3 protein, a member of the teneurin family of cell adhesion molecules. Teneurin-3 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain features eight EGF-like repeats and a YD-repeat region, which form a protective shell-like structure (Jackson2018Structures). The protein also includes a transthyretin-like domain, a fibronectin-plug domain, and a 6-bladed β-propeller NHL domain, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function in cell-cell adhesion (Jackson2018Structures).

Teneurin-3 forms compact dimers through an extended β-sheet interaction, with specific domains such as EGF8, YD, and ABD playing key roles in dimerization (Gogou2024Alternative). The presence of calcium is essential for maintaining the compact dimer conformation, which is important for neuronal recognition and synaptic specificity (Gogou2024Alternative). Alternative splicing of TENM3 results in different isoforms, such as A0B0, A0B1, A1B0, and A1B1, which exhibit distinct structural conformations and influence the protein's ability to engage in trans-cellular interactions (Gogou2024Alternative). These structural variations are critical for the protein's role in neural circuit wiring and synaptic organization.

## Function
TENM3, or teneurin transmembrane protein 3, plays a significant role in synaptic organization and neural connectivity. It is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it functions as a cell-adhesion molecule. TENM3 is involved in synapse formation and maintenance, particularly in excitatory synapses, by acting as a presynaptic adhesion molecule. It forms nanoclusters in presynaptic active zones, which are crucial for synaptic connectivity and organization (Zhang2022Teneurins).

TENM3 is expressed in a gradient along the CA1 region of the hippocampus and is localized to dendritic spines, especially at spine heads and spine attachment points. This localization suggests a role in dendritic spine organization and synaptic assembly (Cheung2022Teneurin). The intracellular domain of TENM3 is essential for its synaptic localization, influencing synaptic organization and function (Cheung2022Teneurin).

TENM3 also interacts with postsynaptic non-teneurin ligands, such as latrophilins, through heterophilic interactions, which are essential for synapse formation in the hippocampus (Zhang2022Teneurins). These interactions contribute to the specific wiring diagrams of neural circuits, impacting neural connectivity and synaptic specificity (Zhang2022Teneurins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TENM3 gene are associated with a range of developmental and physical abnormalities, particularly affecting ocular development. Biallelic variants in TENM3 have been linked to non-syndromic microphthalmia with coloboma-9 (MCOPCB9) and microphthalmia and/or coloboma with developmental delay (MCOPS15). Patients with these conditions often present with eye abnormalities such as bilateral microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, and esotropia, as well as developmental delays and distinctive physical features (Lu2023Case).

In addition to ocular conditions, TENM3 mutations have been implicated in developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). A novel mutation in TENM3 was found to co-segregate with DDH in a multi-generation family, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. This mutation was associated with delayed development of the acetabulum and glenoid fossa in knock-in mutant mice, indicating a potential role in chondrogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling (Feldman2018Novel).

Alterations in TENM3 expression or interactions may also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, given its involvement in neural connectivity and patterning (Lu2023Case).

## Interactions
TENM3, also known as teneurin transmembrane protein 3, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synapse formation and neuronal recognition. TENM3 assembles into presynaptic nanoclusters and interacts with postsynaptic non-teneurin ligands, such as latrophilins, which are high-affinity binding partners. This interaction is essential for organizing synaptic connections and promoting synapse formation through heterophilic interactions (Zhang2022Teneurins).

Alternative splicing of TENM3 affects its ability to form homophilic and heterophilic interactions. Different splice variants of TENM3 exhibit distinct conformations that influence their interaction with binding partners like latrophilin-3. For instance, the A0B1 isoform forms trans dimer-of-dimer interactions, which may affect its ability to engage in trans-cellular interactions with latrophilin due to the orientation of its interaction surface (Gogou2024Alternative; Gogou2023Alternative).

TENM3 also has the potential to form cis-heterodimers with other teneurin paralogues, which may be relevant for its synaptic localization and function (Cheung2022Teneurin). These interactions highlight the role of TENM3 in neuronal circuit wiring and synaptic organization.
