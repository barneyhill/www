# CA9

## Overview
The CA9 gene encodes the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) protein, a transmembrane zinc metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in pH regulation and cellular respiration. CA IX is primarily involved in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a process crucial for maintaining acid-base balance in various tissues, particularly under hypoxic conditions. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestine, where it aids in digestion and nutrient absorption. In addition to its physiological roles, CA IX is significantly implicated in cancer biology, where its expression is often upregulated in response to hypoxia, contributing to tumor survival and progression. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), further underscore its involvement in cellular processes like migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in oncology (Pastorekova2019The; Supuran2018Inhibition).

## Structure
The human carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) gene encodes a transmembrane protein involved in pH regulation, particularly in tumor environments. The primary structure of CA9 consists of 459 amino acids, including a 414 amino acid N-terminal extracellular part, a 20 amino acid transmembrane region, and a 25 amino acid C-terminal intracellular tail (De2010Carbonic). The secondary structure features a ten-stranded antiparallel β-sheet core within the catalytic domain (De2010Carbonic).

The tertiary structure of CA9 is characterized by a compact globular domain with a zinc ion at the active site, essential for its enzymatic function (De2010Carbonic). The quaternary structure of CA9 is dimeric, with dimerization mediated by an intermolecular disulfide bond involving Cys-41 (Alterio2009Crystal). This dimeric arrangement is crucial for its physiological role in CO2 hydration (Alterio2009Crystal).

CA9 contains several specific domains, including a proteoglycan-like domain, a catalytic domain, and a transmembrane segment (De2010Carbonic). The proteoglycan-like domain is located at the entrance to the active site clefts and may assist in catalysis and cell adhesion (Alterio2009Crystal). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which may influence its functional properties (De2010Carbonic).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance in healthy human cells by catalyzing the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. This enzymatic activity is essential for cellular respiration and pH regulation in tissues, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, where CA IX contributes to the regulation of pH in the stomach and intestines, aiding in digestion and nutrient absorption (Pastorekova2019The).

CA IX is primarily active on the cell surface, where it interacts with the extracellular environment. It facilitates the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, which is vital for maintaining pH homeostasis across the plasma membrane (Pastorekova2019The). This activity supports cellular metabolism and ion transport, ensuring cellular homeostasis in various physiological conditions (Pastorekova2019The).

In non-cancerous tissues, CA IX expression is typically confined to the epithelia of the stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestine, where it may play a role in protecting gastric epithelia from acid load (Pastorekova2019The). Its expression is tightly regulated and often induced under hypoxic conditions, aligning its activity with the metabolic needs of the cell (Pastorekova2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The CA9 gene, encoding the carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) protein, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in pH regulation and cellular respiration. Alterations in CA9 expression are linked to several cancer types, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), where it is not expressed in healthy renal tissue but is prevalent in tumors due to hypoxia and VHL gene inactivation (Tostain2010Carbonic). High CA9 expression in CCRCC is associated with better prognosis and response to IL-2 therapy, although this is debated (Tostain2010Carbonic). In pancreatic cancer, CA9 contributes to an acidic microenvironment that inhibits CD8+ T cell infiltration, correlating with poorer overall survival and lymphatic metastasis (Yin2022CA9Related).

CA9 is also implicated in other cancers, such as cervical and ovarian, where its expression is linked to hypoxia and poor prognosis (Tostain2010Carbonic). The gene's expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and is often upregulated in hypoxic tumor environments, promoting tumor survival and metastasis (Supuran2018Inhibition). CA9's interactions with proteins like β-catenin and its involvement in pathways such as Rho/ROCK influence cell adhesion and migration, further contributing to cancer progression (Supuran2018Inhibition).

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9) is known to participate in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as migration, invasion, and signaling pathways. CA9 directly interacts with dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1), a protein involved in the Wnt/β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that CA9 and DKK1 physically interact at a physiological level (Shin2011Carbonic; Kim2012Dickkopf1). The interaction between CA9 and DKK1 is significant in modulating tumor-associated cell migration and invasion, potentially through the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway (Shin2011Carbonic).

CA9 also interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), specifically VEGF 165, enhancing VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. This interaction is specific to the C-terminal region of CA9 and is inhibited by DKK1, which can suppress the angiogenic process stimulated by the VEGF/CA9 interaction (Kim2012Dickkopf1).

In addition, CA9 forms stable complexes with bicarbonate transporters such as AE1, AE2, and AE3, enhancing their Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. This interaction is mediated by the catalytic domain of CA9 and is crucial for maintaining bicarbonate transport activity (Morgan2007Interactions).
