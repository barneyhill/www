# ADCY8

## Overview
ADCY8 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 8, a calcium-stimulated enzyme that belongs to the family of adenylate cyclases. This enzyme is integral to cellular signaling, primarily through its role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a pivotal second messenger involved in various physiological processes. Adenylate cyclase 8 is particularly significant in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, as well as in synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the brain (Raoux2014Multilevel; Conti2007Distinct). The gene's expression and function are also implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological disorders, highlighting its broad impact on human health (Tarasov2022A; Guo2022Targeting).

## Function
ADCY8 encodes adenylate cyclase 8, a calcium-stimulated enzyme that plays a crucial role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a key second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. In pancreatic beta cells, ADCY8 is involved in glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. It acts as a coincidence detector, integrating signals from glucose and hormones to regulate cAMP levels, which are essential for glucose responsiveness and insulin secretion (Raoux2014Multilevel). ADCY8 is necessary for glucose-induced increases in cytosolic calcium and insulin secretion, and its knockdown leads to reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and calcium response (Raoux2014Multilevel).

In the brain, ADCY8 is expressed in regions associated with learning and memory, such as the hippocampus. It is involved in synaptic plasticity, particularly in long-term potentiation (LTP), a process critical for learning and memory (Conti2007Distinct). ADCY8 also plays a role in stress-induced anxiety responses, as its deficiency in mice leads to altered anxiety behaviors and impaired long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus (Schaefer2000Altered). These functions highlight ADCY8's importance in both metabolic regulation and neuronal signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADCY8 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, ADCY8 polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of glioma, particularly in female patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), while potentially offering a protective effect in male patients (Guo2022Targeting). The gene's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in signaling pathways that are similar to those activated in cancer cells, as observed in studies of cardiac-specific overexpression of ADCY8 (Tarasov2022A).

In the cardiovascular system, overexpression of ADCY8 in transgenic mice leads to significant adaptations in heart performance and protection. These adaptations include increased cardiac workload and changes in metabolic pathways, which may contribute to conditions like left ventricular fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy over time (Tarasov2022A). The study of these transgenic mice also suggests that chronic stress from altered ADCY8 expression can engage complex defense circuits within heart cells, potentially leading to maladaptive outcomes (Tarasov2022A).

Overall, the clinical significance of ADCY8 is evident in its association with both neurological and cardiovascular conditions, as well as its potential role in cancer risk and progression.
