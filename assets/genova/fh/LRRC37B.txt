# LRRC37B

## Overview
The LRRC37B gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat containing 37B protein, which is a membrane-anchored protein characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are integral to the protein's role in protein-protein interactions, particularly within human cortical neurons. The LRRC37B protein is primarily localized at the axon initial segment (AIS) of human cortical pyramidal neurons, where it functions as a receptor and modulator of voltage-gated sodium channels, influencing neuronal excitability. This modulation is achieved through interactions with proteins such as FGF13A and the SCN1B subunit, which are crucial for the regulation of neuronal action potentials. The gene's expression is notably higher in humans compared to other primates, suggesting its involvement in the evolution and specialization of the human cerebral cortex (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary; LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

## Structure
The LRRC37B protein is encoded by the LRRC37B gene and consists of 947 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 106 kDa (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The protein features a signal peptide and a transmembrane helix, indicating its role as a membrane-anchored protein (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The primary structure includes several domains and motifs, such as leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The LRR domain spans amino acids 468-841 and is crucial for binding interactions, such as with the FGF13A protein (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

The secondary structure of LRRC37B is characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which typically form alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to a horseshoe-like tertiary structure (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). The protein also contains an LB domain near the N-terminal, which is essential for interactions with other proteins like the SCN1B subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

LRRC37B is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may vary in the number of LRR motifs and potentially lack the transmembrane domain (Giannuzzi2012Evolutionary). These structural features and modifications play a significant role in the protein's function and localization within human cortical neurons.

## Function
The LRRC37B gene encodes a protein that functions as a species-specific regulator of voltage-gated channels and excitability in human cortical neurons. It is primarily localized at the axon initial segment (AIS) of human cortical pyramidal neurons, a critical site for the initiation of action potentials. LRRC37B interacts with the ligand FGF13A and the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta subunit SCN1B, forming a complex that modulates the function of NAV channels at the AIS. This interaction results in the inhibition of VGSC function, thereby reducing neuronal excitability, which is essential for regulating neuronal and circuit function (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

The protein's role in modulating neuronal excitability is linked to its ability to decrease the action potential firing rate and increase the rheobase, action potential rise time, and width. These effects suggest that LRRC37B expression alters intrinsic excitability in human pyramidal neurons, contributing to the specialization of human cortical neurons and potentially impacting neuronal evolution (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B). The gene's expression pattern, which is higher in humans compared to other primates, indicates its involvement in the development and function of the human cerebral cortex (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC37B gene is implicated in several neurological conditions due to its role in regulating voltage-gated channels and neuronal excitability. Mutations in the interacting partners of LRRC37B, such as FGF13A and SCN1B, are associated with epilepsy. These mutations can disrupt the regulation of NAV channels at the axon initial segment (AIS), potentially leading to increased neuronal excitability and seizure activity (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B). Although no germ-line mutations in LRRC37B have been identified in databases, the possibility of somatic mutations affecting its function is considered, which could contribute to neurological disorders (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

The gene's expression is species-specific, with a significant role in human cortical neurons, suggesting its involvement in human-specific brain functions and possibly in conditions like epilepsy (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B). The LRRC37B gene is also involved in structural rearrangements in the genome, as seen in neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) microdeletions, although these deletions do not directly link to diseases caused by LRRC37B mutations (Bengesser2010A). The gene's interactions and expression levels are crucial for maintaining normal neuronal function, and alterations may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
The LRRC37B protein is involved in several interactions that modulate neuronal excitability. It acts as a receptor for the secreted ligand FGF13A, a member of the FHF non-canonical FGF family, which binds to LRRC37B at the axon initial segment (AIS) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. This interaction is significant because FGF13A also binds to voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly NAV1.6, at the AIS, which are crucial for neuronal excitability (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

LRRC37B also interacts with the voltage-gated sodium channel beta subunit 1 (SCN1B). This interaction is mediated by the LB domain of LRRC37B and is important for the regulation of NAV channels, which are critical for neuronal excitability and have implications in epilepsy (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B). The presence of LRRC37B can disrupt the interaction between SCN1B and NAV1.6, suggesting an inhibitory role of LRRC37B on NAV function (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).

These interactions highlight LRRC37B's role in modulating neuronal excitability through its interactions with other proteins at the AIS, influencing the function and targeting of voltage-gated sodium channels (LibéPhilippot2022LRRC37B).
