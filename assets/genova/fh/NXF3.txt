# NXF3

## Overview
NXF3, or nuclear RNA export factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the transport of RNA molecules within cells. The NXF3 protein is a member of the nuclear RNA export factor family and is characterized by its RNA binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. Unlike other members of its family, NXF3 lacks a C-terminal nucleoporin-binding domain but includes a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence, which is crucial for its function in mRNA export (Li2017Nuclear; Zhou2011Nxf3). NXF3 plays a significant role in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and is involved in cellular stress responses, particularly in endothelial cells under lipotoxic conditions (Li2017Nuclear). Additionally, NXF3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and male infertility, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Dicke2024NXT2; Zeng2018AF119895).

## Structure
NXF3 is a member of the nuclear RNA export factor family and is involved in the transport of RNA molecules. The protein structure of NXF3 includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an RNA binding domain, which is crucial for its role in RNA transport (Li2017Nuclear). Additionally, NXF3 has four leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions (Li2017Nuclear). The protein also features a sequence similar to nuclear transport factor 2, a ubiquitin-associated-like domain, a nuclear localizing sequence, and a nuclear export sequence, which includes a CRM1 binding region (Li2017Nuclear).

NXF3 is known to exist in at least two isoforms, Nxf3-1 and Nxf3-2, which differ by the inclusion of an alternative exon 2. Nxf3-1 encodes a protein that is 13 amino acids longer than Nxf3-2 (Zhou2011Nxf3). These isoforms are observed as two bands in Western blot analysis, suggesting that they may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Zhou2011Nxf3). Unlike other NXF family members, NXF3 lacks the C-terminal nucleoporin-binding domain, which is essential for direct interaction with the nuclear pore complex (Zhou2011Nxf3). Instead, it contains a leucine-rich Crm1-binding nuclear export sequence (NES) (Zhou2011Nxf3).

## Function
NXF3 (nuclear RNA export factor 3) is involved in the regulation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) within human cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of snoRNAs, particularly those encoded within the Rpl13a locus. NXF3 is proposed to import snoRNAs from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, ensuring low cytoplasmic levels under normal conditions (Li2017Nuclear). This function is distinct from other members of the NXF family, as NXF3 lacks certain domains for nuclear export but possesses a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence for mRNA export (Li2017Nuclear).

NXF3's role extends to cellular stress responses, where its knockdown in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) results in reduced markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improved cell viability under lipotoxic conditions. This suggests a protective role against lipotoxic cell death (Li2017Nuclear). NXF3's involvement in snoRNA transport and localization is critical for cellular homeostasis, as it influences the distribution of snoRNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm, which may have implications for their noncanonical functions in the cytoplasm (Li2017Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NXF3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the long non-coding RNA AF119895 upregulates NXF3 expression, promoting the migration and invasion of cancer cells. This suggests that NXF3 plays a role in the progression and metastasis of HCC, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Zeng2018AF119895).

In the context of male fertility, a deleterious variant in NXF3 has been associated with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count and poor sperm motility. This variant results in a truncated protein that cannot bind to NXT2, leading to impaired sperm production and function (Dicke2024NXT2). The absence of NXF3-specific staining in sperm suggests a midpiece defect or mitochondrial dysfunction as the cause of sperm immotility (Dicke2024NXT2).

NXF3 also plays a role in endothelial cell response to lipotoxicity. Knockdown of NXF3 in these cells reduces markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improves cell viability under stress conditions, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses (Li2017Nuclear).

## Interactions
NXF3, a member of the nuclear export factor family, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In mouse Sertoli cells, NXF3 interacts with STRAP (serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein), a WD40 domain-containing protein. This interaction enhances TGF-β-induced activation of Smad-specific reporters and Smad-2 and -3 phosphorylation, indicating a role in TGF-β signaling. The interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and is mediated by a region in NXF3 upstream of the RNA-binding domain and a domain in STRAP between the fourth and fifth WD40 repeats (Yin2013Nuclear).

In Drosophila, NXF3 is involved in the export of piRNA precursor transcripts. It forms a complex with Bootlegger and Nxt1, facilitating the transport of these transcripts to the nuage, a site of piRNA biogenesis. NXF3 binds to piRNA precursors and is recruited to piRNA clusters by Bootlegger, possibly through direct protein-protein interactions (Kneuss2019Specialization).

NXF3 also associates with small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts. It is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of snoRNAs, particularly those from the Rpl13a locus. NXF3 associates with a broad range of snoRNAs, including box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, and is suggested to function as a snoRNA transporter (Li2017Nuclear).
