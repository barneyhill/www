# C14orf119

## Overview
C14orf119 is a gene located on chromosome 14 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 14 open reading frame 119. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely undefined (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited understanding of its precise role, C14orf119 has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and neurodevelopmental disorders, through its altered expression levels and genetic variants (Suzuki2020A; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, it is part of a coexpression network associated with circadian rhythm and coronary heart disease, suggesting a potential, albeit not fully elucidated, role in these conditions (Yan2018Identify).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C14orf119 has been implicated in several diseases through its altered expression levels and genetic variants. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), high expression levels of C14orf119 are associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with elevated expression of this gene have a shorter overall survival of 17.0 months compared to 24.4 months for those with lower expression levels, with a hazard ratio of 1.76 and a statistically significant p-value of 0.0069 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Another study reported a hazard ratio of 2.1, with survival times of 16.6 months for high expression versus 30.4 months for low expression, further underscoring its prognostic significance in PAAD (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). 

C14orf119 is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). De novo truncation variants in this gene were identified in patients with NDDs, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of these disorders, although specific clinical impacts were not detailed (Suzuki2020A). 

Additionally, C14orf119 is part of a coexpression network related to circadian rhythm and coronary heart disease (CHD), although its specific role in CHD is not well-defined (Yan2018Identify).
