# REM1

## Overview
REM1 is a gene that encodes the protein RRAD and GEM-like GTPase 1, which belongs to the RGK family of small GTP-binding proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), particularly in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. As a regulatory protein, it modulates the activity of L-type calcium channels, such as CaV1.2, by interacting with specific domains involved in calcium/calmodulin-mediated channel regulation. REM1 functions as a potent inhibitor of VDCC currents, influencing calcium flux and action potential duration in cardiac myocytes. It achieves this by disrupting the association between CaV β and CaV α1 subunits, thereby reducing the surface expression of calcium channels. The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it plays a critical role in maintaining cellular excitability and vascular tone. REM1's expression is regulated by various stimuli, including β-adrenergic receptor agonists and inflammatory signals, underscoring its importance in calcium homeostasis and cellular protection (Pang2010Rem; Finlin1997Rem; Correll2008The).

## Function
REM1, a member of the RGK family of small GTP-binding proteins, plays a crucial role in regulating voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), particularly in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. It modulates the activity of L-type calcium channels, such as CaV1.2, by interacting with their proximal C-terminus, which includes domains involved in calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-mediated channel regulation (Pang2010Rem). This interaction is significant for calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) of these channels, influencing calcium flux and action potential duration in cardiac myocytes (Pang2010Rem).

REM1 functions as a potent inhibitor of VDCC currents by disrupting the association between CaV β and CaV α1 subunits, leading to reduced surface expression of calcium channels (Correll2008The). This inhibition is modulated by CaM, which can partially reverse REM1-mediated channel inhibition, highlighting a complex regulatory mechanism (Pang2010Rem).

REM1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it impacts cellular excitability and vascular tone. Its expression is regulated by various stimuli, including β-adrenergic receptor agonists and inflammatory signals, suggesting a role in maintaining calcium homeostasis and protecting cells from dysfunction (Finlin1997Rem; Correll2008The).

## Clinical Significance
The REM1 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in cancer. In primary bladder cancer, high expression levels of REM1 are statistically significantly associated with a reduction in the survival probability of patients. This suggests that REM1 could serve as a potential marker for overall survival in primary bladder cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in the disease's prognosis (Okutse2021Differential). 

In the context of breast cancer, REM1 is noted for its potential involvement in fatigue experienced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Although the transcript probes for REM1 did not pass quality-control filters in a study, its protein product is suggested to inhibit L-calcium channel activity in skeletal muscle myocytes, which may relate to alterations in skeletal muscle energy and fatigue severity (Flowers2019A).

In yeast, REM1 mutations, identified as alleles of the RAD3 gene, lead to a hyper-recombinational phenotype, increasing spontaneous mitotic recombination and mutation. These mutations are distinct from other RAD3 alleles and do not cause extreme UV sensitivity, but they do alter DNA metabolism, which may provide insights into similar mechanisms in human cells (Montelone1988Spontaneous).

## Interactions
REM1, a member of the RGK family of small GTP-binding proteins, interacts with several key proteins involved in calcium channel regulation. REM1 binds to the proximal C-terminus of the CaV1.2 calcium channel, specifically interacting with the CB/IQ domain, which is involved in Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-mediated channel regulation. This interaction is disrupted by Ca2+/CaM, indicating a competitive binding mechanism (Pang2010Rem). REM1 also associates with the CaVβ subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), which is crucial for its inhibitory effect on calcium channel currents (Yang2012Distinct; Correll2008The).

REM1 can inhibit CaV1.2 channels through both β-binding-dependent and independent mechanisms. It has a novel binding site on the N-terminus of the CaV1.2 α1C subunit, which mediates β-binding-independent inhibition (Yang2012Distinct). The interaction with the proximal C-terminus of CaV1.2 is direct, while the distal interaction may require additional intracellular proteins (Pang2010Rem). REM1's interaction with CaV1.2 channels is significant for modulating calcium-dependent channel inactivation (CDI), and overexpression of CaM can partially reverse REM1-mediated inhibition (Pang2010Rem).
