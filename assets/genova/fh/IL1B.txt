# IL1B

## Overview
The IL1B gene encodes interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), a pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. IL-1β is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to become active, playing a crucial role in mediating inflammatory processes. As a member of the cytokine family, IL-1β is primarily produced by monocytes and macrophages, but it can also be synthesized by other cell types such as epithelial and endothelial cells. The active form of IL-1β functions by binding to specific receptors, triggering signaling pathways that lead to the expression of various inflammatory genes. This cytokine is implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including fever induction, acute-phase response, and the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases. The IL1B gene and its polymorphisms have been associated with various clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1; Nemetz2001Allelic; Weber2010Interleukin1).

## Structure
Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine encoded by the IL1B gene. The primary structure of IL-1β consists of a polypeptide chain of 153 amino acids (Kamogashira1988Sitespecific). Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of IL-1β forms a beta-trefoil fold, a common structural motif in cytokines, which is crucial for its biological activity (Chrunyk1993Inclusion). 

IL-1β is initially synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic cleavage to become active. This processing is facilitated by enzymes such as the interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) in humans and its murine homologue (Molineaux1993Interleukin). The active form of IL-1β is typically a monomer, as there are no known quaternary structures associated with this protein (Mizutani1991Rapid).

Post-translational modifications of IL-1β may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its stability and activity. The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its role in mediating inflammatory responses and its involvement in various signaling pathways (Acuner2014The).

## Function
The IL1B gene encodes the cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a key mediator in the inflammatory response. In healthy human cells, IL-1β is primarily produced by cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, but it can also be synthesized by epithelial, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1; Weber2010Interleukin1). IL-1β is initially produced as an inactive 31-kDa precursor and requires cleavage by interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE), also known as caspase-1, to become an active 17-kDa protein (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1).

IL-1β functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, rapidly inducing the expression of numerous genes across various cell types, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response (Weber2010Interleukin1). It plays a crucial role in mediating normal inflammatory responses to tissue injury or infection, acting in both a paracrine and systemic manner (Weber2010Interleukin1). The cytokine is involved in the induction of fever and the acute-phase response during local tissue damage (Laurincová2000INTERLEUKIN1). IL-1β's activity is tightly regulated by its interaction with membrane receptors and intracellular signaling pathways, including nuclear factor B signaling and the JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Weber2010Interleukin1).

## Clinical Significance
The IL1B gene, encoding the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in inflammation and immune response. In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, allelic variations in IL1B, particularly the IL1B-511*2 allele, are associated with decreased bone mass and increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis. This is attributed to enhanced osteoclast activity and bone resorption (Nemetz2001Allelic).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the IL1B rs1071676 polymorphism is linked to faster disease progression and shorter survival, especially in carriers of two C alleles. This polymorphism is also associated with bulbar onset of ALS, which correlates with shorter survival (RavnikGlavač2022Genetic).

IL1B polymorphisms are also connected to psychiatric disorders. In major depressive disorder (MDD), the IL1B C-511T polymorphism influences the severity of depressive symptoms and response to antidepressants. The IL1B-511TT genotype is associated with a lower severity of symptoms and a better response to treatment (Tsai2017Effects). In Alzheimer's disease, the IL1B-511TT genotype has been linked to increased risk, although findings are inconsistent (Tsai2017Effects).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specific IL1B haplotypes correlate with increased IL1B mRNA levels and higher cancer risk, particularly in the presence of TP53 mutations (Landvik2009A).

## Interactions
IL1B (interleukin 1 beta) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its expression and function. The IL1B promoter region contains a -31 T/C polymorphism that influences the binding of transcription factors. NF-IL6 (also known as C/EBPβ) and TATA-box binding protein (TBP) are known to bind to this region, affecting the formation of protein-DNA complexes. NF-IL6 impacts the binding of certain complexes, while TBP slightly reduces the intensity of all complexes, suggesting a regulatory role in IL1B gene expression (Lind2007Differential).

IL1B also interacts with transcription factors STAT3 and NF-κB p65. Upon IL-1β treatment, a complex involving STAT3 and p65 forms, binding to a specific DNA sequence containing a GAS-like STAT factor binding site overlapping a B motif. This interaction highlights a mechanism of cross-talk between STAT3 and NF-κB pathways, crucial for the transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes (Yoshida2004Interleukin).

Additionally, IRF8, Spi-1/PU.1, and non-phosphorylated Stat1 form a pre-associated complex at the LILRE region of the IL1B gene. This complex is essential for the inducible activity of IL1B, with IRF8 phosphorylation playing a critical role in its function (Unlu2007Phosphorylation).
