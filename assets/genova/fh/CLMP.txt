# CLMP

## Overview
The CLMP gene encodes the CXADR-like membrane protein, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes, playing a critical role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial tight junctions, which are essential for proper epithelial barrier function. CLMP is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, particularly in the small intestine, where it is crucial for normal intestinal development and function. The protein's structure includes Ig-like domains that facilitate homophilic binding, contributing to its role in cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. Mutations in the CLMP gene are linked to congenital short bowel syndrome and other developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Schreiber2013The; Luissint2014JAMrelated; Rathjen2023The).

## Structure
The human gene CLMP encodes a type I transmembrane protein that is 373 amino acids long with a predicted molecular mass of 41 kD (Rathjen2023The). The primary structure includes a signal peptide, a V-type and C2-type Ig-like domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tail rich in serine residues (Rathjen2023The). The C2 domain contains four cysteine residues forming two intradomain disulfide bridges, contributing to the protein's stability (Rathjen2023The).

The secondary structure of CLMP is characterized by the presence of β-sheets in the Ig domains, as suggested by homology modeling with the CAR protein (Rathjen2023The). The tertiary structure of CLMP's extracellular region has not been fully determined, but it is proposed that the two Ig domains form an elongated, rod-like structure (Rathjen2023The).

In terms of quaternary structure, two CLMP molecules may form a U-shaped homodimer through their N-terminal Ig domains (Rathjen2023The). CLMP has two predicted N-glycosylation sites, which likely contribute to its appearance as a doublet on SDS-PAGE due to different glycosylation forms (Rathjen2023The). The protein is part of the CAR family within the immunoglobulin superfamily, sharing a similar domain structure with other family members (Rathjen2023The).

## Function
The CLMP (CXADR-like membrane protein) gene encodes a cell adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial tight junctions, which are essential for proper epithelial barrier function. CLMP is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, including those in the small intestine, where it colocalizes with tight junction-associated proteins such as ZO-1 and occludin, indicating its involvement in the epithelial tight junction complex (Gharesouran2018First; Luissint2014JAMrelated).

In healthy human cells, CLMP is implicated in several physiological processes, including normal intestinal development and adipocyte differentiation. It is abundantly expressed in the small intestine and is crucial for its development, as evidenced by its association with congenital short bowel syndrome when mutated (Schreiber2013The). CLMP also plays a role in adipocyte differentiation, with its expression upregulated in white adipose tissues in obesity models, suggesting a link to metabolic processes (Schreiber2013The).

CLMP is involved in cell-cell adhesion processes, potentially through homophilic binding facilitated by its Ig-like domains, similar to its structural relative, the CAR protein (Rathjen2023The). This adhesion function is critical for maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating cellular communication.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLMP gene are associated with congenital short bowel syndrome (CSBS), a rare and severe gastrointestinal disorder characterized by a significantly shortened small intestine, leading to malnutrition and poor weight gain (Gharesouran2018First; Rathjen2023The). CSBS is linked to defects in intestinal elongation during embryonic development and impaired peristalsis, which are associated with uncoordinated calcium signaling and reduced levels of connexin43 and 45 in the intestinal smooth muscle (Rathjen2023The). Mutations in the CLMP gene include homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations, nonsense and missense mutations, splicing errors, and deletions, which affect the Ig-like domains of CLMP and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Chuang2020WholeExome; Rathjen2023The).

In addition to CSBS, CLMP mutations have been linked to ureteropelvic junction obstructions in humans, potentially due to impaired ureteral peristalsis, resulting in conditions like bilateral hydronephrosis (Rathjen2023The). CLMP is also expressed in various tissues, including the brain and heart, suggesting that mutations could affect other organs, potentially leading to conditions such as mild mental retardation and increased susceptibility to seizures (Rathjen2023The). The expression of CLMP is modulated by inflammatory cytokines and interferon signaling, indicating potential roles in immune response and inflammation (Rathjen2023The).

## Interactions
CLMP (CXADR like membrane protein) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a cell adhesion molecule. It is known to associate with ZO-1, a tight junction-associated protein, indicating a role in cell junctions and structural integrity (Gharesouran2018First; Schreiber2013The). This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the intestinal epithelium, as CLMP interacts with actin filaments with the assistance of ZO-1 (Gharesouran2018First).

In the context of smooth muscle cells, CLMP is implicated in the regulation of Connexin43 and Connexin45 expression, which are critical for gap junction formation and function. The absence of CLMP leads to a significant reduction in these connexins, impairing cell-cell communication and coordinated muscle contractions (Rathjen2023The; Langhorst2018The). This suggests that CLMP may form a molecular complex with ZO-1 and connexins, although the exact nature of these interactions remains to be fully elucidated (Langhorst2018The).

In the brain, CLMP interacts with subunits of AMPA and kainate receptors, specifically forming complexes with GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPARs and GluK2 and GluK5 subunits of KARs. These interactions are crucial for modulating post-synaptic receptor responses and synapse development (Jang2020Clmp).
