# TBRG4

## Overview
TBRG4, or transforming growth factor beta regulator 4, is a gene that encodes a nuclear DNA-encoded protein involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and stability. The protein, also referred to as TBRG4, is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function by modulating mitochondrial RNA precursors and stabilizing mitochondrial mRNAs, which are essential for energy balance and cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions (Ali2019Nuclear; Carbajosa2022Identification). TBRG4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including mitochondrial respiration, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, through its role in RNA cleavage at specific mitochondrial gene boundaries (Zhang2022Mitochondrial; Carbajosa2022Identification). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as DEAD-Box 56 and Beclin1, further highlight its involvement in cell proliferation, migration, and autophagy regulation (Tao2024High). TBRG4's dysregulation is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tao2024High; Huang2020Knockdown).

## Function
TBRG4, also known as transforming growth factor beta regulator 4, is a nuclear DNA-encoded protein that localizes to the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in mitochondrial RNA processing and stability. It is involved in the processing of mitochondrial RNA precursors and stabilizes several mitochondrial mRNAs, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy balance, particularly under stress conditions (Ali2019Nuclear; Carbajosa2022Identification). TBRG4 is implicated in the cleavage of mitochondrial RNA at specific junctions, such as the MT-TE-MTCYB and MTATP6-MTCO3 junctions, indicating its role in the broader processing of mitochondrial RNA beyond canonical sites (Carbajosa2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, TBRG4 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function by modulating mitochondrial respiration and preventing oxidative stress. It helps maintain the mRNA levels of mitochondrial proteins such as ND3 and COX1 and is involved in the processing of the mitochondrial ND5-CYTB transcript (Zhang2022Mitochondrial). TBRG4's activity in the mitochondria is crucial for proper cellular energy production and homeostasis, impacting processes like cell cycle progression and apoptosis (TBRG4; p&gt; Huang2020&lt).

## Clinical Significance
The TBRG4 gene, also known as FASTKD4, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TBRG4 is abnormally elevated, serving as a diagnostic marker and being associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and unfavorable outcomes. High TBRG4 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and disease-specific survival in HCC patients. It is involved in oxidative phosphorylation and HCC-related signaling pathways, and its knockdown reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Tao2024High).

In osteosarcoma, TBRG4 is overexpressed in tumor tissues and cell lines, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Knockdown of TBRG4 in osteosarcoma cells results in reduced proliferation and invasion, increased apoptosis, and downregulation of the TGF-β1 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, indicating its role in cancer progression (Huang2020Knockdown).

In lung cancer, TBRG4 knockdown affects the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis, such as DDIT3, CAV1, and RRM2, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related pathways and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2017Knockdown).

## Interactions
TBRG4, also known as transforming growth factor beta regulator 4, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, TBRG4 interacts with DEAD-Box 56 (DDX56), forming part of a signaling pathway that includes p-AKT and GSK3β, which is crucial for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Tao2024High). TBRG4 also binds to Beclin1, a protein involved in autophagy, suggesting a role in regulating ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Tao2024High).

In prostate cancer, TBRG4 is a target of the ERG and BRD4 proteins, which co-occupy chromatin loci and regulate gene expression related to cancer progression and cell proliferation (Blee2016BET). TBRG4 is also implicated in mitochondrial RNA processing, where it is involved in RNA cleavage at specific mitochondrial gene boundaries, indicating its role in mitochondrial transcriptome regulation (Carbajosa2022Identification).

Additionally, TBRG4 participates in autoregulatory mechanisms through alternative splicing coupled with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (AS-NMD), where it binds its own pre-mRNA to regulate its expression levels (Pervouchine2018Novel). These interactions highlight TBRG4's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential impact on cancer and mitochondrial function.
