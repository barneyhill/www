# ETDC

## Overview
The ETDC gene encodes the protein known as embryonic testis differentiation homolog C, which plays a crucial role in the development of the embryonic testis. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression during the differentiation of embryonic tissues. The ETDC protein is implicated in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, a signaling cascade essential for proper testis development and function (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of ETDC and its interactions is vital for elucidating the genetic basis of disorders related to testis differentiation and development.
