# BTBD2

## Overview
BTBD2 is a gene that encodes the BTB domain containing 2 protein, which is a member of the BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal region that interacts with human topoisomerase I (TOP1), a key enzyme in DNA replication and transcription (Xu2002Characterization). The BTBD2 protein is widely expressed in human tissues, with particularly high expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting its role as a housekeeping gene (Xu2002Characterization). Functionally, BTBD2 is involved in cellular processes such as DNA repair and protein degradation pathways, interacting with proteins like TRIM5δ, which is involved in ubiquitination (Xu2003BTBD1). Clinically, BTBD2 has been implicated in glioblastoma multiforme, where specific polymorphisms in the gene are associated with patient survival outcomes (Liu2010Polymorphisms).

## Structure
BTBD2 is a protein that contains an amino-terminal BTB/POZ domain, which is a conserved 120 amino acid domain rich in hydrophobic residues. This domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, specifically mediating homodimerization and heterodimerization (Xu2002Characterization). The BTBD2 protein also includes a C-terminal region related to proteins with the kelch domain, although it lacks the characteristic residues of kelch repeats (Xu2002Characterization). 

The BTBD2 protein is part of the BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) family, which includes a conserved carboxy-terminal region known as the 'PHR-like' region. This region is approximately 170 residues long and is predicted to have an all-β fold, potentially forming a novel type of β-propeller structure (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins). 

BTBD2 interacts with human topoisomerase I (TOP1), with the C-terminal half of BTBD2, particularly the last 50 residues, being critical for this interaction (Xu2002Characterization). The protein is widely expressed in human tissues, with higher expression in skeletal muscle, and its mRNA is characterized by a high GC content (Xu2002Characterization). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
BTBD2 is a protein that interacts with human topoisomerase I (TOP1), a key enzyme involved in DNA replication and transcription. The interaction between BTBD2 and TOP1 is mediated by the C-terminal region of BTBD2, which binds to specific residues on TOP1 (Xu2002Characterization). Although BTBD2 slightly inhibits the supercoil relaxation activity of TOP1, it does not significantly affect its catalytic activity (Xu2002Characterization).

BTBD2 is localized to cytoplasmic bodies and can co-localize with TOP1 when co-transfected in cells (Xu2002Characterization). It also interacts with TRIM5δ, a protein involved in ubiquitination processes, suggesting a potential role in protein degradation pathways (Xu2003BTBD1). The BTB/POZ domain in BTBD2 is crucial for its interactions and localization within the cell, indicating its involvement in protein-protein interactions (Xu2003BTBD1).

BTBD2 is expressed in various human tissues, with higher expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting it may function as a housekeeping gene (Xu2002Characterization). Its exact role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but it is implicated in cellular processes involving DNA repair and protein interactions (Xu2002Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
BTBD2 (BTB domain containing 2) has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor. Research has identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11670188 in the BTBD2 gene as a predictor of short-term survival in GBM patients. This polymorphism is associated with a decreased survival time, highlighting its potential role in influencing the prognosis of glioblastoma (Liu2010Polymorphisms).

BTBD2 is involved in the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity. Alterations in BTBD2 expression or its interactions, particularly with DNA Top II alpha, have been linked to survival outcomes in GBM. High expression levels of DNA Top II alpha, associated with BTBD2, correlate with prolonged survival, suggesting that BTBD2's role in DSBR is significant for tumorigenesis prevention and cell survival (Liu2010Polymorphisms).

The study by Liu et al. also suggests that genetic variations in BTBD2 and its interaction network, including genes like LIG4, HMGA2, and RTEL1, may impact the effectiveness of treatments such as radiation or chemotherapy, further influencing survival outcomes in glioblastoma patients (Liu2010Polymorphisms). However, the study does not address other diseases or conditions associated with BTBD2 mutations.

## Interactions
BTBD2 interacts with human topoisomerase I (TOP1), a protein involved in DNA replication and transcription. This interaction was identified through two-hybrid screens and confirmed by GST-pulldown assays using HeLa cell nuclear extracts. The C-terminal region of BTBD2, specifically residues 215-329 of TOP1, is crucial for this binding, while the BTB domain of BTBD2 is not required for the interaction (Xu2002Characterization). The interaction does not significantly affect the catalytic activities of TOP1, such as supercoil relaxation or DNA cleavage (Xu2002Characterization).

BTBD2 also colocalizes with TRIM5δ, a member of the TRIM protein family, in cytoplasmic bodies. This colocalization suggests a potential interaction, as TRIM5δ serves as a scaffold for BTBD2 and exhibits autoubiquitin ligase activity (Xu2003BTBD1). The interaction with TRIM5δ involves the coiled-coil region and possibly other domains like the B-box zinc finger (Xu2003BTBD1).

BTBD2's interaction with TOP1 is also implicated in the restriction of HIV-1 infection. Specific residues in TOP1, E236 and N237, are required for binding to BTBD2, and RNA interference of BTBD2 increases cell permissiveness to HIV-1 infection (Khurana2010Human).
