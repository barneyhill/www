# GUCY1B1

## Overview
The GUCY1B1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a critical enzyme in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. This enzyme functions as a heterodimer, composed of alpha and beta subunits, with GUCY1B1 providing the beta subunit necessary for its activity. Soluble guanylate cyclase is primarily located in the cytoplasm and acts as a receptor for NO, which binds to the heme cofactor of the beta subunit, significantly enhancing the enzyme's activity. Upon activation, sGC catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation, platelet aggregation inhibition, and neurotransmission (Curtis2021Analysis; Vishnolia2021sGC). The GUCY1B1 gene, through its role in sGC, is implicated in cardiovascular health and disease, as well as in cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Schenk2021Soluble; Mauersberger2021Loss).

## Structure
The GUCY1B1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is a heterodimeric enzyme involved in nitric oxide signaling. The primary structure of the GUCY1B1 protein includes a heme-binding domain, which is essential for the enzyme's activation by nitric oxide, and a catalytic domain responsible for converting GTP to cGMP (Curtis2023Analysis). The secondary structure of the protein features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. 

In terms of tertiary structure, the GUCY1B1 protein folds into a conformation that allows it to interact effectively with its partner subunit, forming a functional enzyme complex. The quaternary structure of sGC involves the formation of a heterodimer with the alpha subunit, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Curtis2023Analysis). 

Common post-translational modifications of the GUCY1B1 protein include phosphorylation and nitrosylation, which can regulate its activity and stability. These modifications play a role in the protein's function in various physiological processes, including vasodilation and platelet aggregation (Curtis2023Analysis). The protein's structure and modifications are critical for its role in cardiovascular health and disease.

## Function
The GUCY1B1 gene encodes the beta subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), an enzyme that plays a critical role in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway. This enzyme is a heterodimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, with GUCY1B1 providing the beta subunit necessary for its function. sGC is primarily located in the cytoplasm and acts as a receptor for NO, which binds to the heme cofactor of the beta subunit, significantly enhancing the enzyme's activity. Upon activation by NO, sGC catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Curtis2021Analysis; Vishnolia2021sGC).

cGMP serves as a second messenger in various physiological processes, including the regulation of vascular tone, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and neurotransmission. In the cardiovascular system, cGMP mediates vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby playing a crucial role in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular health (Curtis2021Analysis; Vishnolia2021sGC). The GUCY1B1 gene, through its role in sGC, is also implicated in the regulation of blood flow and vascular function, as demonstrated in model organisms like zebrafish (Vishnolia2021sGC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GUCY1B1 gene, which encodes the beta subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of cardiovascular health, variants in GUCY1B1 are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. The loss of sGC in platelets leads to increased leukocyte adhesion, larger atherosclerotic plaques, and enhanced vascular inflammation, primarily due to reduced release of angiopoietin-1, a factor that inhibits endothelial cell activation and leukocyte adhesion (Mauersberger2021Loss). 

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), GUCY1B1 expression is upregulated during disease progression and is linked to acquired chemoresistance. This upregulation is associated with the activation of the sGC signaling pathway, which mediates resistance to chemotherapy drugs like etoposide. Targeting GUCY1B1 expression or the sGC pathway has been suggested as a potential strategy to overcome chemoresistance in SCLC (Schenk2021Soluble). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GUCY1B1 in both cardiovascular and cancer-related contexts.

## Interactions
The GUCY1B1 gene encodes the β1 subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which forms a heterodimer with the α1 subunit encoded by GUCY1A1. This heterodimer is the active form of sGC, a key receptor for nitric oxide (NO) that catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cyclic GMP (cGMP), a crucial signaling molecule in various cellular processes (Zhou2019TMPRSS2ERG). The β1 subunit is essential for the stabilization of the α1 subunit protein expression, suggesting a physical interaction between these subunits (Zhou2019TMPRSS2ERG).

In prostate cancer cells, particularly those positive for the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, the β1 subunit plays a critical role in driving cGMP synthesis and is involved in cancer cell proliferation. The β1 subunit also upregulates genes involved in NO-cGMP signaling pathways, including those related to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and calcium signaling (Zhou2019TMPRSS2ERG). The β1 subunit's activity is crucial for the NO-cGMP pathway, which is a downstream effector of ERG in promoting cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Zhou2019TMPRSS2ERG).
