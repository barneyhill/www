# TMEM198

## Overview
TMEM198 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 198, which is integral to cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM198 is primarily located within the cell membrane, where it functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating critical molecular interactions necessary for the activation of signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin. This protein enhances LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling by promoting the phosphorylation of LRP6, a process essential for the pathway's activation (Jeong2021Regulation; Krishnamurthy2021Optogenetic). TMEM198's role in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing organismal development by regulating how cells grow and differentiate (Zhu2021Transmembrane). The ongoing research into TMEM198's molecular mechanisms continues to reveal its significance in fundamental biological processes.

## Structure


## Function
TMEM198, or transmembrane protein 198, is a protein encoded by the TMEM198 gene in humans. It plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, which are crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. TMEM198 is predominantly located in the cell membrane, where it engages in molecular interactions that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. These interactions are vital for the proper signaling processes that ensure cells respond appropriately to various stimuli, thereby maintaining the balance and health of the cell. The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests it may have a broader impact on organismal development and function by influencing how cells grow and differentiate into specialized types. The precise molecular mechanisms by which TMEM198 exerts its effects are still under investigation, but its role in cellular signaling highlights its importance in fundamental biological processes.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TMEM198 is a transmembrane protein that plays a role in enhancing LRP6-mediated Wnt signaling. It acts as a scaffold protein for CK1γ and LRP6, facilitating LRP6 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Jeong2021Regulation). TMEM198 promotes the aggregation and CK1γ-induced phosphorylation of LRP6, enhancing its function. By fusing the cytosolic domain of TMEM198 to LRP6c, researchers have achieved more robust phosphorylation, improving the activation state of LRP6c (Krishnamurthy2021Optogenetic).

TMEM198 interacts with LRP6 and recruits CK1 family proteins for phosphorylation, similar to the function of TMEM97, although there is no significant sequence identity between TMEM198 and TMEM97 (Zhu2021Transmembrane). This interaction is significant in the context of Wnt signaling, as it enhances the phosphorylation and activation of LRP6, thereby promoting the signaling pathway. The role of TMEM198 in these interactions highlights its importance in cellular signaling processes, particularly in the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.
