# GOLGA7B

## Overview
GOLGA7B is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A7 family member B, which is integral to cellular adhesion processes. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in stabilizing the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5 at the plasma membrane, a function critical for the palmitoylation and proper localization of desmosomal proteins such as Desmoglein-2 and Plakophilin-3. These proteins are essential for the assembly and maintenance of desmosomes, which are structures that facilitate cell-cell adhesion. The palmitoylation of GOLGA7B itself is necessary to prevent the internalization of DHHC5, thereby ensuring its functional presence at the plasma membrane. The interaction between GOLGA7B and DHHC5 is vital for maintaining cellular structure and function, with implications for conditions such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and cancer metastasis (Woodley2018Sacylated; Woodley2019S‐acylated).

## Function
GOLGA7B encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and desmosome assembly in healthy human cells. The protein is involved in the stabilization of DHHC5, a palmitoyl acyltransferase, at the plasma membrane. This stabilization is essential for the proper palmitoylation and localization of desmosomal proteins such as Desmoglein-2 (DSG2) and Plakophilin-3 (PKP3), which are critical for cell adhesion processes (Woodley2019S‐acylated).

Palmitoylation of GOLGA7B is necessary for its function, as it prevents the internalization of DHHC5, thereby maintaining its presence at the plasma membrane. This interaction ensures the correct trafficking and localization of desmosomal proteins, facilitating their incorporation into desmosomes (Woodley2019S‐acylated). The loss of either DHHC5 or GOLGA7B leads to defects in cell adhesion, highlighting the importance of GOLGA7B in maintaining cellular structure and function (Woodley2018Sacylated).

GOLGA7B's role extends to influencing the interactome of DHHC5, affecting its interactions with other proteins involved in cell adhesion, such as clathrin heavy chain and ZO-1, further underscoring its significance in cellular adhesion mechanisms (Woodley2019S‐acylated).

## Interactions
GOLGA7B interacts with the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5, playing a crucial role in stabilizing DHHC5 at the plasma membrane. This interaction is essential for the proper localization and function of DHHC5, which is involved in cell adhesion processes. GOLGA7B is palmitoylated by DHHC5, and this modification prevents the internalization of DHHC5, thereby maintaining its presence at the plasma membrane (Woodley2019S‐acylated). The interaction between GOLGA7B and DHHC5 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and the palmitoylation of DHHC5 is necessary for this interaction (Woodley2019S‐acylated).

GOLGA7B also affects the interactome of DHHC5, influencing its interaction with proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and cell adhesion, such as desmoglein-2 and plakophilin-3 (Woodley2018Sacylated; Woodley2019S‐acylated). The presence of GOLGA7B is necessary for the proper localization of DHHC5 to the plasma membrane, as depletion of GOLGA7B leads to reduced plasma membrane localization of DHHC5 (Woodley2018Sacylated). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of desmosome assembly and cell adhesion, with implications for diseases like arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and cancer metastasis (Woodley2019S‐acylated).
