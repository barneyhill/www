# CMTM1

## Overview
CMTM1, or CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing 1, is a gene located on chromosome 16q21 that encodes a protein belonging to the CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family. This family is characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain, which is involved in vesicle transport and membrane binding-related events (Liang2021Comprehensive; Li2020ChemokineLike). The CMTM1 gene is known for its extensive alternative splicing, resulting in at least 23 isoforms, each potentially contributing to diverse biological functions (Cao2019A; Li2020ChemokineLike). The protein is predominantly expressed in testis tissue but is also found in various tumors, suggesting a role in cancer progression and resistance to apoptosis (Li2020ChemokineLike). Notably, the CMTM1-v5 isoform, which lacks the MARVEL domain, interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein CAML, influencing apoptosis in tumor cells (Cao2019A). The expression patterns and interactions of CMTM1 highlight its potential significance in cancer biology and as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The CMTM1 protein is part of the CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family, characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain. This domain is associated with a four transmembrane helix architecture, which plays a role in vesicle transport and membrane binding-related events (Liang2021Comprehensive; Li2020ChemokineLike). The CMTM1 gene is located on chromosome 16q21 and produces at least 23 alternatively spliced isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Cao2019A; Li2020ChemokineLike). Among these isoforms, CMTM1-v5 is notable for lacking the MARVEL domain and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Cao2019A).

The CMTM1 protein is predominantly expressed in testis tissue, but certain isoforms, such as CMTM1-v17, are highly expressed in various tumors, including breast, kidney, lung, ovarian, and liver cancers (Li2020ChemokineLike). The protein's expression and isoform diversity suggest potential roles in cancer progression and resistance to apoptosis, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CMTM1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, the isoform CMTM1_v17 is highly expressed in tumor tissues and is associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. This suggests that CMTM1_v17 may contribute to cancer cell survival and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (WANG2014CMTM1v17). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CMTM1 expression is linked to shorter survival times, while low expression correlates with longer disease-free survival. CMTM1 expression is considered an independent prognostic factor for HCC, indicating its potential as a biomarker for patient outcomes (Song2021Expression).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high expression of CMTM1_v17 is associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. It is identified as an independent prognostic risk factor, suggesting its role in predicting chemotherapy efficacy and patient outcomes (Si2017CMTM1v17).

In ovarian cancer, high CMTM1 expression is linked to shorter overall survival and progression-free survival, indicating a poor prognosis. The gene is associated with changes in the immune microenvironment, which may influence cancer progression (Zhang2022Identification).

## Interactions
CMTM1, specifically its isoform CMTM1-v5, has been shown to interact physically with the endoplasmic reticulum protein CAML. This interaction was initially identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, demonstrating a direct physical association between CMTM1-v5 and CAML. Immunofluorescence staining further verified that CMTM1-v5 colocalizes with CAML in small punctate structures within the cytoplasm, suggesting a specific interaction that may influence the protein's function in inducing apoptosis in tumor cells (Cao2019A).

The interaction between CMTM1-v5 and CAML is significant in the context of apoptosis in lymphoma cells. CMTM1-v5, a spliced isoform of CMTM1, inhibits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis. CAML, involved in intracellular calcium signaling, negatively regulates CMTM1-v5-induced apoptosis. The interaction modulates the NF-AT signaling pathway, which is crucial for calcium release and calcineurin activation. CMTM1-v5 suppresses NF-AT signaling and reduces calcium flux caused by CAML, suggesting that the interaction is essential for CMTM1-v5's apoptotic effect through mitochondrial and ER stress pathways (Cao2019A).
