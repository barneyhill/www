# SON

## Overview
The SON gene encodes the SON DNA and RNA binding protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its large size and the presence of several functional domains, including a serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain, a glycine-rich G-patch, and a double-stranded RNA binding motif (Ahn2011SON). SON is primarily localized in nuclear speckles, where it facilitates the splicing of pre-mRNA by interacting with various splicing factors and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (Kim2021SON; Sharma2010Son). The protein is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and genome stability, with its deficiency leading to defects in mitotic spindle organization (Ahn2011SON). Clinically, mutations in the SON gene are linked to Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a disorder characterized by intellectual disability and developmental anomalies, underscoring the gene's significance in human health (Dingemans2021Establishing; Kushary2021ZTTK).

## Structure
The SON protein is a large, multifunctional protein composed of 2426 amino acids, featuring several domains crucial for its role in RNA processing and splicing. It contains a serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain, a glycine-rich motif known as the G-patch, and a double-stranded RNA binding motif (DSRM) (Ahn2011SON). The RS domain is essential for targeting the protein to nuclear speckles and facilitating interactions with other splicing factors (Sharma2010Son). The G-patch and RS domain are identified as core motifs necessary for SON-mediated splicing, while the DSRM is considered dispensable for this function (Ahn2011SON).

SON's structure also includes multiple serine-rich tandem repeats, which are hypothesized to serve a scaffolding role in nuclear speckles, similar to the repeated heptad sequence in the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Sharma2010Son). These repeats are crucial for maintaining proper nuclear speckle organization (Sharma2010Son). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its distribution and function within the cell (Sharma2010Son). Multiple splice variants of SON exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Ahn2011SON).

## Function
The SON gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in RNA splicing and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. SON is a large Ser/Arg (SR)-related protein that acts as a splicing cofactor, essential for the efficient splicing of cell-cycle regulators. It facilitates the interaction of SR proteins with RNA polymerase II and other spliceosome components, which is crucial for cotranscriptional RNA processing (Ahn2011SON). SON is particularly important for the splicing of genes with weak splice sites, ensuring accurate splice site recognition and selection (Ahn2011SON).

In the nucleus, SON is localized to nuclear speckles, which are subnuclear structures involved in the storage and modification of pre-mRNA splicing factors. It is essential for maintaining the proper organization of these speckles, which is crucial for the functioning of pre-mRNA splicing (Sharma2010Son). SON's presence in nuclear speckles and its interaction with splicing factors like SRrp53 suggest its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing (Sharma2010Son).

SON also plays a role in cell cycle progression by ensuring proper mitotic spindle organization and microtubule dynamics, which are essential for cell morphology and function. Its deficiency leads to defects in spindle pole separation and chromosome alignment, highlighting its importance in maintaining genome stability and facilitating cell division (Ahn2011SON).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SON gene are primarily associated with Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim (ZTTK) syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical features. These include intellectual disability, developmental delay, brain malformations, facial dysmorphisms, and various congenital anomalies affecting the heart, urogenital system, and musculoskeletal system (Dingemans2021Establishing; Kushary2021ZTTK). The syndrome is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the SON gene, leading to haploinsufficiency and resulting in defects in RNA splicing and gene expression (Ueda2020Knockdown; Yang2019Clinical).

SON gene mutations often result in truncated proteins due to frameshift or nonsense mutations, which are typically degraded by nonsense-mediated decay, reducing SON expression levels (Slezak2020Phenotypic). This insufficiency affects neuronal migration and dendritic spine formation, contributing to the neurological symptoms observed in ZTTK syndrome (Ueda2020Knockdown). Missense variants in the SON gene may cause ZTTK syndrome through different mechanisms, potentially affecting the DNA binding region and altering transcriptional repression (Kushary2021ZTTK; VasquezForero2023Case). The clinical significance of these variants remains under investigation, with ongoing research aimed at understanding genotype-phenotype correlations (Kushary2021ZTTK).

## Interactions
The SON protein is a DNA and RNA binding protein that plays a significant role in RNA splicing and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, forming distinct multiprotein complexes. SON is known to interact with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), including hnRNP A2B1, hnRNP M, hnRNP H, and hnRNP K, but not with RBFOX2 or hnRNP U (Kim2021SON). The interaction between SON and hnRNP A2B1 is particularly important, as it cooperatively regulates the expression of PTBP2, a splicing factor, by blocking RBFOX2-mediated exon inclusion (Kim2021SON).

SON also influences the splicing of PTBP2 by interacting with RBFOX2, another RNA-binding protein. SON and RBFOX2 competitively bind to the intron sequences flanking the PTBP2 cassette exon, affecting exon 10 inclusion or skipping (Kim2021SON). This competitive interaction is crucial for regulating alternative splicing in glioblastoma cells, where SON inhibits RBFOX2-mediated exon inclusion (Kim2021SON).

In glioblastoma, SON is overexpressed and forms a complex with hnRNP A2B1 to antagonize RBFOX2, affecting the inclusion of neuronal-specific exons (Kim2021SON). These interactions highlight SON's role in maintaining oncogenic splicing programs and its potential as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma (Kim2021SON).
