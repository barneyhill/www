# OR5I1

## Overview
The OR5I1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily I member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is integral to the olfactory system, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. Characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, the OR5I1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorant molecules, triggering a neuronal response that contributes to the sense of smell (Yoshihito2012Olfactory). The gene has been subject to evolutionary pressures, with certain nonsynonymous polymorphisms, such as the Ser to Phe replacement at codon 76, potentially enhancing receptor stability and function (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). These adaptations underscore the gene's significance in human sensory perception and its evolutionary importance.

## Structure
The OR5I1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. These transmembrane domains are crucial for ligand binding, with specific regions forming a binding pocket for odorant molecules (Yoshihito2012Olfactory; MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). The primary structure of OR5I1 includes amino acid sequences that undergo nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resulting in different protein variants. Notably, the Ser to Phe replacement at codon 76 in the second transmembrane domain is significant, as it may alter the receptor's structure and stabilize it within the hydrophobic membrane environment (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures).

The secondary structure of OR5I1 likely involves alpha helices typical of GPCRs, contributing to the formation of the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, which is essential for the receptor's function and ligand specificity. Although the quaternary structure is less common in GPCRs, the structural modeling of OR5I1 using bovine rhodopsin as a template provides insights into its potential configuration (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). The study of OR5I1 highlights the evolutionary significance of these structural changes, suggesting they may have been subject to positive selection due to their impact on receptor function (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures).

## Function
The OR5I1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules. These receptors are characterized by seven transmembrane domains, which are essential for ligand binding and signal transduction (Yoshihito2012Olfactory; MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). The OR5I1 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a neuronal response that contributes to the perception of smell (Yoshihito2012Olfactory).

A significant feature of the OR5I1 protein is a nonsynonymous polymorphism that results in a Ser to Phe replacement at codon 76. This amino acid change is thought to enhance the structural stability of the receptor, potentially altering its odorant-binding properties and influencing interactions between transmembrane domains (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). The OR5I1 gene has undergone positive selection, suggesting that these structural changes may be advantageous, possibly affecting the receptor's function in odorant binding and specificity (MorenoEstrada2007Signatures). This evolutionary adaptation highlights the importance of OR5I1 in the olfactory system and its role in human sensory perception.
