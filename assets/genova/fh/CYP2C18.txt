# CYP2C18

## Overview
CYP2C18 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 18, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are critical in the metabolism of various substances, including drugs, cholesterol, and steroids. CYP2C18 is primarily expressed in the liver, with notable activity in skin and lung tissues, where it contributes to the biotransformation of therapeutic drugs and endogenous compounds (L??pple2003Differential; Ibeanu1995Transcriptional). Although it is expressed at lower levels compared to other CYP2C isoforms, CYP2C18 plays a significant role in drug metabolism and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including potential antitumor effects and inflammatory bowel disease (Du2021Revisiting; Deng2023Study). The enzyme's activity and expression are regulated by complex interactions at both the transcriptional and RNA splicing levels, highlighting its intricate role in human biology (Zaphiropoulos1999RNA; Ibeanu1995Transcriptional).

## Function
CYP2C18 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs and the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver, where it contributes to the biotransformation of various therapeutic drugs and endogenous compounds, impacting drug clearance and hormone regulation (L??pple2003Differential; Ibeanu1995Transcriptional). Although CYP2C18 is expressed at lower levels compared to other CYP2C isoforms, it is a significant enzyme in skin and lung tissues, where it is involved in the metabolism of drugs such as (S)-methylphenidate and warfarin (Deng2023Study).

The transcriptional regulation of CYP2C18 is less active compared to CYP2C9, as indicated by the weaker promoter activity and lower protein concentrations in human liver tissues (Ibeanu1995Transcriptional). Despite its lower expression, CYP2C18 has been noted for its potential antitumor effects, although these effects are not fully expressed and require further study (Deng2023Study). The enzyme's activity is influenced by various transcription factors and DNA elements, which regulate its expression in a tissue-specific manner (Ibeanu1995Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
CYP2C18 has been identified as a novel marker for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC). Research has shown that CYP2C18 is upregulated in affected individuals compared to unaffected ones in discordant IBD twin pairs, suggesting its potential role in IBD pathogenesis (Du2021Revisiting). The gene is specifically expressed in the colon or small intestine, and its expression increases in response to inflammation signaling, indicating its involvement in the immune response associated with IBD (Du2021Revisiting). Immunohistochemistry analysis has confirmed higher expression levels of CYP2C18 in UC-affected cases compared to normal individuals, supporting its candidacy as a susceptibility gene for IBD (Du2021Revisiting).

In addition to its role in IBD, CYP2C18 is polymorphically expressed, with known mutant alleles such as CYP2C18m1 and CYP2C18m2. These mutations are coincident with CYP2C19 mutations, which are associated with a poor metabolizer phenotype affecting drug metabolism (Mizugaki2000Rapid). Although the clinical implications of CYP2C18 mutations are less clear compared to other CYP2C enzymes, its expression and genetic variations may influence drug metabolism and susceptibility to certain conditions (Mizugaki2000Rapid).

## Interactions
CYP2C18, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in various interactions that influence its transcriptional regulation and expression. The promoter region of CYP2C18 interacts with nuclear proteins, although these interactions are weaker compared to those of CYP2C9. This is primarily due to differences in the HPF-1 motif, which affects the binding affinity of nuclear proteins. The HPF-1 motif in CYP2C18 forms only minor bands in gel shift assays, indicating weaker interactions with nuclear proteins (Ibeanu1995Transcriptional). Mutations in the HPF-1 motif, specifically changing cytosines to guanines, enhance the binding of nuclear proteins, suggesting that the nucleotide sequence is crucial for interaction (Ibeanu1995Transcriptional).

CYP2C18 is also involved in complex splicing events at the RNA level, where its exons can be spliced with those from other members of the CYP2C subfamily, such as CYP2C19. This suggests potential interactions at the RNA level, although these events are infrequent and not abundant (Zaphiropoulos1999RNA). These interactions highlight the complexity of CYP2C18's role in gene expression and regulation.
