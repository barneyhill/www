# GOLT1B

## Overview
GOLT1B (Golgi Transport 1B) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein integral to the function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. The GOLT1B protein plays a pivotal role in vesicular trafficking, facilitating the movement of vesicles within the Golgi membrane, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein processing. This protein's activity is crucial for the proper distribution of proteins and lipids, impacting various cellular activities and overall organismal health. GOLT1B's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular machinery, ensuring that proteins and lipids reach their intended destinations to support numerous physiological functions (Liu2021Vesicle; Cramer2023A).

## Structure


## Function
GOLT1B (Golgi Transport 1B) encodes a protein that is integral to the transport processes within the Golgi apparatus, a key organelle responsible for the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids. The GOLT1B protein is involved in vesicular trafficking, a critical cellular process that ensures the proper delivery of materials within the cell. This protein is active in the Golgi membrane, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein processing. By facilitating the movement of vesicles, GOLT1B plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus, impacting the overall efficiency of protein and lipid processing in the cell. This function is essential for the correct distribution of proteins and lipids, which are vital for numerous cellular activities and organismal health. The activity of GOLT1B in the Golgi membrane underscores its importance in the cellular machinery, ensuring that proteins and lipids reach their intended destinations, thereby supporting various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The GOLT1B gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. Elevated GOLT1B mRNA and protein expression levels are observed in several cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma. High expression levels are associated with poor overall survival in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma and bladder urothelial carcinoma (Tian2023A). Genetic alterations, primarily copy number amplifications, are common in tumors, with the highest frequency in non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. These alterations correlate with increased mRNA expression and poorer survival outcomes (Tian2023A).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), GOLT1B is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes CRC metastasis by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GOLT1B also interacts with DVL2 and PD-L2, contributing to immune escape and tumor progression (Liu2021Vesicle). The gene's expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly CD4+ T lymphocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts, influencing the tumor microenvironment and potentially affecting cancer immunotherapy (Tian2023A).

## Interactions
GOLT1B is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cancer metastasis and cellular processes. In colorectal cancer, GOLT1B interacts with the protein DVL2, facilitating its localization to the cell membrane and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell adhesion and metastasis (Liu2021Vesicle). This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments, demonstrating co-localization of GOLT1B and DVL2 (Liu2021Vesicle). GOLT1B also interacts with PD-L2, increasing its level on the cell membrane, which is involved in immune escape mechanisms (Liu2021Vesicle).

In the context of ER export, GOLT1B is part of a complex with YIPF5 and GOT1A, interacting with inner COPII coat components SEC23/24. This complex is involved in the early secretory pathway, although GOLT1B is not considered part of the core ER-export machinery (Cramer2023A). The interaction with YIPF5 is significant, as it suggests a role in linking secretion and ER stress (Cramer2023A). These interactions highlight GOLT1B's involvement in both cancer progression and cellular transport processes.
