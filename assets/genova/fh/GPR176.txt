# GPR176

## Overview
GPR176 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 176, a class A orphan receptor characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, typical of GPCRs. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, functioning independently of ligands by coupling with the Gz protein to modulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain. The receptor's activity is crucial for maintaining normal circadian rhythms by acting as a negative modulator of cAMP synthesis, counterbalancing the VIP-VIPR2 signaling pathway. Structurally, GPR176 is notable for its unique features, such as the absence of an aspartic acid at position 2.50 and a conserved DRYxxV motif, which are essential for its function and interaction with G-proteins. Clinically, alterations in GPR176 expression have been linked to various cancers, including breast and gastric cancer, where it influences tumor progression and patient prognosis (Doi2016Gpr176; Nakagawa2020TimeRestricted; Yun2023Oncogenic; Zhang2023High).

## Structure
GPR176 is a class A orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs (Doi2016Gpr176). The receptor has a unique structural feature, lacking an aspartic acid at position 2.50, which is uncommon among class A GPCRs (Doi2016Gpr176). The N-terminal region of GPR176 contains four putative glycosylation sites, specifically at asparagine residues N4, N11, N17, and N26, which are crucial for proper protein expression and stability (Wang2020Identification). N-glycosylation is the primary post-translational modification observed, as O-glycosylation does not affect the protein's mobility (Wang2020Identification).

The C-terminal domain of GPR176 is relatively large, consisting of about 200 amino acids, and is highly conserved across species, suggesting a critical functional role, although its exact interactions remain unclear (Doi2016Gpr176). The receptor also features a conserved DRYxxV motif at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane domain III, which is important for coupling with G-proteins (Doi2016Gpr176). The absence of detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of GPR176 limits further structural characterization (Wang2020Identification; Doi2016Gpr176).

## Function
GPR176 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms in mammals. It is predominantly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, which is the central circadian clock. GPR176 exhibits agonist-independent basal activity, meaning it can function without a ligand, and it couples with the Gz protein, a member of the Gi/o subfamily, to reduce cyclic AMP (cAMP) production (Doi2016Gpr176; Nakagawa2020TimeRestricted). This reduction in cAMP is crucial for maintaining normal circadian rhythms, as it acts as a negative modulator of cAMP synthesis, counteracting the positive cAMP signaling via the VIP-VIPR2 axis (Nakagawa2020TimeRestricted; kunisue2019roles).

The expression of GPR176 is circadian, peaking at night, which aligns with its role in suppressing cAMP levels during this period. This suppression is essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock, as it influences the expression of clock genes such as Per1 (Doi2016Gpr176; kunisue2019roles). The absence of GPR176 leads to increased cAMP levels and a shortened circadian period, highlighting its importance in circadian regulation (Doi2016Gpr176; Nakagawa2020TimeRestricted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPR176 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast and gastric cancer. In breast cancer, GPR176 expression is downregulated at the mRNA level but upregulated at the protein level, suggesting a complex role in breast carcinogenesis. This discrepancy may be due to rapid mRNA translation and protein stability. GPR176 mRNA hypoexpression is linked to promoter hypermethylation, which serves as a regulatory mechanism in breast cancer. The gene's expression is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, influencing proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Its expression correlates with recurrence-free survival and overall survival in certain breast cancer subtypes, but negatively with overall survival in patients with lymph node involvement or estrogen receptor positivity (Yun2023Oncogenic).

In gastric cancer, GPR176 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with high expression levels correlating with poor prognosis. It is identified as an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High GPR176 expression is also linked to increased immune cell infiltration and potentially reduced efficacy of immunotherapy, suggesting its role in tumor progression and immune response (Zhang2023High).

N-glycosylation of GPR176 is crucial for its protein expression, and mutations affecting this process can lead to reduced protein levels and altered activity, although the intrinsic activity remains unaffected (Wang2020Identification).

## Interactions
GPR176, a G protein-coupled receptor, is primarily associated with the Gz protein, a member of the Gi/o subfamily. This interaction is crucial for its function in reducing cAMP accumulation, as demonstrated by experiments where the knockdown of Gz abrogated GPR176's ability to suppress cAMP levels (Doi2016Gpr176). GPR176's interaction with Gz is significant because it operates independently of the canonical Gi protein, highlighting a unique specificity that may be attributed to differences in the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of these G-proteins (Doi2016Gpr176).

In the context of circadian rhythms, GPR176 colocalizes with the Vipr2 receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), suggesting a competitive interaction with the Vip-Vipr2-cAMP signaling pathway. This interaction is part of a mechanism that represses cAMP at night, counteracting the Vip-Vipr2 axis (Doi2016Gpr176). The receptor's intrinsic activity is regulated by its expression levels, which are circadian, and its absence leads to reduced cAMP suppression at night, affecting the circadian period (Doi2016Gpr176).

In breast cancer, GPR176 is involved in various signaling pathways, including the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which influences proliferation and anti-apoptosis. However, specific details on direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided (Yun2023Oncogenic).
