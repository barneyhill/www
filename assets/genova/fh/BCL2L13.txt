# BCL2L13

## Overview
BCL2L13 is a gene located on human chromosome 22 that encodes the Bcl-2-like protein 13, also known as BCL-Rambo. This protein is a member of the Bcl-2 family and is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the mitochondrial outer membrane, and its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. BCL2L13 plays a pivotal role in mitophagy, acting as a receptor that facilitates the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria, thereby maintaining mitochondrial quality control. It is capable of interacting with various mitochondrial components, such as adenine nucleotide translocator and voltage-dependent anion channel, to mediate apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways. The protein's ability to exhibit both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions is context-dependent, highlighting its complex role in cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Kim2023BCL2L13; Meng2020BCL2L13:).

## Structure
BCL2L13, also known as BCL-Rambo, is a BCL2-like protein encoded by the BCL2L13 gene on human chromosome 22. The protein contains all four BH domains (BH1-4) and a unique BHNo region, followed by a trans-membrane (TM) motif that anchors it in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Meng2020BCL2L13:). The BHNo region includes two pairs of tandem repeats situated between the BH1-4 domains and the TM motif (Meng2020BCL2L13:). BCL2L13 also contains two WXXL/I motifs, with the second motif acting as the LC3-interacting region (LIR2), which is critical for its mitophagy-inducing ability (Meng2020BCL2L13:).

BCL2L13 has three major isoforms produced by alternative splicing. Isoform 1 has a mutation at Gly201 to Val and lacks amino acids 202-485. Isoform 3 lacks the first 162 amino acids. Isoform 2 retains the complete sequence of 1-485 amino acids and is considered the canonical sequence (Meng2020BCL2L13:). Another splice variant, BCL-Rambo-beta, consists only of the BH4 motif followed by an ALU element (Meng2020BCL2L13:).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with components like adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) to facilitate apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways (Kim2023BCL2L13). BCL2L13 can exhibit both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions depending on the cellular context (Meng2020BCL2L13:).

## Function
BCL2L13, also known as Bcl-2-like protein 13, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. It is a mammalian homologue of the yeast Atg32 and functions as a mitophagy receptor, facilitating the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria. BCL2L13 interacts with LC3 through a conserved LIR sequence, recruiting LC3 to the mitochondrial surface and promoting the formation of mitophagosomes, which are essential for mitochondrial quality control (Murakawa2015Bcl2like).

BCL2L13 is involved in mitochondrial fragmentation, a process that occurs independently of the Drp1 protein, a typical regulator of mitochondrial fission. This fragmentation is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and is linked to the protein's role in mitophagy (Murakawa2015Bcl2like). BCL2L13 can induce mitophagy even in the absence of Parkin, indicating its function in a Parkin-independent pathway (Murakawa2015Bcl2like).

In addition to its role in mitophagy, BCL2L13 is implicated in adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis. It is expressed in brown adipose tissue and is upregulated during the browning of white adipose tissue, suggesting a role in energy metabolism and thermogenesis (Ju2018A). BCL2L13's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular and organismal energy regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BCL2L13 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly cancers. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high expression of BCL2L13 is linked to inferior event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), making it an independent prognostic factor. This suggests that BCL2L13 expression could serve as a molecular marker to predict treatment response and clinical outcomes in ALL (Holleman2006The; Yang2010Expression). In acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), high BCL2L13 expression at diagnosis is associated with a worse prognosis, affecting both disease-free survival (DFS) and OS (Handschuh2021TranscriptLevel).

In renal cell carcinoma, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC), BCL2L13 mRNA expression is significantly reduced compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer prognosis and is independent of demographic and clinical factors. Promoter hypermethylation of BCL2L13 is observed in ccRCC, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Meng2021Downregulation).

In the context of neural stem cells, BCL2L13 is regulated by microRNAs miR-124 and miR-137, which control its expression and subsequently affect caspase-3 activity. This regulation is significant in conditions like epilepsy, where BCL2L13's role in apoptosis and neurogenesis may influence disease progression (Schouten2015MicroRNA124).

## Interactions
BCL2L13, also known as Bcl-rambo, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in mitophagy and apoptosis. It acts as a mitophagy receptor by recruiting the ULK1 complex, which includes ULK1, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, to the mitochondria. This recruitment is facilitated by its interaction with LC3B through the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is essential for the induction of mitophagy (Murakawa2019A). BCL2L13 also interacts with heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in the mitochondrial matrix, indicating a close physical association (Meng2021Downregulation).

In the context of apoptosis, BCL2L13 interacts with the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), a component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). This interaction is significant for the pro-apoptotic activity of BCL2L13, as ANT mediates the exchange of ADP for ATP and plays a role in mitochondrial respiration (Meng2021Downregulation). BCL2L13 also interacts with ceramide synthases 2 and 6 (CerS2/6) in glioblastoma cells, which is relevant to its role in apoptosis and drug resistance (Meng2021Downregulation). These interactions highlight BCL2L13's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and energy metabolism.
