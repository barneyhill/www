The encoded protein is called red cone photopigment or long-wavelength sensitive opsin.

This gene and the medium-wavelength opsin gene are tandemly arrayed on the X chromosome and frequent unequal recombination and gene conversion may occur between these sequences. X chromosomes may have fusions of the medium- and long-wavelength opsin genes or may have more than one copy of these genes. Defects in this gene are the cause of partial, protanopic colorblindness.
