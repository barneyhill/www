# SLC25A17

## Overview
SLC25A17 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 17, which is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is primarily located in the peroxisomal membrane and functions as a transporter for coenzyme A (CoA), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which are crucial for various metabolic processes within peroxisomes. The SLC25A17 protein is characterized by its transmembrane structure, featuring six alpha-helices that facilitate its role in substrate transport. It operates via a counter-exchange mechanism, essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and lipid homeostasis. The gene and its encoded protein have significant implications in human health, with mutations linked to various diseases, including neuroblastoma and triple-negative breast cancer, as well as developmental disorders in model organisms like zebrafish (Zhou2024SLC25A17; Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The).

## Structure
The SLC25A17 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with three tandemly repeated homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). The protein features six transmembrane alpha-helices, with both the N- and C-termini located on the cytosolic side (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). 

The SLC25A17 protein is known to function as a peroxisomal coenzyme A transporter, and its structure is conserved across species, including humans, mice, and zebrafish (Kim2019Slc25a17). The protein's transmembrane nature is indicated by the presence of six conserved transmembrane domains, which are typical of mitochondrial carriers (Kim2019Slc25a17). 

While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of SLC25A17 are not provided in the context, the protein's structural features align with those of other mitochondrial carriers, which often undergo conformational changes during substrate transport (Palmieri2013The).

## Function
SLC25A17 is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, specifically located in the peroxisomal membrane. Its primary function is to transport coenzyme A (CoA), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into peroxisomes. These molecules are essential for various metabolic processes, including the β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids and the synthesis of ether phospholipids, which are crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and membrane integrity (Zhou2024SLC25A17; Palmieri2013The).

SLC25A17 operates via a counter-exchange mechanism, importing CoA, FAD, and NAD+ in exchange for intraperoxisomally generated molecules such as 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP), flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (Palmieri2013The). This transport activity is vital because the biosynthesis of CoA, FAD, and NAD+ occurs outside the peroxisomes, necessitating their import for peroxisomal metabolic processes (Palmieri2013The).

In humans, SLC25A17 is implicated in the activation of branched-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids within peroxisomes, which is essential for lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Palmieri2004The). The protein's activity in peroxisomes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC25A17 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of neuroblastoma, the loss of SLC25A17 is associated with poor overall survival and relapse-free survival, indicating its potential role in the progression of this cancer (Khan2015Acquired). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SLC25A17 is significantly upregulated, and its high expression correlates with poorer overall survival. Knockdown of SLC25A17 in TNBC cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting that it plays a role in tumorigenesis through the ROS-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (Zhou2024SLC25A17).

In zebrafish, knockdown of the Slc25a17 gene, which is homologous to human SLC25A17, results in impaired lipid metabolism and developmental defects, such as disrupted myelination and swim bladder development. These findings suggest that SLC25A17 is crucial for normal lipid metabolism and organ development, and its dysfunction may contribute to developmental disorders (Kim2019Slc25a17). Additionally, a mutation in SLC25A17 has been associated with a severe phenotype characterized by microcephaly and premature death, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological development (Palmieri2004The).
