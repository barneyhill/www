# IFTAP

## Overview
IFTAP is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport associated protein, which plays a crucial role in the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT). This protein is integral to the assembly and maintenance of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are essential for cell signaling and motility. The IFTAP protein is categorized as a component of the IFT complex, which is responsible for the bidirectional movement of molecular cargo along the ciliary axoneme. This movement is critical for the proper functioning of cilia, and disruptions in IFTAP can lead to a variety of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction. The study of IFTAP and its interactions within the IFT complex is ongoing, with implications for understanding the molecular basis of diseases related to ciliary defects (Qiu2020aarFDC).
