# PPP2R3B

## Overview
The PPP2R3B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B''beta, a regulatory component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity and substrate specificity of PP2A, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, growth, and signaling pathways. The gene is involved in key signaling pathways, including RAS/MAPK, Wnt, and AKT/mTOR, which are essential for cell communication and regulation. PPP2R3B is expressed in a variety of tissues, with notable expression in myotome and vertebral chondrocytes, indicating its potential role in chondrogenesis and muscle function. Dysregulation of PPP2R3B has been linked to several diseases, including idiopathic scoliosis and melanocytic neoplasia, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease (Seda2018A; Polubothu2019Inherited; Polubothu2021Inherited).

## Function
The PPP2R3B gene encodes the PR70 protein, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. PP2A is a critical serine/threonine phosphatase involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, growth, and signaling pathways. The PR70 subunit influences the substrate specificity and activity of PP2A, thereby impacting cellular functions such as metabolism, apoptosis, and development (Seda2018A; Polubothu2021Inherited).

In healthy human cells, PPP2R3B is involved in key signaling pathways, including RAS/MAPK, Wnt, and AKT/mTOR, which are essential for cell communication and signaling. These pathways play significant roles in cell cycle regulation and malignancy, highlighting the importance of PPP2R3B in maintaining normal cellular functions (Polubothu2019Inherited; Polubothu2021Inherited). The gene's expression is broad but is particularly accentuated in certain tissues, such as myotome and vertebral chondrocytes, suggesting a role in chondrogenesis and muscle function (Seda2018A).

PPP2R3B's involvement in these pathways and cellular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease when dysregulated. The gene's regulatory role in PP2A activity is crucial for the proper functioning of these pathways, influencing both cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPP2R3B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In zebrafish, a CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutation in the orthologue of PPP2R3B leads to idiopathic scoliosis, characterized by adolescent onset and progressive kyphoscoliosis. This condition is associated with reduced bone mineralization and abnormal vertebral structure, suggesting a potential link to similar spinal conditions in humans (Seda2022A).

In humans, germline duplications of the PPP2R3B gene are associated with melanocytic neoplasia, including congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) and melanoma. These duplications result in increased expression of the PR70 protein, which is linked to a pro-proliferative and anti-migratory phenotype in melanoma cells. This phenotype is driven by the gene C21orf91, independent of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), and is associated with improved melanoma-specific survival (Polubothu2021Inherited).

The PPP2R3B gene's role in these conditions highlights its significance in skeletal and melanocytic pathologies, suggesting that alterations in its expression or function can have profound clinical implications.

## Interactions
PPP2R3B encodes the PR70 protein, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is involved in various cellular processes. PR70 is known to efficiently bind to the PP2A core enzyme, potentially competing with other regulatory subunits for binding sites. This interaction does not lead to free PR70, suggesting competitive binding or direct interactions with other effectors (Polubothu2021Inherited). 

PPP2R3B overexpression has been shown to influence key signaling pathways such as RAS/MAPK, Wnt, and AKT/mTOR, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and malignancy (Polubothu2019Inherited; Polubothu2021Inherited). Despite its role in these pathways, PPP2R3B overexpression does not significantly alter known melanoma signaling pathways but affects the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum protein folding (Polubothu2019Inherited).

The gene C21orf91 is significantly upregulated following PPP2R3B overexpression, indicating a potential interaction or regulatory relationship between these genes. C21orf91 is suggested to be a key mediator of the pro-proliferative phenotype induced by PPP2R3B overexpression, independent of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) (Polubothu2019Inherited; Polubothu2021Inherited).
