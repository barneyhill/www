# S100A14

## Overview
S100A14 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A14, a member of the S100 protein family known for its role in calcium ion binding through EF-hand motifs. The S100A14 protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Singh2022Multifunctional; Donato2003Intracellular). It plays a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis by influencing cell motility and invasion (Donato2012Functions). The protein's ability to form non-covalent homo- and heterodimers allows it to interact with various target proteins and receptors, such as GPCR, RAGE, and TLR-4, which are crucial for its regulatory functions in cellular activities (Singh2022Multifunctional). S100A14's interactions and regulatory roles underscore its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function, as well as its potential implications in disease states when dysregulated.

## Structure
The S100A14 protein is a member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its ability to bind calcium through EF-hand motifs. The gene encoding S100A14 is located on chromosome 1q21 and features a unique exon-intron structure with four exons and three introns, where exons 2-4 are translated (Basnet2019Expression). The primary structure of S100A14 consists of 104 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of 11.6 kDa (Basnet2019Expression).

The secondary structure of S100A14 includes two EF-hand type calcium-binding motifs, each comprising a calcium-binding loop flanked by two α-helices. The N-terminal site contains helices I and II, while the C-terminal site includes helices III and IV, followed by a C-terminal extension (Basnet2019Expression). The N-terminal calcium-binding loop is distinctively 13 amino acids long, differing from the typical 14-amino-acid loop found in other S100 family members (Basnet2019Expression).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs into a stable configuration, with a flexible hinge region separating the two EF-hand motifs (Basnet2019Expression). The quaternary structure of S100A14 is not detailed in the available context, and there is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
S100A14 is a member of the S100 protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Singh2022Multifunctional; Donato2003Intracellular). S100A14 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell motility and invasion, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis (Donato2012Functions).

In healthy human cells, S100A14 is implicated in controlling transcriptional regulation, which is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis (Singh2022Multifunctional). The protein's ability to form non-covalent homo- and heterodimers contributes to its functional diversity, allowing it to interact with a range of target proteins and receptors, such as GPCR, RAGE, and TLR-4 (Singh2022Multifunctional; Donato2003Intracellular). These interactions are essential for its role in regulating various cellular activities, including cytoskeleton assembly, membrane protein recruitment, and trafficking (Singh2022Multifunctional).

S100A14's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in cell biology, particularly in maintaining cellular structure and function, as well as its potential implications in disease states when dysregulated (Donato2012Functions).

## Clinical Significance
The S100A14 gene has significant clinical implications in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Overexpression of S100A14 in breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer cell invasion. It is often co-expressed with S100A16, and their combined expression correlates with aggressive cancer features such as younger patient age, ER-negative status, and HER2-positive status (Tanaka2015Coexpression). S100A14 interacts with HER2, modulating its signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation in breast cancer. Knockdown of S100A14 reduces HER2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling, leading to decreased cell proliferation (Xu2014S100A14).

In prostate cancer, S100A14 is expressed at lower levels compared to normal tissues and acts as a tumor suppressor. It inhibits cell growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the FAT1-mediated Hippo signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2021S100A14). These findings highlight the dual role of S100A14, acting as an oncogene in breast cancer and a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, underscoring its complex involvement in cancer biology.

## Interactions
S100A14, a member of the S100 protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cancer progression. It interacts with S100A16, another S100 family member, forming a regulatory relationship where S100A14 modulates the expression of S100A16 at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level. This interaction is significant in oral squamous cell carcinomas and normal mucosa, suggesting a functional role in cancer cells (Sapkota2013S100A14).

S100A14 also binds to the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a critical interaction for activating ERK1/2 and NF-kB signaling pathways, which are important for cell proliferation and survival. This interaction can be inhibited by RAGE antagonists, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jin2011S100A14).

In breast cancer, S100A14 binds to actin in a calcium-independent manner, potentially affecting cytoskeletal dynamics and promoting cancer cell invasion. The co-expression of S100A14 and S100A16 in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis and increased invasiveness, indicating their role in cancer progression (Tanaka2015Coexpression).
