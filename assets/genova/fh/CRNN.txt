# CRNN

## Overview
CRNN is a gene that encodes the protein cornulin, which is a member of the "fused gene" family, evolved from the S100 family, and is primarily expressed in stratified epithelial tissues (Kypriotou2012The). Cornulin is characterized by an EF-hand calcium-binding motif and is involved in cellular differentiation and stress response, particularly in the epidermis and esophagus (Pawar2013Downregulation; Kaur2021Gene). The protein plays a crucial role in the late stages of keratinocyte differentiation and the cornification process, contributing to the structural integrity of the skin's barrier (Pawar2013Downregulation). Cornulin's expression is modulated in response to stress, and it has been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle by inhibiting cellular proliferation (Pawar2013Downregulation; Kaur2021Gene). Alterations in CRNN expression have been associated with various squamous cell carcinomas and skin conditions, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis and therapeutic target (Chen2013Characterization; Trzeciak2017Altered).

## Structure
The CRNN (cornulin) protein is composed of 495 amino acids and is characterized by specific structural features that include an EF-hand calcium-binding motif at the N-terminus, which is 90 amino acids long (Kaur2021Gene). This motif is involved in calcium binding, although its precise role in cornulin's function is not fully understood (Kaur2021Gene). The protein also contains two glutamine and threonine-rich repeat units of 60 amino acids in its C-terminal domain (Kypriotou2012The). 

Cornulin is part of the "fused gene" family, which evolved from the S100 family and is expressed in stratified epithelia (Kypriotou2012The). The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 70 kDa, although its calculated molecular weight is 53 kDa, suggesting the presence of post-translational modifications (Kypriotou2012The). These modifications may include phosphorylation, which could influence the protein's function and stability (Kypriotou2012The). 

Cornulin is a major cytoplasmic matrix protein associated with intermediate filament proteins and is a minor component of the cornified envelope (Kypriotou2012The). It acts as a substrate for transglutaminase 1 (TG1) and is expressed in the upper spinous and granular layers of the epidermis (Kypriotou2012The).

## Function
Cornulin (CRNN) is a protein primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the esophagus, skin, and other squamous epithelia. It is part of the epidermal differentiation complex located on chromosome 1q21.3, which is rich in genes involved in terminal epidermal differentiation (Pawar2013Downregulation; Kaur2021Gene). Cornulin is characterized by an EF-hand calcium-binding motif and multiple tandem peptide repeats, which are crucial for its role in cellular differentiation and stress response (Pawar2013Downregulation; Kaur2021Gene).

In healthy human cells, cornulin is involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, particularly in the late stages, and plays a role in the cornification process of the skin (Pawar2013Downregulation). It is expressed in the prickle and functional cell layers of normal esophageal mucosa, predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region (Pawar2013Downregulation). Cornulin also participates in cell cycle regulation by inhibiting cellular proliferation and arresting cells at the G1 phase, linked to the downregulation of cyclin D1, which prevents progression to the S-phase (Pawar2013Downregulation).

Cornulin's expression is upregulated in response to stress, such as deoxycholic stress, where it prevents apoptosis, indicating its role in the stress response and maintenance of epithelial integrity (Kaur2021Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CRNN (cornulin) gene have been implicated in several types of squamous cell carcinomas. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), CRNN is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poor prognosis. Lower CRNN expression correlates with reduced survival rates and is linked to immune profile changes in tumor cells, such as decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and increased tumor purity and macrophage infiltration (Hong2024Identification).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), CRNN is frequently downregulated, with significant associations to advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastases, and shorter survival times. CRNN acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression is an independent prognostic marker for ESCC (Chen2013Characterization).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), CRNN downregulation is linked to genomic instability at the 1q21.3 region, poor prognosis, and microsatellite instability. This downregulation is associated with advanced cancer stages and lymph node metastases (Salahshourifar2015Downregulation).

CRNN expression is also altered in atopic dermatitis, where decreased mRNA levels are observed, potentially contributing to impaired skin barrier function (Trzeciak2017Altered).

## Interactions
Cornulin (CRNN) is known to interact with several proteins within squamous epithelial tissues. It plays a role in the stress response and epithelial cell differentiation by interacting with involucrin and small proline-rich proteins. These interactions suggest that CRNN may be involved in the formation of the cornified envelope in keratinocytes, a critical component of the skin's barrier function. The interaction with involucrin, a protein that is a major component of the cornified envelope, indicates that CRNN may contribute to the structural integrity and resilience of epithelial cells. The association with small proline-rich proteins, which are also involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, further supports CRNN's role in epithelial cell differentiation and stress response. These interactions highlight the importance of CRNN in maintaining the protective barrier of the skin and its potential involvement in cellular processes that respond to environmental stressors.
