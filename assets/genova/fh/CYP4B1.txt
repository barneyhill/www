# CYP4B1

## Overview
CYP4B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily B member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme functions as a monooxygenase, primarily involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and the bioactivation of certain protoxins (Baron2008Expression; Du2006Effects). It is expressed in various extrahepatic tissues, including the skin, lung, esophagus, and bladder, where it plays a role in tissue-specific metabolic processes (Roos2005Expression). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a heme cofactor and a narrow active site optimized for hydroxylation reactions (Hsu2017The). CYP4B1 is clinically significant due to its involvement in the activation of procarcinogens and its altered expression in various cancers, making it a potential biomarker for disease prognosis (Lin2019Downregulation; Liu2021CYP4B1).

## Structure
The human CYP4B1 protein is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various substances. The primary structure of CYP4B1 includes a sequence of amino acids, with a notable serine at position 427, which differs from the conserved proline found in other species like rabbits (Wiek2014Identification). This serine is thought to affect the enzyme's ability to process certain substrates, such as 4-ipomeanol (Wiek2014Identification).

The tertiary structure of CYP4B1 resembles other mammalian microsomal P450s, with substrates binding in an internal cavity above the heme and below helix G (Hsu2017The). The heme cofactor, which is the catalytic center, is covalently linked to Glu-310 via an ester bond, causing an out-of-plane distortion of the heme (Hsu2017The). The active site is optimized for hydroxylation of aliphatic substrates, providing a hydrophobic environment that constrains substrates like octane in a planar conformation (Hsu2017The).

The structure includes a slot-like active site that is narrow near the heme iron, facilitating the preference for hydroxylation of primary C-H bonds (Hsu2017The). Specific amino acid residues, such as His-312, Thr-314, and Phe-309, contribute to the formation of the substrate-binding cavity, stabilizing the substrate near the heme iron (Hsu2017The). The enzyme's active site is adapted to channel substrates to the reactive oxygen, with specific residues forming a narrow cavity for substrate approach (Hsu2017The). The quaternary structure and post-translational modifications of human CYP4B1 are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
CYP4B1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, primarily involved in the hydroxylation of medium-chain fatty acids, suggesting a role in fatty acid metabolism in healthy human cells (Baron2008Expression). This enzyme is expressed in various extrahepatic tissues, including the skin, lung, esophagus, and bladder, indicating its potential involvement in tissue-specific metabolic processes (Roos2005Expression; Du2006Effects). In the skin, CYP4B1 is highly up-regulated during keratinocyte differentiation, which suggests a differentiation-specific function in the epidermis (Du2006Effects).

CYP4B1 is also implicated in the bioactivation of certain protoxins, which can lead to tissue-specific toxicological effects. For instance, it converts 4-ipomeanol to pneumotoxic species and activates arylamines, which are linked to bladder cancer (Baron2008Expression). Despite its role in activating procarcinogens, the enzyme's physiological substrates and functions in healthy human cells remain largely unknown. The presence of CYP4B1 mRNA in various tissues, including tumors and normal tissues like the placenta and colon, suggests its involvement in both normal physiological processes and potential disease states (Zheng1998Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP4B1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic mutations. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CYP4B1 expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2021CYP4B1). Genetic polymorphisms in CYP4B1, such as missense variants, have been linked to increased lung cancer risk, particularly in the Chinese Han population (Yang2023Missense).

In bladder cancer, CYP4B1 expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis in urothelial carcinomas (Lin2019Downregulation; Lim2020Cytochrome). Specific genetic polymorphisms, such as CYP4B1*1/*2 and CYP4B1*2/*2, are associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in certain populations (Jarrar2019Molecular).

CYP4B1 expression is also notably absent in adrenocortical carcinoma, while increased expression is observed in prostate and breast cancers, suggesting a potential role in these malignancies (Röder2023Spotlight). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CYP4B1 in cancer development and prognosis.

## Interactions
CYP4B1 interacts with several proteins that influence its enzymatic activity, particularly in the context of fatty acid oxidation. One significant interaction is with cytochrome b5, a microsomal heme protein that facilitates electron transfer during enzymatic reactions. The presence of cytochrome b5 enhances the conversion rate of fatty acids by CYP4B1, improving the NADPH coupling efficiency and reducing NADPH consumption. This suggests that cytochrome b5 acts as an electron buffer between CYP4B1 and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), directly influencing electron transfer without altering the product distribution (Thesseling2020Novel).

The study also highlights the role of glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in cofactor regeneration, which is crucial for maintaining NADPH levels during the reaction. GDH, along with cytochrome b5, enhances reaction rates, indicating a synergistic effect on CYP4B1 activity (Thesseling2020Novel). These interactions are essential for the efficient conversion of fatty acids and demonstrate the complex interplay between CYP4B1 and other proteins in its metabolic functions. The context does not provide information on interactions of CYP4B1 with nucleic acids.
