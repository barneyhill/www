# ITLN2

## Overview
Intelectin 2, encoded by the ITLN2 gene, is a carbohydrate-binding protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. It is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, particularly within Paneth cells, which are essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and defense mechanisms. As a member of the lectin family, intelectin 2 is involved in recognizing and binding specific carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbial pathogens, thereby facilitating their clearance from the host system. This function highlights its role in antimicrobial defense and gut health. The expression of ITLN2 is largely restricted to the small intestine, suggesting a specialized function in this region, although the full spectrum of its activities in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Nonnecke2021Human; almalki2020genetic; Paval2022The).

## Structure


## Function
ITLN2, or intelectin 2, is a protein primarily expressed in the small intestine, specifically in Paneth cells, which are crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and defense (Nonnecke2021Human; Paval2022The). The protein is involved in the innate immune response by recognizing and binding to specific carbohydrates on microbial surfaces, facilitating pathogen clearance (Paval2022The). This binding ability suggests a role in antimicrobial defense, as ITLN2 can interact with microbial glycan chains (Paval2022The).

Although the specific functions of ITLN2 in healthy human cells are not fully delineated, its expression in Paneth cells indicates its involvement in gut homeostasis. Paneth cells are known for their role in secreting antimicrobial peptides and proteins, which help regulate the gut microbiota and protect against pathogenic bacteria (Nonnecke2021Human). The expression pattern of ITLN2, limited to the small intestine, underscores its specialized function in this region (almalki2020genetic). While ITLN2's precise molecular activities in healthy cells require further research, its role in the immune response and gut health is evident from its expression and binding properties.
