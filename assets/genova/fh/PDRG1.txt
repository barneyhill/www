# PDRG1

## Overview
PDRG1, or p53 and DNA damage regulated gene 1, encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses. The protein encoded by PDRG1 is a component of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which is crucial for the assembly of RNA polymerase II, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation (Pajares2017PDRG1at). PDRG1 is predominantly localized in the nuclear compartment, where it is associated with nuclear speckles, suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling and splicing (Pajares2017PDRG1at). The protein interacts with various partners, including methionine adenosyltransferases and proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its potential role in regulating gene expression and cell death pathways (Pajares2017PDRG1at). PDRG1 is highly conserved among mammals and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may influence its function and stability (Pajares2017PDRG1at). Despite its established interactions and roles, the precise biological functions of PDRG1 in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
PDRG1 is a protein involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is a component of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex, which plays a role in the assembly of RNA polymerase II, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Pajares2017PDRG1at). PDRG1 interacts with methionine adenosyltransferases, enzymes responsible for synthesizing S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a crucial methyl donor for epigenetic modifications. This interaction indicates a potential role in regulating AdoMet synthesis, impacting DNA and histone methylation processes (Pajares2017PDRG1at).

The protein is predominantly located in the nuclear compartment, where it colocalizes with nuclear speckles, implicating it in chromatin remodeling and splicing (Pajares2017PDRG1at). PDRG1 also interacts with proteins involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, such as RUVBL1, RUVBL2, and PDCD7, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression and cell death pathways (Pajares2017PDRG1at).

PDRG1 is highly conserved among mammals and undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may influence its function and stability (Pajares2017PDRG1at). Despite these insights, the precise function of PDRG1 in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
PDRG1 is implicated in various human malignancies due to its altered expression and interactions. Overexpression of PDRG1 is observed in several cancers, including colon, rectum, ovary, lung, stomach, breast, and uterus, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Jiang2011PDRG1; Tao2016The). In lung cancer, PDRG1 promotes radioresistance through the ATM-p53 signaling pathway, enhancing cell viability and reducing apoptosis, which contributes to poor treatment outcomes (Tao2016The). 

PDRG1's expression is often upregulated in tumors with impaired p53 expression, a common feature in many cancers, leading to increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis in cancer cells (Pajares2017PDRG1at). In bladder cancer, PDRG1 expression is inversely correlated with miR-214 levels, affecting tumor stage and recurrence (Pajares2017PDRG1at). 

The gene's interaction with methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) affects S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) production, impacting DNA methylation levels, which are often altered in cancer cells (Pérez2016The). These interactions suggest PDRG1's role in oncogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PDRG1 interacts with methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs), specifically MATα1 and MATα2, within the nuclear compartment. This interaction is significant as it influences the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), a key methyl donor in transmethylation reactions. PDRG1 reduces the activity of MATα1 and MATα2 homo-oligomers, as well as the MAT II hetero-oligomer, thereby affecting DNA methylation levels (Pérez2016The). The interaction between PDRG1 and MATα1 is particularly relevant in extrahepatic tissues and during liver injury, where MATα1 accumulates in the nucleus (Pérez2016The).

PDRG1 also interacts with the URI protein, a component of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex. This interaction is mediated through the prefoldin-like domain of URI, which stabilizes PDRG1 protein levels. Overexpression of URI increases PDRG1 protein levels, while URI depletion decreases them, indicating a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism (Mita2013Analysis).

In cancer contexts, PDRG1 interacts with proteins such as PDCD7, CIZ1, and MAP1S, which are involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and microtubule dynamics. These interactions suggest a role for PDRG1 in modulating cancer cell growth and progression (Jiang2011PDRG1).
