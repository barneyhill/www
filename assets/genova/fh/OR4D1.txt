# OR4D1

## Overview
The OR4D1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily D member 1, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of odorants. While traditionally associated with the olfactory system, OR4D1 is notably expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the testis, where it plays a crucial role in sperm function. This receptor is activated by specific ligands, leading to calcium signaling pathways that regulate sperm motility and chemotaxis, essential processes for successful fertilization (Lee2018Therapeutic; Raka2021Human). The ectopic expression of OR4D1 and its involvement in reproductive physiology underscore its significance beyond the olfactory system, highlighting its potential impact on human fertility (Tong2021Ectopic; Abaffy2015Human).

## Function
The human gene OR4D1 encodes an olfactory receptor that is ectopically expressed in the testis, where it plays a significant role in sperm function. OR4D1 is activated by the ligand 5α-androst-16-en-3-one, which induces calcium (Ca2+) transients in spermatozoa. This activation is crucial for regulating sperm motility and chemotaxis, influencing sperm swimming speed and direction, which are essential for successful fertilization (Lee2018Therapeutic; Raka2021Human). The receptor's function involves cAMP-mediated calcium signaling pathways, which are vital for the cellular response to odorants and contribute to specific motility patterns in sperm (Tong2021Ectopic).

OR4D1, along with other ectopic olfactory receptors, is implicated in the broader mechanism of sperm chemotaxis, potentially affecting human fertility by facilitating chemical communication between sperm and egg cells (Lee2018Therapeutic). The receptor's ability to regulate intracellular Ca2+ levels is a critical factor in various cellular processes, underscoring its importance in healthy cells (Raka2021Human). OR4D1's expression in non-olfactory tissues highlights its versatile roles beyond traditional olfactory functions, contributing to reproductive physiology (Abaffy2015Human).
