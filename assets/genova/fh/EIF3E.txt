# EIF3E

## Overview
EIF3E is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit E (eIF3e), a crucial component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex is integral to the initiation phase of protein synthesis, facilitating the assembly of pre-initiation complexes and the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome. The eIF3e protein is characterized by a PCI domain, which includes a conserved 'winged helix' (WH) domain, and is involved in interactions with various partners to regulate translation initiation rates (Scheel2005Prediction; Valášek2017Embraced). While eIF3e is not essential for global protein synthesis, it plays a significant role in selective mRNA translation, particularly in energy metabolism regulation (Zhou2005PCI; Valášek2017Embraced). The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in cellular growth, proliferation, and stress adaptation, with alterations in EIF3E expression linked to cancer development, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Hershey2010Regulation; Valášek2017Embraced).

## Structure
The eIF3e protein is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF3e subunit contains a PCI domain, characterized by a bipartite structure with a C-terminal 'winged helix' (WH) domain and a less well-defined N-terminal region due to low sequence conservation (Scheel2005Prediction). The WH domain is better conserved and is detectable by profile searches, suggesting a β-structure rather than the typical helical-hairpin repeats found upstream of the WH region (Scheel2005Prediction). 

The eIF3 complex, including eIF3e, is involved in translation initiation and is composed of core and non-core subunits. In fission yeast, distinct eIF3 complexes are identified, differentiated by the presence of PCI proteins eIF3e and eIF3m, with eIF3e not being essential for global protein synthesis (Zhou2005PCI). The eIF3e subunit is part of the octamer that extends into the solution, potentially mediating interactions with various partners to control initiation rates (Valášek2017Embraced). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of eIF3e, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
EIF3E is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a critical role in the initiation of protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, EIF3E is involved in the assembly of the 43S and 48S pre-initiation complexes (PICs), essential for the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome and the initiation of translation (Herrmannová2019Adapted). EIF3E, along with other subunits like eIF3a and eIF3c, forms part of the core of the PCI/MPN octamer, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex (Valášek2017Embraced).

EIF3E contributes to the binding of the eIF3 complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit, facilitating mRNA recruitment and playing a role in the initial steps of translation initiation (Herrmannová2019Adapted). It is also involved in selective mRNA translation, particularly in the regulation of energy metabolism, by promoting the translation of specific metabolic mRNAs (Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3E's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell growth and proliferation by regulating translation (Zhou2005PCI). The protein's role in translation initiation and mRNA recruitment underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and stress adaptation (Valášek2017Embraced).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EIF3E gene have been linked to various cancers, including breast and lung carcinomas. The underexpression of eIF3e is often associated with the integration of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) into its gene introns, particularly intron 6, which leads to decreased expression of eIF3e and is observed in human breast and lung carcinomas (Hershey2010Regulation; Valášek2017Embraced). This underexpression also affects the expression of other eIF3 subunits, such as eIF3d, eIF3k, and eIF3l, potentially contributing to cancer progression by forming a subcomplex that may alter normal cellular functions (Valášek2017Embraced).

Conversely, MMTV integration at intron 5 results in a truncated eIF3e protein, which may possess malignant transformation properties, potentially altering the function of the entire eIF3 complex (Valášek2017Embraced). The eIF3e subunit is also implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, with its underexpression linked to cancerous states, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Hershey2010Regulation). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EIF3E in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
EIF3E, also known as Int-6, is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex and participates in various protein interactions. It associates with the COP9 signalosome subunit CSN7 and eIF3c, indicating its involvement in a complex that includes these proteins (Yahalom2001Arabidopsis). EIF3E interacts directly with CSN7 and eIF3c, as confirmed by yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pull-down assays, but does not interact with eIF3b or other COP9 signalosome subunits like CSN1 or CSN8 (Yahalom2001Arabidopsis).

In Arabidopsis, eIF3e is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its role in multiple complexes and a propensity for nuclear uptake (Yahalom2001Arabidopsis). It also interacts with the S9 protein subunit of the 40S ribosomal small subunit and RPN12a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome (PazAviram2008Arabidopsis). These interactions suggest a regulatory role in translation and proteolysis.

In yeast, eIF3e/Int-6 binds to the eIF3b subunit, Prt1p, indicating a conserved binding domain and functional similarity with its yeast counterpart, Pci8p (Shalev2001Saccharomyces). This interaction is specific to the eIF3 complex, as little or no eIF2α co-immunoprecipitates with eIF3e/Int-6 (Shalev2001Saccharomyces).
