# OR5P3

## Overview
The OR5P3 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily P member 3, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, facilitating the detection and transduction of odorant signals. OR5P3 is specifically involved in the recognition of coumarin, a fragrant compound, and is expressed in the olfactory epithelium where it initiates signal transduction pathways that contribute to the perception of smell (Zhang2019Computational). Structurally, the OR5P3 protein is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, with a conserved disulfide bond that maintains its structural integrity (Zhang2019Computational). The gene has also been associated with certain health conditions, including breast cancer and multiple chemical sensitivity, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2019Computational). Additionally, evolutionary studies have shown that OR5P3 was a pseudogene in Neandertals, indicating a potential loss of olfactory function in these extinct hominins (Hughes2014Loss; de2021Genetic).

## Structure
The OR5P3 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. The primary structure of OR5P3 consists of an amino acid sequence that was obtained from the NCBI database for computational modeling (Zhang2019Computational). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, which form the transmembrane domains. These domains are primarily composed of hydrophobic amino acids, as identified through hydrophobicity analysis (Zhang2019Computational).

The tertiary structure of OR5P3 was modeled using bovine rhodopsin as a template due to its structural similarity. The 3D structure was generated using MODELER, and the model was refined by removing excessive hydrophobic residues to ensure stability and conformational energy (Zhang2019Computational). A disulfide bond between Cys97 and Cys179 was identified, which is conserved among rhodopsin family receptors, contributing to the structural integrity of the protein (Zhang2019Computational).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, although specific modifications for OR5P3 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein functions as a monomer, typical of olfactory receptors, and does not exhibit quaternary structure.

## Function
The OR5P3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants, such as coumarin, a compound found in many fragrances (Zhang2019Computational). The binding of coumarin to OR5P3 initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves changes in the olfactory bulb and central nervous system, contributing to the perception of smell (Zhang2019Computational).

At the molecular level, OR5P3 interacts with coumarin through specific transmembrane domains, particularly TM6 and TM7, with key amino acid residues like Tyr259 and Thr279 playing significant roles in ligand binding (Zhang2019Computational). The receptor's structure includes a conserved disulfide bond between Cys97 and Cys179, typical of rhodopsin family receptors, and a pi-pi stacking interaction between Tyr259 and coumarin (Zhang2019Computational). These interactions are essential for the receptor's function in olfactory signal transduction, ultimately leading to neuronal responses that facilitate the sense of smell.

## Clinical Significance
The OR5P3 gene has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in olfactory receptor function. Notably, OR5P3 is associated with the development of breast cancer and acquired resistance to tamoxifen, a common treatment for this cancer. The interaction between coumarin, a compound found in many fragrances, and OR5P3 may trigger signaling events that contribute to these adverse health outcomes (Zhang2019Computational). Additionally, OR5P3 has been linked to multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), a condition exacerbated by exposure to fragrances, leading to symptoms such as skin hypersensitivity, respiratory issues, and cognitive dysfunction (Zhang2019Computational).

In extinct lineages like Neandertals, OR5P3 was found to be a pseudogene, suggesting a loss of function that may have affected their olfactory capabilities (Hughes2014Loss). This loss of function is attributed to specific mutations, such as the Y266STOP mutation found in the Altai Neandertal sample, which could have rendered the receptor non-functional (de2021Genetic). These genetic variations highlight the evolutionary differences in olfactory receptor function between Neandertals and modern humans. However, the clinical implications of these mutations in present-day humans remain unclear.
