# CX3CR1

## Overview
The CX3CR1 gene encodes the C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in immune system function. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs, and is primarily involved in mediating leukocyte migration and adhesion through its interaction with the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) (Imai1997Identification). CX3CR1 is expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and subsets of T cells, where it contributes to immune surveillance, inflammation, and cell survival (Landsman2009CX3CR1). The receptor's function is crucial in several physiological and pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, neuroinflammation, and pain modulation, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Lee2010CX3CR1; Liu2016Role).

## Structure
The CX3CR1 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs (Imai1997Identification). This receptor is involved in leukocyte migration and adhesion, interacting with the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) (Imai1997Identification). The primary structure of CX3CR1 includes several conserved motifs found in the chemokine receptor superfamily, such as the DRY motif, which is crucial for G protein interactions and signal transduction (Imai1997Identification).

The secondary structure of CX3CR1 involves alpha helices that span the cell membrane, forming the characteristic seven-transmembrane domain of GPCRs (Imai1997Identification). The tertiary structure of CX3CR1 allows it to interact with fractalkine, with the chemokine domain of fractalkine acting as the primary effector domain for receptor binding (Imai1997Identification).

CX3CR1 also exhibits quaternary structural features, as it can form clusters on the cell surface, which may influence its function in cell adhesion and signaling (Darbandi‐Tehrani2010Subtle). The receptor has several genetic variants, such as V249-T280, I249-T280, and I249-M280, which are associated with different structural conformations and functional implications (Darbandi‐Tehrani2010Subtle). These variants can affect the packing of the receptor's helices, influencing its interaction with ligands and other proteins (Darbandi‐Tehrani2010Subtle).

## Function
The CX3CR1 gene encodes a receptor that is integral to the regulation of leukocyte migration and adhesion, playing a crucial role in immune surveillance and inflammation. CX3CR1 is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor that specifically binds to the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) (Imai1997Identification; Jung2000Analysis). This interaction facilitates the chemotaxis and adhesion of leukocytes, such as monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, to endothelial cells, particularly in inflamed tissues (Imai1997Identification). The receptor's chemotactic and calcium mobilization functions are linked to G protein signaling, which can be inhibited by pertussis toxin, while its adhesion function is independent of integrin activation and pertussis toxin sensitivity (Imai1997Identification).

CX3CR1 is expressed on various immune cells, including monocytes, NK cells, and subsets of T cells, and is involved in the survival of these cells by mediating anti-apoptotic effects through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Landsman2009CX3CR1). In the context of atherosclerosis, CX3CR1 is implicated in the survival of monocytes within atherosclerotic plaques, influencing disease progression (Landsman2009CX3CR1). Additionally, CX3CR1 expression is used to classify memory CD8+ T cells, distinguishing between populations with different functional capabilities, such as cytotoxicity and proliferation (Böttcher2015Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CX3CR1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis, the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is crucial for monocyte recruitment and plaque stability. Genetic variations such as the V249I and T280M polymorphisms in CX3CR1 have been linked to coronary artery disease susceptibility, with these polymorphisms having an atheroprotective effect due to decreased reactivity of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis (Liu2016Role).

In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the M280 allele of CX3CR1 is associated with increased disease risk due to impaired monocyte migration. CX3CR1-deficient mice exhibit subretinal microglia accumulation, leading to retinal degeneration, suggesting a role for CX3CR1 in retinal homeostasis (Combadière2007CX3CR1dependent).

In Alzheimer's disease, CX3CR1 deficiency is linked to altered microglial activation and reduced beta-amyloid deposition, indicating that CX3CR1 signaling affects microglial phagocytic capacity and amyloid clearance. This deficiency can exacerbate neurodegenerative activation, highlighting its protective role in microglial function (Lee2010CX3CR1; Puntambekar2022CX3CR1).

The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis is also implicated in neuropathic and inflammatory pain, with CX3CR1 knockout mice showing reduced pain responses, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in pain management (Liu2016Role).

## Interactions
CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor, primarily interacts with its ligand fractalkine (CX3CL1) to mediate cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is crucial for maintaining microglial cells in a quiescent state and regulating their activation, migration, and proliferation in the central nervous system (Chidambaram2020Interaction). The binding of fractalkine to CX3CR1 involves specific structural regions of the receptor, including the N-terminus and dynamic regions like the N-loop and 30's loop, which are important for receptor binding and signaling (Mizoue1999Solution).

CX3CR1 also participates in interactions with other proteins, such as G-proteins, which are involved in signal transduction pathways. These interactions activate several signaling pathways, including PI3K and Akt, which help inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chidambaram2020Interaction). In Alzheimer's disease, CX3CR1 interacts with extracellular Tau protein, promoting its internalization by microglia and influencing microglial activation and cytokine production (Chidambaram2020Interaction).

The receptor's interaction with fractalkine is characterized by a weak binding affinity, with the complex in fast exchange, indicating a micromolar to millimolar affinity (Mizoue1999Solution). These interactions highlight the role of CX3CR1 in immune response modulation and neuroinflammation.
