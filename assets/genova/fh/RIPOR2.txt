# RIPOR2

## Overview
RIPOR2, or RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell polarization, particularly within auditory hair cells. The protein encoded by RIPOR2 is crucial for the structural integrity and orientation of stereociliary bundles, which are essential for mechanotransduction and hearing. It is categorized as a cell polarization regulator and is localized at the apical plasma membrane and stereocilia of auditory hair cells, where it forms ring-like structures that maintain stereocilia shape and length (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). RIPOR2 interacts with various proteins, including nonmuscular myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9) and small GTPases, influencing cellular processes through these interactions (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). Mutations in the RIPOR2 gene are linked to hearing loss and have implications in cancer, where its expression affects immune responses and tumor characteristics (Xu2022Comprehensive; Canales2019The).

## Function
RIPOR2, also known as RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 2, plays a critical role in the structure and orientation of auditory hair cell stereociliary bundles. It is localized at the apical plasma membrane and stereocilia of auditory hair cells, forming ring-like structures near the basal taper of stereocilia. These structures are essential for maintaining the shape and length of stereocilia, which are crucial for proper mechanotransduction and hearing function (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2).

RIPOR2 interacts with several proteins, including nonmuscular myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9) and small GTPases such as RhoA and RhoC. These interactions influence the oligomerization of RhoC and the abundance and post-translational modifications of Myh9, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which are important for cellular functions (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). RIPOR2's interaction with Myh9 is particularly significant for maintaining the structural integrity of hair cells, as it co-localizes with Myh9 near the taper of stereocilia (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2).

In RIPOR2-deficient mice, the absence of this gene leads to defects in the orientation and organization of stereociliary bundles, resulting in profound deafness while vestibular function remains intact (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). This highlights RIPOR2's essential role in auditory function and its involvement in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RIPOR2 gene are associated with various forms of hearing loss. A specific mutation, c.102-1 G > A, leads to recessive nonsyndromic, prelingual, profound hearing loss by causing exon skipping and deletion of amino acids crucial for membrane localization. This mutation results in the protein failing to localize to the plasma membrane, instead accumulating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Canales2019The). Another variant, c.1696_1707del, is linked to adult-onset progressive hearing loss, showing high penetrance and variable expressivity. This variant affects the localization of RIPOR2 in cochlear hair cells, leading to structural defects in stereocilia (de2019ARIPOR2inframe).

RIPOR2 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression correlates with immune scores and tumor microenvironment characteristics. It acts as a protective factor in certain cancers like kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, but as a risk factor in acute myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma. High RIPOR2 expression is associated with better responses to immunotherapy in cancers such as cervical cancer and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Xu2022Comprehensive). These findings highlight RIPOR2's role in both auditory function and immune regulation.

## Interactions
RIPOR2, also known as RHO family interacting cell polarization regulator 2, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In cervical cancer, RIPOR2 interacts with DNA damage repair (DDR) related genes and immune checkpoints. Overexpression of RIPOR2 is associated with high expression of immune checkpoints such as LAG3, TIGIT, CTSS, ICOS, and TIM3. It also shows a negative correlation with DDR-related genes FEN1, PARP2, and RAD52, while positively correlating with PARP1, indicating a potential interaction at the protein level (Xu2022Comprehensive).

In auditory hair cells, RIPOR2 interacts with nonmuscular myosin heavy chain 9 (Myh9), which is essential for the structure and orientation of stereociliary bundles. This interaction was identified using immunoprecipitation methods, which are advantageous for detecting protein interactions influenced by post-translational modifications (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). RIPOR2 also interacts with RhoC, which regulates its oligomerization in stereocilia, and inhibits HDAC6 enzymatic activity, affecting post-translational modifications of α-tubulin (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2). These interactions are vital for maintaining the proper structure and function of auditory hair cells, and deficiencies in RIPOR2 can lead to hearing loss (Diaz-Horta2018Ripor2).
