# LCE1E

## Overview
The LCE1E gene encodes the late cornified envelope 1E protein, which is a member of the LCE family involved in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the epidermis, contributing to the cornified envelope that provides mechanical resilience and protection against environmental insults. The LCE1E protein plays a crucial role in skin homeostasis and is implicated in various dermatological conditions due to its involvement in epidermal barrier function. Alterations in the expression of LCE1E have been associated with skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and vesicular hand eczema, highlighting its significance in dermatological health and disease (Brunner2018Earlyonset; Voorberg2021Vesicular). Additionally, LCE1E has been studied in the context of melanoma, although its contribution to cancer risk requires further investigation (Artomov2017Rare).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The LCE1E gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, has been implicated in several skin-related conditions due to alterations in its expression. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), LCE1E expression is significantly downregulated in adult patients, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of the disease by contributing to epidermal barrier dysfunction (Brunner2018Earlyonset). This downregulation is not observed in pediatric AD, indicating a potential age-related difference in disease mechanisms.

In vesicular hand eczema (VHE), LCE1E also shows significant downregulation in lesional skin, although this finding was not consistently replicated across different validation methods (Voorberg2021Vesicular). This suggests that LCE1E may be involved in the pathophysiology of VHE, although its exact role remains to be fully elucidated.

Additionally, LCE1E has been identified as a potential risk factor for both cutaneous and ocular melanoma, although it did not reach genome-wide statistical significance in studies (Artomov2017Rare). These findings indicate that LCE1E may play a role in various skin conditions, primarily through its involvement in maintaining the integrity of the skin barrier.
