# GSPT2

## Overview
GSPT2 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein G1 to S phase transition 2, also known as eRF3b. This protein is a GTPase and a member of the GTP-binding elongation factor family, playing a pivotal role in translation termination by interacting with eukaryotic peptide chain release factor 1 (Grau2017Xp11.22). GSPT2 is widely expressed, with significant expression in the brain, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism and mRNA stability (Zhouravleva2006Evolution). The gene's involvement in translation termination and its interactions with proteins such as BIRC5 and Tia1 suggest its importance in normal cellular function and development, particularly in the nervous system (Li2014Functional; Grau2017Xp11.22). GSPT2 has clinical significance due to its association with X-linked intellectual disability, particularly in cases involving Xp11.22 deletions, highlighting its potential role in developmental and neurological disorders (AlShehhi2019Further; Grau2017Xp11.22).

## Function
The GSPT2 gene encodes a GTPase that is part of the GTP-binding elongation factor family, playing a crucial role in translation termination by interacting with eukaryotic peptide chain release factor 1. This interaction helps prevent the translation of extended protein products, known as readthrough, which could be harmful to cells (Grau2017Xp11.22). GSPT2 is widely expressed, with notable abundance in the brain, and is considered a candidate gene for X-linked intellectual disability due to its high probability of loss-of-function intolerance (Grau2017Xp11.22).

GSPT2 is involved in nuclear processes, potentially through its interaction with BIRC5 (survivin), an antiapoptotic protein essential for early brain development (Grau2017Xp11.22). Although specific effects of GSPT2 deficiency on central nervous system function have not been demonstrated in humans or studied in mice, its role in translation termination suggests it is vital for normal cellular function (Grau2017Xp11.22).

The gene is located on the X chromosome and is expressed in the mouse brain, though it has not been detected in human cell lines, indicating potential species-specific expression patterns (Zhouravleva2006Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
The GSPT2 gene is clinically significant due to its association with Xp11.22 deletions, which are linked to syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. These deletions result in a range of phenotypes, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, joint hypermobility, and abnormal growth patterns. The critical region of overlap in these deletions includes the GSPT2 gene, which is widely expressed, particularly in the brain. GSPT2 is a GTPase involved in translation termination, and its deficiency may lead to the production of abnormally elongated proteins, potentially detrimental to cells (Grau2017Xp11.22).

The loss of GSPT2 function, along with MAGED1, is proposed to contribute to the intellectual disability and developmental delay observed in individuals with Xp11.22 deletions. These deletions have been identified in several males from different families, suggesting a distinct X-linked syndrome characterized by these symptoms (AlShehhi2019Further; Grau2017Xp11.22). Although the specific role of GSPT2 in these phenotypes is not fully detailed, its interaction with BIRC5, an antiapoptotic protein essential for early brain development, suggests a potential cooperative role in nuclear processes (Grau2017Xp11.22). The gene's high probability of loss-of-function intolerance underscores its critical role in normal cellular function (Grau2017Xp11.22).

## Interactions
GSPT2, also known as eRF3b, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in translation termination and RNA metabolism. It interacts with eRF1 to form a complex that facilitates the release of the nascent polypeptide chain from the ribosome, a key step in translation termination (Zhouravleva2006Evolution). GSPT2 also interacts with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which influences mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Zhouravleva2006Evolution).

In the context of cancer biology, GSPT2 has been implicated in interactions that are critical for RNA metabolism, potentially affecting cancer treatment responses, particularly with PARP1 inhibitors like olaparib (Mertins2023Pharmacodynamic). GSPT2 is also part of a complex at the ribosome, influencing protein synthesis and degradation, which may have prognostic implications in ovarian and uterine cancers (Mertins2023Pharmacodynamic).

Additionally, GSPT2 interacts with Tia1, a protein involved in stress granule formation, and this interaction may play a specific role in the nervous system, particularly in neurons where GSPT2 is predominantly expressed (Li2014Functional). These interactions suggest that GSPT2 is involved in the regulation of mRNA processing and protein synthesis, potentially forming complexes with other proteins like Sup35 and Pub1 (Li2014Functional).
