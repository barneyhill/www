# ITGBL1

## Overview
The ITGBL1 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta like 1 protein, a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, and signaling. Unlike typical integrins, ITGBL1 does not form heterodimers with alpha subunits but instead modulates integrin activity by inhibiting integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, particularly at the trailing edges of migrating cells. This function is essential for the disassembly of focal adhesion complexes, facilitating efficient cell movement (Jang2022Integrin). ITGBL1 is involved in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB and TGFβ1-SMAD2/3, and has been implicated in cancer metastasis and fibroblast activation (Ji2020Primary; Zou2022Small). Its expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Cortez2020Evaluation; Wang2022A).

## Function
The ITGBL1 gene encodes the integrin β-like 1 protein, which plays a significant role in cell migration by modulating integrin activity, particularly at the trailing edges of migrating cells. ITGBL1 is a secreted protein that preferentially inhibits integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) binding at the trailing edge, facilitating the disassembly of focal adhesion complexes. This disassembly is crucial for the retraction of trailing edges, allowing cells to move forward efficiently (Jang2022Integrin). 

In healthy human cells, ITGBL1's inhibition of integrin activation at the trailing edges is essential for proper cell migration and directionality. The protein's activity is associated with decreased levels of active integrin β1 and reduced localization of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin at the trailing edges, promoting efficient cell movement (Jang2022Integrin). ITGBL1 is active in various cellular locations, including the cell membrane and extracellular space, where it influences cellular communication and structural integrity. Its role in cell biology extends to processes such as cell adhesion, signaling, and tissue development, contributing to organismal outcomes like embryonic development and wound healing (Jang2022Integrin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITGBL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. In gastric cancer, ITGBL1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis through pathways such as TGF-β signaling (Li2017ITGBL1; Wang2022A). High ITGBL1 expression correlates with poor overall survival and is linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2022A).

In colorectal cancer, ITGBL1 is overexpressed and associated with shorter overall survival. It promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is involved in pathways related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions (Qiu2018ITGBL1). ITGBL1-enriched extracellular vesicles have been shown to facilitate metastatic growth by activating cancer-associated fibroblasts and promoting a pre-metastatic niche (Ji2020Primary).

In ovarian cancer, ITGBL1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased resistance to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and paclitaxel. It affects cellular adhesion, motility, and invasiveness, contributing to cancer progression (Cortez2020Evaluation). These findings highlight ITGBL1 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
ITGBL1 (integrin subunit beta like 1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer metastasis and fibroblast activation. ITGBL1-rich extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote colorectal cancer metastasis by activating fibroblasts through the NF-κB signaling pathway. This activation is mediated by the interaction between ITGBL1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), a zinc finger protein and ubiquitin-editing enzyme. The binding of ITGBL1 to TNFAIP3 is crucial for the activation of NF-κB signaling, which is involved in inflammation and cancer progression (Ji2020Primary).

ITGBL1 also interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway. It is associated with the upregulation of several genes involved in this pathway, such as SFRP2, WNT2, and FZD1, which are co-expressed with ITGBL1. CTNNB1 (β-catenin), a key protein in the Wnt pathway, binds to ITGBL1, suggesting a significant role in the regulatory mechanism of ITGBL1 in colorectal cancer metastasis (Qi2020Regulatory).

In addition, ITGBL1 interacts with the TGFβ1-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway, promoting fibroblast activity and skin development. It upregulates the protein levels of SMAD2, SMAD3, and TGFβ1, indicating its role as an activator downstream of this pathway (Zou2022Small).
