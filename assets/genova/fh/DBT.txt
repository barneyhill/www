# DBT

## Overview
The DBT gene encodes the dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2, a pivotal enzyme within the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. This enzyme is categorized as a transacylase and is integral to mitochondrial energy metabolism, facilitating the conversion of BCAAs into acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle (Hwang2024DBT). The DBT protein forms a 24-meric scaffold that serves as the core of the BCKDH complex, interacting with other enzymes through its subunit-binding domain (Ahn2015Interaction). Beyond its metabolic functions, DBT is involved in proteostasis, acting as a metabolic switch that influences autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby playing a role in cell survival under proteotoxic stress (Hwang2024DBT). Mutations in the DBT gene are linked to metabolic disorders such as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) and have implications in neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Zeynalzadeh2018Four; Hwang2024DBT).

## Structure
The DBT gene encodes the dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2, a key enzyme in the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex, which is crucial for amino acid metabolism. The DBT protein is composed of three independently functional domains: a lipoyl-bearing domain located in the N-terminal portion, an E1/E3-binding domain, and an inner-core domain at the C-terminal portion. These domains are connected by flexible linker regions, allowing for structural flexibility (Ahn2015Interaction).

The quaternary structure of the DBT protein involves the formation of a 24-meric scaffold, which serves as a core for the BCKDH complex. This scaffold is decorated with multiple copies of E1 and E3 enzymes, which attach through the subunit-binding domain of DBT (Ahn2015Interaction). The DBT protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as lipoylation, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins in the complex (Ahn2015Interaction).

In zebrafish, a mutation in the dbt gene results in a truncated protein lacking a significant portion of the acetyl transferase domain, highlighting the importance of this domain for proper function (Friedrich2012Mutation).

## Function
The DBT gene encodes a core component of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, which is essential for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine in human cells. This process occurs in the mitochondria, where the BCKD complex facilitates the conversion of BCAAs into acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA, which are crucial for energy production in the citric acid cycle (Hwang2024DBT). The DBT protein provides the binding site for all other proteins in the BCKD complex, directly influencing the total amount of BCKD complex in a cell (Mersey2005Human).

In addition to its role in amino acid metabolism, DBT is involved in maintaining proteostasis, particularly under conditions of proteasomal impairment. It acts as a metabolic switch that influences energy metabolism and autophagy, which are essential for protein quality control and cell survival under proteotoxic stress (Hwang2024DBT). The loss of DBT has been shown to protect against cell death by promoting the clearance of ubiquitinated proteins and enhancing autophagic activity, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy pathways (Hwang2024DBT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DBT gene, which encodes the E2 component of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, are associated with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), a rare metabolic disorder. MSUD is characterized by the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their corresponding keto acids, leading to severe neurological symptoms and potentially life-threatening conditions if untreated (Zeynalzadeh2018Four; Li2023Identification). The disease manifests in various forms, ranging from classic to mild variants, depending on the specific mutation and its impact on enzyme activity (Flaschker2007Description).

Several studies have identified novel mutations in the DBT gene that contribute to MSUD. For instance, the mutation c.1291C>T (p.R431*) results in a premature stop codon, leading to a loss of function in the enzyme and severe clinical manifestations (Sun2020Identification; Li2023Identification). Another mutation, c.1132C>T (p.378X), is associated with milder clinical symptoms and can be managed with dietary interventions and thiamine supplementation (Feng2019Case).

The DBT gene's role extends beyond MSUD, as it has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where it helps regulate protein homeostasis under proteasomal impairment (Hwang2024DBT).
