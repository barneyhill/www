# ZMAT4

## Overview
ZMAT4 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger matrin-type 4 protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and are involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger matrin-type 4 protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and may play a role in maintaining genomic stability. ZMAT4 has been studied in the context of several diseases, including hematological malignancies, high myopia, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cancer, highlighting its potential significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology (Cheong2020Association; Xia2018Prediction; Wan2011The; Steffens2020Genomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ZMAT4 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, alterations in expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In hematological malignancies, copy-number variations (CNVs) of ZMAT4 have been associated with different types of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Specifically, ZMAT4 is often deleted in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), while it is amplified in some cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Wan2011The).

In the context of high myopia, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZMAT4, such as RS7829127, have been identified as protective against the condition. The presence of the G allele in this SNP is associated with a lower risk of high myopia and a shorter axial length, which is typically protective against myopia (Cheong2020Association).

ZMAT4 has also been linked to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, where the C allele of SNP rs17851751 increases the likelihood of developing the disease (Steffens2020Genomewide). Additionally, ZMAT4 is downregulated in tall cell variant papillary thyroid carcinoma, suggesting a role in the aggressive nature of this cancer subtype (Xia2018Prediction).
