# RABGGTB

## Overview
RABGGTB is a gene that encodes the beta subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, an enzyme categorized as a prenyltransferase. This enzyme plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of Rab proteins, which are small GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking within cells. The Rab geranylgeranyltransferase subunit beta facilitates the attachment of geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins, a process essential for their membrane association and function in intracellular transport processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Zhen2015Cellular). The activity of RABGGTB is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal autophagic processes, impacting various cellular functions including signaling, growth, and differentiation (Yang2023Rab). Additionally, RABGGTB has been implicated in several diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yang2023Rab).

## Function
RABGGTB encodes the beta subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase, an enzyme crucial for the post-translational modification of Rab proteins. This enzyme facilitates the attachment of geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins, which are small GTPases essential for vesicle trafficking within cells. The geranylgeranylation process is vital for the membrane association of Rab proteins, enabling them to perform their roles in intracellular transport processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Zhen2015Cellular).

Rab GTPases, once modified by RABGGTB, are involved in various cellular functions, including vesicle sorting, motility, and tethering to acceptor membranes. These activities are critical for maintaining cellular processes like signaling, polarity, migration, and division (Zhen2015Cellular). In healthy human cells, RABGGTB is implicated in maintaining normal autophagic processes and cellular homeostasis through its role in Rab protein prenylation (Yang2023Rab). This function is particularly important for cell signal transduction, growth, differentiation, and autophagy, highlighting the enzyme's role in sustaining cellular health and function (Yang2023Rab).

## Clinical Significance
RABGGTB has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), RABGGTB expression is significantly higher in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients compared to healthy controls. This elevated expression correlates with disease progression, suggesting that RABGGTB could serve as a prognostic biomarker for ALS (Yang2023Rab). The increased expression is associated with faster disease progression and greater severity, as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) (Yang2023Rab).

In contrast, RABGGTB expression is downregulated in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, indicating a dysregulation of the protein prenylation pathway in this condition (Yang2023Rab). The role of RABGGTB in cancer and osteoporosis has also been explored, with high expression levels reported in tumor-associated diseases. Psoromic acid, a selective Rab-prenylation inhibitor, is proposed as a potential therapeutic agent for these conditions, although RABGGTB is not currently used as a biomarker in these diseases (Yang2023Rab).

In ALS model mice, overexpression of RABGGTB in spinal motor neurons has shown protective effects, delaying disease onset and prolonging survival, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for RABGGTB in ALS (Gao2023Protective).

## Interactions
RABGGTB, or Rab geranylgeranyltransferase subunit beta, is known to interact with several proteins, forming part of a complex that facilitates the post-translational modification of Rab proteins. It interacts with the alpha subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase to catalyze the transfer of geranylgeranyl groups to Rab proteins, which is essential for their membrane attachment and function in vesicular trafficking (Zhen2015Cellular).

RABGGTB has been identified as a binding partner of PTAR1, forming a complex known as geranylgeranyltransferase type-III (GGTase-III). This complex is distinct from other prenyltransferases and is involved in the geranylgeranylation of the SNARE protein Ykt6, specifically at the Cys194 residue (Shirakawa2020A). Approximately 18% of RabGGTb in rat brain cytosol is complexed with PTAR1, indicating a significant interaction (Shirakawa2020A).

Additionally, RABGGTB interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of chondrolectin (chodl), a type Ia transmembrane protein. This interaction was identified using the CytoTrap two-hybrid system and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a role for chodl in processes mediated by Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Claessens2008The).
