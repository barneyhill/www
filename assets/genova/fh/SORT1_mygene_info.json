The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin to generate the mature receptor. This receptor plays a role in the trafficking of different proteins to either the cell surface, or subcellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes. Expression levels of this gene may influence the risk of myocardial infarction in human patients. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
