# SDR42E1

## Overview
The SDR42E1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, specifically identified as short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 42E, member 1. This protein is characterized by its involvement in steroid metabolism, facilitated by its 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) domain and two transmembrane domains, which suggest a role in membrane-associated processes (Bouhouche2021Identification). The SDR42E1 protein is implicated in the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroid hormones, playing a crucial role in maintaining steroid hormone synthesis and cholesterol metabolism, which are essential for connective tissue maintenance and sexual maturation (Bouhouche2021Identification; Stiles2012Genetic). Mutations in the SDR42E1 gene have been associated with oculocutaneous genital syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in disorders related to steroid biosynthesis and metabolism (Bouhouche2021Identification).

## Structure
The SDR42E1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, characterized by a Rossmann-fold structure, which is a central, twisted parallel beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices. This fold provides a scaffold for cofactor binding, typical of the SDR superfamily (Bhatia2015Towards). The SDR42E1 protein includes a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) domain and two transmembrane domains, indicating its involvement in steroid metabolism and potential membrane association (Bouhouche2021Identification).

A missense mutation, c.461G > A, in the SDR42E1 gene results in the substitution of arginine with glutamine at position 154. This mutation is located within the catalytic 3β-HSD domain, between the active site at position 152 and the binding site at position 156, affecting the protein's conformational stability and flexibility (Bouhouche2021Identification). The mutation is predicted to have a destabilizing effect on the protein structure, with a ΔΔG value of -1.039 kcal/mol, indicating a significant impact on the protein's stability (Bouhouche2021Identification). The SDR42E1 protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in steroid biosynthesis and its association with oculocutaneous genital syndrome.

## Function
The SDR42E1 gene encodes a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, which is involved in steroid biosynthesis and metabolism. This gene is located on chromosome 16q23.3 and consists of three exons, with the first being noncoding. The protein encoded by SDR42E1 includes a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) domain and two transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity in steroid biosynthesis (Bouhouche2021Identification).

In healthy human cells, SDR42E1 is thought to play a role in maintaining proper steroid hormone synthesis and cholesterol metabolism. This function is essential for the maintenance of connective tissue and sexual maturation (Bouhouche2021Identification). The enzyme's activity is associated with the regulation of 8-dehydrocholesterol levels, suggesting its involvement in sterol metabolism (Stiles2012Genetic).

SDR42E1 is also implicated in the biosynthesis and metabolism of steroid hormones at the ocular surface, potentially influencing mucin production, tear film stability, and immune responses in the conjunctiva (Alenezi2022Differential). Despite these roles, the precise biological function of SDR42E1 in healthy cells remains partially understood, with ongoing research exploring its enzymatic specificity and molecular mechanisms (Stiles2012Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDR42E1 gene have been linked to a novel syndrome known as oculocutaneous genital syndrome (OCGS). This condition is characterized by a combination of ocular, cutaneous, and genital abnormalities. A specific missense mutation, c.461G > A, resulting in the amino acid substitution p.Arg154Gln, has been identified as pathogenic. This mutation affects a highly conserved nucleotide, replacing a positively charged arginine with a noncharged glutamine at position 154 within the catalytic 3β-HSD domain of the enzyme. This alteration is critical as it occurs between the active site and the binding site of the enzyme, leading to a destabilizing effect on the protein's conformational stability and flexibility (Bouhouche2021Identification).

The mutation has been associated with symptoms of brittle cornea syndrome, such as corneal thinning and blue sclera, as well as endocrine abnormalities like micropenis, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism. It is suggested that the mutation alters steroid hormone synthesis, resulting in low cholesterol levels in affected individuals, which may contribute to the clinical manifestations observed (Bouhouche2021Identification). The mutation was found in a homozygous state in affected individuals and in a heterozygous state in carriers within the family, indicating a potential link to disorders of sex development and connective tissue integrity (Bouhouche2021Identification).
