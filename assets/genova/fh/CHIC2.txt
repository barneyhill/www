# CHIC2

## Overview
The CHIC2 gene encodes the cysteine-rich hydrophobic domain 2 protein, which is characterized by a distinctive cysteine-rich motif essential for its function and localization. This protein is primarily membrane-anchored due to post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, which facilitate its association with cellular membranes. Functionally, CHIC2 plays a critical role in modulating the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, acting as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor that influences protein homeostasis and cellular health. The interaction between CHIC2 and CHIP is evolutionarily conserved and significant for various cellular processes, including receptor trafficking and protein degradation pathways. Clinically, alterations in the CHIC2 gene, such as deletions, are associated with hematological disorders, including systemic mastocytosis with associated eosinophilia, and serve as markers for specific genetic fusions that respond to targeted therapies (Pardanani2003CHIC2; Callahan2023Interaction).

## Structure
The CHIC2 protein is characterized by a cysteine-rich hydrophobic motif known as the CHIC motif, which consists of a highly conserved 23 amino acid stretch. This motif includes eight cysteine residues, five of which are 100% conserved, and is crucial for the protein's function and localization (Cools2001A). The primary structure of CHIC2 is defined by this conserved motif, which is essential for its palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that facilitates membrane association (Cools2001A). Palmitoylation results in a molecular weight shift from 23 kDa to 27 kDa, confirming its role in membrane localization (Cools2001A).

The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CHIC2 are not explicitly detailed in the available sources. However, the AlphaFold2 predicted structure suggests that the membrane-anchoring cysteines of the CHIC motif are positioned at the end of a helix-turn-helix, leaving the C-terminus exposed, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins such as CHIP (Callahan2023Interaction). The C-terminus of CHIC2 contains an EEVD-like motif that binds to the TPR domain of the ubiquitin ligase CHIP, influencing its activity (Callahan2023Interaction). The interaction between CHIC2 and CHIP is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in cellular processes (Callahan2023Interaction).

## Function
The CHIC2 gene encodes a membrane-anchored protein that plays a significant role in regulating the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. CHIC2 interacts with CHIP in a chaperone-independent manner, primarily through its C-terminal binding to CHIP's TPR domain, which is crucial for CHIP recruitment (Callahan2023Interaction). This interaction constrains CHIP's ubiquitin ligase activity by competing with molecular chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp90, thereby influencing protein homeostasis and cellular health (Callahan2023Interaction).

CHIC2 is involved in substrate recognition and is highly coordinated with CHIP in certain cell types, affecting the stability and surface levels of proteins such as the interferon gamma receptor (IFNGR) (Callahan2023Interaction). The protein is localized to the plasma membrane and vesicles, a process dependent on its constitutive palmitoylation, which allows it to modulate CHIP's activity at the cell membrane (Callahan2023Interaction).

The interaction between CHIC2 and CHIP is crucial for maintaining neuronal health and longevity, as its disruption can lead to neurodegeneration and decreased lifespan in model organisms (Callahan2023Interaction). CHIC2's role in regulating receptor trafficking and protein degradation pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Callahan2023Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
The CHIC2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in chromosomal rearrangements, particularly deletions, which are associated with various hematological disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to CHIC2 deletion is systemic mastocytosis with associated eosinophilia (SMCD-eos). This deletion serves as a surrogate marker for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, which is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase. The presence of this fusion gene is associated with a positive response to imatinib mesylate therapy, a targeted treatment for certain eosinophilic disorders (Pardanani2003CHIC2; Pardanani2004FIP1L1PDGFRA).

The CHIC2 deletion is also significant in distinguishing between SMCD-eos and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Patients with the CHIC2 deletion often exhibit symptoms characteristic of systemic mastocytosis and respond well to imatinib therapy, unlike those with the c-kit D816V mutation (Pardanani2004FIP1L1PDGFRA; Pardanani2003CHIC2). Additionally, the CHIC2 gene has been implicated in rare cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through the formation of a CHIC2-ETV6 fusion gene, although this is less common (Kuchenbauer2005A). These genetic alterations highlight the role of CHIC2 in the pathogenesis and treatment of specific hematological malignancies.

## Interactions
The CHIC2 protein interacts with the ubiquitin ligase CHIP through its C-terminal EEVD-like motif, which binds to CHIP's TPR domain. This interaction is characterized by the terminal aspartic acid of CHIC2 interacting with specific residues in CHIP, namely K30 and K95, forming a carboxylate clamp (Callahan2023Interaction). CHIC2 competes with chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 for binding to CHIP, despite having a modest affinity compared to these chaperones (Callahan2023Interaction). This interaction is significant as it constrains CHIP's ubiquitin ligase activity, particularly at the membrane, and may influence receptor trafficking through monoubiquitination (Callahan2023Interaction).

CHIC2 acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor, reducing CHIP's ubiquitin ligase activity by hindering the recruitment of Hsp70 and other chaperones, thereby affecting CHIP's catalytic activity (Callahan2023Interaction). The interaction between CHIC2 and CHIP is evolutionarily conserved and plays a crucial role in regulating CHIP's function, particularly at the cell surface. The loss of this interaction can lead to neurodegeneration and shortened lifespan in model organisms like C. elegans (Callahan2023Interaction). CHIC2's interaction with CHIP is distinct from other CHIP partners, such as TMEM185A/B, and does not interfere with their interactions (Callahan2023Interaction).
