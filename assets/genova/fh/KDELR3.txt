# KDELR3

## Overview
KDELR3 is a gene that encodes the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3, a crucial component of the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining protein homeostasis within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This receptor is part of a family of seven-transmembrane-domain receptors that facilitate the retrograde transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER by recognizing the KDEL sequence at the C-terminus of target proteins (Yuan2024Exomewide). The KDELR3 protein plays a significant role in the ER stress response and is involved in the secretion of extracellular matrix components, particularly in ocular fibroblasts, contributing to tissue integrity and eye health (Yuan2024Exomewide). Mutations in KDELR3 have been associated with various conditions, including lung adenocarcinoma, type 2 diabetes, and extreme myopia, highlighting its clinical significance (Altenhofen2023E96V; Yuan2024Exomewide; Li2024Exploring).

## Function
The KDELR3 gene encodes the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 3, which is integral to the retrograde transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This receptor is part of a family of seven-transmembrane-domain ER protein retention receptors that recognize the KDEL sequence at the C-terminus of target proteins, ensuring their retention within the ER. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, facilitating proper protein folding, and ensuring quality control within the cell (Yuan2024Exomewide).

KDELR3 is highly expressed in fibroblasts, particularly ocular fibroblasts, where it plays a significant role in the secretion of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, including those in the eye (Yuan2024Exomewide). The receptor is also involved in the ER stress response, which is important for cellular adaptation to stress and maintaining cellular function (Yuan2024Exomewide).

In the context of eye health, KDELR3 is implicated in the organization of the scleral ECM, contributing to the maintenance of normal eye structure and function (Yuan2024Exomewide). Its role in ECM remodeling and integrity is crucial for preventing conditions such as extreme myopia (Yuan2024Exomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KDELR3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), elevated mRNA expression levels of KDELR3 are associated with shorter overall survival and first progression survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Genetic alterations in KDELR3, including mutations, correlate with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in LUAD patients, indicating significant prognostic implications (Li2024Exploring).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), the E96V mutation in the KDELR3 gene is associated with diabetes susceptibility in obese NZO mice. This mutation affects protein function, potentially altering electrostatic interactions and impacting ER stress responses, leading to beta cell dysfunction. KDELR3 is involved in insulin processing and beta cell function, with its knockdown resulting in higher pro-insulin levels, an early indicator of beta cell loss (Altenhofen2023E96V).

KDELR3 mutations are also linked to extreme myopia (EM). Rare protein-truncating variants in KDELR3 are enriched in EM cases, suggesting a role in the disease's genetic architecture. These mutations may affect extracellular matrix organization and ER stress in scleral fibroblasts, contributing to myopia pathogenesis (Yuan2024Exomewide).

## Interactions
KDELR3, a member of the KDEL receptor family, is involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. This process is crucial for maintaining ER function and protein quality control. KDELR3 interacts with proteins containing the KDEL sequence, facilitating their transport between the Golgi and the ER. This interaction is essential for the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport pathway, which is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (Yuan2024Exomewide).

The KDELR3 protein is also involved in the retention or transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi, interacting with specific C-terminal amino acid motifs. The protein family, to which KDELR3 belongs, is known to form a negatively charged pocket for ligand binding upon pH acidification, suggesting that mutations in KDELR3 may affect its interaction with ligands (Altenhofen2023E96V). These interactions are critical for the proper functioning of the ER-Golgi interface and are implicated in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and extreme myopia, where KDELR3 mutations have been shown to disrupt normal cellular processes (Yuan2024Exomewide; Altenhofen2023E96V).
