# TRAP1

## Overview
TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial chaperone protein belonging to the Hsp90 family. The TRAP1 protein is primarily involved in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity, playing a critical role in cellular bioenergetics and stress responses. It modulates oxidative phosphorylation and protects cells from apoptosis by regulating mitochondrial membrane permeability and interacting with various mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins. TRAP1's activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation, which affect its conformation and function. The protein's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in both normal cellular processes and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where it is implicated in tumor progression, drug resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Faienza2020Snitrosylation; Cannino2022The; Masuda2011The).

## Structure
TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) is a mitochondrial chaperone protein that belongs to the Hsp90 family. It is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of TRAP1 includes a 59 amino acid mitochondrial import sequence, which is crucial for its localization within the mitochondria (Faienza2020Snitrosylation). The protein functions as a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of three main domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD) for ATP binding, a middle domain (MD) that contains the client protein binding site, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) responsible for dimerization (Faienza2020Snitrosylation).

TRAP1's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its three-dimensional folding, forming a tertiary structure that facilitates its chaperone activity. The quaternary structure involves the dimerization of TRAP1, which is essential for its function (Faienza2020Snitrosylation).

TRAP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, deacetylation, and S-nitrosylation. S-nitrosylation at Cys501 is particularly significant as it affects the protein's conformation and ATPase activity, impacting mitochondrial homeostasis and cell death response (Faienza2020Snitrosylation). The protein also features a novel N-terminal extension, known as the 'strap,' which regulates its ATPase activity in a temperature-dependent manner (Partridge2014A).

## Function
TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) is a mitochondrial chaperone that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating cellular bioenergetics by modulating oxidative phosphorylation, specifically through the inhibition of key enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Cannino2022The). TRAP1 enhances the enzymatic activity of F-ATP synthase, a complex responsible for ATP production, and counteracts the inhibitory effects of cyclophilin D (CyPD) on this enzyme (Cannino2022The). This interaction also inhibits the permeability transition pore (PTP) channel activity, which is associated with mitochondrial depolarization and cell death, thereby protecting cells from apoptosis (Cannino2022The).

TRAP1 also acts as a sensor of oxidative stress and is involved in blocking apoptosis by influencing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Masuda2011The). It regulates mitochondrial membrane permeability, which is crucial for controlling apoptosis, and helps maintain mitochondrial stability by responding to oxidative stress (Masuda2011The). Through these functions, TRAP1 contributes to cellular energy metabolism, survival, and stress responses, playing a protective role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRAP1 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, TRAP1 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. It is highly expressed in colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers, where it is linked to poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Matassa2018TRAP1; Pietrafesa2019Gene). In colorectal cancer, TRAP1 upregulation is associated with drug resistance and poor survival rates, and it regulates key signaling pathways like BRAF and Wnt/βCatenin, which are crucial for cancer progression (Matassa2018TRAP1). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, TRAP1 downregulation is linked to higher tumor grade and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting its complex role in cancer biology (Amoroso2016TRAP1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, TRAP1 mutations are implicated in Parkinson's disease. These mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of the disease, and are associated with late-onset Parkinson's symptoms (Fitzgerald2017Metformin). The R47X mutation, in particular, results in a truncated protein and is linked to various health conditions, including cardiomyopathy and chronic pancreatitis (Fitzgerald2017Metformin). These findings highlight TRAP1's significant role in disease pathology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TRAP1 (TNF receptor associated protein 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TRAP1 interacts with the mitochondrial protein import channel component TOMM40, as well as with mitochondrial translation elongation factor TUFM and cytosolic translation elongation factors EEF1A and EEF1G. These interactions are specific and have been demonstrated through proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Avolio2023Cytosolic).

TRAP1 also forms a complex with the proteasome regulatory particle TBP7/RPT3 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which plays a role in controlling the ubiquitination of specific mitochondrial proteins. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing apoptosis in response to ER stress (Amoroso2011TRAP1).

In cancer cells, TRAP1 interacts with various metabolic intermediates, helping to stabilize mitochondrial functions and maintain the integrity of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation complexes (Dharaskar2023Analysis). Additionally, TRAP1 interacts with sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) to promote mitochondrial respiration and maintain metabolic plasticity in glioblastoma cells (Joshi2022The). These interactions highlight TRAP1's role in regulating mitochondrial function and cellular stress responses.
