# FGFBP3

## Overview
Fibroblast growth factor binding protein 3 (FGFBP3) is a gene that encodes a chaperone protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways. The FGFBP3 protein plays a critical role in modulating metabolic processes by binding to endocrine FGFs such as FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, thereby enhancing their stability and signaling efficacy. This interaction is essential for the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as vascular function and angiogenesis. FGFBP3's ability to mobilize FGFs from the extracellular matrix and facilitate their bioavailability underscores its significance in various physiological processes, including glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and motor neuron development (Tassi2018Fibroblast; Xu2022FGF). The gene's involvement in metabolic regulation and potential therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases and cancer highlight its clinical importance (Tassi2018Fibroblast; Slater2021Combinations).

## Function
Fibroblast growth factor binding protein 3 (FGFBP3) plays a significant role in modulating metabolic processes in healthy human cells. FGFBP3 functions as a chaperone that binds to fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), particularly endocrine FGFs such as FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, enhancing their stability and signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as FGFBP3 enhances the formation of stable complexes between FGFs and their receptors, such as FGFR4, leading to increased activation of downstream signaling pathways like ERK1/2 (Tassi2018Fibroblast).

In the context of metabolic regulation, FGFBP3 has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as well as reduce fat mass and hepatic steatosis in mouse models. These effects suggest its potential therapeutic role in metabolic diseases (Tassi2018Fibroblast). FGFBP3 also interacts with FGFs to modulate vascular permeability, indicating its involvement in angiogenesis and vascular function (Zhang2008Effect). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix, where it mobilizes FGFs from their storage, facilitating their bioavailability and signaling (Tassi2018Fibroblast).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FGFBP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of metabolic disorders, FGFBP3 plays a significant role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Its expression is downregulated in diabetic conditions, which suggests a potential link to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance (Tassi2018Fibroblast). FGFBP3's interaction with fibroblast growth factors like FGF19 and FGF21 enhances their signaling, which is crucial for metabolic regulation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome and related disorders (Tassi2018Fibroblast).

In the realm of cancer, a germline missense variant A242T in FGFBP3 has been identified in a family with familial pancreatic cancer and melanoma. This variant co-segregates with the disease, although its presence in healthy individuals suggests incomplete penetrance, indicating that while it may contribute to disease predisposition, its clinical significance remains uncertain (Slater2021Combinations).

FGFBP3 is also involved in neural development, with its expression being crucial for motor neuron development and regeneration. Alterations in FGFBP3 expression can lead to motor neuron defects, as observed in zebrafish models, which may have implications for understanding motor neuron-related clinical conditions (Xu2022FGF).

## Interactions
Fibroblast growth factor binding protein 3 (FGFBP3) interacts with various fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), particularly endocrine FGFs such as FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23. FGFBP3 enhances the signaling of these FGFs by binding to them, which has been demonstrated through assays like surface plasmon resonance and solid-phase equilibrium binding assays. FGFBP3 shows a stronger binding affinity to FGF19 compared to other FGF-binding proteins, such as BP1, and enhances the formation of a stable complex between FGF19 and its receptor FGFR4, thereby increasing the activation of downstream signaling pathways like ERK1/2 in cell models (Tassi2018Fibroblast).

FGFBP3 also competes with KLB, a co-receptor, for binding to FGFs and can enhance FGF19 and FGF21 signaling even in the absence of KLB (Tassi2018Fibroblast). This interaction is significant for modulating metabolic processes, suggesting FGFBP3's potential role in treating metabolic syndrome (Tassi2018Fibroblast). Additionally, FGFBP3 interacts with FGF2, which is involved in neuron axonal branching, growth, and neurogenesis, indicating its role in motor neuron development and regeneration (Xu2022FGF). These interactions highlight FGFBP3's role as a chaperone protein that modulates FGF signaling pathways, impacting various physiological processes.
