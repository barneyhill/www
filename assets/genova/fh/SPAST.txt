# SPAST

## Overview
The SPAST gene encodes the protein spastin, a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, which is integral to microtubule dynamics within cells. Spastin functions primarily as a microtubule-severing enzyme, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell division, cytokinesis, and axonal maintenance. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain and a central AAA ATPase domain, which are essential for its ATP-dependent activity. Spastin's ability to sever microtubules is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and dynamics, particularly in neurons where it contributes to axonal growth and maintenance. Mutations in the SPAST gene are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), specifically type 4 (SPG4), highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Sandate2019An; Errico2004Spastin; Depienne2005Spastin).

## Structure
The spastin protein, encoded by the SPAST gene, is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family and plays a crucial role in microtubule severing. Structurally, spastin is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain, a central AAA ATPase domain, and a C-terminal region. The AAA domain is highly conserved and contains Walker A and B motifs essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Hazan1999Spastin; RollMecak2008Structural).

Spastin typically forms a hexameric structure upon ATP binding, which is necessary for its function in microtubule severing. This hexameric form resembles a split lock-washer and is composed of individual protomers that form a right-handed spiral. The central pore of the hexamer is formed by the large nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), with peripheral contact from the helical bundle domain (HBD) of neighboring protomers (Sandate2019An).

The protein's structure is further stabilized by specific interactions within the hexamer, including well-ordered loops in the AAA domain involved in substrate binding and inter-protomer contacts. These loops are disordered in nucleotide-free structures, highlighting the importance of ATP binding for structural integrity (Sandate2019An). Spastin's activity and structural stability are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and the presence of splice variant isoforms (Eckert2012Subunit).

## Function
The SPAST gene encodes the protein spastin, which plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics within human cells. Spastin is a member of the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family and functions primarily as a microtubule-severing enzyme. This activity is essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, cytokinesis, and axonal maintenance (Sandate2019An; Errico2004Spastin). Spastin is enriched in regions with dynamic microtubules, such as the spindle pole, midbody, and distal axons, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal rearrangements and dynamics (Errico2004Spastin).

The protein interacts with microtubules through its N-terminal region, and its ATPase activity is crucial for its function. This interaction is regulated by ATP hydrolysis, which facilitates the severing of microtubules, thereby maintaining their integrity and dynamics (Salinas2007Spastin; Errico2002Spastin). Spastin's activity is also modulated by the polyglutamylation of the tubulin C-terminal tail, enhancing its severing capability (Sandate2019An).

In neurons, spastin is involved in axonal microtubule organization, with a gradient of increasing concentration from proximal to distal regions, highlighting its role in axonal growth and maintenance (Errico2004Spastin). The proper regulation of microtubule dynamics by spastin is crucial for maintaining the integrity of long axons, such as those in the corticospinal tracts (Errico2002Spastin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPAST gene, which encodes the protein spastin, are primarily associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), specifically type 4 (SPG4). This condition is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs due to axonal neurodegeneration of the corticospinal tract (Ferese2023Cohort; Depienne2005Spastin). SPAST mutations account for approximately 40% of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) cases and about 20% of sporadic HSP cases (Fonknechten2000Spectrum; Lo2014Hereditary).

The clinical manifestations of SPG4 can vary widely, ranging from a pure phenotype with spastic paraparesis to more complicated forms that may include cognitive impairments, cerebellar signs, or epilepsy (Depienne2005Spastin). Some patients may also experience sensory deficits, bladder disturbances, and mild peripheral neuropathy (Lo2014Hereditary; Proukakis2011Detection). The age of onset is highly variable, with cases reported from infancy to late adulthood (Proukakis2011Detection).

Mutations in the SPAST gene often lead to a loss of function, primarily affecting the AAA domain of spastin, which is crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and membrane trafficking (Lo2014Hereditary; Shoukier2008Expansion). The pathogenic mechanism is typically haploinsufficiency, where the reduced function of spastin contributes to the disease (Depienne2005Spastin).

## Interactions
Spastin, encoded by the SPAST gene, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with atlastin, a protein also mutated in autosomal-dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments. The binding occurs within the N-terminal 80 residues of spastin, overlapping with its microtubule-binding region (Sanderson2005Spastin). Spastin and atlastin co-localize on the endoplasmic reticulum and possibly the Golgi apparatus, suggesting their participation in the same biochemical pathway related to HSP (Sanderson2005Spastin).

Spastin also interacts with the endosomal protein CHMP1B, part of the ESCRT-III complex. This interaction is mediated by the MIT domain of spastin and is crucial for recruiting spastin to the midbody during cytokinesis. The interaction is highly specific, involving a large interface with numerous hydrogen bonds (Yang2008Structural). Mutations in the CHMP1B binding site of spastin can impair its midbody localization, affecting cell division (Yang2008Structural). These interactions highlight spastin's role in microtubule dynamics and membrane trafficking.
