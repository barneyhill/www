# C4orf17

## Overview
C4orf17 is a gene located on chromosome 4 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 4 open reading frame 17. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely undefined. However, emerging research suggests that C4orf17 may be involved in chromatin modification processes, particularly through interactions with proteins associated with histone methylation. These interactions imply a potential role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression. The protein's involvement in such pathways is inferred from its association with a subinteractome rich in chromatin-modifying proteins, including ATRX, CHD3, and SUV39H1 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). While the precise functions of C4orf17 are still under investigation, its study is facilitated by advanced techniques such as scalable multiplex co-fractionation/mass spectrometry, which helps elucidate protein interaction networks in various cellular contexts, including cancer (Havugimana2022Scalable).

## Function


## Interactions
C4orf17 is a protein that may be involved in chromatin modification processes, particularly through histone methylation. This inference is based on the analysis of its subinteractome, which includes a high representation of proteins such as ATRX, CHD3, KAT2B, KDM1A, PRMT1, and SUV39H1. These proteins are known to participate in chromatin modification, suggesting that C4orf17 might play a role in similar pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The study of C4orf17's interactions does not mention direct interactions with nucleic acids but focuses on protein-protein interactions that imply a role in chromatin-related functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

The scalable multiplex co-fractionation/mass spectrometry (mCF/MS) platform has been used to study protein interaction networks, including those involving C4orf17, in the context of breast cancer cells. This method allows for the detection of multi-protein assemblies and provides insights into the formation of protein-protein interactions among oncoproteins in cancer cells. However, specific interactions involving C4orf17 were not detailed in the available data (Havugimana2022Scalable).
