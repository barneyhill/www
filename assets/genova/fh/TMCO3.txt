# TMCO3

## Overview
TMCO3 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 3 protein, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions that may influence signaling pathways and cellular homeostasis (Hu2022Transmembrane). TMCO3 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Hu2022Transmembrane). Additionally, TMCO3 has been linked to other diseases, including neuroblastoma and opioid dependence, highlighting its potential significance in clinical research and as a biomarker for disease progression and treatment response (Wang2024Wholeexome; Duan2018Whole). Further studies are required to elucidate the precise biological functions and mechanisms of TMCO3 in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The TMCO3 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), TMCO3 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poorer overall survival and increased immune cell infiltration. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a target for immunotherapy, particularly in predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapies (Hu2022Transmembrane).

In a case report involving a chromosome 13q34 duplication, TMCO3 was overexpressed in a patient with dystonia, facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, and breast cancer. Although the duplication included several genes, the overexpression of TMCO3 may contribute to the clinical phenotypes observed, although its specific role remains unclear (Moscovich2013Dystonia).

TMCO3 has also been associated with opioid dependence through suggestive associations identified in a whole-exome sequencing study. Rare variants in TMCO3 were found to have a potential role in the genetic architecture of opioid dependence, although these findings did not reach genome-wide significance (Wang2024Wholeexome).

In neuroblastoma, mutations in TMCO3 were identified in both plasma cell-free DNA and bone marrow genomic DNA, indicating its potential utility in monitoring minimal residual disease during chemotherapy (Duan2018Whole).

## Interactions
TMCO3, a gene encoding a transmembrane protein, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that may play a role in cellular processes and signaling pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network established using the STRING database suggests that TMCO3 interacts with several proteins, including GART, TEME117, NQO2, CPA2, TYSND1, ATP6V1A, NQO1, C20orf96, and CNEP1R1 (Hu2022Transmembrane). These interactions indicate that TMCO3 may be part of multiprotein complexes or participate in regulatory pathways within the cell.

The study by Yang et al. also predicts an interaction between TMCO3 and the C11orf96 protein, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death pathways (Yang2022Molecular). This interaction suggests a potential role for TMCO3 in stress response mechanisms within the endoplasmic reticulum.

While the specific functional outcomes of these interactions are not fully elucidated, the involvement of TMCO3 in these networks highlights its potential significance in cellular homeostasis and disease processes, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis (Hu2022Transmembrane). Further research is needed to clarify the precise roles of these interactions in cellular and pathological contexts.
