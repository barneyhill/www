# ALX1

## Overview
The ALX1 gene encodes the ALX homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor that is integral to craniofacial development. As a member of the ALX family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors, ALX1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis, particularly influencing the development of frontonasal structures. The protein functions primarily within the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of genes essential for the proper patterning of craniofacial mesenchyme. Mutations in the ALX1 gene can result in frontonasal dysplasia, a condition marked by significant craniofacial anomalies, underscoring the gene's critical role in normal facial development (Farlie2016Frontonasal; Iyyanar2022Alx1).

## Function
The ALX1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in craniofacial development by regulating gene expression during embryogenesis. ALX1 is part of the ALX family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors, which also includes ALX3 and ALX4. These transcription factors are involved in the development of frontonasal structures and are crucial for the proper patterning of craniofacial mesenchyme (Farlie2016Frontonasal; Iyyanar2022Alx1).

In healthy human cells, ALX1 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the transcription of target genes. This activity is essential for maintaining the identity of frontonasal mesenchyme and ensuring the correct development of facial structures. ALX1 regulates the expression of genes involved in cranial neural crest cell (CNCC)-derived mesenchyme, which is vital for the formation of the frontonasal region (Iyyanar2022Alx1).

Mutations in ALX1 can lead to frontonasal dysplasia, a condition characterized by craniofacial anomalies, highlighting its importance in normal craniofacial development. The homeodomain of ALX1 is particularly critical for its function, as it is involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Farlie2016Frontonasal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALX1 gene are associated with frontonasal dysplasia type 3 (FND3), a condition characterized by severe craniofacial malformations. These include bilateral severe microphthalmia or anophthalmia, hypertelorism, bilateral facial clefts, and a complete cleft palate. Additional features may include craniosynostosis, brain abnormalities, and other systemic anomalies (Markitantova2020Inherited; Vargel2021ALXRelated). In humans, ALX1 mutations can lead to frontofacionasal dysplasia, which involves severe facial clefts and microphthalmia, and these conditions are typically inherited in a recessive manner (Liao2011Clinical).

In animal models, such as zebrafish, knock-down of Alx1 expression results in significant craniofacial defects, including reduced eye size and loss of facial cartilage, due to impaired cranial neural crest cell migration (Dee2012Defective). In Burmese cats, a specific 12 bp deletion in ALX1 is linked to severe craniofacial defects, similar to human FND3, characterized by ocular hypertelorism and median facial cleft (Lyons2016AristalessLike). These findings underscore the critical role of ALX1 in craniofacial development and the severe consequences of its mutations.

## Interactions
ALX1, a transcription factor involved in skeletogenesis, interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It binds directly to DNA at specific sites, including palindromic and half sites, with a preference for palindromic sites containing inverted TAAT sequences. This binding involves cooperative dimerization of ALX1 molecules, facilitated by the D2 domain, which influences its DNA-binding properties and allows the acquisition of new transcriptional targets (GuerreroSantoro2021Analysis).

ALX1 also forms interactions with other proteins, such as Ets1, in a gene regulatory network. ALX1 and Ets1 co-regulate a significant number of downstream genes, often through a coherent feed-forward loop where Ets1 regulates ALX1, and both together regulate effector genes. This interaction is supported by the presence of consensus Ets1 binding sites in ALX1 ChIP-seq peaks, indicating a physical interaction with nucleic acids (Khor2019Genomewide; Ettensohn2022Lessons).

ALX1 can also dimerize through direct protein-protein interactions independent of DNA binding. This dimerization is crucial for its dual regulatory roles, acting as both an activator and a repressor of its own transcription and other target genes (Damle2011Precise; GuerreroSantoro2021Analysis).
