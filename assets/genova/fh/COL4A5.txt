# COL4A5

## Overview
The COL4A5 gene encodes the collagen type IV alpha 5 chain, a crucial component of the type IV collagen family, which plays a significant role in the structural integrity of basement membranes across various tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and ears. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, forming part of a heterotrimeric network with other collagen IV chains, such as COL4A3 and COL4A4, to maintain the function and stability of basement membranes (Kalluri1994COL4A5). The alpha 5 chain is particularly vital in the glomerular basement membrane, where it contributes to the filtration barrier essential for kidney function (Zhou1994Structure). Mutations in the COL4A5 gene are predominantly associated with X-linked Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities (Heidet2016Syndrome). The gene's role in maintaining basement membrane integrity underscores its importance in normal physiological processes and its involvement in disease pathogenesis when mutated (Hudson2003Alport’s).

## Structure
The COL4A5 gene encodes the alpha 5(IV) collagen chain, a component of type IV collagen found in basement membranes. The primary structure of the protein consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the alpha 5(IV) chain, characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats typical of collagen proteins (Sand2016Type; Kobayashi2008Mutational). The secondary structure includes motifs such as beta-sheets, contributing to the novel tertiary structure of the monomers (Hudson2003Alport’s). The tertiary structure involves two homologous subdomains characterized by these beta-sheet motifs (Hudson2003Alport’s).

At the quaternary level, the alpha 5(IV) chain forms part of a triple helical protomer, which is a component of a larger network. This network is composed of protomers that connect end-to-end, forming a supercoiled and looped structure with disulfide cross-links between triple helical domains (Hudson2003Alport’s). The NC1 domain of the alpha 5(IV) chain plays a crucial role in molecular recognition and assembly of the protomer and network, with specific sequences governing the selection of partner chains (Hudson2003Alport’s; Khoshnoodi2008Mammalian). The 7S domains contribute to the specificity, affinity, and geometry of the tetramer formed through the connection of four protomers (Hudson2003Alport’s).

## Function
The COL4A5 gene encodes the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen, a critical component of basement membranes in various tissues, including the kidneys, eyes, and ears. In healthy human cells, the alpha-5 chain forms a heterotrimer with the alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains of type IV collagen, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of the basement membrane (Zhao2019Novel). This structural role is particularly important in the glomeruli of the kidneys, where the basement membrane acts as a filtration barrier, contributing to the size-selective sieving of macromolecules (Zhou1994Structure).

The alpha-5 chain is strongly expressed in the glomerular basement membrane, Bowman's capsules, and some tubules in the human kidney, indicating its crucial role in maintaining the filtration processes necessary for normal kidney function (Ninomiya1995Differential). The presence of the alpha-5 chain in the basement membranes of the kidney is confirmed through immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses, highlighting its restricted distribution and specific role in kidney function (Hostikka1990Identification).

Mutations in the COL4A5 gene can disrupt these processes, leading to conditions such as Alport syndrome, characterized by progressive nephropathy, sensorineural deafness, and ocular abnormalities (Zhao2019Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL4A5 gene are primarily associated with Alport syndrome, a hereditary nephropathy characterized by progressive renal failure, sensorineural deafness, and ocular abnormalities. This condition is predominantly X-linked, with mutations in COL4A5 accounting for approximately 85% of Alport syndrome cases (Heidet2016Syndrome; Wang2005Detection). The gene encodes the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen, which is crucial for the structural integrity of basement membranes in the kidney, ear, and eye (Hertz2008MLPA).

Alport syndrome manifests with symptoms such as hematuria, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease, often progressing to end-stage renal failure in affected males by their early 20s (King2002Unusual; Plant1999Detection). Females with heterozygous mutations generally experience a milder form of the disease (King2002Unusual). The severity of the condition can vary based on the type of mutation, with nonsense, frameshift, deletion, and splicing mutations often leading to more severe symptoms (Zhao2019Novel).

In addition to Alport syndrome, mutations in COL4A5 have been linked to other conditions such as diffuse leiomyomatosis and atypical presentations of glomerular disease without the classic symptoms of Alport syndrome (Wuttke2015ACOL4A5mutation; Nabais2014Collagen).

## Interactions
The COL4A5 gene encodes the alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen, which is a critical component of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the kidneys. This protein interacts with other collagen IV chains, such as COL4A3 and COL4A4, to form a heterotrimeric network essential for the structural integrity and function of basement membranes (Kalluri1994COL4A5). Mutations in COL4A5 can lead to X-linked Alport syndrome, characterized by defects in the GBM (Lennon2015Coinheritance).

In the context of kidney disease, COL4A5 has been shown to interact with MYO1E, a podocyte-expressed non-muscle myosin. The coinheritance of mutations in COL4A5 and MYO1E can exacerbate the severity of kidney disease, suggesting that these proteins may disrupt common signaling pathways when mutated (Lennon2015Coinheritance). Protein interaction network analysis has mapped collagen IV alpha-3,4,5 and myosin 1E onto a merged human interactome, highlighting their interactions within the extracellular matrix and with other proteins (Lennon2015Coinheritance).

Additionally, the absence of the alpha-5 chain due to COL4A5 gene deletion can lead to the production of alloantibodies targeting the alpha-3(IV) chain, indicating a defective assembly of collagen chains in the GBM (Kalluri1994COL4A5).
