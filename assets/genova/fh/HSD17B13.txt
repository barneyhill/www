# HSD17B13

## Overview
HSD17B13 is a gene that encodes the protein hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 13, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver and is associated with lipid droplets in hepatocytes, where it plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. The enzyme is involved in the conversion of 17-ketosteroids to 17β-hydroxysteroids, as well as the metabolism of sex steroids, fatty acids, cholesterol, bile acids, and retinoids. Its enzymatic activity includes the conversion of retinol to retinaldehyde, which is crucial for vitamin A metabolism. HSD17B13 is regulated by factors such as liver x receptor-α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and its expression is linked to hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Variants of the HSD17B13 gene have been associated with various liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Ma201917‐Beta; Amangurbanova2022Review).

## Structure
The HSD17B13 protein is characterized by its formation as a dimer, with each subunit comprising a catalytic core domain and a membrane anchoring domain. The catalytic core domain spans residues 29-259 and contains the cofactor binding site and catalytic center, while the membrane anchoring domain includes a hydrophobic N-terminal helix (residues 2-28) and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif (residues 260-286) (Liu2023Structural). The N-terminal helix is crucial for lipid droplet (LD) association, interacting with the non-polar interior of the lipid membrane, while amphipathic patches interact with the membrane's charged head groups (Liu2023Structural). 

The protein's structure features a conserved α/β folding pattern typical of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, with a catalytic tetrad of Asn-Ser-Tyr-Lys (Ma2020Characterization). Post-translational modifications include palmitoylation of Cys80, enhancing membrane interaction (Ma2020Characterization). Splice variants, such as the isoB variant, lack residues 71-106, affecting the cofactor binding site and dimer interface, leading to misfolding and aggregation (Liu2023Structural). The presence of proline residues at key positions introduces sharp turns, affecting stability and expression levels (Liu2023Structural).

## Function
The HSD17B13 gene encodes a protein that is part of the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family, which is involved in the conversion between 17-ketosteroids and 17β-hydroxysteroids. This enzyme family plays a crucial role in the metabolism of sex steroids, fatty acids, cholesterol, bile acids, and retinoids (Amangurbanova2022Review). HSD17B13 is highly expressed in the liver and localizes to the surface of lipid droplets in hepatocytes, where it is involved in lipid homeostasis by stabilizing intracellular triglyceride content (Amangurbanova2022Review).

The protein exhibits enzymatic activity, potentially acting on substrates such as steroids, proinflammatory lipid mediators, and retinol. It catalyzes the conversion of retinol to retinaldehyde, a process essential for vitamin A metabolism in the liver (Amangurbanova2022Review). This activity is linked to the regulation of hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, immunomodulation, and suppression of fibrogenesis (Amangurbanova2022Review).

HSD17B13 expression is regulated by liver x receptor-α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which are associated with lipid metabolism. Its expression is suppressed by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα), involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation (Amangurbanova2022Review). Overexpression of HSD17B13 is linked to increased hepatic lipogenesis, while its suppression is associated with reduced lipogenic gene expression, indicating its role in lipid metabolism and hepatic lipogenesis regulation (Amangurbanova2022Review).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSD17B13 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in liver diseases. The rs72613567 variant is associated with a reduced risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as a lower risk of progression to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (Ma201917‐Beta; Amangurbanova2022Review). However, in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, this variant increases the risk of hepatic decompensation and liver-related mortality, especially in those with viral hepatitis (GilGómez2022Impact).

The rs72613567 variant also interacts with the PNPLA3 gene variant rs738409, exacerbating liver-related complications in carriers of the rs738409-GG genotype (GilGómez2022Impact). Other variants, such as rs6834314, are linked to lower liver enzyme levels and reduced risk of cirrhosis (Ma201917‐Beta).

Therapeutically, targeting HSD17B13 expression through RNA interference is being explored, with clinical trials for siRNA-based treatments like ARO-HSD and ALN-HSD showing promise in reducing liver enzyme levels and potentially mimicking the protective effects of loss-of-function variants (Amangurbanova2022Review). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in liver disease management.
