# AFAP1L2

## Overview
AFAP1L2, also known as actin filament associated protein 1 like 2 or XB130, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, adhesion, and signaling. The protein is characterized by its Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a coiled-coil region, which facilitate its role as an adaptor in signaling pathways (ZHANG2016XB130:). Unlike other members of the AFAP family, AFAP1L2 does not efficiently bind to actin filaments but instead acts as an intermediary in the RET/PTC kinase and PI-3 kinase pathways, particularly in thyroid tissues (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). The protein is implicated in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell survival and differentiation, and is involved in the PTN-PTPRZ signaling pathway, which affects oligodendrocyte differentiation (Tanga2019The). Clinically, AFAP1L2 is significant in cancer biology, particularly in thyroid cancer and melanoma, where it forms fusion oncogenes and interacts with key signaling molecules (Brossard2015Integrated; Iyama2017Identification).

## Structure
AFAP1L2, also known as XB130, is a protein encoded by the AFAP1L2 gene located on human chromosome 10q25.3. The protein consists of 818 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa (ZHANG2016XB130:). Its primary structure includes several Src homology 2 (SH2) and Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs, two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a coiled-coil region. The N-terminal region contains 23 putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a proline-rich motif, which may interact with SH2- and SH3-domain-containing proteins (ZHANG2016XB130:).

The PH domains are involved in targeting proteins to cellular membranes through interactions with phospholipids and membrane-associated proteins (ZHANG2016XB130:). The C-terminal region features a coiled-coil domain, similar to the leucine zipper domain found in AFAP proteins, which is believed to be involved in protein oligomerization and DNA binding (ZHANG2016XB130:). AFAP1L2 is a phosphorylation target of cSrc and RET/PTC, with Tyr 54 being a major phosphorylation site, which resembles a PI3K binding motif (Snyder2024A).

AFAP1L2 does not efficiently bind to actin filaments, unlike other members of the AFAP family, and acts as an intermediary between the RET/PTC kinase and PI-3 kinase pathway in the thyroid (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). The protein is widely expressed in various human tissues and is typically distributed in the cytoplasm (ZHANG2016XB130:).

## Function
AFAP1L2, also known as actin filament associated protein 1 like 2, plays a crucial role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and signaling. In healthy human cells, AFAP1L2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with actin filaments to affect cell structure and movement.

AFAP1L2 is involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cell survival and differentiation. It acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules like AKT and mTOR, which are critical for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system (Tanga2019The). The protein's phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, such as Tyr-54, is crucial for its interaction with the p85α subunit of PI3K, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Tanga2019The).

AFAP1L2's role in cellular signaling is further highlighted by its involvement in the PTN-PTPRZ signaling pathway, where it mediates the effects of pleiotrophin on oligodendrocyte precursor cells, promoting their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes (Tanga2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AFAP1L2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In thyroid cancer, the AFAP1L2 gene is involved in the formation of the AFAP1L2/RET fusion oncogene, identified in young patients from Fukushima. This fusion results from an intrachromosomal translocation and is associated with the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cell growth and contributing to thyroid carcinogenesis (Iyama2017Identification).

In melanoma, AFAP1L2 interacts with the TERF1 gene, and genetic variants at these loci have been linked to increased melanoma risk. The interaction between SNPs at the TERF1 and AFAP1L2 loci suggests a potential role in melanoma development, as both genes are involved in pathways regulating the mitotic cell cycle (Brossard2015Integrated).

AFAP1L2 also plays a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation through the PTN-PTPRZ signaling pathway. Alterations in AFAP1L2 expression or its interaction with PTPRZ can impact oligodendrocyte function, potentially contributing to conditions related to myelination and demyelination (Tanga2019The). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both cancer biology and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
AFAP1L2, also known as XB130, is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein interactions, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, and migration. It is known to interact with tyrosine kinases and is involved in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is significant in melanoma tumors (Brossard2015Integrated). AFAP1L2 also plays a role in cell migration and invasion through its association with Rac-GTPases, including Rac1, which is known to have mutations in melanoma tumors (Brossard2015Integrated).

In the context of thyroid cancer, AFAP1L2 forms a fusion oncogene with RET, known as AFAP1L2/RET. This fusion results from an intrachromosomal translocation and activates the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cell growth and demonstrating transforming potential (Iyama2017Identification). The AFAP1L2/RET fusion is significant in papillary thyroid carcinomas, particularly in young patients, where it acts as a driver oncogene (Iyama2017Identification).

While AFAP1L2 shares structural similarities with other AFAP family members, such as AFAP1, it does not efficiently bind to actin filaments. Instead, it acts as an intermediary in the RET/PTC kinase and PI-3 kinase pathway in the thyroid, suggesting distinct functions from AFAP1 (Snyder2011AFAP1L1).
