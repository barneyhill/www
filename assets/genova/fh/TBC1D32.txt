# TBC1D32

## Overview
TBC1D32 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 32, also known as BROMI, which is a ciliary protein involved in critical cellular processes. The protein plays a significant role in the function and maintenance of primary cilia, which are essential for sensory perception and signal transduction in cells. TBC1 domain family member 32 is particularly important in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development and the formation of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis during embryogenesis (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction; Ahn2021A). The protein's interactions with other ciliary proteins, such as CCRK/CDK20, facilitate ciliary protein trafficking and are vital for maintaining ciliary function and length (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20). Mutations in the TBC1D32 gene are associated with developmental disorders, including syndromic hypopituitarism and ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in normal cellular and developmental processes (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction; Adly2013Ciliary).

## Function
TBC1D32, also known as BROMI, is a ciliary protein that plays a crucial role in the function of primary cilia, which are essential for sensory and signal transduction in cells. It is involved in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is vital for brain development and the proper development of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis during embryogenesis (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction; Ahn2021A). TBC1D32 is expressed in the developing hypothalamus and pituitary gland, as well as in other brain regions, indicating its significant role in neural development (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction).

The protein is critical for the localization of Gli2 within the cilium, which is necessary for SHH signaling. This localization is essential for the correct development of cilia, which are important for cell polarity and signaling pathways (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction). TBC1D32 is also involved in ciliary protein trafficking, interacting with CCRK/CDK20 to regulate the retrograde transport of proteins within cilia, which is crucial for maintaining ciliary function and length (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20). The gene's role in ciliary function and SHH signaling underscores its importance in the development of midline anterior brain and craniofacial structures (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBC1D32 gene are associated with several developmental disorders, most notably syndromic hypopituitarism and ciliopathies. Syndromic hypopituitarism is characterized by underdevelopment of the pituitary gland, leading to hormone deficiencies and various midline defects, including facial and ocular abnormalities, microcephaly, and postaxial polydactyly. These conditions are linked to biallelic variants in TBC1D32, which disrupt normal hypothalamo-pituitary development (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction).

TBC1D32 mutations are also implicated in ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by defects in the primary cilium. These disorders can result in a range of phenotypes, including midline cleft, micro/anophthalmia, polydactyly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and pituitary hypoplasia with hormonal insufficiency (Adly2013Ciliary; Ahn2021A). The gene's role in ciliary function is further supported by its interaction with CCRK/CDK20, which is crucial for ciliary protein trafficking (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20).

The pathogenic variants in TBC1D32 are predicted to cause aberrant splicing, leading to truncated proteins that disrupt normal cellular processes, including hedgehog signaling and cilium assembly, which are essential for brain development (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction).

## Interactions
TBC1D32, also known as BROMI, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in ciliary processes. It interacts with CCRK (CDK20), a kinase that regulates ciliary retrograde protein trafficking. This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of ciliary protein trafficking, as demonstrated by the inability of CCRK mutants defective in BROMI binding to rescue abnormal phenotypes in CCRK knockout cells (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20). The interaction between TBC1D32 and CCRK involves both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of TBC1D32, with the C-terminal region being particularly crucial (Noguchi2021CCRKCDK20).

TBC1D32 is also part of a complex involved in ciliary function, interacting with proteins such as TALPID3 and CEP290, which are important for ciliogenesis and centrosome function. These interactions are vital for the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia, which are key to various signaling pathways (Hietamäki2020LossofFunction). Additionally, TBC1D32 has been identified in complexes related to the transcriptional regulation of ciliogenesis, suggesting a role in coordinating ciliary assembly (Boldt2016An).
