# CCZ1

## Overview
The CCZ1 gene encodes a protein known as CCZ1 homolog, vacuolar protein trafficking and biogenesis associated, which plays a pivotal role in cellular trafficking processes. This protein is a component of the Mon1-CCZ1 complex, functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab7 GTPase, a key regulator of endosomal maturation and lysosomal fusion. The Mon1-CCZ1 complex is essential for the conversion of early to late endosomes and the subsequent fusion with lysosomes, processes critical for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of macromolecules. CCZ1 is also involved in autophagic processes and interacts with various proteins, such as FYCO1 and Atg8, to facilitate vesicle transport and autophagosome targeting. The proper functioning of CCZ1 is crucial for intracellular trafficking and has implications in viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Yasuda2015Mon1Ccz1; Monteil2023Identification; Gao2018Molecular).

## Function
The CCZ1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the endosomal-lysosomal trafficking pathway in human cells. It forms a complex with the protein Mon1, known as the Mon1-Ccz1 complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab7, a small GTPase crucial for endosomal maturation and trafficking (Yasuda2015Mon1Ccz1). This complex specifically activates Rab7 on late endosomes, facilitating their fusion with lysosomes, a critical step for the degradation and recycling of cellular materials (Yasuda2015Mon1Ccz1).

The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is recruited to late endosomes and dissociates from lysosomes, indicating its specific role in late endosomal Rab7 activation (Yasuda2015Mon1Ccz1). This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient degradation of macromolecules. The CCZ1 protein is also involved in the maturation of early to late endosomes, working alongside the HOPS tethering complex to mediate the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7, which is crucial for the fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes (Monteil2023Identification). The proper function of CCZ1 is vital for the intracellular trafficking of certain viruses, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to lysosomal function and membrane trafficking (Monteil2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the CCZ1 gene can significantly impact cellular processes, leading to various diseases and conditions. In the context of viral infections, CCZ1 is identified as a crucial regulator of lysosomal trafficking, which is essential for the entry and replication of filoviruses such as Marburg and Ebola viruses. Knockdown or knockout of CCZ1 impairs the infection process, suggesting that alterations in CCZ1 could affect susceptibility to these viral infections (Monteil2023Identification). The gene's role in endolysosomal trafficking is critical for the viruses to reach the cytosol, and its disruption can trap viruses in early endosomal structures, preventing successful infection (Monteil2023Identification).

In Alzheimer's disease models, the CCZ1-MON1A complex is involved in the autophagic degradation of Alzheimer's-related proteins. Impaired function of this complex is associated with decreased levels of active RAB7, a small GTPase necessary for autophagosome maturation, contributing to the accumulation of proteins implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of the CCZ1-MON1A complex has been shown to alleviate neuropathology and memory defects in Alzheimer's disease models, indicating its potential therapeutic role (Cai2022Enhancing).

## Interactions
The CCZ1 protein is a component of the Mon1-CCZ1 complex, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab7-like Ypt7 protein. This complex is crucial for the recruitment and activation of Rab7 on endosomal membranes, facilitating endosomal maturation and autophagic processes (Vaites2018Systematic; Kiontke2017Architecture). The Mon1-CCZ1 complex forms a heterotetrameric structure, with Mon1 and CCZ1 interacting through longin domains to mediate nucleotide exchange on Ypt7 (Kiontke2017Architecture).

CCZ1 interacts with the FYCO1 protein, an autophagy adaptor, through the GOLD domain of FYCO1, indicating a role in vesicle or membrane transport (Liu2020Probing). Additionally, CCZ1 contains LIR motifs that facilitate its interaction with Atg8, a homolog of the mammalian LC3 protein family, which is essential for targeting the Mon1-CCZ1 complex to autophagosomes (Gao2018Molecular).

In yeast, CCZ1 interacts with the Ypt7 GTPase, playing a role in vacuolar fusion processes. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that CCZ1 may regulate GDP/GTP exchange on Ypt7p, similar to other GEFs (Kucharczyk2001The).
