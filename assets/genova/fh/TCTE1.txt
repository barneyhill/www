# TCTE1

## Overview
The TCTE1 gene encodes the t-complex-associated-testis-expressed 1 protein, which is a critical component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) within the axoneme of sperm flagella. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of sperm motility by ensuring the proper coordination and function of the flagellar beating motion, which is essential for male fertility (Zhou2022Biallelic; Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). TCTE1 is primarily expressed in the testis, particularly during the spermatid stage, and contains leucine-rich repeats that facilitate receptor-mediated signaling and protein interactions necessary for sperm flagella function (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). Mutations in the TCTE1 gene have been linked to male infertility, specifically asthenozoospermia, due to their impact on sperm motility despite normal sperm morphology and count (Zhou2022Biallelic).

## Function
The TCTE1 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) within the axoneme of sperm flagella. This complex is crucial for coordinating the activity of sperm flagella elements, directly impacting sperm motility (Zhou2022Biallelic; Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). In healthy human cells, TCTE1 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of sperm flagella, contributing to normal sperm morphology and motility (Zhou2022Biallelic; Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout).

The TCTE1 protein is primarily expressed in the testis, particularly starting at the spermatid stage, and is associated with the axoneme, a structural component of the sperm tail (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). It contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are involved in receptor-mediated signaling and protein interactions, which are essential for the proper functioning of the sperm flagella (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). The protein's role in the N-DRC is to ensure the proper beating motion of flagella, which is crucial for sperm motility and, consequently, male fertility (Zhou2022Biallelic; Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCTE1 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. Studies have identified bi-allelic variants in TCTE1 that lead to impaired sperm motility and male infertility, despite normal sperm morphology and count (Zhou2022Biallelic). A specific frameshift mutation, c.396_397insTC, results in a truncated TCTE1 protein that is rapidly degraded, causing reduced sperm motility (Zhou2022Biallelic). 

Research using Tcte1 knockout mice has shown that homozygous mutants are infertile, displaying oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, while heterozygous mutants exhibit oligozoospermia, indicating a haploinsufficiency mechanism (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). These mutations affect mitochondrial ATP processing and disrupt protein interactions within the axoneme, impacting sperm tail function and motility (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). 

In humans, TCTE1 mutations have been identified in a significant percentage of infertile males, with some variants predicted to be disease-causing (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TCTE1 in male reproductive health and its potential role in diagnosing and treating male infertility.

## Interactions
The TCTE1 protein, also known as DRC5, is a component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), which is crucial for the proper functioning of motile cilia and flagella. TCTE1 interacts with other proteins within the N-DRC, including DRC7 and GAS8. These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the N-DRC and ensuring proper sperm flagellum formation and motility (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein). In Tcte1 knockout mice, the absence of TCTE1 leads to impaired sperm motility, although the axoneme structure remains normal, suggesting that TCTE1 primarily regulates flagellar motility rather than axoneme assembly (Morohoshi2020NexinDynein).

Mutations in TCTE1 can alter its surface charge potential, disrupting interactions with other N-DRC components and microtubule-associated proteins. These charge-based interactions are critical for proper flagellar beating and motility (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). Specific mutations, such as R64H, I125R, and R133C, can impact the protein's interactions by altering surface potential, disrupting the hydrophobic core, or removing hydrogen bonding groups, respectively (Olszewska2022Tcte1knockout). These disruptions can lead to abnormal sperm motility and contribute to male infertility.
