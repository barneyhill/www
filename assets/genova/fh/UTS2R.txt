# UTS2R

## Overview
The UTS2R gene encodes the urotensin 2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly within the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. As a member of the rhodopsin family of receptors, the urotensin 2 receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which facilitate its interaction with ligands and G proteins (Maryanoff2010UrotensinII). The receptor is primarily activated by the peptide urotensin II and is involved in complex signaling pathways that regulate vascular tone, including vasoconstriction and vasodilation mechanisms (PereiraCastro2019Novel). UTS2R is expressed in various tissues, including the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cardiovascular systems, and is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as glioblastoma and cardiovascular diseases (PereiraCastro2019Novel; Le2021Targeting). The receptor's interactions and signaling pathways underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in these diseases.

## Structure
The urotensin 2 receptor (UTS2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Maryanoff2010UrotensinII). The primary structure of UTS2R includes conserved motifs such as the ERY motif and NP(XX)Y motif, which are essential for receptor function and G protein coupling (Cui2021Characterization). The receptor also contains specific residues crucial for ligand binding, including an Asp residue (Cui2021Characterization).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, the receptor's seven transmembrane domains form a helical bundle typical of GPCRs, facilitating its interaction with ligands and G proteins. The receptor's structure is further stabilized by post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which are important for its proper folding and function (Cui2021Characterization).

Alternative splicing of the UTS2R gene can lead to different isoforms, potentially affecting its signaling pathways and functional roles in various tissues (Cui2021Characterization). These structural features and modifications underscore the receptor's role in mediating complex physiological responses.

## Function
The urotensin 2 receptor (UTS2R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily involved in cardiovascular and central nervous system functions. It is encoded by the UTS2R gene located on human chromosome 17q25.3 and is part of the rhodopsin family of receptors (PereiraCastro2019Novel). UTS2R is widely distributed in various human tissues, including the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, and cardiovascular systems, such as the atria, ventricles, and vascular smooth muscle cells (PereiraCastro2019Novel).

In terms of molecular processes, UTS2R is primarily coupled to the Gαq/11 protein, which activates the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. This activation leads to vasoconstriction through increased intracellular calcium levels, involving the Ca2+/calmodulin/myosin light chain system and potentially mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and the RhoA/ROCK pathway (PereiraCastro2019Novel). UTS2R also mediates vasodilation by promoting the synthesis and release of nitric oxide (NO) and other factors (PereiraCastro2019Novel).

The receptor's presence in the nuclear membrane suggests a potential intracrine mechanism, indicating that UTS2R may participate in new intracellular signaling cascades (PereiraCastro2019Novel). This complex signaling highlights the receptor's role in modulating vascular tone and influencing cardiovascular regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the UTS2R gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly glioblastoma (GBM) and cardiovascular conditions. In glioblastoma, high expression levels of UTS2R are associated with increased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and poor patient survival. The urotensinergic system, involving UTS2R, promotes hypoxia and necrosis in GBM, contributing to the aggressive nature of the tumor. Treatments targeting UTS2R, such as the antagonist urantide, have shown potential in inhibiting tumor growth and improving survival in preclinical models (Le2021Targeting).

In the cardiovascular system, UTS2R activation by remdesivir, a drug used for COVID-19 treatment, has been linked to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. This interaction can lead to reduced contractility and electrical abnormalities, contributing to cardiac side effects like arrhythmias and hypotension. Genetic variations in UTS2R, such as certain single-nucleotide variants, can alter the receptor's response to remdesivir, potentially increasing susceptibility to cardiotoxicity (Ogawa2023Activation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of UTS2R in both cancer and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that targeting this receptor could offer therapeutic benefits.

## Interactions
The urotensin 2 receptor (UTS2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways. UTS2R is activated by the peptide urotensin II, leading to interactions with G proteins, specifically the Gαi/o and Gαq proteins, which are involved in signal transduction pathways. Activation of UTS2R by agonists such as remdesivir can lead to cardiomyocyte dysfunction through the Gαi/o-dependent AKT/ERK signaling axis (Ogawa2023Activation).

Remdesivir acts as a selective, partial agonist of UTS2R, activating the receptor without involving β-arrestin recruitment, which is typically associated with receptor desensitization and internalization (Ogawa2023Activation). This interaction results in prolonged receptor activation, potentially leading to cardiotoxic effects (Ogawa2023Activation). The study by Ogawa et al. also highlights that specific mutations in UTS2R can alter its response to remdesivir, indicating that genetic variations can influence receptor sensitivity and the resulting physiological effects (Ogawa2023Activation).

In addition to its role in cardiovascular regulation, UTS2R is implicated in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, with increased expression observed in diabetic tissues. This suggests that UTS2R may interact with other proteins involved in metabolic pathways (Jiang2008Comparative).
