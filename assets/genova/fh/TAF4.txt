# TAF4

## Overview
TAF4 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 4, a crucial component of the TFIID complex involved in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The TAF4 protein is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the assembly and stability of the transcription machinery at core promoter regions. It contains several conserved domains, including a TAF homology (TAFH) domain, which is essential for its interactions with other proteins and its function in transcription regulation (Chen2013A; Kazantseva2013Alternative). TAF4 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, and its activity is critical for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (Chen2013A; Kazantseva2013Alternative). Alterations in TAF4 expression have been linked to several diseases, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies (SäisäBorreill2023General; Kazantseva2016Targeted).

## Structure
TAF4 is a component of the TFIID complex, essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The protein includes several conserved domains, such as an N-terminal glutamine-rich domain, a central TAF homology (TAFH) domain, and a C-terminal histone-like domain (Kazantseva2013Alternative). The TAFH domain is characterized by a five-helix structure unique to vertebrates, which facilitates specific protein-protein interactions (Kazantseva2013Alternative). This domain is involved in interactions with various proteins, including N-CoR, E-proteins, and others, and plays a role in WNT signaling (Kazantseva2013Alternative).

TAF4 forms heterodimers with TAF12, contributing to the structural stability of the TFIID complex (Kolesnikova2018Molecular). The TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer is part of a hexameric arrangement similar to a nucleosome hexasome, emphasizing the role of the WD40 repeat of TAF5 in stabilizing these heterodimers (Kolesnikova2018Molecular). Alternative splicing of the TAF4 gene results in multiple isoforms, with variations in the TAFH domain affecting its interaction capabilities and potentially influencing transcriptional responses during development (Kazantseva2013Alternative).

TAF4's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in transcription regulation, with its domains facilitating various protein interactions and contributing to the assembly and stability of the TFIID complex.

## Function
TAF4 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 4) is a critical component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF4 plays a significant role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the TFIID complex, facilitating the assembly of the transcription machinery at the core promoter regions of genes (Chen2013A). It interacts with various transcription factors, such as Sp1 and CREB, and contains a TAF homology (TAFH) domain that is crucial for its function (Chen2013A).

TAF4 is involved in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation. In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), TAF4 influences the balance between different differentiation pathways, such as chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and adipogenesis, by interacting with TP53 and WNT signaling pathways (Kazantseva2013Alternative). The alternative splicing of TAF4, particularly in the hTAF4-TAFH domain, affects the proliferation and differentiation of hMSCs, suggesting a role in switching cellular transcriptional programs from maintaining stem cell states to differentiation (Kazantseva2013Alternative).

TAF4 is also necessary for the differentiation of various cell types, including human neural progenitors and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and plays a role in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (Kazantseva2016Targeted). Its activity is crucial for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as p21, by enhancing the recruitment and binding of TFIID to promoters (Chen2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TAF4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, TAF4 plays a significant role in cellular differentiation and tumor progression. Its inactivation in mouse epidermis has been linked to hyperplasia and the development of aggressive melanomas, while in keratinocytes, it leads to the ectopic expression of melanocyte-specific genes and invasive melanomas (Kazantseva2016Targeted). In the liver, TAF4 is crucial for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation and metabolism. Its inactivation results in severe hypoglycemia, jaundice, and early post-natal death due to disrupted liver function and organization, indicating its essential role in liver metabolic processes (Alpern2014TAF4).

In the intestinal epithelium, TAF4 is vital for maintaining stem cell functions and the immune microenvironment. Loss of TAF4 leads to increased activity of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which suppresses stem cell identity and promotes tumorigenesis, particularly in Apc-driven tumors. This alteration affects the immune response, reducing cytotoxic T lymphocyte recruitment and enhancing tumor growth (SäisäBorreill2023General). These findings suggest that TAF4 is a potential target for therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.

## Interactions
TAF4, a component of the TFIID complex, plays a crucial role in transcription regulation through its interactions with various proteins and domains. It interacts with E-proteins, such as HEB, via the dTAFH domain, which is essential for the recruitment and stabilization of TFIID at gene promoters. This interaction enhances the binding of TFIID to promoters like the p21 promoter, facilitating transcription initiation (Chen2013A). The dTAFH domain of TAF4 specifically interacts with the AD3 domain of E-proteins, while the eTAFH domain interacts with the AD1 domain, indicating distinct roles in transcription regulation (Chen2013A).

TAF4 also modulates interactions between ATF7 and TAF12, inhibiting TAF12-mediated transactivation by ATF7, which suggests a regulatory role in transcriptional activation (Hamard2005A). Additionally, TAF4 interacts with the transcription factor Sp1, which contains glutamine-rich domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for transcriptional activation (Hibino2020A).

In the cytoplasm, TAF4 is part of a 7TAF complex, interacting with TAF8, TAF6, TAF9/9B, TAF10, and TAF5, contributing to the assembly and function of the TFIID complex (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). These interactions highlight TAF4's multifaceted role in gene expression regulation.
