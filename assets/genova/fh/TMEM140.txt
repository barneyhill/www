# TMEM140

## Overview
TMEM140 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 140, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is predominantly located in the cell membrane and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane transport, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2015TMEM140). While the specific molecular functions of transmembrane protein 140 remain under investigation, its membrane localization suggests a role in mediating interactions between the cell and its external environment, thereby influencing cellular responses to external stimuli (Li2015TMEM140). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to certain pathological conditions, such as gliomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, highlighting its potential significance in cancer biology and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Indio2018Integrated; Marx2020Transmembrane).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM140, or transmembrane protein 140, is a protein encoded by the TMEM140 gene in humans. It is primarily located in the cell membrane, where it is believed to play a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and function. TMEM140 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and membrane transport, which are crucial for normal cellular homeostasis. Although the precise molecular activities of TMEM140 are still under investigation, its presence in the cell membrane suggests it may contribute to the regulation of interactions between the cell and its environment. This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance of cellular activities and ensuring proper cellular responses to external stimuli. The organismal outcomes of TMEM140's functions are not yet fully understood, but its involvement in these fundamental processes indicates its importance in maintaining the health and stability of human cells.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM140 is significantly overexpressed in gliomas, a common type of primary brain tumor in adults, compared to normal brain tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size, higher histologic grade, and shorter overall survival time, indicating its role in glioma progression and poor prognosis (Marx2020Transmembrane; Li2015TMEM140). Silencing TMEM140 in glioma cell lines results in reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion, potentially due to G1 phase cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis (Li2015TMEM140). These findings suggest that TMEM140 promotes glioma cell viability and invasive capabilities, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2015TMEM140).

In addition to its role in gliomas, TMEM140 mutations have been identified in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) with the rare D842V mutation in the PDGFRA gene. However, these mutations were found in only one patient, limiting the ability to draw broad conclusions about their clinical significance in GIST (Indio2018Integrated). Overall, TMEM140's expression and mutation status are important factors in the prognosis and potential treatment strategies for certain cancers.
