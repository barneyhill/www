# ANKDD1A

## Overview
ANKDD1A is a human gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and death domain containing 1A, which is involved in various cellular processes through its structural motifs. The protein is characterized by ankyrin repeats and a death domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. The ankyrin repeats typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, enabling interactions with other cellular components, while the death domain is often associated with apoptotic signaling, suggesting a potential role in programmed cell death. ANKDD1A interacts with Factor Inhibiting HIF1 (FIH1), influencing the stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), a key transcription factor in the cellular response to low oxygen conditions. This interaction highlights the protein's involvement in hypoxia-related pathways and its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

## Structure
ANKDD1A is a human gene encoding a protein that features ankyrin repeats and a death domain. Ankyrin repeats are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, typically forming a helix-loop-helix structure. These repeats are crucial for the protein's ability to interact with other cellular components, potentially influencing various signaling pathways. The death domain present in ANKDD1A is a well-known protein interaction module that is often associated with apoptotic signaling, suggesting a role in programmed cell death processes.

The molecular structure of ANKDD1A is characterized by these domains, which contribute to its functional properties. The ankyrin repeats and death domain are integral to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, providing stability and specificity in its interactions. While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ANKDD1A are not provided, these aspects could further influence the protein's function and regulation. Understanding the structural components of ANKDD1A, such as the ankyrin repeats and death domain, is essential for elucidating its role in cellular processes and potential implications in human health.

## Function
ANKDD1A (ankyrin repeat and death domain containing 1A) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its ankyrin repeats and death domain. These structural motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the protein's function in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, ANKDD1A interacts with Factor Inhibiting HIF1 (FIH1), a hydroxylase that regulates the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), a key transcription factor involved in the cellular response to low oxygen conditions. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and is mediated by the ankyrin domain of ANKDD1A and the N-terminal domain of FIH1 (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

ANKDD1A's interaction with FIH1 influences the stability and activity of HIF1α, thereby modulating hypoxia-related pathways. This regulation affects processes such as glucose uptake, lactate production, and autophagy, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Feng2018Hypermethylated). The protein's role in these pathways suggests its involvement in cellular stress responses and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, highlighting its importance in normal physiological functions (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

## Clinical Significance
The ANKDD1A gene is clinically significant in the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a type of brain cancer. ANKDD1A is frequently hypermethylated in GBM, leading to its decreased expression, which contributes to the silencing of its tumor suppressor functions and facilitates cancer progression (Feng2018Hypermethylated). The gene's interaction with FIH1 is crucial, as it decreases the stability of HIF1α, a major regulator of the hypoxic response in tumor cells. This interaction results in reduced glucose uptake, decreased lactate production, inhibited autophagy, and induced apoptosis in GBM cells, ultimately improving survival in glioma patients (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

ANKDD1A's role as a tumor suppressor is particularly significant under hypoxic conditions, which are common in solid tumors like glioma. Its re-expression in GBM cells decreases tumor cell invasion and inhibits DNA replication, with a stronger effect under hypoxia (Feng2018Hypermethylated). The hypermethylation of the ANKDD1A promoter region can be reversed with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, restoring its expression and suggesting its potential as an epigenetic biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma (Feng2018Hypermethylated). These findings highlight the importance of ANKDD1A in the regulation of HIF1α, which is overexpressed in various human malignancies and associated with poor patient survival (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

## Interactions
The ANKDD1A protein interacts with the FIH1 protein, a key regulator of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) pathway. This interaction was initially identified using BioGRID software and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, where endogenous FIH1 was co-immunoprecipitated with ANKDD1A (Feng2018Hypermethylated). Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ANKDD1A and FIH1 co-localize in the cytoplasm of these cells (Feng2018Hypermethylated). The interaction occurs through the ankyrin repeat domain of ANKDD1A and the N-terminal domain of FIH1, as shown by GST pull-down assays (Feng2018Hypermethylated).

ANKDD1A's interaction with FIH1 plays a significant role in regulating the stability and activity of HIF1α. ANKDD1A suppresses the expression of hypoxic response genes by inhibiting HIF1α transcriptional activity. This is achieved by promoting the hydroxylation of the Asn803 residue of HIF1α by FIH1, which blocks its interaction with the p300/CBP co-activator (Feng2018Hypermethylated). ANKDD1A also enhances the ubiquitinated degradation of HIF1α by upregulating FIH1 and PHD2, leading to decreased stability of HIF1α under hypoxic conditions (Feng2018Hypermethylated). These interactions suggest that ANKDD1A modulates HIF1α stability and activity, impacting cellular responses to hypoxia (Feng2018Hypermethylated).
