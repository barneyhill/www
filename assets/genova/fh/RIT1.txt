# RIT1

## Overview
RIT1 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras-like without CAAX 1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. This protein is characterized by its role as a molecular switch, cycling between active and inactive states to regulate various cellular processes. Unlike other Ras proteins, Ras-like without CAAX 1 lacks the CAAX motif, which typically facilitates membrane localization through prenylation. Instead, it localizes to the plasma membrane via its C-terminal peptide, which interacts with lipid bilayers. Functionally, Ras-like without CAAX 1 is involved in critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in the RIT1 gene have been linked to Noonan syndrome and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Castel2019RIT1; Cavé2016Mutations; Kouz2016Genotype).

## Structure
RIT1 is a small GTPase protein that is part of the Ras superfamily, characterized by a GTP-binding domain. It shares structural similarities with other Ras proteins but notably lacks the CAAX motif, which is typically involved in membrane localization through prenylation (Castel2019RIT1). Instead, RIT1 localizes to the plasma membrane via its C-terminal peptide (CTP), which interacts with lipid bilayers based on charge complementarity and hydrophobic interactions (Migliori2021The).

The primary structure of RIT1 includes conserved motifs typical of GTPases, and its secondary and tertiary structures involve a compact fold with beta sheets and alpha helices. The protein features a βαβ fold, also known as the Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its function in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway (Paladino2021Structural). The CTP of RIT1 is largely unstructured in aqueous environments but adopts a specific orientation when interacting with lipid membranes, particularly those containing phosphatidylserine (POPS) lipids (Migliori2021The).

RIT1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine 209, which may regulate its interaction with membranes (Migliori2021The). The protein's interaction with the LZTR1 E3 ligase is mediated through specific electrostatic interactions, with mutations in RIT1 affecting its binding and function (Paladino2021Structural).

## Function
RIT1 is a member of the Ras family of small GTPases, functioning as a molecular switch by alternating between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. It is involved in several key cellular processes, including neuronal morphogenesis, neural differentiation, and cell survival (Meyer2018RIT1). RIT1 plays a significant role in actin dynamics by forming complexes with RAC1, CDC42, and PAK1, which are crucial for regulating the actin cytoskeleton. This regulation affects cell shape, motility, and adhesion, as RIT1 induces the dissolution of actin stress fibers and influences the stability of focal adhesions (Meyer2018RIT1).

In the context of neurogenesis, RIT1 is essential for IGF-1-mediated signaling pathways that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. It is involved in a signaling cascade with Akt and SOX2, which is crucial for neuronal induction and differentiation. RIT1 deficiency results in reduced Akt activation and SOX2 phosphorylation, impairing neurogenesis (Mir2017IGF1). RIT1 also modulates the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways, influencing cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (Meyer2018RIT1). These functions highlight RIT1's role in maintaining cellular processes and organismal outcomes related to cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RIT1 gene are associated with Noonan syndrome (NS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, congenital heart defects, and developmental delays. RIT1 mutations account for approximately 5% of molecularly confirmed NS cases and are considered one of the major genetic contributors to the syndrome (Kouz2016Genotype; Cavé2016Mutations). These mutations often result in gain-of-function effects, leading to enhanced activation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Kouz2016Genotype; Zha2022Noonan).

Clinically, RIT1 mutations are linked to a high incidence of cardiovascular abnormalities, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS). The prevalence of HCM in RIT1-related NS is notably high, with reports indicating a prevalence of 52% to 58.53% (Kouz2016Genotype; Zha2022Noonan). Prenatal abnormalities such as polyhydramnios and fetal nuchal edema are also common in individuals with RIT1 mutations (Yaoita2015Spectrum; Kouz2016Genotype).

RIT1 mutations have also been implicated in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and other malignancies, although their role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) appears to be minimal (Cavé2016Mutations). The oncogenic potential of RIT1 mutations is supported by their presence in various adult cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (Cavé2016Mutations).

## Interactions
RIT1, a small GTPase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the RHO GTPases CDC42 and RAC1, as well as PAK1, a known effector of these GTPases. This interaction is independent of the guanine nucleotide state of CDC42 and RAC1, suggesting a stable binding mechanism. Both wild-type and mutant forms of RIT1 can bind to CDC42 and RAC1, indicating a role in a multiprotein signaling module that regulates actin dynamics and cell migration (Meyer2018RIT1).

RIT1 also interacts with the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins MAD2 and p31 comet, with this interaction being regulated by CDK1 phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for spindle assembly checkpoint regulation, as RIT1 inhibits the checkpoint, promoting chromosome segregation errors (CuevasNavarro2020The).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, RIT1-mutant cells show a dependency on RTK complex proteins such as GRB2 and IGF1R, suggesting a role in RTK activation or feedback signaling. These cells are also sensitive to perturbations in mitotic regulators, particularly those involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (Vichas2021Integrative).

RIT1 interacts with LZTR1, a substrate-specific adaptor for the cullin 3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction is dependent on the GTP binding status of RIT1, with GDP-bound RIT1 interacting with LZTR1, while GTP-bound RIT1 does not. LZTR1 mutations can impair RIT1 degradation, leading to increased protein abundance (Castel2019RIT1).
