# EFCAB3

## Overview
EFCAB3 is a gene that encodes the EF-hand calcium binding domain 3 protein, which is characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs. These motifs are helix-loop-helix structural domains that facilitate calcium ion binding, playing a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell cycle regulation. EFCAB3 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the testis and thyroid, although its role in male fertility appears to be non-essential in mice (Miyata2016Genome). The protein's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it influences cellular responses to calcium fluctuations. Mutations in the EFCAB3 gene have been linked to fertility issues in livestock and potential roles in cancer and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Ung2017Whole; Raphael2008A; Galliou2020Identification).

## Structure
EFCAB3 encodes a protein characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structural domains that facilitate calcium ion binding. These motifs are integral to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, allowing it to effectively coordinate calcium ions. The EF-hand motifs contribute to the protein's ability to undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding, which is crucial for its function in cellular processes.

The protein's structure may be further influenced by post-translational modifications, which can affect its function and localization within the cell. These modifications can include phosphorylation, acetylation, or ubiquitination, although specific modifications for EFCAB3 are not detailed in the provided context. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of EFCAB3 may exist, potentially leading to variations in the protein's structure and function. These isoforms can result from alternative splicing events, which may alter the presence or arrangement of EF-hand motifs or other structural domains, thereby impacting the protein's calcium-binding capabilities and its role in cellular signaling pathways. The precise details of these isoforms and their structural implications are not specified in the context provided.

## Function
EFCAB3 (EF-hand calcium binding domain 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The protein contains EF-hand motifs, structural domains that bind calcium ions, facilitating its role in cellular activities such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell cycle regulation. In the context of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in HepG2 cells, a human liver cancer cell line, EFCAB3 is associated with procollagen-proline 4-dioxygenase activity and oxidoreductase activity. These activities suggest its involvement in collagen biosynthesis and redox reactions, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Wijaya2023A).

EFCAB3 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the testis and thyroid, although its expression in the testis is relatively low compared to related genes (Lilue2018Sixteen). Despite its expression in testis-enriched manner, studies suggest that EFCAB3 does not play a critical role in spermatogenesis or fertilization in mice, indicating it may not be essential for male fertility (Miyata2016Genome). The protein's activity within the cell is primarily cytoplasmic, where it may influence cellular responses to calcium fluctuations, impacting overall cellular function and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EFCAB3 gene have been implicated in various health conditions. In U.S. Holsteins, mutations in EFCAB3 are associated with fertility issues, particularly affecting calcium signaling in the myometrium. This dysregulation can lead to increased uterine contractility during early pregnancy, often resulting in pregnancy loss (Galliou2020Identification).

In cancer research, EFCAB3 has been identified in genomic rearrangements. A study on tumor genomes found a deletion involving EFCAB3 on chromosome 17, suggesting its potential role in cancer development through structural genomic changes (Raphael2008A). Additionally, a S6K1-EFCAB3 fusion has been reported, although its specific function in cancer remains to be determined (Yu2022Attacking).

EFCAB3 has also been identified as a candidate gene in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) among African American patients, though specific details on its role in the disease are not provided (Ung2017Whole). Despite its testis-enriched expression in mice, EFCAB3 was found not to be essential for male fertility, indicating that its role may vary across species and conditions (Miyata2016Genome).
