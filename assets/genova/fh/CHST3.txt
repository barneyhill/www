# CHST3

## Overview
The CHST3 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3, a critical sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through the 6-sulfation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated; Unger2010Phenotypic). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in cartilage and neural tissues (BaidoeAnsah2019Epigenetic). The protein is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the maturation of GAG side chains, influencing skeletal development, joint function, and brain plasticity (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated). Mutations in CHST3 are associated with several congenital disorders, including spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and Larsen syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal and joint health (Mizumoto2021Congenital; Hermanns2008Congenital).

## Function
The CHST3 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3, which is responsible for the 6-sulfation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated; Unger2010Phenotypic). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6th position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in chondroitin, a critical process in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated). The sulfation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains is essential for the proper function and structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly in cartilage and neural tissues (BaidoeAnsah2019Epigenetic).

In healthy human cells, CHST3 activity is crucial for the formation and maintenance of cartilage, as it influences the structural integrity and function of proteoglycans like aggrecan, which are major components of cartilage (Unger2010Phenotypic). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the maturation of GAG side chains on core proteins of CSPGs (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated). This process is vital for skeletal development and joint function, as well as for maintaining brain plasticity and cognitive functions by regulating the ECM composition (BaidoeAnsah2022AgingAssociated; BaidoeAnsah2019Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST3 gene, which encodes chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (C6ST1), are linked to several congenital disorders. These include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia with congenital joint dislocations, characterized by short stature, severe kyphoscoliosis, mild brachydactyly, arthritic joints, joint dislocation, rhizomelia, fusion of the carpal bones, and cardiac defects such as ventricular septal, mitral, and tricuspid defects (Mizumoto2021Congenital). Both homozygous and heterozygous mutations in CHST3 can cause Larsen syndrome and humero-spinal dysostosis, which are marked by joint and knee dislocations, bilateral clubfeet, and spinal dysplasias (Mizumoto2021Congenital; Hermanns2008Congenital).

CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is another condition associated with mutations in this gene, presenting with prenatal short stature, joint dislocation, movement restriction of large joints, and skeletal deformities such as kyphosis and scoliosis (Liang2023A). The gene's mutations lead to decreased 6-O-sulfation and increased 4-O-sulfation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, confirming functional impairment of CHST3 (Hermanns2008Congenital). The genetic data indicate a recessive inheritance pattern for these conditions, often linked to consanguinity in affected families (Hermanns2008Congenital).

## Interactions
CHST3, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration. It has been shown to interact with CSPG4, a glycoprotein, in tissues affected by this condition. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis, which confirmed the physical association between CHST3 and CSPG4 (Guan2021Carbohydrate). The interaction between these proteins is significant as both are differentially expressed in various grades of intervertebral disc degeneration, with lower expression levels observed in more advanced stages (Guan2021Carbohydrate).

CHST3 also influences cellular processes such as cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of CHST3 in cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) leads to increased expression of proteins like VCAN, VASP, NCAN, and OFD1, which are involved in cellular structural integrity and signaling pathways (Guan2021Carbohydrate). These interactions suggest that CHST3 plays a role in the regulation of molecular mechanisms related to tissue repair and cellular dynamics in the context of intervertebral disc degeneration. However, specific details on the physical interactions of CHST3 with nucleic acids or other proteins outside this context are not provided in the available sources.
