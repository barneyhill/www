# DLX3

## Overview
The DLX3 gene encodes the distal-less homeobox 3 protein, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of developmental processes, particularly in bone and craniofacial development. As a member of the homeobox gene family, DLX3 is characterized by a conserved helix-turn-helix motif that facilitates its DNA-binding capability, allowing it to regulate the expression of genes critical for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation (Liu2022Novel; Feledy1999Transcriptional). The protein interacts with various signaling pathways, including WNT, TGFb/BMP, and NOTCH, to modulate bone development and homeostasis (Isaac2014DLX3). Mutations in DLX3 are associated with genetic disorders such as tricho-dento-osseous syndrome and amelogenesis imperfecta, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Liu2022Novel; Lee2008DLX3). Additionally, DLX3's involvement in gene regulation extends to interactions with other transcription factors, influencing diverse biological processes (Li2017DLX3; Ezashi2008The).

## Structure
The DLX3 protein is a homeodomain transcription factor characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif, which is crucial for its DNA-binding function (Liu2022Novel). The homeodomain is a conserved 60 amino acid element responsible for DNA binding, and it is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in development (Liu2022Novel; Feledy1999Transcriptional). The DLX3 protein contains two transactivation domains, one located at the N-terminal (residues 43-93) and another at the C-terminal (residues 200-261), which are critical for its function as a transcriptional activator (Feledy1999Transcriptional).

The primary structure of DLX3 includes specific residues such as R133, Q178, and N179, which are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with DNA bases, playing key roles in DNA recognition (Jin2022Salt). Mutations in these residues, such as Q178R and R133P, are associated with tricho-dento-osseous syndrome, highlighting their importance in the protein's function (Liu2022Novel; Jin2022Salt).

The DLX3 protein can form heteromeric complexes with other proteins, such as Msx1, which influences its ability to activate transcription (Feledy1999Transcriptional). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DLX3 gene encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in bone development and homeostasis. In healthy human cells, DLX3 regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation by controlling the expression of key transcription factors such as Runx2, Sp7, Dlx5, and Dlx6, which are essential for osteoblast differentiation and ossification (Isaac2014DLX3; Hassan2004Dlx3). DLX3 is involved in both intramembranous and endochondral bone formation, influencing the expression of genes related to bone mass and mineral homeostasis (Isaac2014DLX3).

DLX3 functions as an attenuator of osteoblastogenesis, as its deletion leads to increased differentiation and mineralization capacity in osteoblasts (Isaac2014DLX3). It modulates the binding of bone-activator transcription factors on regulatory elements of the osteocalcin promoter, affecting the expression of osteoblast-related markers (Isaac2014DLX3). DLX3 also interacts with the WNT, TGFb/BMP, and NOTCH signaling pathways, which are critical for bone development (Isaac2014DLX3).

In addition to its role in bone, DLX3 is expressed in osteogenic lineage cells at sites of new bone formation and is involved in craniofacial development (Hassan2004Dlx3). It is expressed in perichondrium, mature chondrocytes, periosteal cells, and endosteal osteoblasts, but not in the condensing mesenchyme or growth plate zones (Hassan2004Dlx3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DLX3 gene are associated with tricho-dento-osseous syndrome (TDO), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities in hair, teeth, and bone development. Common clinical features of TDO include kinky hair at birth, enamel hypoplasia, taurodontism, and increased bone density (Liu2022Novel; Zhao2016Senescence:). A specific 4-bp deletion in DLX3 has been linked to enhanced trabecular bone volume and mineral density, suggesting a role in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption (Levi2022DLX; Tan2021DLX).

The DLX3 gene is also implicated in amelogenesis imperfecta with taurodontism (AIHHT), where mutations such as c.561_562delCT result in enamel defects and enlarged pulp chambers (Lee2008DLX3). Variability in phenotypic expression is observed among individuals with DLX3 mutations, with enamel defects and taurodontism being common, while hair, nail, and bone features vary (Liu2022Novel).

Alterations in DLX3 expression are linked to certain leukemias. In pediatric B-ALL patients with MLL-AF4 rearrangement, DLX3 shows aberrant CpG methylation, leading to reduced expression and potentially contributing to poor prognosis (Campo2007Downregulation; Tan2021DLX). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DLX3 in various genetic and epigenetic contexts.

## Interactions
DLX3 is known to participate in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. In the context of bovine interferon-tau (IFNT) gene expression, DLX3 interacts with the transcription factor ETS2. This interaction is crucial for the synergistic activation of the IFNT promoter, as both DLX3 and ETS2 binding sites are necessary for effective transactivation. The co-expression of DLX3 and ETS2 significantly enhances IFNT reporter activity, indicating a cooperative interaction between these proteins (Ezashi2008The).

In human trophoblast-derived cells, DLX3 interacts with GCM1, inhibiting its transactivation-stimulating activity. This interaction is mediated by the homeodomain of DLX3, which is essential for the physical interaction. The presence of either the amino or carboxyl domains of DLX3 is necessary to facilitate or stabilize this interaction, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Li2017DLX3).

DLX3 also interacts with Runx2 in the context of osteoblast differentiation. This interaction involves the recruitment of DLX3 to the osteocalcin (OC) gene promoter, where it can modulate gene expression through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The interaction with Runx2 is crucial for the regulation of OC gene expression during osteoblast differentiation (Hassan2004Dlx3).
