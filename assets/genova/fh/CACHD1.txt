# CACHD1

## Overview
CACHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein cache domain containing 1, a type I transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including two dCache domains and a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, which contribute to its function as an auxiliary subunit modulating voltage-gated calcium channels, particularly T-type CaV3 channels (Cottrell2018CACHD1). This modulation enhances neuronal excitability and action potential firing frequency, especially in the central nervous system (Stephens2019CACHD1:). Additionally, cache domain containing 1 interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, forming complexes with Frizzled and LRP6 receptors, which suggests a regulatory role in cellular signaling and development (Powell2024Cachd1). The protein's involvement in both calcium channel activity and Wnt signaling highlights its significance in physiological and pathological contexts, including its potential implications in cancer and neurological disorders (Kakehashi2021Cache; Rudan2019Mouse).

## Structure
CACHD1 is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct domains, including two dCache domains and a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain. The protein also features a short hydrophobic transmembrane domain and an intracellular C-terminus (Cottrell2018CACHD1). The extracellular domain (ECD) of CACHD1 forms a ternary complex with Frizzled (FZD) and LRP6, indicating its role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This ECD includes a novel Frizzled interaction (FZI) domain, which interfaces with FZD5 CRD, and the N-terminal dCache domain interacts with the LRP6 P3 propeller (Powell2024Cachd1; Powell2022Cachd1).

Structurally, CACHD1 shows similarity to the α2δ1 auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, although it lacks certain features such as a proteolytic cleavage motif and multiple N-glycosylation sites found in α2δ proteins (Cottrell2018CACHD1). The protein's structure has been crystallized, revealing its ability to form complexes that may compete with Wnt ligands for binding to FZD and LRP6, suggesting a regulatory role in Wnt signaling (Powell2024Cachd1). CACHD1 is also identified as a substrate for the Alzheimer's protease BACE1, with cleavage occurring in the juxtamembrane domain (Rudan2019Mouse).

## Function
The CACHD1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit modulating the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, specifically T-type CaV3 channels. This modulation is crucial for increasing the cell-surface localization and peak current density of CaV3.1 channels, which enhances maximal conductance and channel open probability. As a result, CACHD1 increases action potential firing frequency and neuronal excitability, particularly in hippocampal neurons (Stephens2019CACHD1:; Cottrell2018CACHD1). 

CACHD1 is structurally similar to the α2δ family of proteins, containing a von Willebrand Factor A (VWA) domain and cache domains, but it is distinct in having a single transmembrane domain and a large intracellular C-terminal tail (Stephens2019CACHD1:). It is highly expressed in the central nervous system, especially in the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum, where it plays a significant role in modulating T-type calcium currents, which are important for regulating excitability around the resting membrane potential (Cottrell2018CACHD1).

CACHD1 also interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as Frizzled and LRP6 receptors, influencing cellular processes regulated by this pathway (Powell2024Cachd1). This interaction suggests a broader role for CACHD1 in cellular signaling and development.

## Clinical Significance
The CACHD1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In the context of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, CACHD1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) in STAM mice, suggesting its role in early liver cancer development. Knockdown of CACHD1 in liver cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell growth and proliferation, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Kakehashi2021Cache).

Mutations in the CACHD1 gene have been detected in various human cancers, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma. Its expression is also upregulated in soft tissue sarcomas, particularly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (Kakehashi2021Cache).

CACHD1 is a substrate of the Alzheimer's protease BACE1, and its interaction with BACE1 is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology. The gene undergoes sequential cleavage by BACE1 and γ-secretase, similar to the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is a key event in Alzheimer's disease (Rudan2019Mouse). CACHD1's involvement in Wnt signaling and neuronal development further suggests its potential role in neurological disorders (Powell2024Cachd1).

## Interactions
CACHD1 interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, specifically binding to Frizzled (FZD) family receptors and the LRP6 co-receptor. It binds to the extracellular domain of FZD7, a Frizzled family receptor, and this interaction is inhibited by the monoclonal antibody OMP-18R5, indicating that the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD7 is the binding site for CACHD1 (Powell2024Cachd1; Powell2022Cachd1). CACHD1 also forms a ternary complex with FZD5 and LRP6, serving as a cross-linking component. The binding site on FZD5 CRD overlaps with the 'thumb' and palmitoleic acid (PAM) lipid binding site, which is crucial for receptor-ligand interaction with Wnt (Powell2024Cachd1).

CACHD1 is also involved in modulating voltage-gated calcium channel activity, particularly with CaV3 (T-type) channels. It increases the cell-surface localization and open probability of CaV3.1 channels, forming complexes at the plasma membrane. This interaction enhances the peak current density and maximal conductance of CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 subunits, unlike the α2δ1 subunit, which does not affect T-type current (Stephens2019CACHD1:; Cottrell2018CACHD1). These interactions suggest that CACHD1 plays a significant role in modulating both Wnt signaling and calcium channel activity.
