# UBE2H

## Overview
UBE2H is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 H, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The UBE2H protein is characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) core domain, facilitating its role in the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins in collaboration with E3 ligases. This enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including protein turnover, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. UBE2H has been implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Martin2009Association; Yen2021Ubiquitin; Shin2023A).

## Structure
The UBE2H protein, encoded by the UBE2H gene, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The primary structure of UBE2H consists of a polypeptide chain of 183 amino acids (Martin2009Association). The protein includes a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) core domain, which is crucial for its function in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Guo2021Molecular). This domain is responsible for forming a thiol-ester linkage with a conserved cysteine and the C-terminus of ubiquitin, facilitating interactions with ubiquitin protein ligase enzymes (E3) (Guo2021Molecular).

The secondary structure of UBE2H is composed of approximately 43.72% alpha helices, 16.99% extended strands, 32.24% random coils, and 7.10% beta turns (Guo2021Molecular). Tertiary structure predictions have been made using homology modeling techniques, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided (Guo2021Molecular). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Shin2023A). The UBE2H protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein degradation and stress responses, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Martin2009Association; Shin2023A).

## Function
UBE2H encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 H, which is involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. This enzyme participates in tagging proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular health (Martin2009Association). UBE2H is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA repair (Hosseini2019E2).

In healthy human cells, UBE2H is involved in the ubiquitination of histones and cytoskeletal proteins, suggesting roles in chromatin remodeling and maintaining neuronal structure and function (Martin2009Association). The enzyme's activity on histones indicates a potential role in gene expression regulation, while its action on cytoskeletal proteins may be linked to structural integrity within cells (Martin2009Association).

UBE2H is also regulated by TNF-a, a cytokine that is up-regulated in certain conditions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although no direct association between UBE2H polymorphisms and sporadic ALS has been found (Martin2009Association). Despite its involvement in these processes, UBE2H displays low levels of activity in certain ubiquitylation contexts, suggesting a limited role in specific pathways (Sheng2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UBE2H gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), UBE2H mRNA levels are significantly increased in the blood of patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for AD diagnosis. The gene's expression is specifically elevated in AD models and patients, indicating a possible role in disease progression (Lim2020Predictive).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), UBE2H is associated with poor outcomes and metastasis. High expression levels of UBE2H are linked to poor survival outcomes, and its knockdown has been shown to reduce metastatic capacity in LUAD cell lines. This suggests that UBE2H may serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in LUAD (Yen2021Ubiquitin).

UBE2H mutations have also been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. A de novo missense variant of UBE2H was identified in a patient with developmental delay, leading to abnormal brain development in zebrafish models. This mutation disrupts normal neurogenesis, implicating UBE2H in developmental brain defects through mechanisms involving p53-dependent apoptosis (Shin2023A).

## Interactions
UBE2H, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation. UBE2H interacts with E3 ligases to transfer ubiquitin to target proteins, facilitating their degradation. This interaction is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular functions (Lim2020Predictive).

In the context of brain development, UBE2H has been shown to interact with the p53 signaling pathway. In zebrafish models, the knockdown of ube2h led to increased expression of p53 and apoptosis, which could be reversed by co-injecting normal ube2h mRNA. This suggests that UBE2H interacts with ATM-p53 signaling pathways to regulate brain development and prevent apoptosis (Shin2023A). The interaction between UBE2H and p53 is also observed under thermal stress conditions in turbot, where UBE2H and p53 exhibit synergistic effects, indicating a crosstalk between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and p53 signaling (Guo2021Molecular).

UBE2H is also associated with hypoxia-related pathways in lung adenocarcinoma, although its specific role in these pathways is not fully understood (Yen2021Ubiquitin).
