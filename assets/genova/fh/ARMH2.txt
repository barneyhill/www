# ARMH2

## Overview
The ARMH2 gene encodes the protein armadillo-like helical domain containing 2, which is characterized by its armadillo repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ARMH2 may play a role in cellular signaling pathways or structural assembly within the cell. While the specific biological functions of ARMH2 remain to be fully elucidated, proteins with similar structural domains are often involved in diverse cellular processes, including signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. The ARMH2 protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its armadillo-like helical domain, which is a common feature in proteins that mediate interactions between cellular components (Qiu2020aarFDC).
