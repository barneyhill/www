# COL11A2

## Overview
The COL11A2 gene encodes the collagen type XI alpha 2 chain, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix involved in the formation and maintenance of cartilage and skeletal tissues. This gene is part of the collagen family, which is characterized by its triple-helical structure and is essential for the structural integrity of various connective tissues. The protein product of COL11A2, the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen, plays a significant role in the assembly of collagen fibrils, contributing to the proper development and function of cartilage and bone (Bridgewater1998Chondrocytespecific; Goto2006Sp1). Mutations in COL11A2 are linked to several hereditary disorders, including non-ocular Stickler syndrome and various forms of hearing loss, underscoring its importance in human health (Iwasa2015Nonocular; Chakchouk2015Novel). The gene's expression is regulated by complex interactions with transcription factors and co-regulators, reflecting its critical role in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis (Goto2006Sp1).

## Structure
The COL11A2 gene encodes the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen, which is a component of the heterotrimeric type XI collagen molecule. The primary structure of the α2(XI) collagen chain includes a long triple-helical domain, which is encoded by 48 exons and parts of two junction exons, beginning with a complete codon for glycine (Vuoristo1995The). This domain is characterized by Gly-X-Y repeats typical of collagen, contributing to its secondary structure. The tertiary structure involves the formation of a triple helix, which is a common feature of collagen molecules.

The quaternary structure of type XI collagen involves the assembly of the α2(XI) chain with other collagen chains, such as α1(XI) and α1(V), but not with the α3(XI)/α1(II) chain (Vuoristo1995The). The α2(XI) chain is synthesized as a precursor procollagen molecule with amino- and carboxy-terminal globular extensions (Lui1996The). The carboxyl-terminal propeptide of the α2(XI) chain is shorter than those of other fibrillar collagens due to internal deletions (Vuoristo1995The).

Post-translational modifications of the α2(XI) chain include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues and glycosylation. The gene undergoes complex alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variant isoforms (Lui1996The).

## Function
The COL11A2 gene encodes the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen, a minor but essential component of the collagen family involved in skeletal morphogenesis and cartilage development. Type XI collagen is a heterotrimer composed of three genetically distinct alpha chains, including the alpha 2 chain encoded by COL11A2, which plays a significant role in collagen fibril formation and the structural integrity of skeletal tissues (Goto2006Sp1). In cartilage, COL11A2 is coexpressed with type II collagen and is crucial for normal cartilage differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis. The gene contains chondrocyte-specific enhancer elements that are activated by the transcription factor SOX9, highlighting its importance in chondrogenesis (Bridgewater1998Chondrocytespecific).

In addition to its role in cartilage, COL11A2 is expressed in osteoblasts, where it is involved in bone formation and maintenance. The regulation of COL11A2 expression in osteoblasts involves the Sp1 family of transcription factors, which can act as activators or repressors of gene expression (Goto2006Sp1). Mutations in COL11A2 are linked to osteochondrodysplasias, underscoring its role in maintaining normal cartilage function (Bridgewater1998Chondrocytespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL11A2 gene are associated with several hereditary connective tissue disorders and hearing loss conditions. Non-ocular Stickler syndrome, also known as Stickler syndrome type III, is one such disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, craniofacial abnormalities, and joint disease, but notably lacks ocular involvement (SirkoOsadsa1998Stickler; Iwasa2015Nonocular). Mutations in COL11A2 can also lead to otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED) and Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome, both of which share overlapping features with Stickler syndrome (Iwasa2015Nonocular; Micale2020ExonTrapping).

In addition to syndromic conditions, COL11A2 mutations are implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss. Autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNA13) and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (DFNB53) have been linked to mutations in this gene (Iwasa2015Nonocular; Chakchouk2015Novel). These mutations can result in profound sensorineural hearing loss without other syndromic features (Chakchouk2015Novel).

Research using zebrafish models has shown that mutations in COL11A2 can lead to early-onset osteoarthritis due to changes in joint development and cartilage composition, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining skeletal integrity (Lawrence2018The).

## Interactions
The COL11A2 gene, encoding the alpha 2 chain of type XI collagen, is involved in several interactions crucial for cartilage structure and function. In the context of Ewing's sarcoma, the EWS/ERG fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, directly interacts with the COL11A2 promoter. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal region of EWS and the DNA-binding domain of ERG, allowing the fusion protein to transactivate the COL11A2 promoter, unlike the wild-type ERG (Matsui2003COL11A2). The EWS/ERG protein also forms complexes with RNA polymerase II, enhancing transcriptional activation (Matsui2003COL11A2).

In osteoblastic cells, the Sp1 family of transcription factors, including Sp1, Sp3, and Sp7/Osterix, bind to specific sites on the COL11A2 promoter, regulating its expression. These transcription factors interact with co-regulators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP), p300, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), influencing the transcriptional activity of COL11A2 (Goto2006Sp1). The presence of HDAC inhibitors can upregulate COL11A2 expression, indicating that HDACs act as transcriptional corepressors in this context (Goto2006Sp1). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing COL11A2 expression in different cellular environments.
