# TMEM217B

## Overview
TMEM217B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 217B, which is part of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 217B remain under investigation, but it is hypothesized to be involved in pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. Understanding the role of TMEM217B and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential implications in health and disease, particularly in pathways such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
