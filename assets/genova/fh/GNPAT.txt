# GNPAT

## Overview
The GNPAT gene encodes the enzyme glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase, a critical component in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, which are a specialized class of membrane phospholipids. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily located in the peroxisomes of human cells. Glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase catalyzes the initial step in plasmalogen synthesis by acylating dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a process essential for various cellular functions, including membrane structure and signal transduction (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The enzyme's activity is closely linked with alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS), forming a complex that enhances substrate channeling and reaction efficiency (Itzkovitz2011Functional). Mutations in the GNPAT gene are associated with disorders such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2, highlighting its clinical significance in skeletal and neurological development (Nimmo2010Rhizomelic). Additionally, specific variants of the GNPAT gene have been implicated in modifying the severity of iron overload conditions, further underscoring its role in human health (McLaren2015Exome).

## Function
The GNPAT gene encodes the enzyme glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, a specialized class of membrane phospholipids. In healthy human cells, GNPAT functions within the peroxisome, where it catalyzes the initial step in plasmalogen synthesis by acylating dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) at the sn-1 position. This process is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions, as plasmalogens play significant roles in membrane structure, signal transduction, vesicle formation, cell-cell junctions, inflammatory responses, and oxidant protection (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

GNPAT interacts with the enzyme AGPS on the luminal membrane side of the peroxisome, facilitating efficient substrate channeling and enhancing reaction efficiency. The presence of AGPS is necessary for full GNPAT activity, as evidenced by reduced GNPAT activity in cells lacking functional AGPS (Itzkovitz2011Functional). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the synthesis and maintenance of plasmalogens, which are important for various cellular functions, including the proper distribution of cholesterol and the formation of cellular structures such as caveolae and clathrin-coated pits (McLaren2015Exome). These structures are vital for processes like transferrin receptor recycling, which is important for iron homeostasis (McLaren2015Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNPAT gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2 (RCDP2). This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, growth retardation, and intellectual disability. RCDP2 results from defects in the GNPAT gene, which is crucial for ether lipid biosynthesis, leading to plasmalogen deficiency. This deficiency affects myelination and myelin maintenance in the central nervous system, contributing to the severe developmental anomalies observed in RCDP2 (Nimmo2010Rhizomelic; Malheiro2019Leukodystrophy).

The GNPAT p.D519G variant has been identified as a significant modifier of iron overload severity in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly in those homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation. This variant is associated with decreased hepcidin expression, a key regulator of iron homeostasis, potentially exacerbating iron overload conditions (McLaren2015Exome).

Additionally, the GNPAT D519G polymorphism is implicated in familial porphyria cutanea tarda (fPCT), an iron-dependent disease. This variant is significantly enriched in patients with fPCT, suggesting it acts as a genetic modifier of iron metabolism, similar to HFE gene variants (Farrell2016The).

## Interactions
GNPAT (glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase) is involved in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids and interacts with other proteins in the peroxisome. It forms a protein complex with alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS), another enzyme crucial for plasmalogen synthesis. This interaction occurs on the luminal side of the peroxisomal membrane and is essential for the full activity of GNPAT, as AGPS presence is required for effective substrate channeling from GNPAT to AGPS (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

Chemical cross-linking and immunoblot analyses have demonstrated that GNPAT and AGPS form high molecular weight complexes, indicating a stable interaction. In the absence of AGPS, GNPAT activity is significantly reduced, highlighting its dependency on AGPS for functional activity (Itzkovitz2011Functional).

GNPAT also interacts with alkyl-dihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase, forming a heterotrimeric complex in peroxisomes. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments, which show that GNPAT is part of a larger protein complex involved in ether phospholipid biosynthesis (Biermann1999Alkyl‐dihydroxyacetone).
