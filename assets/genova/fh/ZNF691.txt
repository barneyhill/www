# ZNF691

## Overview
ZNF691 is a gene located on human chromosome 1p34.2 that encodes the zinc finger protein 691, a member of the Krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. This family is the largest group of transcription factors in humans, characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 691 is a DNA-binding phosphoprotein that is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, with notable enrichment in the brain, central nervous system, and endocrine glands. It plays a crucial role in various nuclear regulatory processes, including transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair. Additionally, ZNF691 is involved in telomere biology, particularly in the regulation of TERRA metabolism, which is essential for telomere maintenance and stability (Avsar2019Atropa; Scheibe2013Quantitative). The gene's expression is modulated by microRNAs, highlighting its involvement in complex regulatory networks and potential implications in neurological and liver-related conditions (Abdel2020Classical; Avsar2019Atropa).

## Function
ZNF691 is a zinc-finger transcription factor encoded on human chromosome 1p34.2, belonging to the Krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family, the largest family of transcription factors in humans. It is a DNA-binding phosphoprotein that is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, with significant enrichment in the human brain, central nervous system (CNS), and endocrine glands (Avsar2019Atropa). ZNF691 is involved in regulating the transcription of multiple genes in the CNS, heart, and endocrine system, playing a role in various nuclear regulatory processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, signal transduction, actin targeting, DNA repair, and cell migration (Avsar2019Atropa).

In the context of telomere biology, ZNF691 has been identified as a regulator of TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) metabolism. It appears to play a role in the removal of TERRA from telomeres, as knockdown of ZNF691 results in increased TERRA association with telomeres, despite a reduction in global TERRA levels (Scheibe2013Quantitative). This suggests that ZNF691 may influence telomere maintenance and stability, although its exact function in healthy human cells remains unclear (Rippe2015TERRA).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF691 is implicated in various neurological and liver-related conditions due to its role in gene regulation. The gene is highly expressed in the human brain and central nervous system (CNS), and its expression is regulated by microRNAs, including hsa-miRNA-378 and aba-miRNA-9497 from Atropa belladonna. These miRNAs target the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of ZNF691 mRNA, leading to its down-regulation. This interaction suggests that plant miRNAs might influence human gene expression, potentially affecting neurological functions and contributing to the neurotoxic and psychoactive properties of Atropa belladonna (Avsar2019Atropa).

In the context of liver-related conditions, ZNF691 is identified as a downregulated gene in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. However, its specific role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis has not been thoroughly investigated, indicating a gap in understanding its clinical significance in liver malignancies (Abdel2020Classical).

Additionally, ZNF691 is mentioned in studies of retinitis pigmentosa, where it is noted among genes with significant alternative splicing events, although its specific clinical implications in this context are not detailed (ArzalluzLuque2021Mutant).

## Interactions
ZNF691, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is involved in interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate its expression. Specifically, the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of ZNF691 mRNA is targeted by two miRNAs: aba-miRNA-9497 from Atropa belladonna and hsa-miRNA-378 from humans. These miRNAs are highly homologous and have been shown to significantly down-regulate ZNF691 expression by binding to its 3′-UTR. This interaction was validated using a luciferase reporter assay in human neuronal-glial cells, demonstrating the miRNAs' ability to modulate gene expression regulated by ZNF691 (Avsar2019Atropa).

The study highlights the potential for cross-kingdom genetic communication, where plant-derived miRNAs can influence mammalian gene expression. This suggests that aba-miRNA-9497 may contribute to the neuroregulatory effects of Atropa belladonna, potentially affecting neurological functions in humans (Avsar2019Atropa). The interaction between these miRNAs and ZNF691 underscores the role of miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation, a mechanism conserved across plants and animals, and their potential involvement in inter-kingdom signaling (Avsar2019Atropa).
