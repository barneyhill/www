# LYN

## Overview
The LYN gene encodes a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, specifically the LYN proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling, particularly within the immune system, where it modulates the balance between activating and inhibitory signals in immune cells such as B cells and myeloid cells (Ingley2008Src; Mkaddem2017Lyn). The LYN protein is characterized by its structure, which includes several domains such as SH3, SH2, and a catalytic SH1 domain, facilitating its interactions with various signaling molecules and regulatory proteins (Weerawarna2023Lyn). Functionally, LYN is involved in the phosphorylation of substrates that regulate immune receptor signaling pathways, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Mkaddem2017Lyn). Dysregulation of LYN activity is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Brodie2018Lyn; Schwarz2014LYNactivating).

## Structure
The LYN proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase that is part of the Src family of kinases (SFKs). The LYN protein is expressed in two isoforms, LynA and LynB, which differ by 21 amino acids at the N-terminal end due to alternative splicing of exon-2 (Yi1991Hematopoietic; Weerawarna2023Lyn). The human LYN protein is 512 amino acids long and consists of several domains: an N-terminal SH4 domain, a unique domain, SH3 and SH2 domains, and a catalytic SH1 domain (Weerawarna2023Lyn).

The SH4 domain includes a Met-Gly-Cys motif that undergoes dual acylation with myristate and palmitate, facilitating membrane anchoring (Weerawarna2023Lyn). The SH3 domain, a 61 amino acid module, interacts with proline-rich motifs and maintains the inactive kinase conformation through intramolecular binding (Weerawarna2023Lyn). The SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine-containing peptide segments, including the Tyr508 phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory sequence of Lyn itself, regulating kinase activity (Weerawarna2023Lyn).

The catalytic SH1 domain features a conserved DFG motif and an αC helix, which adopt 'in' conformations in the active state and 'out' conformations in the inactive state (Weerawarna2023Lyn). The LYN protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. Autophosphorylation of Tyr397 activates the protein, while phosphorylation of Tyr508 by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or Csk homologous kinase (Chk) inhibits it (Weerawarna2023Lyn).

## Function
The LYN gene encodes a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which play a critical role in regulating immune cell signaling, particularly in B cells and myeloid cells. In healthy human cells, LYN functions as a molecular switch that modulates immune receptor signaling pathways, balancing inhibitory and activatory signals to maintain immune homeostasis. It is involved in the phosphorylation of specific substrates, such as SHP-1, which promotes inhibitory signaling through immunoreceptors, thereby preventing hyper-responsiveness of B cells and maintaining immune balance (Mkaddem2017Lyn).

LYN is active in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane, where it interacts with various adaptor molecules, including Csk binding protein (Cbp/PAG). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of LYN's kinase activity, as it facilitates the recruitment of negative regulators like Csk, leading to the inactivation of LYN through phosphorylation of its C-terminal regulatory sites (Ingley2008Src).

The proper functioning of LYN is essential for preventing inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as its deficiency can exacerbate conditions such as nephritis and arthritis, while its balanced activity helps maintain immune tolerance and prevent excessive inflammatory responses (Mkaddem2017Lyn).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LYN gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoimmune disorders. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the D189Y mutation in the LYN gene is associated with resistance to antiestrogen therapies. This mutation increases the catalytic activity of LYN, leading to enhanced cell growth and survival despite treatment with drugs like letrozole and fulvestrant (Schwarz2014LYNactivating). In gliomas, high LYN expression correlates with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and worse patient prognosis. LYN is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, suggesting its role in the tumor microenvironment and potential as an immunotherapy biomarker (Jiang2022Immune).

In leukemia and lymphoma, LYN is often overexpressed, contributing to disease severity and drug resistance. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), LYN interacts with the BCR-Abl fusion protein, playing a role in leukemogenesis and resistance to treatments like Imatinib (Ingley2012Functions). In autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), LYN acts as a negative regulator of immune signaling. Lyn-deficient mice exhibit symptoms of autoimmunity, highlighting the kinase's role in maintaining immune tolerance (Brodie2018Lyn).

## Interactions
Lyn kinase, a member of the Src family tyrosine kinases, engages in various interactions with proteins that are crucial for its role in cell signaling. Lyn interacts with scaffold, anchoring, or adaptor proteins, which facilitate its recruitment into multiprotein signaling networks. These interactions often occur through its SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs in proteins such as Ras-GAP and PI3K kinases (Weerawarna2023Lyn). Lyn also interacts with Src homology and collagen (Shc) proteins in neutrophils, leading to Shc phosphorylation (Weerawarna2023Lyn).

In immune cells, Lyn phosphorylates immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on various receptors. This phosphorylation recruits and activates other kinases, phosphatases, and adaptor proteins, such as Syk kinase and SHP-1, which modulate downstream signaling pathways (Brodie2018Lyn; Weerawarna2023Lyn). Lyn's interaction with SHP-1 is particularly significant, as it phosphorylates SHP-1 at tyrosine 536, promoting inhibitory signaling (Mkaddem2017Lyn).

Lyn also interacts with the FcγRIIA receptor, where it is associated with the phosphorylation of SHP-1, maintaining homeostasis in immune signaling (Mkaddem2017Lyn). In macrophages, Lyn interacts with β-arrestins in response to CCR5 activation (Weerawarna2023Lyn). These interactions highlight Lyn's role in both activating and inhibitory signaling pathways.
