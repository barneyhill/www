# NBPF6

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 6 (NBPF6) is a gene that encodes the NBPF member 6 protein, which is part of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family. This family of proteins is characterized by their involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation. The NBPF6 gene is located on chromosome 1 and is known for its complex genomic structure, which includes multiple tandem repeats and duplications. The protein encoded by NBPF6 is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and has been studied for its potential role in tumorigenesis, particularly in neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that arises from nerve tissue. Research into NBPF6 continues to explore its functional interactions and clinical significance in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
