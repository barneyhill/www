# SCG3

## Overview
Secretogranin III (SCG3) is a gene located on human chromosome 15q21 that encodes the protein secretogranin III, a member of the granin family of acidic secretory proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of secretory granules, particularly in neuroendocrine cells, by acting as a sorting receptor for chromogranin A (CgA) and facilitating the retention of proteins within secretory granules. Secretogranin III is characterized by its ability to bind to cholesterol-rich membrane domains, which is essential for the formation of secretory granules and the processing of prohormones into mature hormone aggregates. The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, underscores its significance in maintaining glucose homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic and neurological disorders (HOSAKA2010Secretogranin; Bartolomucci2011The; Lin2019Serum).

## Structure
Secretogranin III (SCG3) is a protein encoded by the SCG3 gene located on human chromosome 15q21. The SCG3 gene comprises 12 exons and encodes a 468-amino-acid acidic secretory protein. The primary structure of SCG3 includes seven pairs of consecutive basic amino acids, which are characteristic of its sequence (Bartolomucci2011The).

The secondary structure of SCG3 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but it is known to be a well-conserved protein across species, from mammals to fish, suggesting a stable structural conformation (Bartolomucci2011The). The tertiary structure involves its role as a sorting/retention receptor, with specific domains facilitating its function. SCG3 contains at least three functional domains: a cholesterol-binding domain (residues 23-186), a Chromogranin A (CgA)-binding domain (residues 214-373), and a carboxypeptidase E (CPE)-binding domain (residues 374-471) (HOSAKA2010Secretogranin).

SCG3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which is crucial for its synthesis and function within secretory vesicles (Bartolomucci2011The). The protein is involved in the sorting and retention of other proteins to secretory granules, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (HOSAKA2010Secretogranin).

## Function
Secretogranin III (SCG3) is a member of the granin family of proteins, which are involved in the biogenesis of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. SCG3 plays a crucial role in the sorting and retention of chromogranin A (CgA) to secretory granules by acting as a sorting receptor. It binds strongly to CgA under conditions that mimic the intragranular environment, and deletion of the SCG3-binding domain in CgA results in missorting, indicating its essential role in this process (Li2017Secretogranin).

SCG3 is active in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and secretory vesicles, where it binds to cholesterol-rich membrane domains. This binding is crucial for the formation of membrane platforms necessary for secretory granule biogenesis, facilitating the recruitment, processing, and condensation of prohormones into mature hormone aggregates (HOSAKA2010Secretogranin; Bartolomucci2011The). SCG3 acts as a molecular bridge linking hormone aggregates to the secretory granule membrane, ensuring efficient prohormone processing and the formation of dense core aggregates ready for secretion (HOSAKA2010Secretogranin).

In pancreatic beta cells, SCG3 is involved in insulin processing and secretion, affecting glucose homeostasis. Increased SCG3 levels have been observed in dysfunctional beta cells, suggesting its role in maintaining proper insulin secretion (Lin2019Serum).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCG3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3764220 (A-allele) in the promoter region of SCG3 is associated with metabolic syndrome-related changes, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance, which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality (Lin2013The). Another SNP, rs16964465 (minor C-allele) in the SCG3 promoter region, enhances transcriptional activity and is associated with increased SCG3 expression, potentially conferring resistance to obesity. This suggests that decreased SCG3 levels could increase obesity risk (Lin2013The).

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), SCG3 expression is significantly reduced in the substantia nigra and striatum regions of a mouse model of MPTP-induced PD. This reduction is more pronounced in the substantia nigra and is associated with motor deficits, indicating a critical role of SCG3 in the neuropathology of PD (Wen2021Proteomic). The impairment of SCG3 in dopaminergic neurons suggests its involvement in the disease's progression, potentially due to its role in secretory granule function and protein processing (Wen2021Proteomic).

## Interactions
Secretogranin III (SCG3) is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, particularly within the granin family. SCG3 interacts with chromogranin A (CgA) under conditions that mimic the intragranular environment, suggesting its role as a sorting or retention receptor for CgA in secretory granules (Li2017Secretogranin). It also binds to liposomes in a cholesterol-dependent manner and interacts with membrane-associated carboxypeptidase E (CPE), although its transport to secretory granules is independent of CPE (Li2017Secretogranin).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, SCG3 is involved in early peptide processing by interacting with CPE in vesicle membranes, acting as a bridge between CgA and cargo aggregates (Wen2021Proteomic). This interaction is crucial for the aggregation and processing of peptide neurotransmitters in secretory granules (Wen2021Proteomic).

In Alzheimer's disease, SCG3 is found to accumulate in senile plaques and is associated with dystrophic neurites and reactive astrocytes, indicating its involvement in the pathological processes of the disease (Plá2012Secretory). These interactions highlight SCG3's role in the regulated secretory pathway and its potential involvement in various neurological conditions.
