# KDSR

## Overview
The KDSR gene encodes the enzyme 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, a crucial component of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a reductase and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine to dihydrosphingosine, a key step in the production of sphingolipids such as ceramides (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine; Pilz2021Formation). Sphingolipids are vital for cellular functions, including membrane structure and signaling, and are essential for maintaining skin integrity and platelet function (Gelmetti2023A). Mutations in the KDSR gene can lead to various skin disorders and have been implicated in conditions such as leukemia and liver disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine; Pilz2021Formation).

## Function
The KDSR gene encodes the enzyme 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, which plays a crucial role in the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine to dihydrosphingosine, a key step in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, including ceramides (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine; Pilz2021Formation). Sphingolipids are essential components of cell membranes and are involved in maintaining the skin barrier and cellular signaling (Pilz2021Formation). 

KDSR is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it ensures the proper conversion of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, preventing its accumulation and facilitating the production of various sphingolipid species (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine). This process is vital for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and the unfolded protein response, which are crucial for managing cellular stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine).

In healthy human cells, the proper functioning of KDSR is necessary to maintain the balance of sphingolipids, which is essential for normal skin integrity and platelet function (Gelmetti2023A). Disruption of KDSR activity can lead to the accumulation of non-canonical sphingolipids, which are associated with skin disorders and other adverse biological effects (Pilz2021Formation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KDSR gene are associated with several skin disorders, including erythrokeratoderma variabilis et progressiva-4 (PERIOPTER syndrome) and palmoplantar keratoderma. These conditions are characterized by the accumulation of unusual keto-type ceramides in the skin, leading to symptoms such as generalized harlequin ichthyosis and palmoplantar keratoderma. The mutations result in a metabolic bottleneck in sphingolipid synthesis, causing the formation of 3-ketodihydroceramides, which are not typically observed in healthy individuals (Pilz2021Formation).

In leukemia, the KDSR gene plays a crucial role in maintaining cell survival and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. Disruption of KDSR in leukemia cells leads to increased apoptosis and ER stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. The depletion of KDSR results in the accumulation of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, causing cytotoxicity and loss of unfolded protein response (UPR) proteins, which are essential for leukemia cell viability (Liu20213Ketodihydrosphingosine).

In zebrafish, a mutation in the kdsr gene leads to liver conditions such as steatosis and hepatic injury. This mutation causes an accumulation of sphingolipids, including sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is linked to oxidative and ER stress, contributing to liver damage (Park20193-ketodihydrosphingosine).
