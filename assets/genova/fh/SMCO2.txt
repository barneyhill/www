# SMCO2

## Overview
The SMCO2 gene encodes the single-pass membrane protein with coiled-coil domains 2, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its integration into cellular membranes. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and maintaining cellular architecture, due to its coiled-coil domains that enable protein-protein interactions. The precise biological functions and pathways involving SMCO2 are still under investigation, but its role in cellular dynamics suggests potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
