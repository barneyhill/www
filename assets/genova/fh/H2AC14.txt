# H2AC14

## Overview
H2AC14 is a gene that encodes the H2A clustered histone 14 protein, a variant of the histone H2A family. This protein is a fundamental component of the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin structure in eukaryotic cells. As a histone protein, H2A clustered histone 14 plays a critical role in the organization and compaction of DNA, influencing chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation. The protein's structure, characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, facilitates its interaction with DNA and other histone proteins, forming the nucleosome core particle. Post-translational modifications of H2A clustered histone 14, such as methylation, are pivotal in modulating its function, affecting DNA accessibility and transcriptional activity (Dhahri2024Beyond; Soni2024Highthroughput).

## Structure
The H2AC14 gene encodes a variant of the histone H2A protein, which is a component of the histone octamer in nucleosomes. The primary structure of H2AC14 consists of a specific amino acid sequence that can be translated from its DNA sequence. This sequence is crucial for its role in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Soni2024Highthroughput).

The secondary structure of histone H2A, including H2AC14, typically involves alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's ability to interact with DNA and other histone proteins. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its function in the nucleosome. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of H2AC14 with other histone proteins to form the nucleosome core particle (Dhahri2024Beyond).

Post-translational modifications, such as methylation, can affect the function of H2AC14. These modifications play a role in regulating DNA accessibility and gene expression. The C-terminal docking domain of H2A, which is crucial for linking the H3-H4 tetramer with the H2A-H2B dimer, is also present in H2AC14, influencing nucleosome stability and chromatin dynamics (Dhahri2024Beyond).
