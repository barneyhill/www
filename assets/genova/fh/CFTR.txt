# CFTR

## Overview
The CFTR gene encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein, a critical component of epithelial ion transport systems. This protein is a chloride channel and a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the hydration and pH balance of epithelial surfaces, particularly in the lungs and pancreas (SHEPPARD1999Structure; SaintCriq2016Role). The CFTR protein's structure includes two membrane-spanning domains, two nucleotide-binding domains, and a regulatory domain, which together facilitate its function as a chloride ion channel (Mornon2009Molecular). Mutations in the CFTR gene are the primary cause of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that leads to severe respiratory and digestive issues due to impaired ion transport (Bareil2020CFTR). Beyond cystic fibrosis, CFTR mutations are implicated in a range of related disorders, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Cohn1998Relation).

## Structure
The CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) protein is a chloride channel and a unique member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. Its primary structure consists of 1,480 amino acids. The protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a channel with two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory (R) domain (SHEPPARD1999Structure; Mornon2009Molecular).

The tertiary structure of CFTR reveals a complex arrangement where the MSDs form the channel pore, and the NBDs regulate channel gating through ATP hydrolysis. The R domain, which contains multiple phosphorylation sites, controls channel activity by acting as a regulatory plug (Meng2019CFTR; Hwang2018Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization of the NBDs upon ATP binding, which is essential for channel opening (Mornon2009Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of CFTR include phosphorylation, which is crucial for its activation, and glycosylation, which occurs at specific asparagine residues (SHEPPARD1999Structure; Mornon2009Molecular). The CFTR protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and stability (Mornon2009Molecular).

## Function
The CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) protein functions as a chloride ion channel in epithelial cells, playing a critical role in maintaining the hydration and pH balance of the airway surface liquid (ASL), which is essential for effective pulmonary innate immunity (SaintCriq2016Role). CFTR is involved in the regulation of salt and water transport across epithelial cells, facilitating the transcellular transport of chloride ions across the apical membrane. This process creates an osmotic gradient that drives the passive movement of sodium ions and water, resulting in isotonic fluid secretion (SaintCriq2016Role).

In the pancreas, CFTR is crucial for bicarbonate secretion, which is necessary for normal digestive enzyme function and preventing pancreatitis (SaintCriq2016Role). In the lungs, CFTR maintains the hydration of airway surfaces, which is vital for mucociliary clearance and preventing infections (SaintCriq2016Role). CFTR also regulates the activity of other ion channels, such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), to maintain proper electrolyte balance and fluid transport across epithelial surfaces (Kunzelmann1999CFTR).

CFTR's role extends to modulating inflammatory responses and regulating the expression of proinflammatory molecules, contributing to the immune response in the lungs (SaintCriq2016Role). It is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, where it regulates various ion channels and transporters to ensure proper ion and water transport across epithelial membranes (SaintCriq2016Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFTR gene are primarily associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe respiratory and digestive problems. CF is caused by variants in both copies of the CFTR gene, leading to malfunction of exocrine tissues and ion flux perturbations in epithelial cells of various organs (Moskowitz2008Clinical; Bareil2020CFTR). Over 2,000 CFTR variants have been identified, with severe variants often resulting in classic CF symptoms, including pancreatic insufficiency and lung disease (Dean1994Heterogeneity; Bareil2020CFTR).

CFTR mutations are also linked to CFTR-related disorders (CFTR-RD), which include conditions such as idiopathic pancreatitis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), and some forms of bronchiectasis (Cohn1998Relation; Bareil2020CFTR). CFTR mutations can lead to pancreatic ductal obstruction, contributing to pancreatitis, even in the absence of typical CF lung disease (Cohn1998Relation). Additionally, CFTR mutations are associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly in CFTR-expressing sites such as the intestine and pancreatic and biliary ductal systems (Wilschanski2007Patterns). The classification of CFTR variants into classes based on their functional impact aids in predicting clinical outcomes and developing targeted therapies (Bareil2020CFTR).

## Interactions
The CFTR protein interacts with a variety of proteins that regulate its function, stability, and localization. At the apical membrane of epithelial cells, CFTR forms complexes with proteins such as E3KARP and ezrin, which help localize protein kinase A (PKA) for phosphorylation, enhancing CFTR's activity (Sun2000E3KARP). CFTR also interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins like NHERF1, which link it to the cytoskeleton and stabilize it at the membrane (Farinha2021Revisiting). 

CFTR's interaction with syntaxin 1A modulates its chloride channel activity, with syntaxin 1A inhibiting CFTR-mediated currents (Naren1997Regulation). The protein also associates with filamins, which are crucial for its biosynthetic maturation and stability, as demonstrated by the impact of the S13F mutation on CFTR-filamin interactions (Thelin2007Direct).

In the endoplasmic reticulum, CFTR interacts with chaperones like Hsp70 and calnexin, which are part of the quality control system that ensures proper folding and targets misfolded CFTR for degradation (Chevalier2022Differential). These interactions are essential for CFTR's role in maintaining ion transport and cellular homeostasis.
