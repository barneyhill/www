# CXorf66

## Overview
The CXorf66 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 66. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. Although the precise biological function of CXorf66 remains to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern and potential interactions indicate a role in various cellular pathways. The gene's location on the X chromosome also implies potential implications in sex-linked genetic conditions, although further research is necessary to clarify its clinical significance.
