# USP38

## Overview
USP38 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 38) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including protein stability, immune regulation, and gene expression. The protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 38, encoded by USP38, functions by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their degradation and activity. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in modulating type I interferon signaling, chromatin remodeling, and the stabilization of key proteins such as LSD1 and c-Myc, which are crucial for cell proliferation and immune homeostasis. USP38's interactions with other proteins, such as TBK1 and METTL14, further underscore its importance in cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms, including cancer and inflammatory conditions (Zhao2020USP38; Xu2021The; Lin2016USP38).

## Function
USP38 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 38) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the modulation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling by interacting with TBK1, a key kinase in the IFN pathway. USP38 removes K33-linked ubiquitin chains from TBK1, promoting its degradation through K48-linked ubiquitination, thus inhibiting excessive IFN signaling and maintaining immune homeostasis (Lin2016USP38).

USP38 also influences chromatin remodeling and gene transcription by reducing the monoubiquitination of histone H2B and the trimethylation of histone H3, affecting the transcription of genes like Il6 and Il23a (Zhao2020USP38). In addition, USP38 stabilizes the protein LSD1 by removing its ubiquitin chains, enhancing LSD1's role in activating signaling pathways and promoting cell proliferation (Liu2018The).

USP38 is also involved in stabilizing the oncoprotein c-Myc by preventing its degradation, thereby promoting cell proliferation. This stabilization occurs through USP38's interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7α, which mediates c-Myc ubiquitination (Xu2021The). These activities highlight USP38's significant role in cellular processes, including immune regulation, gene expression, and cell proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USP38 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In colorectal cancer, USP38 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is associated with increased malignancy and cancer stem cell populations, leading to enhanced tumor growth and chemoresistance. Conversely, higher USP38 expression correlates with better patient survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer management (Zhan2020USP38).

USP38 also plays a significant role in inflammatory diseases. It negatively regulates inflammation by modulating histone modifications, which affects the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Loss of USP38 leads to increased susceptibility to inflammatory conditions such as endotoxin shock and colitis, highlighting its importance in controlling inflammation (Zhao2020USP38).

In the context of asthma, USP38 stabilizes the JunB protein, which is crucial for Th2 cell differentiation and cytokine production. This role makes USP38 a critical factor in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma, with its deficiency leading to resistance against asthma development (Chen2018USP38).

## Interactions
USP38, a deubiquitinating enzyme, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In bladder cancer cells, USP38 interacts with METTL14, forming a feedback loop that regulates each other's stability and function. METTL14 enhances the stability of USP38 mRNA, while USP38 mediates the deubiquitination of METTL14, preventing its degradation (Huang2022The).

USP38 also interacts with TBK1, a key kinase in type I interferon signaling. It cleaves K33-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from TBK1, regulating its stability and activity through the NLRP4 signalosome. This interaction is crucial for controlling TBK1's role in antiviral immunity (Lin2016USP38).

In the context of inflammation, USP38 forms a complex with KDM5B, affecting histone modification and gene expression. This interaction is important for the recruitment of KDM5B to specific gene promoters, thereby modulating inflammatory responses (Zhao2020USP38).

USP38 also interacts with the oncoprotein c-Myc, inhibiting its polyubiquitination and increasing its stability, which promotes cell proliferation (Xu2021The). Additionally, USP38 interacts with HDAC3 in colorectal cancer, modulating histone acetylation through deubiquitination (Zhan2020USP38).
