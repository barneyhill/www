# OR4Q2

## Overview
The OR4Q2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily Q member 2, which is part of the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Wang2020Genome-Wide). The OR4Q2 protein, like other olfactory receptors, is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the sense of smell by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a neuronal response. The structural features of OR4Q2, including its alpha-helical transmembrane regions, are critical for its function in odorant recognition and signal transduction (cvicek2015structure). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may further modulate its activity and stability, underscoring the complexity of its regulatory mechanisms (cvicek2015structure).

## Structure
The OR4Q2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in odor detection. These receptors typically have a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a characteristic feature of GPCRs (Wang2020Genome-Wide). The primary structure of OR4Q2 consists of amino acid sequences that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs (cvicek2015structure).

The tertiary structure of OR4Q2 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to span the cell membrane and interact with odorant molecules. This folding is crucial for the receptor's ability to transduce signals upon binding to specific ligands. While quaternary structures are less common in GPCRs, the functional state of OR4Q2 may involve interactions with other proteins or receptors (cvicek2015structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability, localization, and function. These modifications are typical in GPCRs and play a role in their regulatory mechanisms (cvicek2015structure).
