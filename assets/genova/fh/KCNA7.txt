# KCNA7

## Overview
The KCNA7 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 7, a protein that is part of the Shaker-related subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and a pore-forming region, which are typical features of the voltage-gated potassium channel family (Kalman1998Genomic). Functionally, the KCNA7-encoded channel plays a critical role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating action potentials in excitable cells, particularly in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues (BardienKruger2002Characterisation; Kalman1998Genomic). The channel's involvement in cardiac electrical activity and insulin secretion underscores its importance in both cardiovascular and metabolic processes (Finol‐Urdaneta2012Block). Despite its significant physiological roles, the KCNA7 gene has not been directly linked to specific diseases, although it has been investigated in the context of cardiac arrhythmias and diabetes susceptibility (Kalman1998Genomic).

## Structure
The KCNA7 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the Shaker-related subfamily. The protein consists of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), which are characteristic of this family, with a pore-forming region between the S5 and S6 segments (Kalman1998Genomic). The hydrophobic core of the protein shares significant sequence similarity with other Shaker family channels, indicating a conserved structure in this region (Kalman1998Genomic). 

The KCNA7 protein includes conserved sites for post-translational modifications, such as a potential tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site in its N-terminal region and two protein kinase C consensus sites in the cytoplasmic loop between S4 and S5 (Kalman1998Genomic). Unlike other Kv1 family genes, KCNA7 lacks an N-glycosylation site in the extracellular loop linking the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments (Kalman1998Genomic). 

The protein functions as a tetramer, typically forming heterotetramers with other subunits, which is a common feature of the Kv1 family of potassium channels (Goldin2007Neuronal). The KCNA7 gene is unique among vertebrate KCNA genes for containing a single intron, while others are intronless (Hoegg2007Phylogenomic).

## Function
The KCNA7 gene encodes the Kv1.7 potassium channel, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating action potentials in excitable cells. This channel is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it contributes to electrical signaling and muscle contraction (BardienKruger2002Characterisation; Kalman1998Genomic).

In cardiac tissue, Kv1.7 channels are functionally similar to the ultrarapidly activating delayed rectifier current (I Kur), which is important for cardiac electrical activity and repolarization of the cell membrane after action potentials (BardienKruger2002Characterisation). The channel's rapid activation and inactivation properties are essential for the proper timing of cardiac muscle contractions, influencing heart rhythm and function (Kalman1998Genomic).

In pancreatic beta cells, Kv1.7 channels are involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). They contribute to the repolarization phase of the beta cell membrane during insulin secretion, modulating action potential firing and intracellular calcium levels, which are critical for insulin release (Finol‐Urdaneta2012Block). The selective blockade of Kv1.7 channels has been shown to enhance GSIS, suggesting their significant role in metabolic regulation (Finol‐Urdaneta2012Block).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNA7 gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays a crucial role in regulating electrical excitability in cells. Although initially considered a candidate for progressive familial heart block type I (PFHBI) due to its chromosomal location and expression in the heart, studies have excluded KCNA7 as the causative gene for this condition. Direct sequencing in individuals affected by PFHBI revealed no pathogenic mutations in the coding regions of KCNA7, although two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in exon 2, resulting in amino acid substitutions (BardienKruger2002Characterisation).

The gene's location on chromosome 19q13.3 has also been linked to a putative diabetes susceptibility locus, particularly in Finnish families with associated hypertension and difficulties in insulin-stimulated glucose storage. This suggests a potential association with diabetes, although no direct link to specific diseases has been established (Kalman1998Genomic). The KCNA7 gene's role in cardiac and neurological functions highlights its clinical significance, as mutations or altered expression could impact these systems, potentially leading to conditions like cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy (Kalman1998Genomic). However, further research is needed to fully understand its implications in these diseases.
