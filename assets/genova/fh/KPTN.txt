# KPTN

## Overview
The KPTN gene encodes the protein kaptin, an actin-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular signaling pathways. Kaptin is characterized by its WD-repeat-containing structure, forming a 7-bladed beta-propeller that facilitates interactions with actin filaments, thereby influencing cellular processes such as motility and intracellular transport (Dutta2023The). As a component of the KICSTOR complex, kaptin is involved in the negative regulation of mTORC1 signaling, a critical pathway for cellular growth and metabolism (Horn2023Case; Levitin2022Mouse). Mutations in the KPTN gene are linked to a syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, and seizures, underscoring its importance in brain development and function (Baple2014Mutations; Levitin2023Models).

## Structure
The KPTN protein, encoded by the KPTN gene, is a member of the WD-repeat-containing protein family and is predicted to have a 7-bladed beta-propeller structure based on AlphaFold modeling (Dutta2023The). This structure is typical for proteins involved in actin dynamics, providing a stable platform for protein-protein interactions. The protein's secondary structure includes a beta-propeller region, which is crucial for its function as an actin-binding protein (Dutta2023The).

A key feature of KPTN is its actin-binding site, which is structurally conserved across higher eukaryotes (Dutta2023The). The protein exhibits weak actin filament bundling activity and functions as a barbed-end capping protein, stabilizing actin filaments by inhibiting their depolymerization (Dutta2023The). A critical cationic residue, Arg 59, in the N-terminal beta-propeller region, is essential for actin binding, and its mutation can abolish this activity (Dutta2023The).

KPTN is also involved in the KICSTOR complex, which regulates mTORC1 signaling, indicating its role in broader cellular processes beyond actin dynamics (Horn2023Case). The protein's localization to actin-rich structures in neurons underscores its importance in neuromorphogenesis and brain development (Horn2023Case).

## Function
The KPTN gene encodes the protein Kaptin, which plays a crucial role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. Kaptin is an actin-associated protein that localizes to actin-rich structures at the cell periphery, such as lamellipodia and filopodia, which are essential for cellular processes like motility and intracellular transport (Dutta2023The). Kaptin exhibits barbed-end capping activity, stabilizing and bundling actin filaments, which is vital for the dynamic remodeling of actin filament-based structures (Dutta2023The). This activity is crucial for maintaining the integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, affecting cell shape, motility, and division (Dutta2023The).

KPTN is also a component of the KICSTOR complex, which negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling, a pathway involved in cellular growth and metabolism (Levitin2022Mouse; Levitin2023Models). In healthy cells, KPTN helps maintain normal mTOR activity, preventing excessive activation that can lead to disorders such as brain overgrowth (Levitin2022Mouse). The protein's role in mTOR signaling is crucial for normal brain development and function, as it regulates synaptic plasticity and neural stem cell proliferation (Levitin2022Mouse; Levitin2023Models).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KPTN gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by macrocephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, and seizures. This condition, also known as Macrocephaly, Autistic features, Seizures, Developmental delay (MASD) syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder linked to germline variants in KPTN, which is part of the mTOR regulatory complex KICSTOR (Baple2014Mutations; Levitin2023Models). The disorder is marked by brain overgrowth, cognitive deficits, and behavioral abnormalities, with symptoms including craniofacial dysmorphism, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and seizures (Levitin2022Mouse; Levitin2023Models).

Research has shown that mutations such as c.776C>A and c.714_731dup disrupt the function of kaptin, leading to impaired neuronal actin cytoskeleton and affecting dendritic arborization and spine formation (Baple2014Mutations). These mutations result in increased mTOR signaling, which is sensitive to rapamycin, suggesting potential therapeutic interventions (Levitin2022Mouse). Mouse models of KPTN loss-of-function exhibit phenotypes similar to the human disorder, including brain overgrowth and cognitive deficits, implicating KPTN in mTORC1 regulation (Levitin2023Models). The disorder is part of a broader group of mTORC1-related disorders affecting brain structure and cognitive function (Levitin2022Mouse).

## Interactions
KPTN, also known as kaptin, is an actin-binding protein that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and mTORC1 signaling. KPTN interacts with actin filaments, inhibiting their assembly in a dose-dependent manner and acting as a barbed-end capping protein, which prevents the elongation of actin filaments (Dutta2023The). This interaction is crucial for modulating actin dynamics, as KPTN stabilizes actin filaments by inhibiting their depolymerization and allows slow filament growth in the presence of profilin (Dutta2023The).

KPTN is a component of the KICSTOR complex, which includes ITFG2, C12orf66, and SZT2, and is involved in regulating mTORC1 signaling (Dutta2023The). The KICSTOR complex recruits GATOR1 to the lysosomal membrane, which is essential for the negative regulation of mTORC1 signaling (Li2024OTUD3). KPTN's interaction with the deubiquitinase OTUD3 is also significant, as OTUD3 deubiquitinates KPTN, affecting the mTORC1 pathway by facilitating the recruitment of GATOR1 to lysosomes (Li2024OTUD3).

KPTN interacts with VWCE, another protein that modulates mTOR signaling. VWCE interacts with all four subunits of the KICSTOR complex, including KPTN, and is necessary for the lysosomal localization of GATOR1 (Zhao2023VWCE). These interactions highlight KPTN's role in cellular growth and metabolism regulation.
