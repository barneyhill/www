# LY86

## Overview
LY86, also known as lymphocyte antigen 86, is a gene that encodes the protein MD-1, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system. MD-1 is primarily associated with the Toll-like receptor family protein RP105, forming a complex that is essential for the surface expression of B cells and is expressed on various immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Cai2023Transcriptomic; Su2014DNA). This complex is involved in modulating immune responses, particularly by acting as a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby influencing the immune response to pathogens and the regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism (Su2014DNA; de2020Integrating). The LY86 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including obesity, atherosclerosis, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal immune function and disease states (Li2021Bioinformatics; Jiang2024LY86).

## Structure


## Function
LY86, also known as lymphocyte antigen 86, encodes the protein MD-1, which is a secreted glycoprotein associated with the Toll-like receptor family protein RP105. This complex is crucial for the surface expression of B cells and is expressed on various immune cells, including B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Cai2023Transcriptomic; Su2014DNA). The RP105/MD-1 complex plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly by acting as a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Su2014DNA).

In monocytes, LY86 forms a complex with RP105, which inhibits TLR4 signaling, affecting the migratory capacity of these cells. This interaction is crucial for the immune response to pathogens, as it influences the recruitment of monocytes to sites of infection (de2020Integrating). LY86 is also involved in the regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism, as evidenced by its role in facilitating oxidized LDL-induced lipid accumulation in macrophages, which is important in the context of atherosclerosis (Jiang2024LY86). The protein is primarily active in immune cells, contributing to the modulation of immune signaling and inflammatory responses (Clark2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LY86 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In obesity, higher DNA methylation levels of the LY86 gene correlate with increased body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance, and inflammation. This methylation may block transcription factor binding, potentially influencing obesity-related traits (Su2014DNA). The gene's methylation is also linked to higher levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting a role in inflammatory processes (GonzalezJaramillo2019Epigenetics).

In the context of atherosclerosis, LY86 expression is significantly elevated in atherosclerotic plaques. Its upregulation is associated with lipid accumulation in macrophages, which is a key factor in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Silencing LY86 can reduce lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disorders (Jiang2024LY86).

In renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC), LY86 is markedly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Li2021Bioinformatics). Additionally, LY86 is downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the R172 IDH2 mutation, although its role in AML is not well established (Handschuh2019Not).

## Interactions
LY86, also known as lymphocyte antigen 86, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in immune response regulation. LY86 forms a complex with the Toll-like receptor protein RP105 (CD180), which is significant in modulating immune signaling pathways. This complex interacts with the LY96 (MD-2)-TLR4 complex, influencing TLR4 signaling. The interaction has cell-type-specific effects: it activates TLR4 signaling in B-cells but inhibits it in myeloid cells, such as monocytes (de2020Integrating).

In monocytes, the LY86-RP105 complex negatively regulates TLR4 signaling, which is crucial for controlling immune responses. The absence of RP105, which can occur due to genetic variations like the rs9405943 candidemia-risk allele, leads to increased LY96-TLR4 signaling. This results in enhanced repression of the chemokine receptor CCR2, affecting monocyte migration and increasing susceptibility to infections like candidemia (de2020Integrating).

These interactions highlight the role of LY86 in immune system processes, particularly in the context of its regulatory effects on TLR4 signaling and its impact on monocyte function and migration (de2020Integrating).
