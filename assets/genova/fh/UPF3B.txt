# UPF3B

## Overview
The UPF3B gene encodes the UPF3B protein, a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, which is responsible for the degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons. This protein is categorized as a regulator of mRNA decay and plays a significant role in maintaining mRNA integrity by preventing the production of truncated proteins that could be deleterious to cellular function. UPF3B is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an RNA recognition motif-like domain and a NONA/paraspeckle-like domain, facilitating its interactions with RNA and other proteins. It is predominantly nuclear but shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, interacting with the exon junction complex and other NMD components to regulate mRNA stability. Mutations in the UPF3B gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in neural development and mRNA surveillance (Deka2021Functional; Kunz2006Functions; Alrahbeni2015Full).

## Structure
The UPF3B protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains an RNA recognition motif-like domain (RRM-L) and a NONA/paraspeckle-like domain (NOPS-L), which are essential for its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Bufton2022Molecular). The middle domain of UPF3B is particularly significant, as it contains interspersed α-helical regions and coiled-coil structures, which are crucial for its function and interaction with double-stranded RNA (Bufton2022Molecular). This middle domain is also where many disease-causing mutations are clustered, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Bufton2022Molecular).

UPF3B interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC) through its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for activating nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Buchwald2010Insights). The protein forms a stable trimeric complex with eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3A, indicating its role in translation termination (Gao2017An). UPF3B's interaction with UPF2 is mediated by its RRM-L and NOPS-L domains, with specific residues like Y160 playing a critical role in maintaining high-affinity binding (Bufton2022Molecular). The protein's structure allows it to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitated by nuclear localization sequences and nuclear export signals (Deka2021Functional).

## Function
The UPF3B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a cellular mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) to prevent the production of truncated proteins. UPF3B is part of the exon junction complex (EJC) and interacts with other NMD components such as UPF1 and UPF2, facilitating the decay of faulty transcripts (Kunz2006Functions; Alrahbeni2015Full). In healthy human cells, UPF3B is involved in delaying translation termination at PTCs by interacting with the eRF3a-GTP/eRF1 complex, which hinders stop codon recognition and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis. This delay allows for the assembly of NMD-promoting complexes on aberrant mRNA (Deka2021Functional).

UPF3B is predominantly nuclear but shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, associating with spliced mRNA to facilitate its interaction with mRNAs (Kunz2006Functions). It is also involved in the regulation of approximately 10% of normal mRNAs, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including neural development (Deka2021Functional). The protein's role in NMD is essential for maintaining mRNA integrity and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful truncated proteins in healthy human cells (Wallmeroth2021UPF3A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UPF3B gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Huang2017A; Nguyen2013Contribution). These mutations can lead to impaired nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a critical process for degrading mRNA transcripts with premature stop codons, which is essential for normal neuronal development (Alrahbeni2015Full).

Specific mutations, such as the c.697_698delAG, p.Arg233fs*30, introduce premature termination codons, resulting in transcript degradation and preventing the production of a full-length protein (Lynch2012Broadening). This can lead to a variety of phenotypes, including renal dysplasia and developmental delays (Lynch2012Broadening). Other mutations, like p.R430X, have been identified as causative in non-syndromic mental retardation (Xu2012Exome).

The UPF3B gene is also implicated in specific syndromes such as Lujan-Fryns and FG syndromes, which are characterized by intellectual disabilities and sometimes autism (Laumonnier2009Mutations). These conditions highlight the gene's role in regulating mRNA expression and degradation at synapses, impacting learning and memory (Laumonnier2009Mutations).

## Interactions
UPF3B is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. It interacts with the exon junction complex (EJC), specifically binding to the MAGO-Y14 heterodimer through its C-terminal region, which is essential for NMD activity (Deka2021Functional; Buchwald2010Insights). UPF3B also forms a ternary complex with eukaryotic release factors eRF3a and eRF1, which is critical for reducing translation termination efficiency at premature termination codons (PTCs) (Deka2021Functional).

UPF3B interacts with UPF2, another key factor in the NMD pathway, through its nuclear export signal (NES) (Deka2021Functional). This interaction is crucial for forming an NMD-competent complex that stimulates SMG1 kinase activity, leading to UPF1 phosphorylation and subsequent mRNA decay (Deka2021Functional). UPF3B also binds preferentially to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and displays RNA-induced oligomerization, with a higher affinity for dsRNA compared to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and DNA (Bufton2022Molecular).

Additionally, UPF3B interacts with human ribosomal subunits, showing high-affinity interactions with both 40S and 60S subunits, which suggests its role in RNA processing and regulation (Bufton2022Molecular). These interactions highlight UPF3B's multifaceted role in mRNA surveillance and neurodevelopmental processes.
