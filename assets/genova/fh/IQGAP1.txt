# IQGAP1

## Overview
IQGAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1, a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its ability to interact with a wide range of cellular components, including actin filaments, small GTPases, and signaling molecules, thereby playing a pivotal role in cytoskeletal dynamics, cell signaling, and intercellular interactions. IQGAP1 is particularly notable for its involvement in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, where it facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (McNulty2011MAPK; Hedman2015The). The protein's structural features, such as its calponin homology domain, coiled-coil repeats, and IQ motifs, enable it to function as a central integrator of signaling pathways and cytoskeletal organization (PelikanConchaudron2011The; Liu2016The). IQGAP1's role in cellular dynamics and its implication in various cancers underscore its significance as a potential therapeutic target (White2009IQGAPs; Wei2021Role).

## Structure
IQGAP1 is a large modular protein with a molecular weight of 189 kDa, consisting of 1657 amino acid residues. It contains several key domains that contribute to its structural and functional diversity. The N-terminal region includes a calponin homology domain (CHD), which is involved in binding and bundling actin filaments. This domain forms a parallel dimer through hydrophobic interactions, which is crucial for its ability to bind F-actin and calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) (Liu2016The). The CHD is composed of five major α-helices and several minor helices, forming a parallel helical bundle (Liu2016The).

Following the CHD, IQGAP1 contains six coiled-coil repeats that facilitate dimerization, a WW domain that binds ERK1 and ERK2, and four IQ motifs that bind calmodulin (CaM) (PelikanConchaudron2011The). The RasGAP-related domain (GRD) binds GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac but lacks GAP activity, suggesting a role in signaling pathways (Hart1996IQGAP1). The C-terminal region interacts with proteins such as E-cadherin and β-catenin, and the extreme C-terminal region binds CLIP170, APC, and the formin mDia1 (PelikanConchaudron2011The).

IQGAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which influence its activity and interactions. Multiple splice variants exist, contributing to its functional diversity. The protein's ability to form dimers is essential for its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Liu2016The).

## Function
IQGAP1 is a multifunctional scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, intracellular signaling, and intercellular interactions. IQGAP1 interacts with multiple partners, including F-actin and small GTPases like Cdc42 and Rac1, to regulate the cytoskeleton, which is essential for processes such as cytokinesis, cell migration, and maintaining cell-cell contacts (Mataraza2003IQGAP1; Hedman2015The). 

IQGAP1 is a key player in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, where it scaffolds components such as K-Ras, B-Raf, MEK, and ERK, promoting ERK activation. This activation influences numerous cellular processes and impacts physiology across various tissues (Hedman2015The). In the context of cytokinesis, IQGAP1 is observed at the mid-body or contractile ring during cell division, and its depletion leads to defects in cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleated cells (Hedman2015The).

IQGAP1 also plays a role in modulating cadherin-mediated adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics, interacting with adhesion-associated proteins like E-cadherin and β-catenin, which influence cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Hedman2015The). It is active in various subcellular structures, including lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and adherens junctions, contributing to cellular dynamics and tissue development (Li2000Gastric).

## Clinical Significance
IQGAP1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a scaffold protein that influences multiple signaling pathways. In breast cancer, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the miR-124 binding site on the IQGAP1 gene, specifically rs1042538, affects its regulation. The AA genotype of this SNP is associated with increased breast cancer risk, suggesting that IQGAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor in early stages but as an oncogene in later stages (Zhang2011Genetic). Overexpression of IQGAP1 is linked to aggressive cancers, including lung, colorectal, and oligodendroglioma, and is considered an oncogene due to its role in promoting proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (White2009IQGAPs).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), IQGAP1 contributes to carcinogenesis through the PI3K signaling pathway. Overexpression correlates with poorer survival rates, and a specific missense mutation, S459L, has been identified in familial cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma (Wei2021Role). In pancreatic and liver cancers, IQGAP1 scaffolds the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression. Its interaction with the JAK-STAT3 pathway also facilitates cell invasion (Wei2021Role). These findings highlight IQGAP1's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
IQGAP1 is a scaffold protein that interacts with a wide array of proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It binds to small GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1, stabilizing them in their active GTP-bound states, which is essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell motility (Gorisse2020Ubiquitination; Pathmanathan2011The). IQGAP1 also interacts with calmodulin through its IQ motifs, with binding influenced by calcium ion concentration (Pathmanathan2011The; McNulty2011MAPK). 

The protein associates with actin, facilitating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Mataraza2007Multiple; White2012IQGAP1). IQGAP1 forms complexes with proteins such as CLIP-170, APC, and CLASP2, which are involved in microtubule regulation (White2012IQGAP1). It also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), modulating its activation in a calcium-sensitive manner (McNulty2011MAPK). 

IQGAP1's interaction with estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ affects transcriptional regulation, influencing the expression of estrogen-responsive genes (Erdemir2014IQGAP1). These diverse interactions highlight IQGAP1's role as a central integrator of signaling pathways and cytoskeletal organization.
