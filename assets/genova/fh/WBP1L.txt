# WBP1L

## Overview
The WBP1L gene encodes the WW domain binding protein 1-like, a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its single transmembrane domain, a short extracellular region, and a larger cytoplasmic tail that contains WW domain binding motifs. These motifs facilitate interactions with NEDD4-family ubiquitin ligases, playing a crucial role in the regulation of ubiquitination processes, particularly affecting the chemokine receptor CXCR4. WBP1L is broadly expressed in various hematopoietic cells and is implicated in the regulation of CXCR4 signaling, which is essential for leukocyte homeostasis and hematopoiesis. The protein's interactions and regulatory functions suggest its importance in normal cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as schizophrenia and serous ovarian cancer (Győrffy2023Discovery; Borna2019Transmembrane; Guan2019Evaluation).

## Structure
The WBP1L protein, also known as WW domain binding protein 1-like, is a transmembrane adaptor protein characterized by a short extracellular/luminal region, a single transmembrane domain, and a larger cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular part is compact, likely stabilized by disulfide bridges formed among cysteines in the C*C*CC*CC motif (Borna2019Transmembrane). The cytoplasmic region contains several WW domain binding motifs, specifically L-P-X-Y or P-P-X-Y sequences, which facilitate interactions with NEDD4-family ubiquitin ligases (Borna2019Transmembrane).

WBP1L is a palmitoylated glycoprotein, with potential N-glycosylation and palmitoylation sites in its N-terminal region, contributing to its membrane association and function (Borna2019Transmembrane). The protein's structure includes a PPPY WW domain interacting motif, crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions (Borna2019Transmembrane). Imaging studies have shown that WBP1L localizes to the plasma membrane, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, and, to a lesser extent, lysosomes or other acidic organelles, but not mitochondria (Borna2019Transmembrane). The protein's interaction with NEDD4-family ligases is dependent on its WW binding motifs, as demonstrated by the loss of interaction in a mutant lacking these motifs (Borna2019Transmembrane).

## Function
The WBP1L gene encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of CXCR4 signaling. This protein is broadly expressed in various human hematopoietic cell subsets, including T cells, B cells, and neutrophils, as well as in bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells (Borna2019Transmembrane). WBP1L interacts with NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases through its WW domain binding motifs, influencing the ubiquitination and expression of CXCR4, a critical chemokine receptor involved in cell migration and hematopoiesis (Borna2019Transmembrane).

In healthy cells, WBP1L negatively regulates CXCR4 signaling, which is crucial for maintaining leukocyte homeostasis and normal hematopoietic processes. This regulation is achieved by increasing CXCR4 ubiquitination, leading to its down-regulation and reduced protein levels (Borna2019Transmembrane). The protein is distributed within cells, co-localizing with the plasma membrane, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum, but not with mitochondria (Borna2019Transmembrane). WBP1L's role in these molecular processes suggests its importance in normal cellular functions and its potential implications in hematopoietic regulation and leukocyte development (Borna2019Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
The WBP1L gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In schizophrenia, WBP1L is associated with the disorder, particularly through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs4147157 and rs284854, which have been linked to the condition and its symptomatology (Guan2019Evaluation). The gene is also a target of microRNA 137, which is a significant risk factor for schizophrenia (GiustiRodríguez2013The).

In the context of cancer, WBP1L has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in serous ovarian cancer, where higher expression levels are associated with worse progression-free survival outcomes (Győrffy2023Discovery). The gene is noted for its role in regulating CXCR4 signaling and hematopoiesis, although it has not been previously correlated with ovarian cancer pathogenesis (Győrffy2023Discovery).

Additionally, WBP1L is part of a gene signature associated with specific leukemia subtypes, such as the ETV6-RUNX1-like B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where it is identified as a high-level target gene of ETV6 (Neveu2016CLIC5:; Chen2021RAG1).

## Interactions
WBP1L, also known as WW domain binding protein 1-like, is a transmembrane adaptor protein that interacts with several members of the NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases, including WWP2, ITCH, WWP1, and NEDD4L. These interactions are mediated through the WW domain binding motifs present in WBP1L, which are crucial for its binding to the WW domains of these ligases (Borna2019Transmembrane). The interaction with these ligases influences their ubiquitination and expression, as demonstrated in experiments using HEK293 cells, where WBP1L was shown to regulate the stability of ITCH and WWP2 ligases (Borna2019Transmembrane).

WBP1L's interaction with NEDD4-family ligases also affects the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Co-expression of WBP1L with CXCR4 leads to increased ubiquitination and reduced protein levels of CXCR4, which is a target of these ligases. This interaction is dependent on the WW domain binding motifs of WBP1L, as mutations in these motifs diminish the effects on CXCR4 (Borna2019Transmembrane). Through these interactions, WBP1L negatively regulates CXCR4 signaling, impacting processes such as hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and leukemia cell survival (Borna2019Transmembrane).
