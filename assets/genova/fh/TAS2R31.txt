# TAS2R31

## Overview
TAS2R31 is a gene that encodes the taste 2 receptor member 31, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the perception of bitter taste. This receptor is part of the TAS2R family, which plays a critical role in detecting bitter compounds, thereby influencing dietary choices and toxin avoidance. The protein encoded by TAS2R31 is characterized by seven transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in agonist selectivity and receptor activation (Brockhoff2010Structural). Beyond its role in taste perception, TAS2R31 is expressed in various extraoral tissues, including the respiratory system, where it may contribute to physiological functions such as smooth muscle relaxation and innate immunity (Lu2017Extraoral). The receptor's interactions with G proteins initiate signal transduction pathways that modulate taste responses, highlighting its importance in both gustatory and non-gustatory processes. Variations in the TAS2R31 gene have been associated with differences in bitterness perception and potential implications for conditions such as obesity and asthma (Archer2019Obesity; OrsmarkPietras2012Transcriptome).

## Structure
TAS2R31 is a member of the TAS2R family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in bitter taste perception. Like other GPCRs, TAS2R31 is characterized by seven transmembrane domains. These domains are crucial for the receptor's function, with specific regions playing significant roles in agonist selectivity and receptor activation. The transmembrane domains, particularly TM6 and TM7, are important for determining agonist specificity, with specific amino acid residues at positions 265 and 268 being key determinants (Brockhoff2010Structural).

The receptor's structure is influenced by the presence of a single agonist binding pocket, which is shared with related receptors such as hTAS2R46. This pocket is located at the extracellular side of the transmembrane domains, involving TM III, V, VI, and VII (Behrens2020StructureFunction). Mutagenesis studies have shown that swapping specific residues between TAS2R31 and other receptors can alter their agonist profiles, indicating the importance of these residues in receptor function (Brockhoff2010Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in TAS2Rs, although specific modifications for TAS2R31 have not been detailed in the available literature (Behrens2020StructureFunction). The receptor's low sequence homology with other GPCRs presents challenges in structural modeling, often resulting in low-resolution models (Behrens2020StructureFunction).

## Function
The TAS2R31 gene encodes a bitter taste receptor that is part of the TAS2R family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the detection of bitter compounds. These receptors are primarily located on taste receptor cells in the tongue, where they play a crucial role in the perception of bitterness, influencing dietary choices and toxin avoidance (Lu2017Extraoral).

In human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, TAS2R31 is one of the highest expressing bitter taste receptors. It is involved in modulating calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) within these cells. TAS2R31, when activated by specific agonists, can inhibit increases in [Ca2+]i induced by procontractile agonists, such as endothelin-1 (ET-1), leading to muscle relaxation. This suggests a potential role in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation, which could be beneficial in treating obstructive lung diseases (CamorettiMercado2015Pleiotropic).

Beyond taste perception, TAS2R31 is expressed in various extraoral tissues, including the respiratory system, where it may contribute to innate immunity and other physiological functions. The receptor's activation leads to intracellular calcium release, triggering diverse cellular responses (Lu2017Extraoral).

## Clinical Significance
The TAS2R31 gene, which encodes a bitter taste receptor, has been implicated in various health conditions due to its role in taste perception and its expression in different tissues. In the context of obesity, TAS2R31 shows reduced expression in obese individuals compared to lean ones, suggesting that obesity may alter the gene expression of type II taste cells, potentially affecting taste perception and dietary choices (Archer2019Obesity). 

Variations in the TAS2R31 gene, such as the Arg35Trp (R35W) polymorphism, have been linked to differences in bitterness perception from sulfonyl amide sweeteners like saccharin and acesulfame potassium. These genetic variations can influence dietary preferences and may have implications for weight management and long-term BMI (Hayes2013Do; Wooding2022Global).

In severe asthma, TAS2R31 expression is upregulated in blood leukocytes, particularly in lymphocytes, suggesting a potential link between TAS2R31 and inflammatory processes in asthma. This upregulation may offer protective roles and serve as a novel therapeutic target for asthma treatment (OrsmarkPietras2012Transcriptome). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TAS2R31 in various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role in health and disease.

## Interactions
TAS2R31, a member of the taste receptor family, is involved in the perception of bitter taste. As a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), TAS2R31 interacts with G proteins to initiate signal transduction pathways. These interactions are crucial for the modulation of taste responses. TAS2R31 may form complexes with other taste receptors, which can influence its function and the overall taste perception process. The receptor's ability to interact with intracellular signaling proteins suggests a role in modulating the intensity and quality of taste signals. These interactions are essential for the receptor's function in detecting and responding to bitter compounds. The precise nature of these interactions, including potential partners and the mechanisms by which they influence taste perception, remains an area of active research. Understanding these interactions is important for comprehending how taste perception is regulated at the molecular level.
