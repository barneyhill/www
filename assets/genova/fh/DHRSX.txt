# DHRSX

## Overview
The DHRSX gene encodes the dehydrogenase/reductase X-linked protein, which is a crucial enzyme involved in the metabolic processes of polyprenol and dolichol conversion. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydrogenase/reductase and plays a significant role in the N-glycosylation pathway by facilitating the synthesis and transfer of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) (Kentache2024The). The DHRSX protein is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, contributing to detoxification and hormone regulation (Kentache2024The). Clinically, alterations in DHRSX expression are associated with various conditions, including stroke, leukemia, and sex chromosome aneuploidies, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Ponomarenko2020Disruptive; Viuff2023X).

## Function
The DHRSX gene encodes a dehydrogenase/reductase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of polyprenol to polyprenal and dolichal to dolichol in healthy human cells. This enzyme is unique because it catalyzes two distinct reactions and has similar affinities for NAD(H) and NADP(H) (Kentache2024The). In the context of N-glycosylation, DHRSX is essential for the proper synthesis and transfer of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs), as dolichol acts as a carrier of monosaccharides and LLOs that are transferred onto proteins during this process (Kentache2024The). The absence of DHRSX leads to a decrease in dolichol and an increase in polyprenol, which perturbs the synthesis and transfer of LLOs, resulting in glycosylation defects (Kentache2024The).

In cellular biology, DHRSX is involved in maintaining normal glycosylation processes, as its absence leads to the accumulation of immature glycan structures and a shift from dolichol to polyprenol as the LLO carrier (Kentache2024The). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to cellular homeostasis by participating in detoxification and hormone regulation (Kentache2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DHRSX gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. Overexpression of DHRSX is identified as a typical marker of stroke in men, particularly during their reproductive age, and is more frequently observed in men than in women. This overexpression is linked to an increased risk of stroke, which can subsequently reduce male reproductive potential (Ponomarenko2020Disruptive). In the context of brain imaging genetics, DHRSX is associated with the grey-white intensity contrast phenotype, primarily driven by male participants, and is up-regulated in the blood of genetic male patients with ischemic stroke (Smith2020Enhanced; Smith2021An).

In pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), DHRSX duplication has been found with high frequency in the high-risk group, suggesting a potential role in leukemia progression (Li2024The). Additionally, DHRSX is implicated in sex chromosome aneuploidies, such as Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), where it is upregulated, and Turner syndrome (45,X), where it is downregulated. These expression changes may contribute to the phenotypic traits associated with these conditions (Viuff2023X). The gene is also biallelically expressed in induced pluripotent stem cells from patients with Klinefelter syndrome, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of this condition (Astro2022Pseudoautosomal).
