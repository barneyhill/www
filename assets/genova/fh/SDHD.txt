# SDHD

## Overview
The SDHD gene encodes the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D, a critical component of the mitochondrial complex II, also known as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). This protein is integral to the electron transport chain and the Krebs cycle, playing a pivotal role in cellular respiration and energy production. As a transmembrane protein, SDHD is part of the hydrophobic membrane anchor that secures the SDH complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (Xekouki2012Succinate; Bandara2021Complex). Mutations in the SDHD gene can lead to significant disruptions in mitochondrial function, contributing to the development of hereditary paraganglioma syndrome type 1 and other pathologies (Eijkelenkamp2019Clinical; Benn201515). The study of SDHD is crucial for understanding its role in both normal cellular metabolism and disease states, particularly in the context of tumorigenesis associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Eijkelenkamp2019Clinical).

## Structure
The SDHD protein is a component of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as mitochondrial complex II, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. Structurally, SDHD is part of the hydrophobic membrane anchor of the complex, which is essential for anchoring the SDH complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane (Xekouki2012Succinate). The SDHD subunit consists of four helices, which are integral to its function in the electron transport process. These helices contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domain, facilitating the binding of ubiquinone, a key component in electron transfer (Xekouki2012Succinate).

Mutations in SDHD can disrupt the binding of ubiquinone, thereby affecting electron transport and the overall function of the respiratory chain. Such mutations often lead to a truncated protein, which can impair the SDH complex's activity and stability (Pasini2007Clinical). The SDHD subunit's structure and function are critical for maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and its disruption is associated with various pathologies, including paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (Cascon2002Identification). The SDHD protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the mitochondrial membrane.

## Function
The SDHD gene encodes a subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), also known as Complex II, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and the Krebs cycle. In healthy human cells, SDHD plays a vital role in cellular respiration and energy production by facilitating the transfer of electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (CoQ) within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Xekouki2012Succinate; Bandara2021Complex). This process is essential for ATP synthesis and maintaining energetic homeostasis in cells (Bandara2021Complex).

SDHD, along with SDHC, anchors Complex II to the inner mitochondrial membrane, ensuring the proper assembly and function of the ETC (Bandara2021Complex). The SDHD subunit specifically contributes to the formation of the membrane anchor and is involved in the binding of ubiquinone, which is essential for electron transport (Xekouki2012Succinate). The proper function of SDHD is critical for maintaining the efficiency of the entire ETC, as its loss can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production (Bandara2021Complex). In summary, SDHD is integral to cellular energy metabolism and growth in healthy cells (Bandara2021Complex).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDHD gene are primarily associated with hereditary paraganglioma syndrome type 1 (PGL1), which is characterized by the development of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. These tumors are often located in the head and neck region, known as head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGL), and are less frequently found in the thoracic-abdominal-pelvic region or as pheochromocytomas (Eijkelenkamp2019Clinical; Benn201515). SDHD mutations are maternally imprinted, meaning the disease typically manifests when the mutation is inherited from the father, which can give the appearance of skipping generations (Taschner2001Nearly; Benn201515).

The SDHD gene mutations are often truncating, such as frameshift or nonsense mutations, which are associated with a higher risk of pheochromocytoma or sympathetic paraganglioma compared to missense mutations (Bayley2005The; Benn201515). The SDHD p.Pro81Leu mutation is specifically noted for its association with HNPGL and a low risk of pheochromocytoma (Astuti2003Genetic; Andrews2018Tumour).

SDHD mutations can also lead to the accumulation of succinate, an oncometabolite, which contributes to tumorigenesis through the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and the induction of pseudohypoxia (Eijkelenkamp2019Clinical). This mechanism is linked to the pathogenesis of various tumors, including renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, although these are less common in SDHD mutation carriers (Eijkelenkamp2019Clinical).

## Interactions
The SDHD gene encodes a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, also known as Complex II, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SDHD, along with SDHC, anchors the SDH complex to the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating electron transfer to ubiquinone (Bandara2021Complex). This anchoring is essential for the proper function of the SDH complex, which is involved in both the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain (Alston2015A).

Mutations in SDHD can disrupt its interactions within the SDH complex, leading to impaired mitochondrial function. For instance, the p.Pro81Leu mutation in SDHD is predicted to alter protein folding and affect ubiquinone binding, potentially allowing partial retention of SDH complex function (Ricketts2010Tumor). This mutation is associated with a distinct phenotype, including a low risk of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma but a higher risk of head and neck paraganglioma (Andrews2018Tumour).

The SDHD subunit's interactions are crucial for maintaining the stability and function of the SDH complex. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to various pathologies, including mitochondrial respiratory deficiencies and certain cancers (Bandara2021Complex).
