# ACOT1

## Overview
ACOT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 1, a member of the Type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, which are part of the esterase-lipase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily located in the cytosol and is involved in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH) (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis). The catalytic activity of acyl-CoA thioesterase 1 is crucial for maintaining the balance of intracellular acyl-CoA and free CoA levels, thereby influencing processes such as fatty acid oxidation and energy homeostasis (Kirkby2010Functional). The gene is located on chromosome 14q24.3 and consists of three exons (Brocker2010Evolutionary). ACOT1's role in lipid metabolism and its differential expression in various cancers highlight its potential significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Wang2018ACOT1; Xu2020AcylCoA).

## Structure
ACOT1, a member of the Type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, is characterized by a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other Type I ACOTs, such as ACOT2, ACOT4, and ACOT6 (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The protein contains an N-terminal acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase domain, which is not directly involved in catalysis but plays a regulatory role in enzyme activity (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The C-terminal region of ACOT1 features an esterase-lipase superfamily domain, also known as the α/β-hydrolase fold, where the catalytic triad of conserved serine, histidine, and aspartate residues is located (Brocker2010Evolutionary). This domain is part of a larger superfamily that includes carboxylesterases and lipases.

The crystalline structure of ACOT2, a closely related protein, suggests that these enzymes are biologically active as monomers, with the N-terminal domain connected to the active site by a long loop, potentially contributing to substrate specificity (Brocker2010Evolutionary). ACOT1 is primarily cytosolic and metabolizes long-chain acyl-CoAs (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The gene encoding ACOT1 is located on chromosome 14q24.3 and contains three exons (Brocker2010Evolutionary). There is no mention of specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for ACOT1 in the provided context.

## Function
ACOT1 (acyl-CoA thioesterase 1) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH) (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis). This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free CoA, impacting processes such as fatty acid oxidation and cellular energy homeostasis (Kirkby2010Functional). ACOT1 is primarily active on long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs, with a preference for substrates ranging from 12 to 20 carbon atoms (Hunt2006Analysis).

The enzyme contains a catalytic triad composed of conserved serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, which are essential for its activity (Brocker2010Evolutionary). ACOT1's activity is significant in maintaining the balance of free and activated fatty acids, which is vital for various cellular processes, including lipid biosynthesis and energy production through the citric acid cycle (Brocker2010Evolutionary). The enzyme's cytosolic localization and substrate specificity suggest it has a non-redundant function in the metabolism of long-chain acyl-CoAs, contributing to the regulation of cellular energy and lipid homeostasis (Brocker2010Evolutionary; Hunt2006Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
ACOT1 (acyl-CoA thioesterase 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric adenocarcinoma, ACOT1 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. The study by Wang et al. suggests that ACOT1 overexpression promotes tumor growth, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric tumors. The research also highlights a potential link between ACOT1 and the Hh signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation, and identifies GLI3 as a potential hub gene of ACOT1 targets (Wang2018ACOT1).

In contrast, ACOT1 is significantly downregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues compared to normal kidney tissues. Despite its downregulation, ACOT1 does not significantly correlate with tumor progression or histological grades in ccRCC, and its clinical significance in this context appears limited (Xu2020AcylCoA). The differential expression of ACOT1 in these cancers underscores its potential role in tumor biology, although its exact mechanisms and interactions in oncogenesis require further investigation.
