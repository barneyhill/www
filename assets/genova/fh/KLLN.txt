# KLLN

## Overview
KLLN is a gene that encodes the protein killin, a p53-regulated DNA replication inhibitor, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Killin is a nuclear protein that binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis and promoting apoptosis, particularly in response to DNA damage (Cho2008Killin). This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing the proliferation of precancerous cells, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (Nizialek2013Germline; Cho2008Killin). The gene's involvement in the DNA damage response and its regulatory role at the G2/M checkpoint underscore its significance in preventing tumorigenesis (Nizialek2013Germline). Alterations in KLLN, such as mutations and epigenetic changes, have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical importance (Sankunny2018KLLNmediated; Bennett2011Germline).

## Function
The KLLN gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a p53-regulated inhibitor of DNA synthesis, playing a critical role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in healthy human cells. KLLN is involved in the DNA damage response pathway, where it acts as a mediator of p53's role in maintaining genomic stability by promoting apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Cho2008Killin). It binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA at replication forks, causing S phase arrest and leading to apoptosis, which is crucial for eliminating replicating precancerous cells (Cho2008Killin).

KLLN also plays a role in cell cycle regulation at the G2/M checkpoint by influencing the expression of CHK1, a key protein in responding to DNA damage and stalled replication (Nizialek2013Germline). This regulation ensures proper cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, preventing tumorigenesis (Nizialek2013Germline). The protein's high affinity for DNA and its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis suggest that KLLN acts as a tumor suppressor, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Nizialek2013Germline; Cho2008Killin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the KLLN gene, including mutations and changes in expression levels, have been linked to several cancers. In breast cancer, somatic deletions of KLLN are found in approximately 21% of cases, with decreased expression correlating with higher tumor grades. These deletions are often associated with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative tumors, indicating a potential role in more aggressive cancer subtypes (Nizialek2013Germline; Sankunny2018KLLNmediated).

KLLN is also implicated in Cowden syndrome, a cancer-predisposition syndrome. Germline promoter hypermethylation of KLLN is observed in individuals with Cowden syndrome who do not have PTEN mutations, increasing the risk of breast, thyroid, endometrial, and kidney cancers (Bennett2011Germline; Nizialek2015KLLN).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), decreased KLLN expression is a significant risk factor. Studies have shown that KLLN mRNA levels are significantly lower in PTC tissues compared to normal thyroid tissues, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (Razavi2021New).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), KLLN is often silenced by germline methylation, which is associated with an increased risk of RCC. This methylation downregulates KLLN expression, and demethylation treatments have been shown to restore its expression in RCC cell lines (Bennett2011Germline).

## Interactions
KLLN (killin) is a protein that interacts with both nucleic acids and other proteins, playing a significant role in DNA replication inhibition and apoptosis. KLLN is a high-affinity DNA-binding protein capable of binding both single- and double-stranded DNA, which is crucial for its function as a DNA synthesis inhibitor and its role in p53-mediated apoptosis (Cho2008Killin). The N-terminal region of KLLN is essential for its DNA-binding ability and its inhibitory effects on DNA replication (Cho2008Killin).

KLLN also interacts with various proteins involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. It has been shown to interact with DBC1, a nuclear protein involved in the DNA damage response, which is linked to the regulation of p53 acetylation (Sankunny2018KLLNmediated). KLLN may regulate p53 activation through its interaction with TRIM25, an E3 ligase known to modulate p53 signaling (Sankunny2018KLLNmediated). Additionally, KLLN binds to the CHK1 promoter, indicating a direct regulatory role in cell cycle regulation (Nizialek2013Germline). These interactions highlight KLLN's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and regulating apoptosis.
