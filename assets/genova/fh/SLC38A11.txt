# SLC38A11

## Overview
SLC38A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 11, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transporters. This protein functions as a transmembrane transporter, primarily facilitating the movement of amino acids across cell membranes. It plays a significant role in cellular metabolism, particularly within the central nervous system, where it is predominantly active. The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, which is essential for neurotransmitter regulation and neuronal function. The gene's involvement in neurological processes and its potential implications in various disorders highlight its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Nickel2018Heterozygous; Wach2019RNA).

## Structure


## Function
SLC38A11 is a member of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in the transport of amino acids across cell membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by facilitating the uptake of amino acids, which are essential for various metabolic processes. In healthy human cells, SLC38A11 is primarily active in the brain, where it contributes significantly to maintaining amino acid homeostasis. This function is vital for supporting neuronal function and ensuring the proper regulation of neurotransmitters, which are critical for communication between neurons.

The activity of SLC38A11 in the brain underscores its importance in the central nervous system, where it helps to regulate the availability of amino acids necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis. By maintaining the balance of amino acids, SLC38A11 supports the overall metabolic health of neurons, which is essential for cognitive functions and neural signaling. The transport activity of SLC38A11 is integral to the cellular processes that sustain neuronal health and function, highlighting its role in the broader context of organismal homeostasis and brain function.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC38A11 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several neurological conditions. A case report described a 28-year-old male patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Tourette syndrome who had a heterozygous deletion on chromosome 2q24.3, which includes the SLC38A11 gene. This deletion, along with others affecting genes like SCN2A and SCN3A, may contribute to the patient's symptoms, suggesting a potential role for SLC38A11 in these disorders (Nickel2018Heterozygous).

In the context of cancer, SLC38A11 has been identified as significantly downregulated in collecting duct renal cell carcinoma (CDC) samples compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is part of a broader pattern of dysregulated solute carrier genes in CDC, although the specific clinical implications of SLC38A11 downregulation in this cancer type remain unclear (Wach2019RNA).

Overall, while SLC38A11 is associated with certain neurological and cancer-related conditions, further research is needed to clarify its precise role and potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker.
