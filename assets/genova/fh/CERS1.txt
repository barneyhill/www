# CERS1

## Overview
CERS1, or ceramide synthase 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ceramide synthase 1, which plays a pivotal role in sphingolipid metabolism. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the synthesis of C18 ceramide, a specific type of sphingolipid that is integral to cell membrane structure and function, as well as various cellular signaling pathways (Mullen2012Ceramide). Ceramide synthase 1 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its six transmembrane domains and localization predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (Stiban2010Ceramide; Mullen2012Ceramide). The activity of ceramide synthase 1 is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its subcellular localization and function (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). Mutations in the CERS1 gene have been associated with neurological disorders, including progressive myoclonus epilepsy, highlighting its critical role in brain function and development (Dubot2019Inherited).

## Structure
Ceramide synthase 1 (CERS1) is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of C18 ceramide, a specific type of sphingolipid. The primary structure of CERS1 is encoded by the CERS1 gene, which produces two transcript variants. The long variant encodes the full protein, while the short variant lacks the last 13 amino acids, though this truncation does not affect the protein's activity (Mullen2012Ceramide). CERS1 is characterized by the presence of the Lag1p motif within the Tram-Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide).

CERS1 is predicted to have six transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytosol (Stiban2010Ceramide; Mullen2012Ceramide). The enzyme is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, with some evidence of Golgi localization under stress conditions (Sridevi2010Stressinduced; Mullen2012Ceramide). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, regulate CERS1 activity and its translocation from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Stiban2010Ceramide; Park2014Ceramide). CERS1 does not contain a Hox-like domain, which is present in other ceramide synthases (Stiban2010Ceramide).

## Function
CERS1 (ceramide synthase 1) is a key enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, primarily involved in the synthesis of C18 ceramide by linking C18 fatty acids to sphingosine. This enzyme is highly selective for C18:0-CoA as a substrate, which is crucial for the production of specific sphingolipids that are integral components of cell membranes and play roles in signaling pathways (Mullen2012Ceramide). CERS1 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, although it can translocate to the Golgi apparatus under certain stress conditions, which is essential for its function in ceramide synthesis (Mullen2012Ceramide).

In skeletal muscle, CERS1 is involved in regulating mitochondrial function and fatty acid metabolism. Inhibition of CERS1 has been shown to enhance mitochondrial oxidative capacity and fatty acid oxidation, suggesting its role in energy expenditure and fat metabolism (Turner2018A). Despite its involvement in these processes, CERS1's role in insulin sensitivity appears to be less significant compared to other ceramide synthase isoforms in liver and adipose tissue (Turner2018A). CERS1 also plays a role in maintaining the balance and composition of sphingolipids, which are essential for normal cellular function and homeostasis (Mullen2012Ceramide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CERS1 gene, which encodes ceramide synthase 1, have been linked to a rare form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), particularly in a family of Algerian origin. This condition is characterized by severe myoclonic syndrome, frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. The specific mutation identified is c.549C > G, p.H183Q, which affects the biosynthesis of C18-ceramide, primarily expressed in the brain (Dubot2019Inherited). In mouse models, mutations in Cers1 result in a complete loss of CerS1 activity, leading to neurodegenerative symptoms such as impaired locomotion and motor coordination, indicating a critical role for CerS1 in brain development and function (Dubot2019Inherited).

CERS1 is also implicated in non-tumor-related diseases. Its deficiency can lead to progressive myoclonic epilepsy of type 8. Additionally, CERS1-derived C18-ceramide in skeletal muscle can promote insulin resistance caused by obesity (Qian2020Ceramide). In Parkinson's disease, alterations in ceramide acyl chain length and CerS1 expression have been observed, suggesting a compensatory response to reduced ceramide levels, which may affect membrane function and signaling pathways (Abbott2013Altered).
