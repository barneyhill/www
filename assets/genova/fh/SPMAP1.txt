# SPMAP1

## Overview
SPMAP1 is a gene that encodes the sperm microtubule associated protein 1, a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of microtubules within sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the proper assembly and stabilization of microtubules, thereby facilitating sperm motility and fertility. The SPMAP1 gene is expressed predominantly in the testes, where it contributes to the regulation of microtubule dynamics during spermatogenesis. Mutations or dysregulation of SPMAP1 have been implicated in male infertility, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
