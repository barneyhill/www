# PPP1R13L

## Overview
The PPP1R13L gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 13 like, commonly referred to as iASPP. This protein is a crucial regulatory component of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a significant role in modulating apoptosis and cell survival. As a member of the Apoptosis Stimulating Proteins of p53 (ASPP) family, iASPP is characterized by its conserved structural domains, including ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, and a proline-rich region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins (Laska2009Enforced). iASPP primarily functions as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby influencing cellular responses to genotoxic stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Laska2010p53). Its regulatory activities extend to interactions with the NF-κB signaling pathway, further underscoring its role in inflammation and tumorigenesis (Laska2009Enforced). Mutations in PPP1R13L have been associated with various cardiac conditions and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression (Falik‐Zaccai2017Sequence; Robinson2020Biallelic).

## Function
PPP1R13L, also known as iASPP, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in modulating apoptosis and cell survival. In healthy human cells, PPP1R13L acts as a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing unnecessary apoptosis. This regulation occurs through direct binding, which compromises p53's accumulation and activity following DNA damage (Laska2010p53). PPP1R13L is involved in a feedback loop with p53, where its expression is induced by p53 activation in response to genotoxic stress, and it subsequently inhibits p53 activity, thus modulating the stress response (Laska2010p53).

PPP1R13L is active in the nucleus and is part of the Apoptosis Stimulating Proteins of p53 (ASPP) family, which includes ASPP1 and ASPP2. These proteins are characterized by a conserved carboxyl terminus with ankyrin repeats, an SH3 domain, and a proline-rich region (Laska2009Enforced). In non-transformed cells, PPP1R13L functions as a tumor suppressor, helping to regulate p53's activity and maintain cellular equilibrium (Laska2010p53). Its role in epithelial homeostasis and stratification further underscores its importance in normal cellular processes (Toonen2012Waved).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP1R13L gene, which encodes the inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP), have been linked to several cardiac conditions. These include a novel form of cardio-cutaneous syndrome (CCS) and pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In CCS, mutations such as a homozygous premature stop codon lead to the loss of iASPP expression, resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, contributing to dilated cardiomyopathy and mild skin manifestations (Falik‐Zaccai2017Sequence). In pediatric DCM, biallelic variants in PPP1R13L have been identified as causative, with mutations leading to loss-of-function of the iASPP protein, which is crucial for apoptosis regulation and inflammatory pathways (Robinson2020Biallelic).

A novel homozygous stop-gain variant in PPP1R13L has also been associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), characterized by severe biventricular systolic dysfunction and fibrosis. This mutation results in a truncated protein, disrupting normal function and contributing to the disease phenotype (Kalayinia2022Novel).

Alterations in PPP1R13L expression have been implicated in cancer progression. Overexpression of PPP1R13L enhances tumorigenesis and invasion through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms, promoting tumor growth and resistance to apoptosis-inducing drugs (Laska2009Enforced).

## Interactions
PPP1R13L, also known as iASPP, is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as apoptosis and tumorigenesis. It interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA, inhibiting its transcriptional activity, which plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses and cell survival (Laska2009Enforced). PPP1R13L also binds to the tumor suppressor protein p53, inhibiting its pro-apoptotic functions and promoting its degradation, which can lead to enhanced tumorigenic potential and resistance to apoptosis in transformed cells (Laska2009Enforced).

In the context of cancer, PPP1R13L overexpression has been shown to accelerate tumor formation and increase metastasis, partly by depleting active p65/RelA and p53 in p53 wild-type cells (Laska2009Enforced). This suggests that PPP1R13L may target these proteins for proteasome degradation, thereby influencing both p53-dependent and independent pathways (Laska2009Enforced).

Additionally, PPP1R13L is identified as a novel target gene of the NF-κB protein family, indicating its potential role in obesity-related syndromes through its interactions with NF-κB (Sabir2019Identification). These interactions highlight PPP1R13L's role in modulating cellular stress responses and its potential impact on disease progression.
