# ZNF669

## Overview
ZNF669 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 669, which is part of a large family of proteins characterized by their zinc finger motifs, known for binding DNA and regulating gene expression. The protein plays a crucial role in modulating NF-κB signaling pathways, which are essential for cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis (Schmidt2024Serum). ZNF669 is also involved in the incorporation of Alu elements, which can modify the protein structure, although the functional implications of this modification are not fully understood (MartinezGomez2019Few). The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor and is involved in gene fusions with high oncogenic potential (ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide). Despite its involvement in significant genetic alterations, the precise clinical significance of ZNF669 remains to be fully elucidated, particularly in the context of its role in genomic stability and disease pathogenesis (Li2023Specific).

## Function
ZNF669 is a zinc finger protein that is part of a family known for its role in DNA binding and gene regulation. In healthy human cells, ZNF669 is involved in modulating NF-κB signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. This modulation can occur through the repression or activation of transcription factor activity, potentially influencing the expression of genes involved in these pathways (Schmidt2024Serum).

The protein is also associated with the incorporation of Alu elements, which can extend the C-terminal of the resulting protein, adding 22 amino acids to the stop codon. This incorporation is noted in the main coding isoform of ZNF669, although the specific functional implications of this modification in healthy cells remain unclear (MartinezGomez2019Few).

ZNF669 has been identified as having recurrent missense mutations in certain pathological conditions, suggesting a potential role in maintaining genomic stability. However, its precise function in normal cellular processes, such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, is not fully detailed in the available literature (Li2023Specific).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF669 has been implicated in various diseases, primarily through its involvement in gene fusions and mutations. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the ZNF669:ZNF136 fusion has been identified as having high oncogenic potential. ZNF669 is characterized as a tumor suppressor gene, and its involvement in multiple gene fusions suggests a significant role in cancer initiation and progression (ILNYTSKYY2023Genomewide).

In the context of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT), ZNF669 was identified as one of the top 10 significantly mutated genes, with recurrent missense mutations observed in patients. The specific mutation, c.331C>G, resulting in p.Q111E, was predicted to be deleterious by SIFT but benign by PolyPhen-2. Despite these findings, the study did not provide detailed information on the clinical significance of these mutations (Li2023Specific). Additionally, the expression of ZNF669 in hyperplastic parathyroids was comparable to that in blood samples, suggesting no significant role in THPT pathogenesis (Li2023Specific).

Overall, while ZNF669 is involved in significant genetic alterations in certain cancers, its precise clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
