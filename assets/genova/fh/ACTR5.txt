# ACTR5

## Overview
ACTR5, or actin-related protein 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the actin-related protein family, which is structurally similar to conventional actin. The protein product, actin-related protein 5, is a critical component of chromatin remodeling complexes, particularly the INO80 complex, where it plays a vital role in DNA-templated processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and replication. As part of the Arp5-Ies6 module, actin-related protein 5 is essential for ATP hydrolysis and nucleosome sliding, contributing to the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure (Yao2015Assembly). The protein's involvement in histone variant exchange and its influence on gene expression underscore its importance in maintaining genomic stability. Alterations in the ACTR5 gene have been linked to cancer, highlighting its significance in genomic integrity and potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
ACTR5 (actin-related protein 5) is a member of the actin-related protein family, which shares structural similarities with conventional actin. The primary structure of ACTR5 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function and interaction with other proteins. In terms of secondary structure, ACTR5 includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of ACTR5 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling complexes. This folding allows ACTR5 to interact with other proteins and DNA, facilitating its function in the cell. The quaternary structure of ACTR5 refers to its assembly into larger protein complexes, which are essential for its activity in chromatin remodeling.

ACTR5 may contain specific domains, such as the actin fold, which is characteristic of proteins in the actin-related family. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of ACTR5 by altering its activity or interactions with other molecules. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of ACTR5 may exist, potentially modifying its structure and function to adapt to different cellular contexts.

## Function
ACTR5, also known as actin-related protein 5, is a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in various DNA-templated processes such as transcription, DNA repair, and replication. Within the INO80 complex, ACTR5 is part of the Arp5-Ies6 module, which is essential for chromatin remodeling activities, including ATP hydrolysis and nucleosome sliding (Yao2015Assembly). The Arp5-Ies6 module is located at the catalytic center of the INO80 complex, near the RecA ATPase domain and the Rvb1-Rvb2 helicase module, which are critical for its ATPase activity (Yao2015Assembly).

ACTR5 is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and maintains genomic stability. It is involved in the exchange of histone variants, such as replacing the Htz1 histone variant with canonical H2A, a process dependent on the Arp5-Ies6 module (Yao2015Assembly). The presence of ACTR5 is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the INO80 complex, as its deletion leads to reduced association with chromatin and decreased cellular fitness (Yao2015Assembly). These activities underscore its importance in maintaining proper chromatin structure and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ACTR5 gene, which encodes actin-related protein 5, have been implicated in the development of cancer. ACTR5 is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in DNA repair and the regulation of gene expression. Disruptions in the normal function of this complex due to changes in ACTR5 can lead to aberrant gene expression and genomic instability, both of which are key factors in oncogenesis. The precise mechanisms by which ACTR5 alterations contribute to cancer are not fully understood, but they are believed to involve the disruption of chromatin remodeling processes that are essential for maintaining genomic integrity and proper cellular function. As such, ACTR5 is considered a significant factor in the study of cancer biology, with potential implications for the development of targeted therapies that address these chromatin remodeling defects.
