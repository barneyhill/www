# B4GALNT3

## Overview
B4GALNT3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 3, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycan structures on glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in the glycosylation process by transferring N-acetylgalactosamine to N-acetylglucosamine residues, forming LacdiNAc structures that are important for various cellular functions, including cell signaling and immune response (Hsu2011B4GALNT3). The activity of beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 3 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies proteins such as SorLA/LR11, influencing intracellular trafficking and cellular communication (Ho2016Protein). B4GALNT3 has been implicated in several cancers, where it can function as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor, depending on the context, highlighting its complex role in human health and disease (Hsu2011B4GALNT3; Costa2015New).

## Function
B4GALNT3 encodes the enzyme β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase III, which is involved in the synthesis of GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc, also known as LacdiNAc or LDN. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues on glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process crucial for glycosylation (Hsu2011B4GALNT3). Glycosylation is essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response. B4GALNT3 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies glycoproteins such as SorLA/LR11, which is expressed by neurons and involved in intracellular trafficking (Ho2016Protein).

The enzyme's activity influences cellular processes by modifying the glycosylation patterns of proteins, which can affect their function and interactions. In particular, B4GALNT3's role in adding LacdiNAc structures to glycoproteins is significant for the regulation of cell signaling pathways, such as those mediated by β1 integrin. This modification can alter integrin-mediated signaling, impacting cell migration and invasion, which are critical processes in both normal physiology and disease states (Hsu2011B4GALNT3). While the specific role of B4GALNT3 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in glycosylation suggests it plays a part in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
B4GALNT3 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a novel gene fusion involving B4GALNT3, specifically the WNK1-B4GALNT3 fusion, has been identified. This fusion is associated with overexpression of B4GALNT3, suggesting a potential oncogenic role in PTC (Costa2015New). In colorectal cancer, B4GALNT3 acts as an oncogene, enhancing the malignant phenotype through integrin and MAPK signaling, and its expression is linked to metastasis and poor survival (Costa2015New).

Conversely, in neuroblastoma, B4GALNT3 functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, as it suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through β1 integrin signaling (Hsu2011B4GALNT3). In pancreatic cancer, B4GALNT3 is overexpressed, with studies indicating its potential role in cancer pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic intervention (Gupta2020Global). These findings highlight the complex role of B4GALNT3 in cancer, acting as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type.
