# OR11H12

## Overview
OR11H12 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 12, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the vast diversity of olfactory detection mechanisms (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR11H12 has been implicated in various biological processes, including potential involvement in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where it is upregulated (Chen2016Expression). However, the precise functions of OR11H12 in non-olfactory tissues and its broader physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Function
OR11H12 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR11H12 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

In the context of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), OR11H12 has been identified as one of the odorant/olfactory receptor-related genes that are upregulated. The study by Chen et al. found that OR11H12 was among the top differentially expressed genes, with a significant fold-change, suggesting a potential role in PTSD. However, the specific function of OR11H12 in healthy human cells remains unclear, as the study did not provide detailed functional analysis of this receptor in non-pathological conditions (Chen2016Expression).

Olfactory receptors, including OR11H12, are not only involved in the sense of smell but also play roles in various biological processes such as cell proliferation and migration in non-olfactory tissues, although specific activities of OR11H12 in these processes have not been detailed (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).
