# LRRC2

## Overview
The LRRC2 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 2, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial and cardiac functions. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat structure, a common motif in proteins that participate in signal transduction pathways, suggesting its role in protein-protein interactions (Kiss2002The). LRRC2 is localized to the mitochondria and is transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, indicating its involvement in modulating mitochondrial abundance and cardiomyocyte growth (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). The protein is implicated in cardiac remodeling, particularly in hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, and is associated with the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). While its expression is highest in skeletal muscle, the specific functions of LRRC2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Function
The LRRC2 gene encodes a protein that is involved in mitochondrial and cardiac function. It is localized to the mitochondria and is transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). LRRC2 plays a role in modulating mitochondrial abundance and cardiomyocyte growth, acting as a dampener of mitochondrial biogenesis and a positive regulator of cardiac hypertrophy by modulating PGC-1α activity (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). The protein is associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting its involvement in cardiac remodeling (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide).

In terms of cellular processes, LRRC2 is part of a highly intra-correlated mitochondrial transcript population, indicating its significant role in mitochondrial function (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). It is also involved in protein-protein interactions, as suggested by its leucine-rich repeat structure, which is common in proteins that participate in signal transduction pathways (Kiss2002The). The protein's expression is highest in skeletal muscle, where it may play a role in muscle differentiation or function (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). However, the specific function of LRRC2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
LRRC2 has been implicated in various cardiac conditions, particularly in the context of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Alterations in LRRC2 expression are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The gene is transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1α, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and its expression is elevated in hypertrophic settings, correlating with MYH7, a heart failure biomarker (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). Suppression of LRRC2 in cardiomyocytes leads to transcriptional changes associated with hypertrophy and increased mitochondrial mass, suggesting its role in the reactivation of the fetal gene program and modulation of cardiomyocyte growth (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide).

LRRC2's involvement in cardiac remodeling and its potential as a therapeutic target in heart failure and type 2 diabetes, where mitochondrial function is compromised, has been proposed. However, the exact mechanisms by which LRRC2 affects mitochondrial biogenesis and its clinical significance in terms of specific mutations remain to be fully elucidated (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). The gene's expression is also noted to be higher in skeletal muscle compared to the heart, indicating tissue-specific roles that may influence its clinical implications (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

## Interactions
LRRC2 is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial and cardiac processes. It is transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting a role in modulating mitochondrial abundance and cardiomyocyte growth (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). The study by McDermott-Roe et al. indicates a potential protein-protein interaction between LRRC2 and PGC-1α, which may influence the hypertrophic response by modulating PGC-1α's auto-regulation (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide).

LRRC2 is also associated with the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. Knockdown experiments in cardiomyocytes have shown that loss of LRRC2 leads to increased expression of hypertrophic biomarkers and mitochondrial mass, indicating its role in cardiac remodeling (Ke2022Construction; McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide). This suggests that LRRC2 may participate in a feedback mechanism that modulates mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte growth, potentially through interactions with other mitochondrial proteins (McDermottRoe2017Transcriptomewide).

While specific protein interactions of LRRC2 are not detailed extensively, its involvement in these pathways highlights its significance in mitochondrial and cardiac function, warranting further investigation into its interaction network.
