# EHD1

## Overview
EHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein EH domain containing 1, which is a member of the EHD protein family involved in endocytic recycling and membrane remodeling. The EHD1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal G-domain, which binds ATP, and a C-terminal EH domain, a protein interaction module that binds to specific motifs on target proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the trafficking and recycling of membrane proteins and lipids, facilitating their return to the cell surface. EHD1 is involved in both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways and interacts with various components of the endocytic machinery, including Rab11 and Rab11-FIP2, to regulate the distribution of the endocytic recycling compartment. Its function is conserved across species, highlighting its essential role in cellular homeostasis and receptor recycling (Grant2008Mechanisms; Naslavsky2005Cterminal; George2007Shared).

## Structure
EHD1 is a protein involved in endocytic recycling and is part of the EHD protein family, which is associated with membrane remodeling. The protein contains an N-terminal G-domain that binds ATP and a C-terminal EH domain, which is a protein interaction module binding to target proteins through motifs such as NPF, DPF, and GPF (Kieken2009Structural; Henry2010Charge). The EH domain consists of two helix-loop-helix structures connected by an antiparallel β-sheet, forming a pocket for peptide binding (Yu2015Molecular; Kieken2009Structural).

The EHD1 protein can form a dimer, with the G-domain forming the bulk of the interface and the EH domain interacting with the G-domain to prevent guanine nucleotide binding (Henry2010Charge). The EH domain's binding pocket is narrower and more positively charged compared to other EH domains, influencing its ligand binding preferences (Kieken2009Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, with specific residues contributing to binding affinity (Yu2015Molecular; Kieken2009Structural).

EHD1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and may have splice variant isoforms that affect its function. These structural features are crucial for its role in endocytic transport and receptor recycling (Henry2010Charge).

## Function
EHD1 (EH domain containing 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in endocytic recycling, a process essential for the trafficking of membrane proteins and lipids back to the cell surface. EHD1 is involved in the recycling of transmembrane cargo internalized by both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent mechanisms, including the transferrin receptor, major histocompatibility complex class I, and β1 integrins (Grant2008Mechanisms). It regulates the distribution of the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) and controls the exit of transferrin and its receptor from the ERC (Naslavsky2005Cterminal). EHD1 interacts with Rab11, a key player in recycling pathways, and Rab11-FIP2, facilitating endosomal recycling through EH-NPF interactions (George2007Shared).

EHD1 is localized to endocytic structures and interacts with components of the endocytic machinery, such as the clathrin heavy-chain and AP-2 (Naslavsky2005Cterminal). It is active in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with tubular endosomal structures, and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper receptor recycling and distribution of membrane proteins (Grant2008Mechanisms). EHD1's function is conserved across species, as demonstrated by its ability to rescue endocytic trafficking defects in C. elegans mutants (George2007Shared).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the EHD1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In Ewing Sarcoma, a type of cancer, EHD1 is overexpressed in nearly 90% of patients, particularly in metastatic tumors, and is associated with shorter patient survival. This overexpression is crucial for the trafficking of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) to the cell surface, promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. Targeting EHD1 could offer therapeutic opportunities in treating Ewing Sarcoma and similar malignancies (Chakraborty2023EHD1dependent).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EHD1 is linked to resistance against epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and is associated with cancer stem cell-like properties. High EHD1 expression correlates with poor response to EGFR-TKI therapy and shorter progression-free survival. Knockdown of EHD1 increases sensitivity to erlotinib, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2018NFκBdriven).

EHD1 mutations have also been associated with male infertility. A missense mutation (p.R398W) in EHD1 is linked to defective spermatogenesis, leading to severe testicular abnormalities and infertility in male mice, suggesting similar implications in humans (Meindl2023A).

## Interactions
EHD1 (EH domain containing 1) is involved in various protein interactions critical for endocytic trafficking and recycling processes. It interacts with the retromer complex and proteins such as MICAL-L1, rabankyrin-5, and syndapin 2 (PACSIN2), forming a 'scission complex' that facilitates the fission of retromer-containing vesicles at early endosomes (EEs) (Naslavsky2018The). EHD1's ATPase activity is thought to induce fission in a manner similar to dynamin 2, contributing to the formation of tubulo-vesicular carriers (Naslavsky2018The).

EHD1 also interacts with Rab11FIP2, an effector of Rab11, through its asparagine-proline-phenylalanine (NPF) motifs, which is essential for transporting receptors from EEs to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) (Naslavsky2018The). It cooperates with MICAL-L1 and CRMP2 to control dynein-mediated transport of transferrin receptor-containing endosomes (Naslavsky2018The).

In the context of a tubular network, EHD1 is associated with Myosin Vb and Rab8a, indicating its role in the recycling of clathrin-independent proteins (Roland2007Myosin). This network does not include Rab11a, highlighting distinct recycling pathways involving EHD1 (Roland2007Myosin).
