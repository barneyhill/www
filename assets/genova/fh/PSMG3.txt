# PSMG3

## Overview
PSMG3, or proteasome assembly chaperone 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the assembly of the 20S proteasome, a critical component of the proteasome complex responsible for protein degradation. The PSMG3 protein functions as a chaperone, specifically facilitating the formation and stabilization of the α-ring of the 20S proteasome by interacting with subunits such as α5 and α6. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and function of the proteasome, which plays a vital role in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes (Rousseau2018Regulation; Zhang2024Structural). PSMG3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, underscoring its importance in cellular health and disease. The gene's expression and its associated non-coding RNA, PSMG3-AS1, have been implicated in several cancers and congenital heart defects, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sewda2019Genebased; Cui2019Novel).

## Function
PSMG3, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 3, plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of the 20S proteasome, a core component of the proteasome complex responsible for protein degradation. PSMG3 is involved in the formation and stabilization of the α-ring of the 20S proteasome. It functions as part of a heterodimer with PAC4, interacting specifically with the α5 and α6 subunits of the α-ring. This interaction is essential for the stabilization and proper assembly of the α-ring, which is a critical step in the formation of the 20S proteasome (Zhang2024Structural).

PSMG3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it facilitates the assembly of proteasome subunits, ensuring the correct formation of the proteasome complex. This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and controlling various cellular processes. The assembly of the 20S proteasome involves multiple chaperones, including PSMG3, which helps prevent premature dimerization of α-rings and ensures the proper maturation of the proteasome (Rousseau2018Regulation). Understanding the function of PSMG3 in healthy human cells is important for insights into proteasome assembly and its implications in cellular health and disease (Adolf2024Visualizing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSMG3 gene have been implicated in various cancer types. In breast cancer, PSMG3-AS1, a long non-coding RNA associated with PSMG3, is upregulated and acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-143-3p. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a role in breast cancer progression (Cui2019Novel). In lung adenocarcinoma, PSMG3-AS1 is also upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes. It interacts with miR-449b-5p, which targets PSMG3-AS1 to suppress cancer cell proliferation (Yue2020MiR449b5p). In lung squamous cell carcinoma, PSMG3-AS1 is linked to advanced disease stages and poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Jin2021Expression).

PSMG3 is also overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is inversely correlated with miR-143-3p, suggesting that miR-143-3p targets PSMG3-AS1 to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (Zhang2020&lt; miR1433p; p&gt). Beyond cancer, PSMG3 has been identified as a candidate gene associated with conotruncal heart defects, a subgroup of congenital heart defects, highlighting its potential role in heart development (Sewda2019Genebased). These findings suggest that PSMG3 and its associated non-coding RNA, PSMG3-AS1, may serve as potential therapeutic targets in various diseases.

## Interactions
PSMG3, also known as proteasome assembly chaperone 3, is involved in the assembly of the 20S proteasome complex. It interacts with the 20S subunit α5 (PSMA5), a relationship predicted based on the structure of their yeast homologues. This interaction is part of a broader analysis of proteasome assembly chaperones and their evolutionary divergence between humans and yeast (Postic2020Probing). The interaction between PSMG3 and PSMA5 is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the proteasome, which plays a significant role in protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

The study by Postic et al. highlights the use of structural data integration and proteomics to predict these interactions, emphasizing the importance of such methodologies in understanding the complex network of protein interactions within the human proteome (Postic2020Probing). While the specific interactions of PSMG3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available context, the interaction with PSMA5 underscores its role in the proteasome assembly process. The integration of structural data and proteomics provides a more comprehensive understanding of these interactions, although challenges such as false positives and negatives in predictions remain (Postic2020Probing).
