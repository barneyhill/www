# HIGD2B

## Overview
HIGD2B is a gene that encodes the protein HIG1 hypoxia inducible domain family member 2B, which is involved in cellular responses to hypoxic conditions. The protein is categorized as a mitochondrial protein and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function under low oxygen levels. It is part of the HIG1 domain family, which is known for its involvement in the regulation of cellular metabolism and survival during hypoxia. The expression of HIGD2B is upregulated in response to hypoxic stress, suggesting its importance in adaptive cellular mechanisms. The protein's function and interactions are significant in understanding various physiological and pathological processes, including its potential implications in diseases characterized by impaired oxygen homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
