# BCORL1

## Overview
BCORL1 (BCL6 corepressor like 1) is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes a transcriptional corepressor protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The BCORL1 protein, also known as BCoR-L1, is characterized by its role in transcriptional repression through interactions with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP), which are essential for its function in modifying chromatin structure (Pagan2007A; Lose2007BCoRL1). The protein is expressed at low levels across various tissues, with higher expression in reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate (Pagan2007A). BCORL1 is involved in the assembly of the non-canonical Polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1.1), highlighting its significance in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (Wong2020Structure; Wong2016KDM2B). Mutations in the BCORL1 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, underscoring its clinical importance (Gafner2021Major; Schaefer2022BCOR).

## Structure
The BCORL1 protein, also known as BCoR-L1, is a corepressor involved in transcriptional repression. It is composed of 1711 amino acids, with an alternatively spliced isoform, BCoR-L1a, that includes an additional exon, resulting in a length of 1785 amino acids (Pagan2007A). The protein contains several structural features, including a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and tandem ankyrin repeats (ANK), which are likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Pagan2007A). It also possesses a PXDLS motif for binding the CtBP corepressor and two LXXLL motifs for nuclear receptor recruitment (Pagan2007A).

BCORL1 lacks identifiable DNA-binding domains but shares homology with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage repair, such as BCoR and BARD1 (Pagan2007A). The predominant isoform detected in cells is the one lacking exon 9, as shown by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analysis (Pagan2007A). The protein is expressed at low levels in many tissues, with the highest expression in the testis and prostate (Pagan2007A). The structure of BCORL1 does not include detailed information on primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures in the available context.

## Function
BCORL1 (BCL6 corepressor like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression. In healthy human cells, BCORL1 functions primarily as a transcription corepressor, interacting with other proteins to form complexes that modify chromatin structure and regulate gene expression. It operates by associating with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the CtBP corepressor, which are involved in transcription repression (Lose2007BCoRL1). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating DNA damage repair processes, as BCORL1 interacts with BRCA1, a multifunctional tumor suppressor involved in these pathways (Lose2007BCoRL1).

BCORL1 is expressed ubiquitously at low levels across various tissues, including breast tissue, with higher expression in reproductive tissues such as the prostate and testes (Lose2007BCoRL1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it plays a role in cell differentiation and development by repressing target genes through its interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes. This repression is essential for regulating cell growth pathways and maintaining proper cellular function (Lose2007BCoRL1). The gene is located on the X chromosome and is subject to X inactivation, which may influence its expression in different tissues (Lose2007BCoRL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCORL1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In neurodevelopment, BCORL1 mutations have been linked to major brain malformations such as corpus callosum dysgenesis, agenesis of the septum pellucidum, and polymicrogyria. These conditions are often observed in patients with neonatal onset intractable epilepsy and profound global developmental delay. BCORL1 variants are also implicated in Shukla-Vernon syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and behavioral abnormalities (Gafner2021Major; Muthusamy2021ShuklaVernon).

In oncology, BCORL1 mutations are found in myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These mutations often result in truncated proteins due to nonsense mutations, splice site mutations, or out-of-frame insertions or deletions, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for BCORL1. The mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases by disrupting the PRC1.1 complex, leading to the derepression of oncogenic pathways (Li2011Somatic; Schaefer2022BCOR). BCORL1 alterations are also noted in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas, where they define a distinct subset of these aggressive tumors (Lin2021Clinicopathological).

## Interactions
BCORL1 (BCL6 corepressor like 1) is a transcriptional corepressor that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. BCORL1 interacts with Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, which are involved in its function as a transcriptional repressor (Pagan2007A). It also interacts with the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) through a CtBP-interacting motif, and this interaction is crucial for its repressive activity. Mutation of the CtBP-binding site impairs BCORL1's ability to repress transcription (Pagan2007A).

BCORL1 is involved in the assembly of the non-canonical Polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1.1) by interacting with PCGF1 through its PUFD domain. This interaction is essential for recruiting KDM2B, a histone demethylase, to the complex (Wong2020Structure; Wong2016KDM2B). The PUFD domain of BCORL1 is necessary for forming a stable complex with PCGF1 and KDM2B, highlighting its role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (Wong2020Structure; Junco2013Structure). These interactions underscore BCORL1's involvement in transcriptional repression and its potential impact on gene expression regulation.
