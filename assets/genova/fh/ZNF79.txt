# ZNF79

## Overview
ZNF79 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 79, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to DNA and contribute to its role in transcriptional repression. ZNF79 is notable for its atypical subcellular localization, being predominantly cytoplasmic and enriched in the nucleolus, suggesting a potential involvement in translation regulation and interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex (Helleboid2019The). Additionally, ZNF79 has been implicated in bone health, as it is upregulated in monocytes of osteoporotic patients, indicating a possible role in bone mineral density regulation (Li2019Integrative). Despite its weak recruitment of the corepressor KAP1, ZNF79's diverse interactions and functions underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes (Helleboid2019The).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF79 is a zinc finger protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning in the regulation of gene expression. It is part of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression and interaction with transposable elements. ZNF79 has been identified as a weak recruiter of the corepressor KAP1, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation through chromatin modification (Helleboid2019The).

In terms of subcellular localization, ZNF79 exhibits an unusual pattern, being predominantly cytoplasmic and enriched in the nucleolus. This localization suggests a role in translation regulation, as its interactome includes several subunits of the translation-promoting eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) (Helleboid2019The). The protein's interactions with components related to nucleosome formation and modification, as well as cytoplasmic chaperones, further indicate its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein synthesis.

ZNF79 is also implicated in the regulation of bone mineral density, as it is one of the upregulated genes in monocytes of osteoporotic patients, indicating a potential role in bone health and metabolic processes (Li2019Integrative). These functions highlight ZNF79's diverse roles in cellular and organismal biology.

## Interactions
ZNF79, a KRAB zinc finger protein, participates in several protein interactions, primarily through its association with KAP1, a common interactor among KRAB zinc finger proteins. However, ZNF79 is noted as a weak recruiter of KAP1, suggesting it may have non-canonical roles compared to other stronger KAP1-binding KRAB proteins (Helleboid2019The). 

ZNF79 is also associated with unique protein interactions, including components of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which is involved in translation. This interaction suggests a potential role for ZNF79 in RNA-related functions, possibly in translation regulation or RNA processing (Helleboid2019The). The protein's unusual sub-nuclear or predominantly cytoplasmic localization, particularly its enrichment in the nucleolus, supports this hypothesis, although specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed (Helleboid2019The).

In the context of bone mineral density, ZNF79 was found to be significantly up-regulated in individuals with low bone mineral density, indicating a possible role in osteoporosis, although specific protein interactions in this context were not detailed (Li2019Integrative).
