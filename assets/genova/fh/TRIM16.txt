# TRIM16

## Overview
TRIM16, or tripartite motif containing 16, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by the presence of a tripartite motif comprising B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain. Unlike many TRIM proteins, TRIM16 lacks a RING finger domain but functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase through its B-box domains, which adopt RING-like folds (Kim2013TRIM16; Bell2012TRIM16). The TRIM16 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including ubiquitination, protein aggregation, and tumor suppression, and plays a significant role in cellular stress responses and autophagy (Chauhan2016TRIMs; Jena2018TRIM16). Clinically, TRIM16 has been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, and its expression levels are associated with disease progression and patient outcomes (Cheung2011The; Ruan2021TRIM16).

## Structure
TRIM16 is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a unique structural composition. Unlike many TRIM proteins, TRIM16 lacks a RING finger domain but contains two B-box domains, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain (Kim2013TRIM16; Bell2012TRIM16). The B-box domains of TRIM16 are hypothesized to adopt RING-like folds, which enable the protein to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase despite the absence of a classical RING domain (Bell2012TRIM16). These B-box domains are capable of zinc binding, which is crucial for their structural integrity and function (Bell2012TRIM16).

The coiled-coil domain facilitates homodimerization and heterodimerization with other TRIM family members, such as TRIM24, PML, and MID1, allowing TRIM16 to form complexes and participate in various cellular processes (Bell2012TRIM16; Marshall2010TRIM16). The SPRY domain is essential for interactions with proteins like p62 and NRF2, playing a significant role in protein stability and signaling (Jena2018TRIM16).

TRIM16 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its activity and interactions (Marshall2010TRIM16). The protein's structure and modifications contribute to its roles in cellular processes such as ubiquitination, protein aggregation, and tumor suppression.

## Function
TRIM16 is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Despite lacking a classical RING domain, TRIM16 utilizes its B-box domains to perform ubiquitination, which is crucial for protein stability and signaling pathways (Bell2012TRIM16). It plays a significant role in the assembly and degradation of protein aggregates by modulating the p62-NRF2 axis and autophagy. TRIM16 stabilizes NRF2 by decreasing its K48-linked poly-ubiquitination and increasing K63-linked poly-ubiquitination, enhancing NRF2's stability and activity (Jena2018TRIM16).

TRIM16 is also involved in the autophagic response to cellular stress, particularly in the context of lysosomal and phagosomal damage. It cooperates with Galectin-3 to organize core autophagy factors and regulate the ubiquitination of damaged compartments, playing a protective role against endomembrane damage (Chauhan2016TRIMs). TRIM16's interaction with autophagy regulators such as ULK1, Beclin 1, and ATG16L1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress conditions (Chauhan2016TRIMs).

In healthy human cells, TRIM16 contributes to protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses, acting as a scaffold protein that facilitates the interaction of ubiquitin, p62, and LC3B with protein aggregates, thus promoting their autophagic degradation (Jena2018TRIM16).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM16 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), TRIM16 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression significantly reduced in SCC tissues compared to normal skin. This reduction is associated with increased tumor growth and migration, suggesting that loss of TRIM16 function may contribute to SCC progression by promoting cell division and inhibiting differentiation (Cheung2011The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TRIM16 expression is also decreased, correlating with poorer survival outcomes. Overexpression of TRIM16 in CRC cell lines reduces cell invasion and migration, while its knockdown facilitates metastasis. TRIM16 suppresses CRC metastasis by promoting the degradation of Snail, a key transcription factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Ruan2021TRIM16).

TRIM16 mutations, particularly in the SPRY domain, have been identified as potential drivers in various cancers. These mutations may affect TRIM16's role in the SQSTM1-KEAP1-NFE2L2 axis, which is crucial for stress-induced biogenesis of protein aggregates (Gao2022Pancancer).

In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), TRIM16 plays a protective role by promoting the degradation of phosphorylated TAK1, thereby modulating the MAPK signaling pathway. Alterations in TRIM16 expression can exacerbate NASH progression, highlighting its significance in liver disease (Wang2021Tripartite).

## Interactions
TRIM16, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. Despite lacking a RING domain, TRIM16 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitated by its B-box domains, which adopt RING-like folds. It can homodimerize through its coiled-coil domain and heterodimerize with other TRIM family members, such as TRIM24, Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, and Midline-1 (MID1) (Bell2012TRIM16).

TRIM16 interacts with cytoplasmic vimentin and nuclear E2F1 in neuroblastoma cells. It reduces vimentin levels, affecting cell motility, and downregulates nuclear E2F1, impacting cell proliferation (Marshall2010TRIM16). TRIM16 also binds to caspase-2, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells through the activation of this caspase (Kim2013TRIM16).

In the context of stress-induced protein aggregates, TRIM16 interacts with NFE2L2/NRF2, enhancing its ubiquitination and stabilization, which leads to the activation of stress response pathways. It acts as a scaffold protein, recruiting SQSTM1 and autophagy initiation proteins to manage protein aggregates (Jena2019TRIM16). TRIM16 also interacts with Galectin-3 and ATG16L1, playing a role in autophagic responses to endomembrane damage (Chauhan2016TRIMs).
