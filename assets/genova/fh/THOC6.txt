# THOC6

## Overview
THOC6 is a gene that encodes the THO complex subunit 6 protein, a critical component of the THO complex within the larger transcription/export (TREX) complex. This protein is characterized by its seven WD40 repeat domains, which form a β-propeller structure essential for its function in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX). The THOC6 protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stabilization of the THO complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as THOC1, THOC5, and THOC7, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the TREX complex (Pühringer2020Structure). Mutations in the THOC6 gene can lead to THOC6 Intellectual Disability Syndrome, also known as Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Werren2024TREX; Casey2016Beaulieu–Boycott–Innes).

## Structure
The THOC6 protein is a subunit of the human THO complex, which is a core component of the transcription/export (TREX) complex involved in mRNA processing and export. THOC6 is composed of seven WD40 repeat domains that form a β-propeller structure when folded, which is crucial for its function (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX). This β-propeller structure is essential for the stability and assembly of the TREX tetramer, as it facilitates interactions with other subunits such as THOC1, THOC5, and THOC7 (Pühringer2020Structure).

The quaternary structure of THOC6 involves its role in tethering TREX dimers to form a tetramer, which is necessary for efficient RNA processing (Werren2024TREX). Pathogenic variants in the WD40 domains, including missense and nonsense mutations, can disrupt the β-propeller structure, leading to impaired tetramerization and associated intellectual disability syndromes (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX). These structural disruptions affect the protein's ability to maintain the integrity of the TREX complex, impacting mRNA processing and neural development (Werren2024TREX). The THOC6 protein consists of 341 amino acids, and its structure is integral to its function within the TREX complex (Werren2024TREX).

## Function
THOC6 is a crucial component of the THO complex, which is part of the larger TREX complex involved in mRNA processing and export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In healthy human cells, THOC6 plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the THO complex, which is essential for mRNA processing and export (Pühringer2020Structure). The THO complex, including THOC6, is recruited to the 5' end of mRNA in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner, facilitating the export of mRNA from the nucleus (Mattioli2018Clinical).

THOC6 forms a b-propeller structure that interacts with other subunits such as THOC5 and THOC7, contributing to the structural integrity and tetramerization of the THO complex (Pühringer2020Structure). This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of the complex, as it allows for the oligomerization necessary for its role in mRNA export (Pühringer2020Structure).

In terms of cellular localization, THOC6 is normally found in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains, indicating its involvement in mRNA processing (Mattioli2018Clinical). The proper functioning of THOC6 is essential for maintaining physiological nuclear localization and interaction with other THO complex subunits, which are crucial for its role in mRNA processing (Mattioli2018Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the THOC6 gene are associated with THOC6 Intellectual Disability Syndrome (TIDS), also known as Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes Syndrome (BBIS), a rare autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, developmental delay, and distinctive facial dysmorphisms. Patients may also present with cardiac and renal malformations, urogenital defects, recurrent infections, and feeding complications (Zhang2020The; Casey2016Beaulieu–Boycott–Innes; Werren2024TREX).

THOC6 is a component of the TREX complex, crucial for mRNA processing and export. Pathogenic biallelic variants in THOC6, including both nonsense and missense mutations, lead to a loss-of-function mechanism that disrupts TREX tetramer formation. This disruption affects RNA processing, particularly in neural cells, leading to mis-splicing and developmental abnormalities (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX).

The clinical manifestations of TIDS are linked to impaired mRNA processing, which affects neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuron differentiation. This results in delayed differentiation and increased apoptosis in neural progenitor cells, contributing to the intellectual disability and developmental issues observed in affected individuals (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX).

## Interactions
THOC6 is a subunit of the THO complex, which is part of the larger TREX complex involved in mRNA processing and export. It plays a crucial role in forming the TREX tetramer, which is essential for mRNA processing in mammals. THOC6 interacts with other THO complex subunits, including THOC1 and THOC5, facilitating the coupling of transcription with mRNA export (Mattioli2018Clinical; Werren2022Mechanisms). 

Pathogenic variants in THOC6 can disrupt its interactions with these subunits, particularly affecting the formation of the TREX tetramer. For instance, the missense variant p.E188K disrupts the interaction between THOC6 and THOC5, leading to a loss of THOC5-THOC6 binding, although the TREX complex remains stable in a dimer conformation (Werren2024TREX). 

THOC6 also interacts with ALYREF, a processing/export factor involved in splicing fidelity. The association of ALYREF with the THO subcomplex is diminished in certain THOC6 variants, suggesting a THOC6-dependent mechanism for ALYREF association (Werren2022Mechanisms; Werren2024TREX). These interactions are vital for the regulation of key signaling pathways during human corticogenesis, which may be disrupted in THOC6-related intellectual disability syndromes (Werren2024TREX).
