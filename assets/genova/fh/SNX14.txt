# SNX14

## Overview
SNX14 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 14, which is a member of the sorting nexin family involved in intracellular trafficking and lipid metabolism. The SNX14 protein is characterized by the presence of a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain and a phox homology (PX) domain, which are integral to its function in cellular processes such as lipid homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integrity (Akizu2015Biallelic). As an ER-lipid droplet (LD) tethering protein, SNX14 plays a critical role in the incorporation of fatty acids into triglycerides, thereby facilitating lipid droplet growth and protecting cells from lipotoxic stress (Datta2020Snx14). Mutations in the SNX14 gene are linked to autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 20 (SCAR20), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar atrophy and intellectual disability (Shao2024Compound). The protein's involvement in lysosomal function and autophagy further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Akizu2015Biallelic).

## Structure
The SNX14 protein is composed of 946 amino acids and features several distinct domains, including two transmembrane domains, a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain, and a phox homology (PX) domain (Akizu2015Biallelic). The RGS domain is predicted to function as a GTPase activating protein (GAP), while the PX domain is involved in binding phosphoinositide lipids, which plays a role in intracellular trafficking (Akizu2015Biallelic). SNX14 is part of the PXA-RGS-PX-PXC subfamily, which includes proteins with a central PX domain flanked by conserved domains, such as the PXA and PXC domains located N-terminal and C-terminal to the PX domain, respectively (Teasdale2011Insights).

The protein is predominantly associated with lysosomal compartments, as demonstrated by cellular fractionation studies in human neural precursor cells (Akizu2015Biallelic). SNX14 is also involved in lipid homeostasis, particularly in the context of saturated fatty acid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis (Datta2020Snx14). Alternate splicing of SNX14 results in transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Akizu2015Biallelic).

## Function
SNX14 (sorting nexin 14) is a protein involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integrity in human cells. It functions as an ER-lipid droplet (LD) tethering protein, crucial for the incorporation of fatty acids into triglycerides during lipid droplet growth, which is essential for proper fatty acid storage (Datta2020Snx14). SNX14 interacts with stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a fatty acid desaturase, to modulate the saturation levels of fatty acids, thereby protecting cells from lipotoxic stress (Datta2020Snx14). 

SNX14 is also involved in lipid droplet biogenesis, particularly following oleic acid treatment, by promoting the incorporation of fatty acids into triacylglycerol (TAG) in an ACSL3-dependent manner (Datta2019Cerebellar). It stabilizes ER-LD contacts, facilitating TAG synthesis and lipid droplet growth, and shares functional similarities with Seipin, another protein involved in LD maturation (Datta2019Cerebellar). 

In addition to its role in lipid metabolism, SNX14 is implicated in lysosomal function and autophagy. It is associated with lysosomal compartments and is involved in the fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes, a critical step in autophagic degradation (Akizu2015Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNX14 gene are associated with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 20 (SCAR20), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early-onset cerebellar atrophy, severe intellectual disability, and craniofacial abnormalities (Shao2024Compound; Bryant2020Diverse). Biallelic mutations in SNX14 lead to a progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration due to Purkinje cell loss, which is a hallmark of cerebellar ataxias (Akizu2015Biallelic). Clinical features of SCAR20 include developmental delays, autistic-like behavior, epileptic seizures, hypotonia, nystagmus, and coarse facial features (Shao2024Compound; Akizu2015Biallelic).

SNX14 mutations disrupt normal cellular processes, particularly affecting autophagy and lipid metabolism. This disruption leads to the accumulation of autolysosomes containing lipids, contributing to neurodegeneration (Zhou2022Altered; Bryant2020Diverse). The gene's role in lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid desaturation is crucial, and its deficiency results in lipid metabolism defects, particularly affecting cerebellar Purkinje cells (Zhou2022Altered).

The condition is often diagnosed using genetic testing methods such as whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing, which are effective in identifying rare genetic variants in non-coding regions (Levchenko2023Homozygous).

## Interactions
SNX14 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. It physically interacts with SCD1, a key enzyme in fatty acid metabolism, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction suggests that SNX14 may facilitate the organization of enzymes within the ER network, although it does not directly alter SCD1's enzymatic activity (Datta2020Snx14a; Datta2020Snx14).

SNX14 also interacts with ACSL3, an acyl-CoA ligase, during lipid droplet (LD) growth. SNX14 is recruited to ER-LD contact sites in an ACSL3-dependent manner, indicating a functional relationship where ACSL3 acts upstream of SNX14 in the process of LD maturation (Datta2019Cerebellar).

In the context of SCAR20 disease, SNX14 is identified as an ER-LD tethering protein, interacting with various proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid processing. These interactions are crucial for maintaining lipid saturation balance and ER integrity, particularly under conditions of saturated fatty acid exposure (Datta2020Snx14).
