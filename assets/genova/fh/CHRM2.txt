# CHRM2

## Overview
The CHRM2 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 2 (M2), a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a pivotal role in various physiological and neurological processes. As a transmembrane receptor, M2 is integral to the modulation of neurotransmitter release, particularly acetylcholine, thereby influencing cardiac function, respiratory processes, and cognitive activities. The receptor's ability to decrease heart rate and contractility, as well as its involvement in synaptic plasticity, underscores its significance in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (Zhou2001Structure; Fenech2004Novel). CHRM2's complex transcriptional regulation and its interactions with proteins such as β-arrestin 1 and GRK5 further highlight its multifaceted role in cellular signaling pathways, with implications for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (Apostolakou2019Extended; Fu2021Potential). The gene's association with neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression and substance dependence, emphasizes its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2004Evidence; Luo2005CHRM2).

## Function
The CHRM2 gene encodes the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, the M2 receptor is crucial for inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic fibers, providing negative feedback to regulate neurotransmitter release. This function is essential for maintaining normal respiratory function by preventing excessive bronchoconstriction, as well as modulating autonomic functions in the central nervous system and other tissues (Zhou2001Structure).

The M2 receptor is involved in the regulation of cardiac function by decreasing heart rate and contractility, primarily through its action in cardiac myocytes. It is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, which helps modulate the relaxant effect of agents like isoproterenol in the airways (Fenech2004Novel). In the central nervous system, the receptor modulates neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, impacting cognitive functions such as intelligence and memory (Gosso2007Exploring; Comings2003Role).

The CHRM2 gene exhibits complex transcriptional regulation, with multiple promoters and alternative splicing patterns resulting in different mRNA transcripts that may have tissue-specific promoter activity (Gosso2007Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
The CHRM2 gene has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders due to its role in memory and cognition. Alterations in CHRM2 have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, major depression, alcohol dependence, and drug dependence, including cocaine and opioid dependence (Luo2005CHRM2). Variants within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of CHRM2 have been linked to an increased risk for alcohol dependence and major depressive syndrome (Wang2004Evidence). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in introns 4 and 5 of the CHRM2 gene have shown strong associations with alcoholism and major depressive syndrome (Wang2004Evidence).

The gene's involvement in psychiatric conditions extends to its influence on electrophysiological endophenotypes, such as event-related oscillations, which are linked to both alcoholism and depression (Wang2004Evidence). In women, a common A->T polymorphism in the 3' UTR of CHRM2 has been associated with major depression, suggesting a gender-specific role in this disorder (Comings2002Association). Additionally, CHRM2 polymorphisms have been associated with asthma susceptibility, with certain SNPs showing significant differences in distribution between asthmatic and control groups (JiménezMorales2014CHRM2). The gene's interaction with environmental factors, such as parental monitoring, also influences externalizing behaviors, including antisocial behavior and substance use (Dick2011CHRM2).

## Interactions
CHRM2, or cholinergic receptor muscarinic 2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. CHRM2 interacts with β-arrestin 1 (ARRB1) and Gα i2 (GNAI2) in hippocampus neuronal cells, which are crucial for its signaling pathways (Apostolakou2019Extended). A unique interaction of CHRM2 is with GRK5, a kinase whose dysfunction is linked to early amyloid-beta accumulation and Tau phosphorylation, both associated with Alzheimer's disease. This interaction is significant because GRK5 deficiency impairs the desensitization of CHRM2, leading to accelerated amyloidogenic APP processing, suggesting GRK5 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's (Apostolakou2019Extended).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHRM2 is part of a protein-protein interaction network involving 11 proteins. These interactions are associated with pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and Ras signaling pathways, which are relevant to cancer progression (Fu2021Potential). The STRING database also provides insights into CHRM2's functional associations, although it does not specifically focus on physical interactions (Szklarczyk2018STRING). These interactions highlight CHRM2's role in both neurological and oncological contexts.
