# RASD2

## Overview
The RASD2 gene encodes the RASD family member 2 protein, commonly referred to as RHES, which is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. This protein is predominantly expressed in the striatum of the brain and plays a significant role in modulating dopaminergic neurotransmission and motor coordination. As a small GTPase, RHES is involved in various cellular signaling pathways, interacting with specific G protein subunits and influencing signal transduction processes. Beyond its neurological functions, RHES is also implicated in the regulation of iron metabolism and has been associated with several neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Huntington's disease and depression. The protein's unique structural features, such as its N-terminal region and cationic C-terminal domain, facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to the plasma membrane, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and signaling (Cheng2024Rasd2; Thapliyal2014Small; Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural).

## Structure
The RASD2 protein, also known as RHES, is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and is primarily expressed in the striatum of the brain. It consists of 266 amino acids and shares approximately 62% similarity with Dexras1, another Ras-like protein (Thapliyal2014Small; Verma2019IN). The protein features a unique N-terminal region that differs from other Ras family members and is hypothesized to play a role in modulating N-type calcium channels (Verma2019IN).

The C-terminal domain of RASD2, known as the 'cationic region,' is enriched with positively charged residues essential for interaction with Gβ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, specifically Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ3, but not Gβ4 or Gβ5 (Thapliyal2014Small). This domain also includes a CAAX motif, which undergoes post-translational modifications that facilitate its association with the plasma membrane (Thapliyal2014Small).

Structurally, RASD2 has an extended carboxyl terminus variable domain of about 56 amino acids, spanning residues 210-266 (Thapliyal2014Small). The protein's GTP-binding domain is crucial for its function, although specific details on its tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The RASD2 gene encodes the RHES protein, a Ras-like small GTPase predominantly expressed in the striatum of the brain, where it plays a crucial role in modulating dopaminergic neurotransmission and motor coordination (Thapliyal2014Small; Vadgama2019De). RHES interacts specifically with the Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ3 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, facilitating its association with the plasma membrane through posttranslational modifications on a CAAX domain (Thapliyal2014Small). This interaction is essential for its role in signal transduction pathways.

In addition to its primary expression in the striatum, RHES is also found in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, granular layer of the cerebellum, and thalamus (Thapliyal2014Small). Outside the nervous system, RHES is expressed in the thyroid and pancreas, where it may influence the secretion of thyroid hormone and insulin, respectively (Thapliyal2014Small).

The protein is involved in the regulation of iron metabolism within the brain by binding to PAP7 in a PKA-dependent manner, which activates DMT1 and facilitates iron uptake in the striatum (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). This suggests a broader role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RASD2 gene, also known as Rhes, have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. In the context of Huntington's disease (HD), RASD2 is involved in the disease's pathology by binding more tightly to the mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) than to the normal protein. This interaction leads to the sumoylation of mHtt, enhancing its cytotoxicity and contributing to the selective atrophy of the striatum observed in HD patients (Thapliyal2014Small).

In depression, RASD2 expression is altered in response to stress, particularly in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) circuit. Chronic stress reduces RASD2 expression in the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, which is linked to depression-like behaviors. Overexpression of RASD2 in these regions can alleviate these behaviors by activating the DRD2-cAMP-PKA-DARPP-32 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential role in mood regulation and as a target for therapeutic interventions in depression (Cheng2024Rasd2).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RASD2 in neurological and psychiatric disorders, suggesting that targeting its expression or interactions could offer new therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
RASD2, also known as RHES, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), where RASD2 directly interacts with DRD2. This interaction is crucial for modulating depression-like behaviors through the DRD2-cAMP-PKA-DARPP-32 signaling pathway (Cheng2024Rasd2). The co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that this interaction is reduced under conditions of stress, such as the 5-day unpredictable mild stress (5-d UMS) model used in mice (Cheng2024Rasd2).

RASD2 also interacts with PAP7 in a PKA-dependent manner, which activates DMT1 and facilitates iron uptake in the striatum (Nakhaei-Rad2018Structural). This interaction highlights RASD2's role in iron metabolism and its potential implications in neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, RASD2 is involved in the modulation of glutamatergic projections from the prelimbic cortex to the NAcc, which affects the expression of proteins like GluA1 in the medial prefrontal cortex (Cheng2024Rasd2). These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of RASD2 in neural signaling and its potential impact on mental health disorders.
