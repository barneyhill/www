# MYO18B

## Overview
MYO18B is a gene that encodes the unconventional myosin protein, myosin XVIIIB, which is part of the myosin superfamily known for its diverse roles in cellular processes. Unlike conventional myosins, myosin XVIIIB lacks typical ATPase motor activity but is crucial for muscle development and function, particularly in the organization and maintenance of sarcomeres in striated muscle cells, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles (Ajima2008Deficiency; Ouyang2021Multifaceted). The protein is characterized by a unique domain structure, including a motor domain with atypical features and a C-terminal tail that interacts with various proteins, implicating it in proteasomal degradation and cytoskeletal organization (Inoue2006MYO18B). MYO18B is also recognized for its potential role as a tumor suppressor, with alterations in the gene linked to certain cancers and congenital disorders, underscoring its importance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts (Yanaihara2004Reduced; Malfatti2015A).

## Structure
The MYO18B protein, encoded by the MYO18B gene, is a member of the unconventional myosin class XVIII. It features a unique domain structure that includes an N-terminal extension, a motor domain, and a C-terminal tail domain. The motor domain contains an unusual insertion and substitution of a highly conserved amino acid at the switch 2 region in the ATPase site, which is critical for its function (Inoue2006MYO18B). The C-terminal tail domain does not show homology to previously known functional domains but interacts with proteins such as Sug1, a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome, indicating its role in proteasomal degradation (Inoue2006MYO18B).

MYO18B also contains a coiled-coil region within its tail domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as HOMER2, enhancing its tumor suppressor activity (Ajima2007HOMER2). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including polyubiquitination, which targets it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Inoue2006MYO18B). The molecular weight of MYO18B is approximately 290 kDa, with a smaller band at 250 kDa, both confirmed to be derived from the MYO18B protein (Inoue2006MYO18B). The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to its functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
MYO18B encodes an unconventional myosin protein that plays a crucial role in muscle development and function. Unlike conventional myosins, MYO18B lacks ATPase motor activity but is involved in the organization of sarcomeres, the fundamental contractile units of muscle cells. It is predominantly expressed in striated muscle cells, such as cardiac and skeletal muscles, where it localizes to the Z-lines of myofibrils (Ajima2008Deficiency; Ouyang2021Multifaceted). MYO18B is essential for sarcomere assembly and myofibril maintenance, contributing to muscle integrity and function. It binds to actin filaments and may help tether thick and thin filaments, providing resistance to changes in sarcomere length (Horsthemke2024Are).

During muscle development, MYO18B expression increases as myoblasts differentiate into myotubes, indicating its role in myogenesis (Ouyang2021Multifaceted). In cardiac muscle, MYO18B initially localizes to nuclei during differentiation, then moves to actin stress fibers, and finally incorporates into sarcomeres (Horsthemke2024Are). Deficiency or mutations in MYO18B can lead to disorganized sarcomeres and impaired muscle function, highlighting its importance in maintaining muscle structure and function (Berger2017Myo18b; Ouyang2021Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO18B gene are associated with several congenital and acquired conditions. MYO18B mutations have been linked to congenital myopathies, including nemaline myopathy, which is characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies in muscle fibers (Gurung2017A; Malfatti2015A). These mutations can result in a truncated myosin-18B protein, leading to disrupted sarcomere assembly and muscle function (Ouyang2021Multifaceted).

MYO18B is also implicated in Klippel-Feil syndrome 4 (KFS4), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital fusion of cervical vertebrae, facial dysmorphism, and myopathy (Altuame2020Further; Brunet2020A). Specific mutations in MYO18B, such as homozygous nonsense mutations, have been identified in patients with KFS4, leading to a null phenotype and associated clinical features (Alazami2015A).

In addition to congenital conditions, MYO18B is considered a tumor suppressor gene, particularly in lung and ovarian cancers. Alterations in MYO18B, including deletions, mutations, and hypermethylation, have been observed in these cancers, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Yanaihara2004Reduced). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
MYO18B interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the proteasomal subunit Sug1, a 19S regulator subunit of the 26S proteasome. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed through GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. MYO18B binds to the C-terminal tail region of Sug1, and this interaction is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, as MYO18B is subject to proteasomal degradation (Inoue2006MYO18B).

MYO18B also interacts with HOMER2, a member of the Homer/Ves1 family. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed in mammalian cells. The C-terminal half of HOMER2 binds to the tail region of MYO18B. These proteins co-localize on F-actin, particularly in regions of membrane protrusion and stress fibers, suggesting a role in actin cytoskeleton organization (Ajima2007HOMER2).

These interactions highlight MYO18B's involvement in protein degradation pathways and cytoskeletal organization, which may contribute to its function as a candidate tumor suppressor gene.
