# PLXNB2

## Overview
PLXNB2 is a gene that encodes the protein plexin B2, which is a member of the plexin family of transmembrane receptors. Plexin B2 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell guidance, migration, and adhesion, with significant roles in the nervous system and bone development. It is crucial for neuronal migration and patterning, influencing the migration of granule cell precursors in the cerebellum and other brain regions, as well as playing a role in neural tube closure and cerebellar foliation (Friedel2007Plexin-B2; Deng2007PlexinB2). In bone development, plexin B2 promotes osteogenic differentiation through the RHOA signaling pathway (Zhang2019PLEXINB2). Additionally, plexin B2 interacts with angiogenin, affecting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions (Yu2017PlexinB2). Mutations in PLXNB2 are linked to various clinical conditions, including a novel autosomal recessive syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease (Smith2024Biallelic; Xiang2018MiR1263p).

## Structure


## Function
Plexin-B2 (PLXNB2) is a protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system and bone development. In the nervous system, PLXNB2 is essential for neuronal migration and patterning. It is involved in the migration of granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the cerebellum, dentate gyrus, and olfactory bulb, influencing processes such as neural tube closure and cerebellar foliation (Friedel2007Plexin-B2; Deng2007PlexinB2). PLXNB2 modulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulates integrin function, affecting cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions crucial for neuronal migration (Deng2007PlexinB2).

In bone development, PLXNB2 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through the activation of the RHOA signaling pathway. This process enhances the activity of alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition, which are markers of osteogenic differentiation (Zhang2019PLEXINB2).

PLXNB2 also mediates the effects of angiogenin on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, influencing their proliferation and self-renewal. It regulates protein synthesis in these cells by modulating transfer RNA-derived fragments and ribosomal RNA (Yu2017PlexinB2). Overall, PLXNB2 is a key player in cell guidance, migration, and adhesion, impacting various developmental and physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLXNB2 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Biallelic pathogenic variants in PLXNB2 have been identified as the cause of a novel autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), intellectual disability, ocular disease, ear developmental abnormalities, and lymphoedema. These variants are extremely rare and have been identified in consanguineous families from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Smith2024Biallelic).

In the context of cancer, PLXNB2 expression is up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues, where it promotes cell proliferation and invasion. This up-regulation is counteracted by miR-126-3p, which targets PLXNB2, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for miR-126-3p in ovarian cancer (Xiang2018MiR1263p). Additionally, a circular RNA derived from PLXNB2, known as circPLXNB2, is significantly increased in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, particularly those with extramedullary infiltration. This suggests that circPLXNB2 could serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker in AML (Lin2021A).

In mice, the loss of PLXNB2 leads to severe developmental abnormalities, including defects in neural tube closure and brain patterning, indicating its critical role in neuronal development (Deng2007PlexinB2).

## Interactions
Plexin-B2 (PLXNB2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It acts as a receptor for angiogenin (ANG), facilitating ANG's nuclear translocation and other cellular activities crucial for cell growth and survival. This interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate the association of ANG with PLXNB2 in vivo (Yu2017PlexinB2). The ANG-binding site on PLXNB2 is located within amino acid residues 424-441, and monoclonal antibodies targeting this site can inhibit ANG-induced activities, including tumor growth (Yu2017PlexinB2).

PLXNB2 also interacts with the RhoA signaling pathway, promoting osteogenic differentiation in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows that PLXNB2 overexpression enhances the binding between PLXNB2 and RhoA, indicating a direct interaction (Zhang2019PLEXINB2). This interaction is crucial for the osteogenic process, as RhoA is necessary for the expression of osteogenic markers (Zhang2019PLEXINB2).

In the context of stem cell dynamics, PLXNB2 influences actomyosin contractility and cell adhesion, interacting with signaling pathways such as YAP, ERK1/2, and calcium signaling. These interactions are essential for maintaining cytoskeletal tension and adhesion in stem cells (Junqueira2021PlexinB2).
