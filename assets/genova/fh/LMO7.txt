# LMO7

## Overview
The LMO7 gene encodes the LIM domain only 7 (LMO7) protein, which is a multifunctional protein characterized by the presence of PDZ, LIM, and Calponin Homology (CH) domains. These domains facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions, particularly in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion (te2007Insights; Ott2008The). LMO7 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and is involved in maintaining cellular architecture by modulating actin dynamics and interacting with various cytoskeletal proteins (Hu2011LMO7; Zhang2023Novel). The protein also functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle, influencing gene transcription related to muscle and epithelial cell structure (NAKAMURA2011Decreased). LMO7's interactions with other proteins, such as those in the Rho-MRTF-SRF signaling pathway, underscore its significance in cellular processes, including cancer cell migration and auditory function (Du2019LMO7; Hu2011LMO7).

## Structure
The LMO7 protein is a member of the PDZ and LIM domain-containing protein family, characterized by its distinct structural domains. It comprises an N-terminal LIM domain, a C-terminal Calponin Homology (CH) domain, and a PDZ domain, all of which are involved in protein-protein interactions (te2007Insights; Ott2008The). The LIM domain is a zinc-binding motif that facilitates interactions with other proteins, while the PDZ domain is known for organizing cell signaling assemblies (te2007Insights; Krcmery2010Nucleocytoplasmic). The CH domain is associated with binding to actin filaments, allowing LMO7 to interact with F-actin binding proteins such as α-Actinin and Afadin (Ott2008The).

LMO7 is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 13q21-q22 and consists of 27 exons, producing a protein of 1349 amino acids. There are three known splice forms of human LMO7, with additional variants identified in rats (Ott2008The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Krcmery2010Nucleocytoplasmic). The combination of these domains and modifications allows LMO7 to play a role in actin cytoskeleton organization and cell-cell adhesion.

## Function
The LMO7 gene encodes a fibrous actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the architecture of epithelial cells by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. It is widely expressed in adult tissues, particularly at the apical surface of lung epithelial cells, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of epithelial structures (Zhang2023Novel; NAKAMURA2011Decreased). LMO7 functions as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein, regulating the transcription of genes related to muscle and epithelial architecture (NAKAMURA2011Decreased).

In healthy human cells, LMO7 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and the activation of the myocardin-related transcription factor-serum response factor (MRTF-SRF) pathway. It enhances the transcription of muscle-specific genes by reducing the G-actin/F-actin ratio, which is crucial for the activation of MRTFs (Hu2011LMO7). LMO7 also interacts with proteins associated with the F-actin network, such as actins and myosins, indicating its role in organizing the cytoskeleton (Du2019LMO7).

LMO7's involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of cell junctions and the cuticular plate in sensory hair cells is essential for proper auditory function, highlighting its importance in cellular architecture and function (Du2019LMO7).

## Clinical Significance
The LMO7 gene has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In lung adenocarcinoma, decreased expression of LMO7 is associated with more advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (NAKAMURA2011Decreased). Conversely, in pancreatic cancer, LMO7 is highly expressed and promotes tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its function as a tumor-promoting factor in this context (Liu2021LMO7). 

In breast cancer, LMO7 is involved in cell migration by activating the Rho-MRTF-SRF pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell motility and invasion (Hu2011LMO7). The gene's expression is also linked to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, where high LMO7 levels correlate with longer overall survival, although its prognostic significance varies depending on the presence of other factors like LRIG1 (Israelsson2024Immunoreactivity).

LMO7 deficiencies have been associated with hearing impairments due to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cuticular plate in hair cells, which is essential for proper auditory function (Du2019LMO7).

## Interactions
LMO7 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with approximately 500 proteins, with a focus on those involved in the organization of F-actin within the cuticular plate and junctions of the inner ear. Notable interaction partners include spectrins (SPTBN1, SPTAN1), Myosin VI (MYO6), and actin isoforms, as well as cell junction proteins such as nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) subunits and α-actinin 4 (ACTN4) (Du2019LMO7). LMO7's interaction with ACTN4 shows near-perfect co-localization, while its interaction with NMII displays a mix of co-localization and mutually-exclusive localization (Du2019LMO7).

LMO7 also plays a role in the Rho-MRTF-SRF signaling pathway, where it interacts with myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) to enhance transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of actin dynamics and is involved in processes such as breast cancer cell migration (Hu2011LMO7). LMO7 interacts with RhoA-L63, a small GTPase, to synergistically activate MRTF/SRF-dependent transcription, reducing actin binding to MAL and influencing gene expression (Hu2011LMO7).

Additionally, LMO7 interacts with the Cryptosporidium rhoptry effector protein ROP1, with the interaction being mediated by the LIM domain of LMO7. This interaction is significant in the context of Cryptosporidium infection, where LMO7 accumulates at the infection site alongside actin and ROP1 (Guérin2021Cryptosporidium).
