# FBN1

## Overview
The FBN1 gene encodes fibrillin-1, a large glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the formation and function of elastic fibers within the extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Fibrillin-1 is categorized as a structural protein, essential for the assembly of microfibrils that provide elasticity and strength to tissues such as skin, blood vessels, and ligaments (Schrenk2017Structural; Li2024The). The protein is characterized by a complex domain structure, including numerous calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains and transforming growth factor-beta binding protein-like domains, which are vital for its stability and function (Li2024The). Fibrillin-1 also interacts with various extracellular matrix components and is involved in regulating key signaling pathways, such as the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, which is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis (Schrenk2017Structural; Peeters2022The). Mutations in the FBN1 gene are linked to several connective tissue disorders, most notably Marfan syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Robinson2002Mutations; Rommel2005Identification).

## Structure
Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is a large glycoprotein essential for the formation of elastic fibers in connective tissues. The primary structure of FBN1 consists of 2871 amino acids encoded by 65 exons, with numerous cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein (Hubmacher2011Genetic; Li2024The). The secondary structure includes 47 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, 43 of which are calcium-binding (cbEGF) domains, and seven transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) binding protein-like (TB) domains (Schrenk2017Structural; Li2024The). These domains are crucial for the protein's stability and function, with the cbEGF domains limiting interdomain mobility and protecting against proteolysis (Li2024The).

The tertiary structure of FBN1 is characterized by a complex arrangement of these domains, contributing to its elasticity and strength. The protein also contains hybrid domains with features of both cbEGF and TB domains, as well as a proline-rich region (Li2024The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of microfibrils, which are essential for the structural integrity of elastic fibers (Li2024The).

Post-translational modifications of FBN1 include glycosylation, and the protein has several known splice variant isoforms (Hubmacher2011Genetic). These structural features enable FBN1 to interact with various extracellular matrix proteins and contribute to its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and mechanical support (Li2024The).

## Function
Fibrillin-1, encoded by the FBN1 gene, is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in connective tissues, where it forms microfibrils that provide structural integrity and elasticity. These microfibrils serve as scaffolds for elastin deposition, essential for the formation of elastic fibers in tissues such as the skin, lungs, blood vessels, and ligaments (Schrenk2017Structural; Peeters2022The). Fibrillin-1 interacts with various ECM components, including fibulin-2, fibulin-5, and microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1, contributing to elastic fiber assembly and tissue homeostasis (Schrenk2017Structural).

Fibrillin-1 also plays a significant role in regulating cell signaling pathways, particularly the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. It interacts with latent TGF-β complexes and integrin receptors, modulating the bioavailability and activity of TGF-β, which is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and cellular signaling (Schrenk2017Structural; Peeters2022The). The protein's interactions with proteoglycans like decorin and biglycan are vital for network assembly and basement membrane maintenance (Schrenk2017Structural).

In healthy cells, fibrillin-1 ensures proper cell-matrix interactions and signaling, which are essential for normal tissue function and development. Its role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of connective tissues is critical for organismal outcomes, such as tissue flexibility and resilience (Schrenk2017Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FBN1 gene are primarily associated with Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder affecting connective tissue. MFS is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular issues such as aortic root dilatation and dissection, skeletal features like tall stature and joint hypermobility, and ocular symptoms such as bilateral ectopia lentis (Robinson2002Mutations; Rommel2005Identification). The majority of FBN1 mutations are missense mutations affecting cysteine residues or calcium-binding sites, which can disrupt fibrillin assembly and stability (Rommel2005Identification). 

The clinical outcomes of FBN1 mutations vary depending on the type and location of the mutation. For instance, mutations in exons 24-32 are associated with more severe presentations, including neonatal Marfan syndrome, which is often fatal within the first months of life (Robinson2002Mutations; Faivre2007Effect). Other conditions linked to FBN1 mutations include Weill-Marchesani syndrome and isolated ectopia lentis (Robinson2002Mutations). The variability in clinical manifestations suggests that factors beyond the allelic mutation contribute to the severity of the condition (Robinson2002Mutations).

## Interactions
Fibrillin-1 (FBN1) is a key component of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interacts with a variety of proteins. It forms complexes with latent transforming growth factor-beta binding proteins (LTBPs), which are crucial for the regulation of TGF-β signaling. FBN1 does not directly bind TGF-β but interacts with LTBPs to form complexes that position TGF-β in the ECM, influencing its bioavailability and activation (Hubmacher2011Genetic; Li2024The). FBN1 also binds directly to several bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), such as BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, BMP-10, and growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), suggesting a role in BMP signaling (Li2024The; Hubmacher2010Microfibrils).

FBN1 interacts with other ECM components, including fibronectin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and integrins, which are important for microfibril assembly and tissue integrity (Li2024The; RITTY2003Fibrillin1). It also associates with microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGP1 and MAGP2), fibulins, and proteoglycans like versican, contributing to the structural and functional properties of microfibrils (Schrenk2017Structural; Peeters2022The). These interactions are essential for maintaining the mechanical properties of tissues and regulating growth factor signaling.
