# SPEGNB

## Overview
SPEGNB is a gene that encodes the SPEG neighbor protein, which is a member of the myosin light chain kinase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle development and function, due to its role in phosphorylating myosin light chains. The SPEG neighbor protein is characterized by its kinase activity, which is crucial for the regulation of muscle contraction and cellular signaling pathways. Mutations or dysregulation of the SPEGNB gene have been implicated in certain muscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle physiology and pathology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
