# HYI

## Overview
The HYI gene encodes the protein hydroxypyruvate isomerase (putative), which is involved in metabolic processes related to carbohydrate metabolism. This protein is categorized as an isomerase, a type of enzyme that catalyzes the structural rearrangement of isomers within a molecule. The activity of hydroxypyruvate isomerase is crucial for the conversion of hydroxypyruvate to other metabolites, playing a significant role in cellular metabolic pathways. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their potential implications in various metabolic disorders, although the full extent of their clinical significance is still under investigation. Understanding the function and interactions of the HYI gene product is essential for elucidating its role in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
