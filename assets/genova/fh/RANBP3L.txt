# RANBP3L

## Overview
RANBP3L (RAN binding protein 3 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a vital cellular process that regulates the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein encoded by RANBP3L is a component of the nuclear pore complex and plays a crucial role in the export of proteins and RNA, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing gene expression (Chernyakov2021Loss). RANBP3L interacts with the RAN GTPase system, impacting cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and osmotic stress response (Chernyakov2021Loss). It is particularly significant in the brain and kidneys, where it may have specialized functions. The gene's expression is regulated by NFAT5 under hyperosmotic conditions, highlighting its role in cellular adaptation and epithelial cell integrity (Chernyakov2021Loss). Additionally, RANBP3L is implicated in various signaling pathways, including BMP and TGF-β, and has been associated with diseases such as renal cell carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chernyakov2021Loss; Branciamore2024Changes).

## Function
RANBP3L (RAN binding protein 3 like) is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical process for the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. It functions as part of the nuclear pore complex, facilitating the export of proteins and RNA from the nucleus, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression (Chernyakov2021Loss). RANBP3L specifically interacts with the RAN GTPase system, influencing cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and the cellular response to osmotic stress (Chernyakov2021Loss).

In renal epithelial cells, RANBP3L is upregulated in response to hyperosmotic conditions, suggesting a role in the cellular adaptation to osmotic stress (Chernyakov2021Loss). This upregulation is regulated by the transcription factor NFAT5, which binds to the RANBP3L promoter under hyperosmotic conditions, indicating its involvement in maintaining epithelial cell structure and morphology (Chernyakov2021Loss). The protein's activity is particularly significant in the brain and kidneys, where it may have specialized functions (Chernyakov2021Loss). While the specific function of RANBP3L in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and response to cellular stress is evident.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RANBP3L gene have been implicated in the development and progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly the kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) subtype. Studies have shown that the loss of RANBP3L expression in renal epithelial cells leads to a transformation towards a carcinoma-like phenotype, characterized by increased cell migration and proliferation, which are hallmarks of tumor progression (Chernyakov2021Loss). RANBP3L is generally downregulated in RCC compared to normal tissue, and higher expression levels are associated with longer overall survival in patients with KIRC, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Chernyakov2021Loss).

In addition to its role in cancer, RANBP3L has been studied in the context of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). It has been identified as a significant factor in individuals carrying the APOE E4 allele, a known risk factor for LOAD. The gene's interaction with BMP signaling pathways, which are implicated in Alzheimer's pathogenesis, suggests that RANBP3L may contribute to the disease's development, particularly in the presence of the APOE E4 allele (Branciamore2024Changes).

## Interactions
RANBP3L (RAN binding protein 3 like) is involved in nuclear transport and cellular signaling pathways. It is similar to RANBP3, which is known to interact with the RAN GTPase, a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. RANBP3L has been implicated in the nuclear import and export processes, particularly in the context of BMP-specific SMAD proteins. It facilitates the termination of BMP signaling by blocking the nuclear import of SMAD 1/5/8 proteins, which is relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Branciamore2024Changes).

In renal cell carcinoma, RANBP3L is involved in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway, where it regulates the nuclear export of Smad proteins in mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Chernyakov2021Loss). The expression of RANBP3L is regulated by the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) under hyperosmotic conditions, which influences its role in maintaining epithelial integrity and preventing cancer-like transformations in renal cells (Chernyakov2021Loss).

While specific protein interactions of RANBP3L are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these pathways suggests it may participate in complex interactions with other proteins involved in nuclear transport and signaling.
