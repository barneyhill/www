# SSR2

## Overview
SSR2, or signal sequence receptor subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, specifically known as TRAPβ. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and plays a pivotal role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides across the ER membrane, facilitating their proper folding and post-translational modifications (Gemmer2020A; Huang2021Deficient). As part of a hetero-tetrameric complex, SSR2 works alongside other subunits, including TRAPα, TRAPγ, and TRAPδ, to ensure the efficient biosynthesis of proteins such as proinsulin and insulin in pancreatic β-cells (Gemmer2020A; Huang2021Deficient). Beyond its fundamental cellular functions, SSR2 has clinical significance, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression levels are correlated with tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (Ye2023Downregulation; Hong2020SSR2).

## Function
SSR2, or signal sequence receptor subunit 2, is a component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It plays a critical role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides across the ER membrane, facilitating their entry into the ER lumen where they undergo folding and post-translational modifications (Gemmer2020A; Huang2021Deficient). SSR2 is part of a hetero-tetrameric complex that includes TRAPα, TRAPβ, TRAPγ, and TRAPδ, also known as SSR1, SSR2, SSR3, and SSR4, respectively (Gemmer2020A).

The TRAP complex, including SSR2, is involved in the initiation of translocation for specific substrates, particularly those with signal peptides that have low helical propensity due to high glycine and proline content (Gemmer2020A). SSR2 is essential for the efficient biosynthesis of proinsulin and insulin in pancreatic β-cells, as it supports the stability and function of other TRAP subunits, such as TRAPα/SSR1, which are crucial for insulin production (Huang2021Deficient). The TRAP complex also plays a role in gating the Sec61 translocon, which is essential for the translocation of secretory polypeptides (Huang2021Deficient).

## Clinical Significance
SSR2, or signal sequence receptor subunit 2, has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that SSR2 is significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and this overexpression is associated with poorer prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in patients (Ye2023Downregulation; Hong2020SSR2). The upregulation of SSR2 is linked to the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that facilitates cancer metastasis and tumorigenesis (Hong2020SSR2).

SSR2 also plays a role in chemotherapy resistance. Downregulation of SSR2 has been shown to increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug, by affecting the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that targeting SSR2 could enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy in HCC patients (Ye2023Downregulation).

Additionally, SSR2 is involved in the miR-876-5p/SSR2 axis, regulated by the long noncoding RNA SNHG14. This axis is crucial for HCC progression, as SNHG14 promotes tumor growth by modulating SSR2 expression (Liao2021Long).

## Interactions
SSR2, also known as TRAPβ, is a component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which includes SSR1, SSR3, and SSR4. This complex plays a crucial role in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SSR2 interacts with SSR1 to form functional complexes, even in the absence of SSR3 or SSR4, highlighting its importance in maintaining the stability and function of the TRAP complex (Phoomak2021The). During ER stress, SSR2, along with SSR1, associates with the chaperone protein BiP, which disrupts their function. This interaction is specific to ER stress conditions and is not observed in wild-type cells treated with thapsigargin, a chemical that induces ER stress (Phoomak2021The).

SSR2 also plays a role in the biosynthesis of proinsulin and insulin in pancreatic β-cells. It supports the function of TRAPα/SSR1, and its deficiency leads to reduced levels of proinsulin and insulin due to decreased proinsulin biosynthesis. This deficiency can be reversed by re-expressing the missing TRAP subunit or overexpressing TRAPα/SSR1, indicating that SSR2 supports TRAPα/SSR1 function (Huang2021Deficient).
