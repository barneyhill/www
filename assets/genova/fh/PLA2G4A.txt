# PLA2G4A

## Overview
The PLA2G4A gene encodes the enzyme cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IVA (cPLA2α), which is a member of the phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular lipid metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of eicosanoids and other bioactive lipid mediators (Kita2019Cytosolic; Lin1993cPLA2). cPLA2α is characterized by its calcium-dependent translocation to cellular membranes and its regulation through phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are essential for its activation and function in various signaling pathways (Clark1991A; Lin1993cPLA2). The enzyme is involved in numerous physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer and psychiatric disorders (Gao2024Copy; Leslie2015Cytosolic).

## Function
The PLA2G4A gene encodes cytosolic phospholipase A2 alpha (cPLA2α), an enzyme that plays a critical role in the liberation of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. This process is essential for the production of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor, which are involved in various physiological and pathological conditions (Kita2019Cytosolic). cPLA2α is activated by extracellular stimuli that increase intracellular calcium levels, leading to its translocation to cellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Kita2019Cytosolic; Clark1991A). The enzyme's activity is further regulated by phosphorylation through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, particularly at the Ser-505 residue, which is crucial for its full activation and function in cellular signaling pathways (Lin1993cPLA2).

In healthy human cells, cPLA2α is involved in membrane phospholipid remodeling and the production of bioactive lipid mediators, which function as hormone-like signaling molecules. These processes are important for maintaining normal physiological functions, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, where cPLA2α plays a protective role (Kita2019Cytosolic). The enzyme's activity is essential for the rapid production of arachidonic acid in response to cellular stimuli, influencing inflammation and homeostasis (Lin1993cPLA2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PLA2G4A gene, which encodes cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α), have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and psychiatric disorders. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PLA2G4A is upregulated, especially in subtypes with MLL fusions and elevated HOXA9 and MEIS1 levels. High expression of PLA2G4A is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter disease-free and overall survival. This gene is considered a potential therapeutic and prognostic marker for AML, with its inhibition showing promise in reducing leukemia cell viability (Hassan2021A).

In multiple myeloma (MM), PLA2G4A is overexpressed, contributing to cancer progression. Inhibition of cPLA2α has been shown to induce apoptosis in MM cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. The overexpression of PLA2G4A in MM is linked to poor patient outcomes, such as relapse and lower survival rates (Mahammad2021Inhibition).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, deletions in the PLA2G4A gene are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. These deletions correlate with specific clinical phenotypes, such as erotomanic delusion in females and poverty of thought in males, and are linked to reduced levels of cPLA2α, potentially affecting neuronal function (Gao2024Copy).

## Interactions
PLA2G4A, also known as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α), engages in several critical protein interactions that regulate its function and localization. It interacts with ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), which is essential for its translocation to intracellular membranes and activation in response to inflammatory stimuli. This interaction occurs at a novel site in the cationic β-groove of the C2 domain, facilitating the production of eicosanoids like prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Lamour2009Ceramide).

PLA2G4A also interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which phosphorylate the enzyme, enhancing its activity. Phosphorylation at serine residues 505, 515, and 727 is necessary for full enzymatic activity (Lamour2009Ceramide; Leslie2015Cytosolic). Additionally, PLA2G4A interacts with the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), which is crucial for leukotriene synthesis (Leslie2015Cytosolic).

In the context of cancer, PLA2G4A has been shown to interact with proteins such as STAT3 and CAP1, which have oncogenic properties in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Bai2020PLA2G4A). These interactions suggest a role for PLA2G4A in modulating malignant phenotypes and influencing tumor progression.
