# SRSF2

## Overview
The SRSF2 gene encodes the serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2, a critical protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. As a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family, SRSF2 plays a pivotal role in both constitutive and alternative splicing by binding to exonic splicing enhancers, thereby influencing exon inclusion or exclusion and contributing to mRNA diversity (Kim2015SRSF2; Li2021Splicing). The protein is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Phelan2011The; Skrdlant2016Characterization). SRSF2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it also participates in transcriptional regulation, genomic stability, and nonsense-mediated decay (Wagner2021Noncanonical). Mutations in the SRSF2 gene are associated with hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Visconte2019Mutations; Shiozawa2018Aberrant).

## Structure
The SRSF2 protein is characterized by a classic RNA recognition motif (RRM) structure, which includes a four-strand anti-parallel β-sheet and two α-helices (Phelan2011The). The RRM domain of SRSF2 is distinct due to its longer and more flexible L3 loop, which is crucial for RNA binding (Phelan2011The). This loop, along with the N- and C-termini, plays a significant role in stabilizing RNA interactions, with specific residues such as R47, D48, and K52 being key to this process (Phelan2011The).

The SRSF2 protein lacks a conserved aromatic residue in the RNP2 motif, which is typically present in other SR proteins, and instead has a lysine residue (K17) in the β1 strand (Phelan2011The). This substitution affects the electrostatic surface potential and hydrophobicity of the protein, contributing to its unique RNA-binding specificity (Phelan2011The).

SRSF2 also contains a serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Skrdlant2016Characterization). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its splicing activity (Skrdlant2016Characterization).

## Function
SRSF2 (serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2) is a crucial component of the splicing machinery in human cells, primarily involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. It plays a significant role in both constitutive and alternative splicing by binding to exonic splicing enhancers, which influences exon inclusion or exclusion, thereby affecting mRNA diversity and gene expression (Kim2015SRSF2; Li2021Splicing). SRSF2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it coordinates the release of RNA polymerase II from promoter-proximal pausing, a critical step for transcriptional elongation (Wagner2021Noncanonical).

In addition to its role in splicing, SRSF2 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and regulating mRNA stability and translation. It interacts with various transcription factors and is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of cell cycle-related genes, thereby influencing cell cycle progression (Li2021Splicing). SRSF2 also participates in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons, by interacting with the exon junction complex (Wagner2021Noncanonical).

The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which affect its stability and function (Edmond2010Acetylation). These diverse roles underscore SRSF2's importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SRSF2 gene are implicated in several hematologic malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations, particularly at proline 95, lead to altered RNA-binding specificity and abnormal RNA splicing, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Visconte2019Mutations; Shiozawa2018Aberrant). In MDS, SRSF2 mutations are associated with impaired hematopoietic differentiation, increased apoptosis, and peripheral cytopenias, resulting in morphologic dysplasia (Kim2015SRSF2). These mutations are also linked to poor prognosis, predicting shorter overall survival and increased risk of progression to AML (Thol2012Frequency).

In AML, SRSF2 mutations are common and often co-occur with other genetic alterations such as ASXL1, IDH2, and RUNX1. They are associated with inferior relapse-free and overall survival (Bamopoulos2020Clinical). The mutations lead to differential splicing of genes involved in critical pathways, including DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Bamopoulos2020Clinical).

SRSF2 mutations also affect mitochondrial function by disrupting the splicing of mitochondrial mRNAs, leading to defects in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and increased mitophagy, which are potential therapeutic targets (Liu2024A).

## Interactions
SRSF2, a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA splicing and gene regulation. It binds to specific RNA sequences through its RNA recognition motif (RRM), influencing splicing outcomes. For example, SRSF2 interacts with exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and has a unique preference for highly degenerated RNA sequences (Li2021Splicing). It also binds to the silencer site ESS2 in HIV-1 RNA, competing with hnRNP A1 for binding (Skrdlant2016Characterization).

SRSF2 forms complexes with other proteins, such as RNA polymerase II, to facilitate viral replication and gene expression in HSV-1 (Li2021Splicing). It interacts with the acetyltransferase CBP/P300 complex, affecting histone modifications and recruiting transcription factors like STAT3 to immune checkpoint gene promoters (Li2021Splicing). SRSF2 also associates with the transcription factor E2F1, recruiting it to the promoters of cell cycle-related genes to regulate cell cycle progression (Li2021Splicing).

In the context of viral infections, SRSF2 interacts with the μ2 protein of the reovirus T1L strain, forming a complex that alters its localization to nuclear speckles, which impacts mRNA splicing and benefits viral replication (RiveraSerrano2017A).
