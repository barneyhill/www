# IFT88

## Overview
IFT88 is a gene that encodes the protein intraflagellar transport 88, a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia, cellular organelles involved in signaling and movement (Taschner2012Architecture; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas). IFT88 plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and is involved in anterograde transport within cilia, ensuring the proper movement of protein particles along axonemal microtubules (Taschner2012Architecture; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas). Beyond its role in cilia, IFT88 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle orientation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (Vitre2020Nonciliary; Robert2007The). Mutations in the IFT88 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, such as craniofacial abnormalities and polycystic kidney disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Tian2017Intraflagellar; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas).

## Structure
IFT88 is a protein characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are degenerate 34-amino acid motifs predicted to form amphipathic helices. These TPRs are arranged in tandem arrays, forming a superhelical structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Taschner2012Architecture; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas). The protein is predicted to contain 15 TPRs, with the N-terminal 119 and C-terminal 67 residues being intrinsically disordered, contributing to a loose and open superhelical structure (Petriman2022Biochemically).

IFT88 interacts with other proteins within the IFT-B complex, such as IFT70 and IFT52, forming a core subcomplex that bridges the IFT-B1 and IFT-B2 subcomplexes. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the IFT complex (Petriman2022Biochemically; Kobayashi2021Cooperation). The C-terminal α-helix region of IFT88 is essential for its interaction with the IFT-A complex, highlighting its role in ciliary retrograde protein trafficking (Kobayashi2021Cooperation).

The protein's structure is validated through crosslinking/mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, confirming the interaction interfaces and structural features (Petriman2022Biochemically). However, specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of IFT88 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
IFT88 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery, specifically part of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia in vertebrate cells (Taschner2012Architecture; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas). In healthy human cells, IFT88 is crucial for ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed, and is involved in anterograde transport within cilia, facilitating the movement of protein particles along axonemal microtubules (Taschner2012Architecture; Pazour2000Chlamydomonas).

IFT88 also plays significant roles beyond cilia formation. It localizes to the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and is involved in regulating the G1-S transition, impacting cell proliferation (Robert2007The; Tian2017Intraflagellar). In non-ciliated cells, IFT88 is implicated in mitotic spindle orientation and dynamics, ensuring proper spindle geometry and chromosome alignment during cell division (Vitre2020Nonciliary). It interacts with proteins such as NuMA and cytoplasmic dynein 1, which are essential for organizing kinetochore fibers into spindle poles (Vitre2020Nonciliary).

IFT88's role extends to craniofacial development, where it regulates primary cilia function in the palatal mesenchyme, crucial for palatogenesis (Tian2017Intraflagellar). Its involvement in these diverse cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and preventing proliferative disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT88 gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, which are disorders caused by defects in cilia function. These include craniofacial abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate, as well as more complex syndromes like Holoprosencephaly 9, Culler-Jones syndrome, Pallister Hall syndrome, and Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, all of which can present with orofacial clefting among other anomalies (Tian2017Intraflagellar). In mouse models, loss of IFT88 leads to severe craniofacial defects, including bilateral cleft lip and palate, due to impaired primary cilia function and disrupted Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling (Tian2017Intraflagellar).

IFT88 mutations are also linked to inherited retinal degeneration (IRD), where they result in abnormal ciliogenesis and contribute to retinal pathology (Chekuri2018IFT88). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg266* and p.Ala568Thr, have been identified in individuals with non-syndromic recessive retinal degeneration, leading to stunted or absent cilia (Chekuri2018IFT88).

Additionally, IFT88 is implicated in polycystic kidney disease, as its mouse homologue, Tg737, is essential for ciliary assembly in the kidney. Mutations in Tg737 result in significantly shorter cilia and are associated with polycystic kidney disease (Pazour2000Chlamydomonas).

## Interactions
IFT88 is a core component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B, where it plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of cilia. It forms part of a ternary complex with IFT52 and IFT46, which is essential for the stability and assembly of the IFT-B complex (Lucker2010Direct). IFT88 directly interacts with IFT52 and IFT46, and these interactions are supported by yeast-based two-hybrid analysis and chemical cross-linking experiments (Lucker2010Direct). The IFT88/52 module also binds to the IFT57/38 components of the IFT-B2 complex, which is critical for the formation of the complete IFT-B complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

IFT88 interacts with the IFT-A complex through its C-terminal α-helix region, which is necessary for binding to IFT-A subunits like IFT144 and IFT122. Deletion of this region reduces its binding affinity to IFT-A subunits, although it retains interactions with other IFT-B subunits such as IFT52 and IFT70B (Kobayashi2021Cooperation). IFT88 also forms a connecting tetramer with IFT57 and IFT38, which is important for interaction with the kinesin-II motor complex, crucial for ciliogenesis (Kobayashi2021Cooperation).
