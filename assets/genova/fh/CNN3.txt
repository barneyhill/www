# CNN3

## Overview
Calponin 3 (CNN3) is a gene that encodes the calponin 3 protein, a member of the calponin family known for its role in actin filament regulation. The calponin 3 protein is categorized as an actin-binding protein, characterized by its conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which facilitates its interaction with actin filaments. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cellular contractility, and cell fusion. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cells across different tissues, such as the lens epithelium and the nervous system. CNN3's involvement in cellular dynamics is modulated through phosphorylation by kinases like ROCK and MEKK1, which influence its binding to actin and its subcellular localization. Alterations in CNN3 expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and neural tube defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Maddala2020Calponin3; Liu2016Calponin; Junghans2017Cnn3).

## Structure
Calponin 3 (CNN3) is a protein encoded by the CNN3 gene, characterized by its involvement in actin filament regulation. The primary structure of CNN3 includes a conserved N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which is a sequence motif of about 100 amino acids found in various actin-binding proteins (Liu2016Calponin). This domain is followed by two actin-binding sites located in the middle region of the protein, which are conserved across calponin isoforms and are involved in inhibiting actomyosin MgATPase activity and stabilizing actin filaments (Liu2016Calponin).

The C-terminal region of CNN3 is variable and acidic, affecting its interaction with F-actin and contributing to its regulatory functions (Liu2016Calponin). This region also contains phosphorylation sites, such as Ser293 and Ser296, which are crucial for CNN3's role in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell fusion processes (Shibukawa2010Calponin). Phosphorylation at these sites, mediated by kinases like ROCK2, influences CNN3's binding to actin and its subcellular distribution (Shibukawa2010Calponin).

CNN3 is known to have splice variants, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Function
Calponin 3 (CNN3) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular functions. In healthy human cells, CNN3 is involved in maintaining the epithelial phenotype, particularly in lens epithelial cells, where it helps organize the actin cytoskeleton and influences cell adhesion and contractility (Maddala2020Calponin3). CNN3 is abundantly expressed in the lens epithelium and colocalizes with F-actin at the plasma membrane, contributing to the maintenance of cell shape and integrity (Maddala2020Calponin3).

CNN3 also plays a role in cellular contractility by modulating myosin ATPase activity through its phosphorylation, which is mediated by MEKK1. This phosphorylation enhances cellular contractility and is part of a feedback loop that regulates mechanotransduction (Hirata2016MEKK1-dependent). In myoblasts, CNN3 acts as a negative regulator of cell fusion during differentiation, with its inhibitory effect being modulated by phosphorylation through the Rho-associated kinase pathway (Shibukawa2013Rockdependent).

In the nervous system, CNN3 is involved in neuronal remodeling and dendritic spine plasticity, highlighting its importance in neural development and function (Liu2016Calponin). Overall, CNN3 is critical for maintaining normal cellular functions and development across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNN3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), CNN3 is highly expressed and promotes the proliferation and cell cycle transition of lymphoma cells. Silencing CNN3 in these cells induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in DLBCL (Xing2023Promoting). 

In the context of muscle development, CNN3 knockdown in myoblasts impairs proliferation, differentiation, and protein synthesis, primarily through the mTOR pathway. This disruption is associated with increased expression of genes involved in necroptosis, apoptosis, and inflammation, indicating a potential role in muscle-related diseases such as muscular dystrophy (She2021Knockdown).

CNN3 also plays a critical role in neural development. Deficiency in CNN3 leads to severe brain development defects, including failure in neural tube closure, which results in embryonic lethality in mice. This highlights its importance in neural tube morphogenesis and suggests that mutations or dysregulation of CNN3 could contribute to neural tube defects (Junghans2017Cnn3). 

In the ocular lens, CNN3 deficiency is linked to increased epithelial plasticity and fibrogenic activity, which may contribute to conditions like posterior capsule opacification (Maddala2020Calponin3).

## Interactions
Calponin 3 (CNN3) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to F-actin with significant affinity, although it does not bind to microtubules, desmin, tropomyosin, calmodulin, and S100 (Hsieh2023Evolution). CNN3 competes with calponin 1 for binding to F-actin but has a weaker inhibitory effect on actomyosin MgATPase (Hsieh2023Evolution). 

CNN3 is phosphorylated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) at Ser293 and Ser296, which is crucial for its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and myoblast fusion (Shibukawa2013Rockdependent). This phosphorylation affects CNN3's binding to actin, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane flexibility (Shibukawa2010Calponin). 

In fibroblasts, CNN3 interacts with ERK1/2 and PKCa, translocating from stress fibers to the cytosol and podosome-like structures upon stimulation (Shibukawa2013Rockdependent). It also forms a complex with MEKK1, which phosphorylates CNN3 at Thr288, enhancing cellular contractility by modulating its inhibitory effect on myosin ATPase activity (Hirata2016MEKK1-dependent). 

In human osteosarcoma cells, CNN3 localizes to stress fibers and interacts with α-actinin-1, suggesting a close association between these proteins (Ciuba2018Calponin3).
