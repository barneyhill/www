# SRSF10

## Overview
SRSF10 is a gene that encodes the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 10, a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family. This protein functions as a sequence-dependent splicing regulator, playing a pivotal role in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. The activity of the SRSF10 protein is modulated by its phosphorylation state, allowing it to act as either a splicing activator or inhibitor, which is crucial for the regulation of gene expression and cellular differentiation processes (Meinke2020Srsf10). SRSF10 is involved in various cellular functions, including muscle differentiation and glucose metabolism, by influencing the splicing of specific target genes (Wei2015SRSF10). Its interactions with other splicing factors and kinases further underscore its importance in maintaining proper splicing patterns essential for normal cellular function and organismal health (Shkreta2016Modulation). Additionally, alterations in SRSF10 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yadav2021ERK12EGR1SRSF10).

## Function
SRSF10 is a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family and functions as a sequence-dependent splicing regulator. It plays a crucial role in alternative splicing (AS), influencing both exon inclusion and exclusion in pre-mRNA processing. SRSF10's activity is modulated by its phosphorylation state; it acts as a splicing activator when phosphorylated and as a splicing inhibitor when dephosphorylated (Meinke2020Srsf10). This dual role allows SRSF10 to regulate its own expression through an autoregulatory feedback loop, which involves a highly conserved splicing enhancer element within its pre-mRNA (Meinke2020Srsf10).

In muscle cells, SRSF10 is essential for myoblast differentiation by regulating the splicing of muscle-specific genes such as Lrrfip1, Fxr1, and Mef2a, which are important for muscle development and differentiation (Wei2015SRSF10). In hepatocytes, SRSF10 regulates glucose production by modulating the splicing of PGC1a, a key factor in gluconeogenesis, particularly during fasting (Wei2015SRSF10).

SRSF10's function is position-dependent, activating or repressing exon inclusion based on its binding location within the pre-mRNA (Zhou2014Transcriptome). Its regulatory activities are crucial for maintaining proper splicing patterns, which are essential for normal cellular function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRSF10 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck cancer (HNC), SRSF10 is upregulated, and this upregulation is inversely correlated with patient survival, suggesting its role as an oncogenic driver (Yadav2021ERK12EGR1SRSF10). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SRSF10 promotes oncogenesis by maintaining exon 10 inclusion of the SREK1 gene, and its expression is associated with poor prognosis (Chang2022The). SRSF10 also stabilizes CDC25A by promoting exon 6 skipping, which enhances cell proliferation and invasion in HCC (Liu2022SRSF10).

In cervical cancer, particularly HPV16/18-positive cases, SRSF10 is upregulated and contributes to tumorigenesis by modulating the alternative splicing of IL1RAP, promoting NF-κB activation, and upregulating CD47, which helps cancer cells evade immune surveillance (Liu2018SRSF10mediated). SRSF10's role in alternative splicing is also linked to DNA damage response, affecting genes involved in apoptosis and cell-cycle control (Shkreta2016SRSF10).

In pulmonary carcinoids, SRSF10 is associated with tumor size and diagnosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis (BlázquezEncinas2023Altered). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SRSF10 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SRSF10 is a splicing factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing RNA splicing regulation. It binds to the ISS-N1 silencer in the SMN2 gene, where it acts as a repressor of exon 7 inclusion. This interaction is position-dependent and involves competition with other splicing factors such as SRSF1, which promotes exon 7 inclusion, and hnRNP A1, which also represses exon 7 inclusion through different mechanisms (Frederiksen2020Identification).

SRSF10 interacts with hnRNP proteins, including hnRNP A1, hnRNP F/H, and hnRNP K, particularly in response to DNA damage. These interactions are modulated by the phosphorylation status of SRSF10, which can be altered by compounds like oxaliplatin and 1C8. Oxaliplatin treatment disrupts SRSF10's interaction with hnRNP F/H, promoting the splicing of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS variant, while maintaining its interaction with hnRNP K (Shkreta2016SRSF10; Cloutier2018hnRNP).

SRSF10 also interacts with SR protein kinases SRPK1 and SRPK2, and its phosphorylation status is crucial for its regulatory functions. The compound 1C8 promotes SRSF10 dephosphorylation, affecting its interactions with other splicing factors like hTRA2β and its role in HIV-1 replication (Shkreta2016Modulation).
