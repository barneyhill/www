# SPACA6

## Overview
SPACA6 is a gene that encodes the sperm acrosome associated 6 protein, which is a single-pass transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the testis. This protein plays a critical role in the process of sperm-egg adhesion and fusion during fertilization, a key step in the formation of a diploid organism. The SPACA6 protein is characterized by a soluble monomeric ectodomain, which includes a four-helix bundle and an immunoglobulin-like domain, connected by a hinge region. It is part of a conserved superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins and shares structural similarities with IZUMO1, another protein involved in gamete fusion. Despite these similarities, SPACA6 and IZUMO1 are not functionally redundant, as knockout studies have demonstrated that the absence of SPACA6 results in male infertility due to the inability of sperm to fuse with the oocyte (Vance2022SPACA6; Barbaux2020Sperm).

## Structure
The SPACA6 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a soluble monomeric ectodomain, expressed primarily in the testis. Its ectodomain is stable and homogeneous, with a molecular weight of approximately 26.2 kDa, indicating it does not oligomerize (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). The ectodomain structure was determined at a 2.2-Å resolution, revealing two main domains: an N-terminal four-helix bundle (4HB) and a C-terminal Ig-like β-sandwich domain, connected by a hinge region (Vance2022SPACA6a). The 4HB domain features four main helices arranged in a coiled-coil fashion, with a small additional helix packing perpendicularly, creating a triangular shape (Vance2022SPACA6a). The Ig-like domain consists of two β-sheets with a hydrophobic core, following the pattern of Ig-like β-sandwich domains (Vance2022SPACA6).

The structure is stabilized by six disulfide bonds, with a conserved arginine residue interacting with the hydrophobic core and solvent (Vance2022SPACA6a). The ectodomain includes an N-linked glycan at Asn243, indicating post-translational modification (Vance2022SPACA6a). The SPACA6 protein is part of a conserved superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins, sharing structural similarities with IZUMO1, another protein involved in gamete fusion (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6).

## Function
The SPACA6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of sperm-egg adhesion and fusion during fertilization. This protein is expressed almost exclusively in the testis and is localized within the inner membrane of sperm prior to the acrosome reaction, relocating to the equatorial region post-reaction (Vance2022SPACA6). SPACA6 is essential for the fusion of sperm and oocyte membranes, a key step in the formation of a diploid organism (Vance2022SPACA6). The protein is part of a molecular complex that includes IZUMO1, and together they are necessary for recruiting other essential molecular actors, possibly a fusogen, to facilitate fusion (Barbaux2020Sperm).

SPACA6 shares structural similarities with IZUMO1, another protein crucial for gamete fusion, suggesting that they belong to a larger superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins (Vance2022SPACA6). Despite these similarities, SPACA6 and IZUMO1 are not functionally redundant, as knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of SPACA6 results in male infertility due to the inability of sperm to fuse with the oocyte (Barbaux2020Sperm). The protein's structure includes a four-helix bundle and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are connected by a quasi-flexible region, providing insights into its role in gamete fusion (Vance2022SPACA6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPACA6 gene can lead to male infertility due to impaired sperm-egg interaction. The absence of SPACA6 results in the inability of sperm to fuse with the oocyte, causing sperm to accumulate in the perivitelline space, which is a condition that can be bypassed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (Barbaux2020Sperm). In mice, knockout models lacking SPACA6 expression confirm male sterility, as sperm fail to fertilize oocytes both in vivo and in vitro (Barbaux2020Sperm). 

The SPACA6 protein is part of a complex necessary for gamete fusion, potentially interacting with other proteins like IZUMO1, and its absence does not affect the localization of IZUMO1 during the acrosomal reaction (Barbaux2020Sperm). In zebrafish, SPACA6 forms a trimeric complex with Izumo1 and Tmem81, essential for sperm-egg interaction, and mutations in any of these genes result in male sterility (Deneke2023A). Although specific clinical implications or diseases directly associated with SPACA6 mutations in humans are not detailed, the gene's role in fertility suggests that alterations could contribute to conditions like subfertility or azoospermia (Barbaux2020Sperm).

## Interactions
SPACA6 is a protein involved in sperm-egg adhesion and fusion during fertilization. It is part of a trimeric complex with IZUMO1 and TMEM81, which is essential for male fertility in vertebrates, including zebrafish and mice. This complex is predicted to form a specific interface for sperm-egg interaction, with SPACA6 playing a crucial role in this process (Deneke2023A). 

Despite structural similarities to IZUMO1, SPACA6 does not bind directly to IZUMO1 or JUNO, as confirmed by biolayer interferometry and pull-down assays. This lack of interaction is attributed to differences in surface residues and domain orientation between SPACA6 and IZUMO1 (Vance2022SPACA6a; Vance2022SPACA6). 

SPACA6 is suggested to interact indirectly with other proteins within a molecular complex necessary for gamete fusion. It may recruit a fusogenic actor crucial for the fusion process, although the specific molecular mechanisms and interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Barbaux2020Sperm). The protein's flexibility, particularly in its hinge region, may play a role in its function, although its exact role in gamete fusion is still unclear (Vance2022SPACA6a).
