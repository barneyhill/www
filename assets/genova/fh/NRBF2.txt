# NRBF2

## Overview
The NRBF2 gene encodes the nuclear receptor binding factor 2 protein, which is a critical component in cellular autophagy and endocytic pathways. As a regulatory protein, NRBF2 is involved in the modulation of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1), playing a pivotal role in the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes. The protein is characterized by its microtubule-interacting and targeting (MIT) domain and a coiled-coil homodimerization domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as Beclin 1 and Vps34, enhancing their kinase activity (Ohashi2021Class; Lu2014NRBF2). NRBF2 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with significant implications in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Alterations in NRBF2 expression have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2022NRBF2mediated; Cai2020NRBF2).

## Structure
NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2) is a protein involved in autophagy, characterized by a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of NRBF2 includes a microtubule-interacting and targeting (MIT) domain at the N terminus and a coiled-coil homodimerization domain at the C terminus, flanked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Ohashi2021Class). The secondary structure features alpha helices, particularly within the MIT domain, which is responsible for binding to the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I (PI3KC3-C1) (Young2019Structural).

The tertiary structure of NRBF2 is described as having a mushroom-like shape, with a four-helix bundle segment forming the cap and a coiled-coil segment forming the stalk, followed by a helical extension (tail) (Ohashi2021Class). In terms of quaternary structure, NRBF2 forms strong homodimers via the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its binding and integrity within the PI3KC3-C1 complex (Ohashi2021Class).

NRBF2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by MTOR at the S113 and S120 residues in the IDR, and by ULK1, although the exact residue for ULK1 is unknown (Ohashi2021Class). There are three known isoforms of NRBF2, with isoform 2 lacking the IDR and isoform 3 missing the first two helices of the MIT domain (Ohashi2021Class).

## Function
NRBF2 (nuclear receptor binding factor 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in autophagy, a cellular process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, NRBF2 is a component of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, where it modulates the activity of the complex by interacting with proteins such as Beclin 1, Vps34, Vps15, and Atg14L. This interaction is crucial for the initiation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are structures that sequester and degrade cellular waste (Lu2014NRBF2).

NRBF2 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by enhancing the lipid kinase activity of Vps34, which is necessary for the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a lipid that recruits other proteins to the autophagosome membrane (Lu2014NRBF2). It also interacts with the MON1-CCZ1 complex to facilitate the activation of RAB7, a GTPase important for autophagosome maturation (Ohashi2021Class; Cai2020NRBF2).

NRBF2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with high levels in the blood, liver, and muscle, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by supporting autophagic and endocytic pathways (Ohashi2021Class). Despite its involvement in these pathways, NRBF2-null mutant mice are viable, suggesting a supportive rather than essential role in autophagy under normal conditions (Lu2014NRBF2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NRBF2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), NRBF2 expression is reduced in key brain regions such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. This downregulation is associated with impaired autophagy, leading to the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, which are critical factors in AD pathogenesis (Lachance2019Autophagy; Cai2020NRBF2). The reduced expression of NRBF2 correlates with the clinical dementia rating score, suggesting its role in AD progression (Lachance2019Autophagy).

In glioblastoma (GBM), NRBF2 expression is upregulated following radiotherapy, contributing to radioresistance by enhancing autophagic processes that support tumor cell survival and proliferation. Targeting NRBF2 may offer a therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance (Kim2022NRBF2mediated).

NRBF2 also plays a role in cognitive functions, as evidenced by learning and memory deficits in mice with nervous system-specific NRBF2 knockout. These deficits are linked to altered gene expression in the hippocampus, affecting synaptic function and protein quality control (Ouyang2020Nuclear).

## Interactions
NRBF2 is a protein that participates in several critical interactions within the cell, primarily related to autophagy and endocytic pathways. It is a component of the Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, where it interacts with Beclin 1, Vps34, Vps15, and Atg14L. The interaction with Atg14L is crucial for linking NRBF2 to Beclin 1, and this association enhances Vps34 kinase activity, which is vital for autophagy regulation (Lu2014NRBF2).

NRBF2 also interacts with the PI3KC3-C1 complex, affecting its dynamics and architecture. It binds with high affinity to this complex, influencing the structural dynamics of its components, including ATG14, BECN1, VPS15, and VPS34. This interaction leads to significant conformational changes, particularly in the VPS34 kinase domain, enhancing the complex's kinase activity (Young2016Dynamics).

In the endocytic pathway, NRBF2 interacts with VPS33A, a subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are involved in endosomal tethering. It also associates with the MON1-CCZ1 complex, which facilitates the transition from early to late endosomes, although its precise role in this pathway is still under investigation (Ohashi2021Class).
