# SRI

## Overview
The SRI gene encodes the protein sorcin, a member of the penta-EF-hand (PEF) family of calcium-binding proteins. Sorcin is characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions, which induces conformational changes that facilitate its interaction with various cellular components. This protein plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling and homeostasis, influencing the function of calcium channels and transporters across different cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (Lalioti2014Sorcin; Colotti2014Sorcin). Sorcin's interactions extend to protein kinases and vesicle trafficking proteins, highlighting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and intracellular transport processes (Lalioti2014Sorcin). Clinically, sorcin is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiac conditions, where its expression levels and interactions contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression (Exertier2024Sorcin; Wang2021Soluble).

## Structure
Sorcin is a calcium-binding protein encoded by the SRI gene, belonging to the penta-EF-hand (PEF) family. Its molecular structure is characterized by a flexible, glycine-rich N-terminal domain and a C-terminal calcium-binding domain (SCBD) composed of eight alpha helices forming five EF-hand motifs (Ilari2015Structural; Colotti2014Sorcin). The EF-hands are organized into pairs: EF1 pairs with EF2, EF3 with EF4, and the odd EF5 pairs with another EF5 from the contralateral monomer, facilitating dimerization (Colotti2014Sorcin; Genovese2018Molecular).

The SCBD can be divided into two subdomains: EF1-3, which binds calcium with high affinity, and EF4-5, which mediates dimerization but does not bind calcium with high affinity (Ilari2015Structural; Genovese2018Molecular). Calcium binding induces a conformational change from a 'closed' to an 'open' structure, exposing hydrophobic residues and enabling Sorcin to translocate from the cytosol to membranes (Ilari2015Structural; Colotti2014Sorcin).

Sorcin undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as NS5A and PLK1 (Mao2020The). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, with the mitochondrial 19-kDa Sorcin B-isoform potentially interacting with targets with higher affinity than the A-isoform (Ilari2015Structural).

## Function
Sorcin (SRI) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a crucial role in calcium signaling and homeostasis within various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria. It is part of the penta-EF-hand (PEF) family and is involved in modulating the activity of calcium channels and transporters, such as the ryanodine receptor (RYR), Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1), L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (Lalioti2014Sorcin; Genovese2020Profiling). Sorcin's interactions with these proteins are calcium-dependent, and it regulates their activity, thus participating in calcium-induced calcium release and maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis (Lalioti2014Sorcin).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, sorcin is involved in vesicle trafficking and is dynamically localized to different subcellular sites, such as the nucleus, plasma membrane, and ER-derived vesicles, during the cell cycle (Lalioti2014Sorcin). Sorcin also interacts with protein kinases like Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), influencing their activity through phosphorylation, which is important for cell cycle regulation, mitosis, and cytokinesis (Lalioti2014Sorcin; Genovese2020Profiling). Its overexpression has been linked to multi-drug resistance in various cancers, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lalioti2014Sorcin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SRI gene, which encodes the protein sorcin, have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In cancer, sorcin is frequently overexpressed and is associated with multidrug resistance (MDR), contributing to poor prognosis in several cancer types, including pancreatic, liver, and breast cancers (Battista2020Roles; Exertier2024Sorcin). Sorcin's overexpression enhances cancer cell survival, drug resistance, and other cancer hallmarks such as angiogenesis, migration, and invasion (Exertier2024Sorcin). It interacts with proteins like TRAP1 and EGFR, influencing anti-apoptotic functions and promoting cancer cell migration (Exertier2024Sorcin; Tito2023Sorcin).

In neurodegenerative diseases, sorcin is overexpressed in conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where it is involved in calcium dysregulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, contributing to neuronal dysfunction (Genovese2020Sorcin; Wang2021Soluble). Sorcin's interactions with proteins such as tau and presenilin 2 are implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Wang2021Soluble).

In cardiac disorders, sorcin plays a role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. Mutations, such as F112L, impair its regulatory ability, potentially leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension (Wang2021Soluble). These findings underscore sorcin's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
Sorcin (SRI) is a calcium-binding protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with calcium channels and exchangers such as the ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), L-type calcium channels, and Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (NCX), which are crucial for calcium homeostasis in cardiac and smooth muscle cells (Lalioti2014Sorcin; Colotti2014Sorcin). Sorcin's interaction with RyR2 is calcium-dependent and inhibits calcium release, while its interaction with SERCA enhances calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Colotti2014Sorcin).

Sorcin also interacts with serine-threonine kinases such as Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), Aurora A, and Aurora B, which are involved in cell cycle regulation. It is phosphorylated by PLK1, which induces PLK1 autophosphorylation and regulates its kinase activity, playing a role in mitosis and cytokinesis (Lalioti2014Sorcin). Sorcin's interaction with PLK1 is significant for kinase regulation during mitosis, and it colocalizes with PLK1 in the midbody during cytokinesis (Lalioti2014Sorcin).

In addition, sorcin interacts with proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, such as Rab10, and colocalizes with calreticulin in ER-derived vesicles (Lalioti2014Sorcin). These interactions highlight sorcin's role in linking calcium signaling to vesicle trafficking and its necessity for mitosis.
