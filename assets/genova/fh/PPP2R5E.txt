# PPP2R5E

## Overview
The PPP2R5E gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'epsilon, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase. This regulatory subunit plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including microtubule organization, neuronal function, and DNA repair. The protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'epsilon is involved in stabilizing microtubule crosslinking factor 1 (MTCL1), regulating Tau protein phosphorylation, and dephosphorylating key DNA damage response proteins. These functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease mechanisms, such as Alzheimer's disease and various cancers (Theendakara2017Downregulation; Hyodo2016A; Kashani2023Unlocking).

## Function
PPP2R5E encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP2R5E plays a crucial role in maintaining microtubule organization by stabilizing microtubule crosslinking factor 1 (MTCL1). This stabilization is essential for proper cell shape, polarity, and division, as PPP2R5E's phosphatase activity prevents the degradation of MTCL1, thereby supporting microtubule structure and function (Hyodo2016A).

PPP2R5E is also involved in regulating the phosphorylation of Tau protein, which is critical for neuronal function. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PPP2R5E helps maintain normal Tau phosphorylation levels by forming a stable complex with PP2A C, which is disrupted in the presence of the ApoE4 allele, leading to abnormal Tau phosphorylation (Theendakara2017Downregulation).

Additionally, PPP2R5E is implicated in DNA repair processes by dephosphorylating DNA damage response proteins such as CHK1, CHK2, and ATM, which influences DNA repair and cellular responses to damage (Kashani2023Unlocking). These functions highlight PPP2R5E's role in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and signal transduction.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP2R5E gene have been implicated in various cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), downregulation of PPP2R5E is a common event that affects the oncogenic potential of leukemic cells, suggesting a role in the development or progression of AML (Kashani2022Pleiotropy). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PPP2R5E is targeted by microRNA-19b, leading to tumorigenesis and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Decreased expression of PPP2R5E in NSCLC is associated with apoptosis resistance and supports tumorigenesis (Kashani2022Pleiotropy). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PPP2R5E is upregulated in tumors, correlating with changes in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression, which may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of pancreatic cancer (van2023Human). 

The role of PPP2R5E in breast cancer risk has also been explored, with genetic variations in the gene potentially modifying risk, particularly in women with proliferative breast disease (Dupont2009Protein). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP2R5E in cancer biology, with its dysregulation contributing to tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.

## Interactions
PPP2R5E, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in several important protein interactions. It forms a complex with the catalytic subunit PPP2CA and the structural subunit PPP2R1A of PP2A, which is crucial for its function in dephosphorylation processes (Hyodo2016A). PPP2R5E interacts with microtubule crosslinking factor 1 (MTCL1), a protein essential for microtubule organization. This interaction is significant for the stabilization of MTCL1, as PPP2R5E's phosphatase activity is necessary for maintaining MTCL1 levels (Hyodo2016A). Among the B' family members, PPP2R5E shows the strongest association with MTCL1, indicating a specific regulatory role (Hyodo2016A).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PPP2R5E forms a complex with the PP2A catalytic subunit, which is disrupted in the presence of the ApoE4 allele, leading to increased tau phosphorylation, a hallmark of the disease (Theendakara2017Downregulation). In glioblastoma, PPP2R5E is targeted by miR-19b, which contributes to temozolomide resistance by affecting the PP2A complex's activity (Kashani2023Unlocking). These interactions highlight PPP2R5E's role in various cellular processes and its potential implications in disease mechanisms.
