# KRTAP4-7

## Overview
KRTAP4-7 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-7, which is part of a family of proteins involved in the structural integrity of hair. These proteins are categorized as keratin-associated proteins, which play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the hair shaft by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The KRTAP4-7 gene is expressed predominantly in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the mechanical properties and resilience of hair fibers. Alterations in the expression or mutations of KRTAP4-7 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including chemotherapy resistance in Wilms tumor and hair structure abnormalities such as alopecia (Choochuen2024Discovery; Hintze2020Alopecia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRTAP4-7 gene have been associated with chemotherapy resistance in advanced-stage Wilms tumor (WT) patients. A study identified KRTAP4-7 as one of four genes significantly linked to chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that mutations in this gene could serve as potential markers for predicting resistance to chemotherapy in WT patients. This resistance is associated with poorer 5-year overall survival rates in affected patients (Choochuen2024Discovery).

In the context of congenital heart defects, a compound heterozygous variant in KRTAP4-7 was identified, although no significant gene-disease associations were established based on genetic data analysis scores (Miller2021A).

In harlequin mutant mice, the loss of KRTAP4-7 expression in the hair cortex is linked to alopecia, indicating its role in hair follicle development. The down-regulation of KRTAP4-7, along with other keratin-associated proteins, contributes to hair shaft fragility and alopecia in this model, although it is not directly due to AIF protein deficiency (Hintze2020Alopecia).

Overall, KRTAP4-7 mutations and expression alterations are implicated in chemotherapy resistance in WT and hair structure abnormalities, with potential but unconfirmed links to congenital heart defects.
