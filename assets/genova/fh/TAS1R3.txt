# TAS1R3

## Overview
The TAS1R3 gene encodes the taste 1 receptor member 3 protein, which is a critical component of the taste perception system in humans. This protein is a member of the T1R family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and plays a pivotal role in the detection of sweet and umami flavors. TAS1R3 forms heterodimers with TAS1R2 to function as a sweet taste receptor and with TAS1R1 to serve as an umami taste receptor. These receptor complexes are expressed in taste bud cells and are also found in the gastrointestinal tract, where they contribute to glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. The TAS1R3 protein is characterized by a large extracellular domain and a heptahelical transmembrane domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with various ligands and modulators. Genetic variations in the TAS1R3 gene have been linked to differences in taste sensitivity and have potential implications in dietary preferences and health conditions such as obesity and cancer (Behrens2014Taste; Carey2022Impact; Bachmanov2007Taste).

## Structure
The TAS1R3 protein is a member of the T1R family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in sweet and umami taste perception. It is characterized by a large extracellular N-terminal domain, which includes a Venus flytrap module and a cysteine-rich domain, connected to a heptahelical transmembrane domain composed of seven transmembrane helices (Bachmanov2014Genetics; Bachmanov2007Taste). The primary structure of TAS1R3 consists of 842-858 amino acids, encoded by six exons (Bachmanov2014Genetics; Bachmanov2007Taste).

The tertiary structure of TAS1R3 involves the folding of these helices and domains, facilitating its function as a receptor. The quaternary structure is formed when TAS1R3 heterodimerizes with either TAS1R1 or TAS1R2, which is essential for its role in taste perception (Bachmanov2014Genetics; Bassoli2014The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, affecting the receptor's function and stability. Alternative splicing of the TAS1R3 gene has been observed, potentially leading to different isoforms of the protein (Bachmanov2007Taste). The transmembrane domain of TAS1R3 also serves as a site for allosteric modulation, interacting with various compounds that influence receptor activation (Sanematsu2023Prediction).

## Function
The TAS1R3 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the sweet taste receptor, which is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in detecting sweet-tasting substances. This receptor functions as a heterodimer with TAS1R2 to recognize a variety of sweet substances, including sugars, artificial sweeteners, and sweet proteins (Sanematsu2023Prediction). The TAS1R3 protein is expressed in type II taste bud cells and is co-expressed with either T1R1 or T1R2, forming heterodimers that function as taste receptors for sweet and umami flavors (Bachmanov2014Genetics).

In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, TAS1R3 is expressed in enteroendocrine cells, where it plays a role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. It detects sugars and triggers the release of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, which are crucial for insulin secretion (Behrens2014Taste). TAS1R3 also influences the expression of the Na+-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1), enhancing carbohydrate absorption (Behrens2014Taste). Additionally, TAS1R3 is involved in the regulation of gut barrier function and inflammation, as its deficiency can alter gut microbiome composition and increase the expression of genes related to gut integrity (Shon2023Gut).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAS1R3 gene have been associated with various clinical implications. In the context of cancer, the expression of TAS1R3 is often higher in tumors compared to normal tissues, and its expression levels have been linked to survival outcomes in certain cancers. For instance, higher TAS1R3 expression is associated with shorter survival times in kidney clear cell carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma (Carey2022Impact). This suggests that TAS1R3 could serve as a prognostic marker in these cancers.

In terms of taste perception, nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in TAS1R3, such as C2269T, have been linked to variations in taste sensitivity to glutamate. These genetic variations are more prevalent in individuals classified as nontasters or hypotasters of glutamate, indicating a genetic basis for taste sensitivity differences (Raliou2009Nonsynonymous). Additionally, specific SNPs in TAS1R3, like C-1572T and G-1266A, are associated with a reduced ability to recognize sweet stimuli, which may influence dietary preferences and contribute to obesity (Cecati2022TAS1R3). These findings highlight the role of TAS1R3 in taste perception and its potential impact on dietary habits and related health conditions.

## Interactions
TAS1R3 is a protein that forms part of the heterodimeric taste receptor complexes involved in sweet and umami taste perception. It interacts with TAS1R2 to form the sweet taste receptor and with TAS1R1 to form the umami taste receptor. These interactions are crucial for detecting sweet compounds and amino acids, respectively (Behrens2016G).

In the context of sweet taste, TAS1R3 interacts with various sweeteners and modulators. It binds sweeteners such as cyclamate and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, as well as the sweetness inhibitor lactisole, within its transmembrane domain (TMD) (Pallante2021On). Cyclamate acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) in humans, enhancing the receptor's response to sweet compounds, while lactisole serves as a negative allosteric modulator (NAM), inhibiting sweet taste perception (Sanematsu2023Prediction).

TAS1R3 also plays a role in the umami taste receptor complex, where it pairs with TAS1R1. This heteromer responds to L-glutamate, with TAS1R3 being essential for the receptor's function (Behrens2016G). The interaction of TAS1R3 with these subunits and ligands highlights its importance in taste perception and modulation.
