# TBX6

## Overview
TBX6 is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor 6, a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation and differentiation of the paraxial mesoderm. This transcription factor is integral to the regulation of gene expression during somite formation, a process essential for the development of vertebrae and skeletal muscles. TBX6 functions by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the expression of target genes involved in mesodermal patterning and differentiation (White2005Dll1). It operates within a genetic network that includes interactions with the WNT signaling pathway and Ripply proteins, which are crucial for its regulatory functions and degradation, respectively (Hofmann2004WNT; Yabe2023Ripply). Mutations in the TBX6 gene are associated with various congenital conditions, including TBX6-associated congenital scoliosis and spondylocostal dysostosis, underscoring its clinical significance in human developmental disorders (Liu2019TBX6associated; Yang2020Mutational).

## Function
The TBX6 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and differentiation of the paraxial mesoderm, a precursor to structures such as vertebrae and skeletal muscles. TBX6 is expressed in the primitive streak, tailbud, and presomitic mesoderm during embryogenesis, where it regulates the specification and patterning of these tissues (White2005Dll1). The protein functions by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing the expression of target genes necessary for somite formation (White2005Dll1). 

TBX6 is involved in a genetic network with other factors such as Wnt3a and Msgn1, which are essential for paraxial mesoderm formation and differentiation (Nowotschin2012Interaction). It acts downstream of Wnt signaling, and its expression is crucial for the proper segmentation and patterning of the mesoderm (Nowotschin2012Interaction). In the absence of TBX6, there is a failure in mesodermal differentiation, leading to ectopic neural tube formation, highlighting its role in repressing neural fate and promoting mesodermal lineage commitment (Chapman1998Three; Nowotschin2012Interaction). TBX6's activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds DNA to regulate gene expression (White2005Dll1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TBX6 gene are associated with several congenital conditions, primarily affecting the spine. TBX6-associated congenital scoliosis (TACS) is a clinically distinct subtype of congenital scoliosis linked to compound inheritance involving a TBX6 loss-of-function variant and a risk haplotype. This genetic model accounts for approximately 10% of congenital scoliosis cases and is characterized by specific vertebral malformations such as hemivertebrae and butterfly vertebrae, particularly in the lower spine (Liu2019TBX6associated).

TBX6 mutations are also implicated in spondylocostal dysostosis, a severe skeletal dysplasia syndrome marked by multiple segmentation defects of the spine and rib anomalies (Yang2020Mutational). Additionally, increased TBX6 gene dosage, such as from 16p11.2 duplications, can lead to congenital vertebral malformations, particularly affecting the cervical vertebrae (Ren2019IncreasedTBX6gene).

Beyond spinal conditions, TBX6 mutations have been linked to Müllerian aplasia, a condition affecting the female reproductive tract. Specific splice mutations and deletions in TBX6 may contribute to the genetic basis of this condition, suggesting a broader role for TBX6 in developmental processes (Sandbacka2013TBX6).

## Interactions
TBX6, a T-box transcription factor, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in embryonic development. TBX6 interacts with the WNT signaling pathway components, particularly through the LEF/TCF proteins, to regulate the expression of the Dll1 gene in the presomitic mesoderm. This interaction is synergistic and dependent on β-catenin, highlighting the collaborative role of TBX6 and WNT signaling in gene regulation (Hofmann2004WNT).

TBX6 also interacts with Ripply proteins, specifically Ripply1 and Ripply2, which are involved in the degradation of TBX6. This interaction is essential for the dynamic-to-static conversion in somite segmentation, as Ripply proteins mediate the removal of TBX6 protein to define somite boundaries and cease clock gene expression (Yabe2023Ripply; Zhao2018Ripply2). The T-box domain of TBX6 is crucial for its interaction with Ripply2, which recruits the proteasome complex for TBX6 degradation, a process necessary for defining segment borders during somitogenesis (Zhao2018Ripply2).

Additionally, TBX6 binds to cis-regulatory elements of the Mesp2 gene, activating its expression. This interaction involves specific nucleotide sequences containing a conserved CACAC motif, which TBX6 binds to, demonstrating its role in regulating gene expression through direct DNA interaction (Yasuhiko2006Tbx6mediated).
