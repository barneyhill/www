# CLEC18C

## Overview
CLEC18C is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 18 member C, which is part of the C-type lectin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain, which allows it to bind specific sugar moieties, playing a crucial role in various biological processes, including cell-cell adhesion, immune response, and pathogen recognition. As a transmembrane protein, C-type lectin domain family 18 member C is involved in mediating interactions between cells and their external environment, contributing to the modulation of immune responses and potentially influencing disease pathogenesis. The study of CLEC18C and its encoded protein is significant for understanding its role in health and disease, particularly in the context of immune system function and its potential implications in clinical settings.
