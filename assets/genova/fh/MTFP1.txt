# MTFP1

## Overview
MTFP1 (mitochondrial fission process 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and integrity. Despite its name, the protein MTFP1 is not primarily responsible for mitochondrial fission but plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane and regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). This protein is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and survival, particularly in cardiac cells, where it prevents excessive mPTP opening, thereby protecting against cell death and maintaining cardiac function (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). MTFP1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting its role as a scaffold protein that influences mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism (Patitucci2023Mtfp1; Donnarumma2021Mitochondrial). The gene's function and interactions underscore its importance in tissue-specific mitochondrial processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Function
MTFP1 (mitochondrial fission process 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial inner membrane integrity and regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Despite its name, MTFP1 is not essential for mitochondrial fission in cardiac cells, as its depletion does not significantly alter mitochondrial morphology (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). Instead, MTFP1 is involved in preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which is critical for protecting against cell death and maintaining cardiac function (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial).

MTFP1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mPTP regulation, such as ANT1 and CYPD. This interaction suggests that MTFP1 may modulate mPTP activity by altering substrate accessibility or activation (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). In cardiomyocytes, MTFP1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial coupling through the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), preventing proton leak and ensuring efficient energy production (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial).

In the liver, MTFP1 ablation enhances mitochondrial respiration and protects against hepatic steatosis, indicating a tissue-specific role in mitochondrial function and stress response (Patitucci2023Mtfp1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MTFP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cardiac health. MTFP1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial inner membrane integrity and bioenergetic efficiency in cardiac cells. Its deletion or dysfunction can lead to severe cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure. In mouse models, the absence of MTFP1 in cardiomyocytes results in progressive DCM, characterized by left ventricular remodeling, myocardial wall thinning, and fibrosis, ultimately leading to heart failure and reduced lifespan (Donnarumma2021Mitochondrial; Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial).

MTFP1 deficiency also increases susceptibility to cell death due to prolonged mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, which is mediated by Cyclophilin D (CYPD). This increased cell death sensitivity is particularly detrimental in cardiomyocytes, which have limited regenerative capacity (Donnarumma2021Mitochondrial; Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). The gene's interaction with mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mPTP regulation, such as ANT1 and CYPD, suggests that MTFP1 mutations could disrupt these interactions, further contributing to cardiac dysfunction (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the potential of MTFP1 as a therapeutic target for treating heart diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
MTFP1 interacts with several proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and function. It is known to interact with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key player in mitochondrial fission, influencing DRP1 phosphorylation and localization (Aung2017Knockdown; Morita2017mTOR). MTFP1 also forms part of a complex with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT1) and Cyclophilin D, which are associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Patitucci2023Mtfp1; Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial). This interaction suggests a role for MTFP1 in regulating mPTP activity, impacting cell survival and mitochondrial integrity (Donnarumma2022Mitochondrial).

In the liver, MTFP1 interacts with various inner mitochondrial membrane components, including proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) such as Complex V subunits (Patitucci2023Mtfp1). Proteomic analyses have identified MTFP1 as part of a macromolecular complex that includes SLC25A4 (ANT1), indicating tissue-specific interactions that enhance mitochondrial respiration (Patitucci2023Mtfp1). These interactions highlight MTFP1's role as a scaffold protein, maintaining mitochondrial function and influencing energy metabolism (Donnarumma2021Mitochondrial).
