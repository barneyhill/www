# ADGRE5

## Overview
ADGRE5 is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E5 (CD97), a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, and a seven-transmembrane helical bundle. CD97 is primarily expressed on leukocytes and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, particularly in inflammatory and cancerous contexts. The protein is involved in various cellular interactions, including binding to CD55 and integrins, which are essential for its function in immune responses and tumor progression. CD97's expression is upregulated in several cancers, where it contributes to aggressive phenotypes and tumor invasiveness, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Aust2022To; Wang2016CD97ADGRE5; RavnBoess2023The).

## Structure
The ADGRE5 gene encodes the CD97 protein, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. CD97 has a complex molecular structure characterized by a tripartite organization. It consists of an extracellular domain (ECD) with tandemly arranged epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats and a GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, a seven-transmembrane (7TM) helical bundle, and an intracellular domain (ICD) (Aust2022To). The EGF-like repeats in the ECD are involved in cell-adhesive interactions and are subject to cell type-specific glycosylation, which is crucial for binding to CD55 (Aust2022To). The GAIN domain facilitates the self-cleavage of CD97, resulting in a bipartite structure with an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (Aust2022To).

CD97 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with variations in the number of EGF-like repeats. The three main isoforms are CD97(EGF1-5), CD97(EGF1235), and CD97(EGF125), each with distinct binding properties (Aust2022To). The ICD contains multiple phosphorylation sites, including a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) at the C-terminus, which is important for cellular detachment and mechanical properties (Aust2022To). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various partners, such as integrins and chondroitin sulfate B, often in a calcium-dependent manner (Aust2022To).

## Function
The ADGRE5 gene encodes the CD97 protein, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, which plays a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling in healthy human cells. CD97 is prominently expressed on leukocytes and is involved in mediating granulocyte accumulation in inflammatory tissues, facilitating the firm adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells to activated endothelial cells (Wang2016CD97ADGRE5). In epithelial cells, CD97 is localized at E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, where it interacts with β-catenin to stabilize membrane-bound non-phosphorylated β-catenin, thereby strengthening cell-cell contacts and maintaining junctional integrity (Hilbig2018The; Aust2022To).

CD97 also plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis, particularly under stress conditions such as serum starvation. It achieves this by modulating the expression of apoptotic proteins, increasing anti-apoptotic factors like BFL-1, and decreasing pro-apoptotic factors such as BIM and PUMA (Hsiao2015The). The protein's structure, which includes a large extracellular domain with EGF-like repeats and a GAIN domain, facilitates its interactions with various partners, contributing to its diverse functions in cellular processes (Aust2022To).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADGRE5 gene, also known as CD97, have been implicated in various cancers. CD97 is upregulated in several carcinomas, including esophageal, thyroid, and hepatocellular cancers, and is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes (Aust2022To). In glioblastoma (GBM), CD97 is expressed de novo and is linked to tumor progression, promoting glycolytic metabolism and tumor growth through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (RavnBoess2023The). Knockdown of CD97 in GBM cells reduces tumor initiation capacity and cell migration, indicating its role in tumor invasiveness (RavnBoess2023The).

CD97 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its interaction with β-catenin is lost during carcinogenesis, leading to changes in cell adhesion and signaling that promote tumor growth and metastasis (Hilbig2018The). In glioma stem cells, CD97 levels correlate with invasion patterns, and its manipulation affects invasive properties and cell proliferation, suggesting a subtype-dependent influence on glioma behavior (Eichberg2021Genetic).

CD97's involvement in immune responses and its upregulation in activated immune cells further highlight its significance in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (RavnBoess2023The).

## Interactions
ADGRE5, also known as CD97, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular adhesion, migration, and signaling, particularly in cancer biology. CD97 interacts with CD55, a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored transmembrane receptor, through its extracellular domain (ECD) if specific N-glycosylation sites are occupied, which is crucial for cellular adhesion (Aust2022To). It also binds to integrins on endothelial cells via an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, contributing to tumor angiogenesis and cell adhesion (Aust2022To). CD97 interacts with Thy-1/CD90, another GPI-anchored receptor, in a calcium-independent manner via the GAIN domain (Aust2022To). The protein also binds to chondroitin sulfate B (CS B), a component of the extracellular matrix, through its fourth EGF-like repeat in a calcium-dependent manner, specific to the CD97(EGF1-5) isoform (Aust2022To).

In the context of cancer, CD97 forms heterodimers with the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1), enhancing LPA-initiated RHO-dependent signaling and invasion in prostate cancer cells (Ward2011LPA). In colorectal carcinogenesis, CD97 interacts with β-catenin at adherens junctions, although this interaction is lost during tumor progression (Hilbig2018The).
