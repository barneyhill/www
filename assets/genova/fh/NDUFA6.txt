# NDUFA6

## Overview
NDUFA6 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A6, which is a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is an accessory subunit within the electron transport chain, playing a crucial role in the assembly and stability of complex I, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Alston2018Biallelic). The NDUFA6 protein, characterized by an LYR motif, is part of the Q-module of complex I and interacts with other subunits to bridge the peripheral and membrane arms of the complex (Pei2021Human; Padavannil2022The). Mutations in the NDUFA6 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, manifesting in various clinical symptoms, including early-onset isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency (Alston2018Biallelic).

## Structure
The NDUFA6 protein, also known as LYRM6, is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, part of the electron transport chain. It is characterized by the presence of an LYR motif, which is a common feature among LYRM proteins, and adopts a three-helix bundle fold (Pei2021Human). The protein is involved in the Q-module of complex I, where it interacts with other subunits such as NDUFS3, NDUFS4, and ND3, bridging the peripheral and membrane arms of the complex (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFA6 has three reported functional isoforms, with the longest consisting of 154 residues (Alston2018Biallelic). Mutations in NDUFA6 can lead to structural disruptions, such as the p.Arg64Pro substitution, which affects critical binding interactions (Alston2018Biallelic). The protein's role in complex I activity is mediated by its interactions with core membrane subunits ND1 and ND3, and mutations affecting these interfaces can impair complex I function (Padavannil2022The).

The structural analysis of NDUFA6 has revealed that mutations can influence the structures of loops in associated subunits, providing conformational flexibility during ubiquinone reduction (Padavannil2022The). These structural features are crucial for the proper assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I.

## Function
The NDUFA6 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This complex is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Alston2018Biallelic). NDUFA6 is an accessory subunit that plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of complex I, ensuring its proper function and integration into the mitochondrial membrane (Alston2018Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA6 is involved in maintaining the integrity and function of complex I, which is vital for efficient cellular respiration and energy metabolism. The gene's predominant isoform, ENST00000602404.5, is supported by RNA expression data, indicating its importance in various tissues (Alston2018Biallelic). The proper function of NDUFA6 is essential for the normal assembly of complex I, as disruptions can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and reduced ATP production, affecting overall cellular energy homeostasis (Alston2018Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFA6 gene are associated with early-onset isolated mitochondrial complex I deficiency, a condition that can manifest with a variety of clinical symptoms, including developmental regression, spasticity, motor difficulties, seizures, and lactic acidosis. This deficiency is a common biochemical phenotype in pediatric mitochondrial diseases and can range from isolated myopathy to more severe conditions like Leigh syndrome (Alston2018Biallelic). The study of affected individuals has revealed various mutations in NDUFA6, such as heterozygous variants, homozygous deletions, and frameshift mutations, which are predicted to disrupt protein structure and function, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (Alston2018Biallelic).

Functional studies using fibroblast cell lines from patients have shown impaired respiration and reduced levels of fully assembled complex I, indicating a direct impact on mitochondrial function. These findings underscore the critical role of NDUFA6 in the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex I (Alston2018Biallelic). The presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in NDUFA6 can lead to complex I assembly defects, although some subjects may exhibit normal complex I activity in certain tissues, complicating diagnosis (Alston2018Biallelic). This highlights the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of mitochondrial diseases associated with NDUFA6 mutations (Alston2018Biallelic).

## Interactions
NDUFA6 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. It interacts with other proteins within complex I to facilitate its assembly and function. NDUFA6 is particularly important for the incorporation of subunits such as NDUFA7 and NDUFA12 into the complex I holoenzyme. The absence or impaired function of NDUFA6 results in stalled assembly intermediates and prevents interactions with N-module subunits (Alston2018Biallelic).

NDUFA6 also interacts with the mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein NDUFAB1, a member of the LYRM family. NDUFAB1 is integrated into complex I at two sites, where it interacts directly with NDUFA6. This interaction involves the insertion of NDUFAB1's acyl-chain into a hydrophobic channel in NDUFA6, with salt-bridge contacts between conserved glutamates in NDUFAB1 and positively charged residues in NDUFA6 (Dibley2020The).

The presence of NDUFAF2, a late-stage complex I assembly factor, bound to stalled assembly intermediates in the absence of functional NDUFA6, indicates a failure in the dissociation process necessary for complex I assembly (Alston2018Biallelic). These interactions highlight the essential role of NDUFA6 in the proper assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I.
