# GPRIN3

## Overview
GPRIN3 is a gene that encodes the protein GPRIN family member 3, which is part of the G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth (GPRIN) family. This protein is involved in neuronal signaling pathways and is implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, a critical process in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. GPRIN family member 3 is categorized as a signaling protein due to its role in modulating intracellular signaling cascades. The gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the brain and adrenal gland, suggesting its involvement in both neurological functions and the stress response. Recent studies have highlighted its potential role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, through epigenetic modifications that affect its expression (Freeman2020Epigenetic; CisternaGarcia2022Genomewide).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
GPRIN3 has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) through its association with epigenetic changes influenced by environmental factors such as the neurotoxicant rotenone. Studies have shown that rotenone exposure leads to increased H3K27ac enrichment at CTCF binding sites within the GPRIN3 gene, correlating with upregulated GPRIN3 mRNA expression. This suggests that alterations in histone modification and DNA methylation at these sites may influence GPRIN3 expression and contribute to PD pathogenesis (Freeman2020Epigenetic).

The gene is also part of a co-expression network associated with dopaminergic neurons and dopamine transport, which are critical in PD. However, the specific clinical significance of GPRIN3 mutations or expression changes in PD remains to be fully elucidated (CisternaGarcia2022Genomewide).

In addition to its role in PD, GPRIN3 expression is notably high in the adrenal gland, which is involved in the stress response. Variations in the frequency of polymorphisms in GPRIN3 have been observed according to temperament types, although the clinical implications of these findings are not yet clear (Romaniuk2024Identification).
