# FAM161B

## Overview
FAM161B is a gene that encodes the FAM161 centrosomal protein B, which is primarily involved in centrosomal function. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes related to cilia function, which is essential for the maintenance and health of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Disruptions in the FAM161B gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa. This condition is marked by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells, underscoring the importance of FAM161B in retinal health and function. The protein's involvement in centrosomal activities suggests its broader significance in cellular organization and stability, particularly in tissues reliant on ciliary function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the FAM161B gene have been associated with retinal diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa. This condition is characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina. The FAM161B protein is involved in centrosomal function, and its disruption can impact cellular processes related to cilia function, which is crucial for the maintenance of photoreceptor cells. Changes in the expression or interactions of FAM161B may lead to defects in these cellular processes, contributing to the pathogenesis of retinal diseases. The link between FAM161B mutations and retinitis pigmentosa highlights the gene's critical role in maintaining retinal health and function.
