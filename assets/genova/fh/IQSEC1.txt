# IQSEC1

## Overview
IQSEC1 is a gene that encodes the protein IQ motif and Sec7 domain ArfGEF 1, also known as BRAG2 or GEP100. This protein is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving the regulation of integrin endocytosis and cell spreading. The protein is characterized by its domain organization, which includes a coiled-coil dimerization domain, a calmodulin-binding IQ motif, a catalytic Sec7-PH tandem, and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif. These structural features enable IQ motif and Sec7 domain ArfGEF 1 to interact with various proteins and lipids, facilitating its involvement in processes such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. The protein's activity is modulated by calcium levels, highlighting its role in calcium-dependent signaling pathways (Bai2024Structural; D’Souza2016The). Mutations in the IQSEC1 gene have been linked to intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Ansar2019Biallelic).

## Structure
IQSEC1, also known as BRAG2 or GEP100, is a protein characterized by a specific domain organization that includes a coiled-coil (CC) dimerization domain, a calmodulin (CaM) binding IQ motif, an integrated catalytic Sec7-PH tandem, and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif (PBM) (Bai2024Structural). The IQ motif, located in the N-terminal third of the protein, binds calcium-free calmodulin and releases it upon calcium binding, indicating a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism (Bai2024Structural; D’Souza2016The). The Sec7 domain functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARF proteins, crucial for ARF signaling pathways (Bai2024Structural).

The PH domain of IQSEC1 interacts with specific membrane lipids or proteins, enhancing its GEF activity, particularly in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 (D’Souza2016The). This domain also interacts with transmembrane receptors like the phosphorylated EGF receptor and the GluA2 subunit of neuronal AMPA receptors (D’Souza2016The). The protein's structure allows for the formation of a ternary complex with the IQ motif and CaM, which is regulated by calcium levels (Bai2024Structural). IQSEC1 is broadly expressed in many tissues, including the central nervous system, and is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Bai2024Structural).

## Function
IQSEC1, also known as BRAG2, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in the regulation of integrin endocytosis and cell spreading. It activates ADP ribosylation factor 5 (Arf5), facilitating the internalization of β1 integrins at the plasma membrane. This process is essential for cell adhesion and spreading, as the knockdown of IQSEC1 or Arf5 results in increased surface levels of β1 integrins and enhanced cell spreading on fibronectin-coated substrates (Moravec2012BRAG2GEP100IQSec1).

IQSEC1 interacts with clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex, localizing to clathrin-coated pits where it promotes integrin internalization. This interaction is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is vital for maintaining cellular functions such as migration and adhesion (Moravec2012BRAG2GEP100IQSec1).

In addition to its role in endocytosis, IQSEC1 is involved in the disassembly of focal adhesions, a process necessary for cell migration. This function is mediated through the activation of Arf5, which is stimulated by calcium influx via STIM1/Orai1 channels. The interaction with ORP3, a lipid transfer protein, is also important for focal adhesion turnover and cell motility (D’Souza2019Calciumstimulated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IQSEC1 gene are associated with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and short stature. Studies have identified homozygous missense variants in affected individuals from consanguineous families, suggesting a recessive inheritance pattern. These variants, such as c.1028C>T (p.Thr343Met) and c.962G>A (p.Arg321Gln), are considered loss-of-function mutations, leading to defects in neural development and function, including dendritic spine dysgenesis (Ansar2019Biallelic). The IQSEC1 gene is crucial for the development and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses, and its deficiency may result in immature dendritic spines, contributing to the pathophysiology of intellectual disability and related disorders (Ansar2019Biallelic).

The clinical significance of IQSEC1 mutations extends to a syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, speech problems, and sometimes epilepsy. The gene is part of a family that includes IQSEC2 and IQSEC3, which are also linked to intellectual disabilities. The mutations in IQSEC1 may impair neuronal development by affecting the regulation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, protein folding, subcellular localization, or protein stability (Ansar2019Biallelic). These findings underscore the importance of including IQSEC1 in clinical diagnoses to identify affected individuals and understand the gene-phenotype link.

## Interactions
IQSEC1, also known as BRAG2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). It interacts with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, forming a complex that is essential for focal adhesion disassembly and cell migration. This interaction is modulated by calcium influx and protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which enhances the binding of ORP3 to IQSEC1 and facilitates the recruitment of the complex to ER/plasma membrane contact sites (D’Souza2019Calciumstimulated).

IQSEC1 also interacts with clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex, which are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains clathrin-binding motifs that allow it to localize to clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane, where it regulates the internalization of β1 integrins through the activation of Arf5 (Moravec2012BRAG2GEP100IQSec1).

Additionally, IQSEC1 interacts with proteins containing PDZ domains, such as PTPN13, and co-precipitates with E-Syt3, indicating its involvement in multiprotein complexes that regulate cellular processes like focal adhesion turnover and endocytosis (D’Souza2019Calciumstimulated). These interactions highlight the role of IQSEC1 in cellular dynamics and signaling pathways.
