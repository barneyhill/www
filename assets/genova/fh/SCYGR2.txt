# SCYGR2

## Overview
SCYGR2 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 2, which is characterized by its distinctive sequence of cysteine and glycine residues. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining cellular architecture and integrity. The SCYGR2 gene is expressed in various tissues, where it contributes to cellular processes such as signal transduction and cellular adhesion. Mutations or dysregulation of SCYGR2 have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in disease research and potential therapeutic targeting (Qiu2020aarFDC).
