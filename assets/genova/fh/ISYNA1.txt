# ISYNA1

## Overview
The ISYNA1 gene encodes the enzyme inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1, which is a pivotal enzyme in the biosynthesis of myo-inositol, a critical component of membrane phospholipids and a precursor in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. This enzyme, categorized as a synthase, catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to inositol-3-phosphate, facilitating various cellular processes, including cell signaling and osmoregulation (Seelan2011Differential; Chauvin2004Characterization). ISYNA1 is notably expressed in the testis, particularly in Sertoli cells and spermatocytes, where it plays a role in maintaining myo-inositol levels in the seminiferous tubule fluid (Chauvin2004Characterization). Alterations in ISYNA1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia and bladder carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Guo2019ISYNA1; Wei2020In).

## Function
The ISYNA1 gene encodes the enzyme inositol-3-phosphate synthase 1, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of myo-inositol. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to inositol-3-phosphate, a key step in the production of myo-inositol, an important component of membrane phospholipids and a precursor for the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (Seelan2011Differential; Chauvin2004Characterization). Myo-inositol is involved in various cellular processes, including the generation of second messengers like diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate, which are critical for cell signaling and osmoregulation (Seelan2011Differential; Chauvin2004Characterization).

In healthy human cells, ISYNA1 is highly expressed in the testis, particularly in Sertoli cells, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids, where it contributes to maintaining high levels of myo-inositol in the seminiferous tubule fluid, suggesting a role in osmoregulation (Chauvin2004Characterization). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it facilitates the biosynthesis of inositol, which is crucial for regulating glycolipid metabolism and other cellular functions (Liu2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ISYNA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), transcriptional silencing of ISYNA1 due to DNA hypermethylation leads to a dependency on the SLC5A3 gene for myo-inositol transport. This dependency is particularly noted in AML patients with IDH1/IDH2 or CEBPA mutations, where ISYNA1 silencing is a recurrent event, affecting about 20% of patient samples (Wei2020In).

In bladder carcinoma, ISYNA1 is overexpressed, and its elevated expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of ISYNA1 in bladder cancer cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor progression (Guo2019ISYNA1).

The ISYNA1 gene is also linked to spina bifida risk, where an interaction between the ISYNA1 1029A>G polymorphism and low maternal glucose levels has been observed, suggesting a potential genetic influence on the condition (Groenen2004Spina).

In breast cancer, lower methylation levels of ISYNA1 in blood DNA have been associated with increased risk, highlighting its potential role in cancer susceptibility (Liu2022The).
