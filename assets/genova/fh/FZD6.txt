# FZD6

## Overview
FZD6 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 6, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates its role in cellular signaling across the cell membrane (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6). The FZD6 protein is primarily involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, such as the planar cell polarity pathway, which is crucial for processes like neural tube closure and the orientation of inner-ear sensory hair cells (De2011FZD6is; Wang2006The). Unlike other frizzled receptors, FZD6 lacks a C-terminal PDZ binding-domain motif, which influences its signaling capabilities (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various developmental processes and clinical conditions, including craniofacial development, neural tube defects, and psychiatric disorders (Han2022Identification; Cvjetkovic2015Regulatory; De2011FZD6is).

## Structure
The FZD6 protein is a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors and is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which allows it to span the cell membrane seven times (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6). The protein includes an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in its N-terminal region, which is essential for binding Wnt ligands (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6). Unlike other frizzled family members, FZD6 lacks a C-terminal PDZ binding-domain motif (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6).

The molecular mass of the FZD6 protein is approximately 79 kDa (Beghini2019FZD6). Alternative splicing of the FZD6 gene results in multiple transcript variants, some of which do not encode a protein with a predicted signal peptide (Beghini2019FZD6). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and signaling capabilities (Beghini2019FZD6).

FZD6 is involved in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, playing a role in processes like cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration (Beghini2019FZD6). It acts as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade (Beghini2019FZD6).

## Function
The FZD6 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, which are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. FZD6 is primarily involved in the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways, such as the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which regulates the orientation and polarity of cells within the plane of a tissue. This is essential for processes like neural tube closure and the proper orientation of inner-ear sensory hair cells (De2011FZD6is; Wang2006The).

In healthy human cells, FZD6 functions as a receptor for Wnt ligands, activating disheveled proteins and Wnt target genes while inhibiting GSK-3 kinase. This activity is important for maintaining normal cellular functions related to cell signaling and development (Mohammadiasl2017A). FZD6 also plays a role in craniofacial development by mediating the noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway, which is crucial for the migration and orientation of neural crest cells, contributing to the formation of facial structures (Cvjetkovic2015Regulatory). The protein is active in the plasma membrane, where it influences these developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FZD6 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCLP), a regulatory variant, rs138557689/C, was identified in an African-American family. This variant decreases FZD6 promoter activity and is suggested to contribute to NSCLP by affecting the WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for craniofacial development (Cvjetkovic2015Regulatory).

FZD6 mutations are also linked to neural tube defects (NTDs). Studies have identified several rare variants in FZD6 that are associated with NTDs, including a de novo frameshift mutation and missense changes, which may lead to abnormal protein conformations and affect miRNA binding (De2011FZD6is).

In the realm of dermatology, a novel pathogenic variant in FZD6 has been found to cause recessive nail dysplasia, characterized by congenital nail abnormalities. This condition is linked to disruptions in the Wnt-FZD signaling pathway, which is essential for nail development (Mohammadiasl2017A).

FZD6 is also implicated in psychiatric disorders. A non-synonymous SNP, rs61753730, has been associated with depressive symptoms. This variant affects the protein's structure and stability, influencing FZD6 expression and function in the brain (Han2022Identification).

## Interactions
FZD6, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, participates in several key interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway. It forms homodimers through interactions involving transmembrane helices 4 and 5, which are crucial for its dimerization and function (Petersen2017Agonistinduced). These dimers are involved in maintaining an inactive state, with monomeric FZD6 acting as the minimal signaling unit (Petersen2017Agonistinduced). 

FZD6 interacts with the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL), which binds to the conserved C-terminal KTxxxW sequence, although DVL is not required for FZD6 dimerization (Petersen2017Agonistinduced). The receptor also interacts with heterotrimeric G proteins, specifically Gαi1 and Gαq, with these interactions being competitive with DVL binding (Petersen2017Agonistinduced). 

FZD6 is involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and functions as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade. It interacts with Wnt ligands, such as Wnt4, but does not enhance Wnt4-dependent activation of TCF/LEF reporter, indicating a non-canonical role (Corda2017Noncanonical; Beghini2019FZD6). These interactions highlight FZD6's role in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (Beghini2019FZD6).
