# HTR2A

## Overview
The HTR2A gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT2A), a prominent G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in serotonergic neurotransmission. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, particularly within the central nervous system, where it modulates neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability. The 5-HT2A receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is involved in several signaling pathways, including those mediated by phospholipase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Barnes2020International; Kim2020Structure). It is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex, influencing both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, and plays a critical role in sensory perception and cognitive functions (Barnes2020International; CarhartHarris2017Serotonin). The receptor's interactions with various ligands, including hallucinogens, and its involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, underscore its significance as a therapeutic target (Cheah2017mRNA; Kim2020Structure).

## Structure
The HTR2A gene encodes the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which is typical of GPCRs (Kim2020Structure). The receptor's structure includes key motifs such as the NPXXY, E/DRY, and P-I-F motifs, which are involved in receptor activation and signaling transduction (Kim2020Structure). The receptor undergoes conformational changes upon activation, with significant displacements in the intracellular ends of transmembrane domains TM5 and TM6, and an inward shift of TM7 (Kim2020Structure).

The receptor's extracellular domain is often glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that can affect receptor function and localization (Ruble2016Genomic). Alternative splicing of the HTR2A gene results in various transcript variants, some of which may lack the N-terminus and parts of the transmembrane domains, potentially affecting membrane expression (Ruble2016Genomic). The receptor's ability to interact with different G protein subunits is influenced by specific residues, such as I181, which is crucial for Gaq coupling (Kim2020Structure). The receptor also forms a functional heterodimer with the 5-HT2C receptor, involving both intracellular and extracellular domains (Fongang2019Coevolution).

## Function
The HTR2A gene encodes the 5-HT2A receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in serotonergic neurotransmission. This receptor is primarily active in the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex, where it is most densely expressed on the dendrites of excitatory glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, especially in layer V of the cortex (Weber2010Htr2a; CarhartHarris2017Serotonin). The 5-HT2A receptor is involved in various signaling pathways, including those involving phospholipase C, phospholipase D, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases, contributing to its function in healthy human cells (Barnes2020International).

The receptor is predominantly postsynaptic and is localized to the apical dendrites or soma of pyramidal neurons, but it is also present in GABAergic interneurons in the cortex and amygdala (Barnes2020International). It plays a crucial role in regulating the release of serotonin in the cortex through a top-down modulatory influence on a cortical-raphe inhibitory feedback circuit (CarhartHarris2017Serotonin). The 5-HT2A receptor is also involved in potentiating GABAergic inhibition in the amygdala, which is important for sensory information processing (Barnes2020International).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR2A gene, encoding the serotonin receptor 2A, is implicated in several psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. Alterations in HTR2A expression and function are associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, with studies showing reduced mRNA levels and hypermethylation at specific CpG sites in patients (Cheah2017mRNA). Genetic polymorphisms such as rs6314 and rs6313 have been linked to schizophrenia, affecting receptor activity and cognitive performance (Cheah2017mRNA). 

Alternative splicing of HTR2A, particularly involving exon II, is also associated with schizophrenia, influencing the expression of different isoforms that may serve as peripheral biomarkers for the disorder (Grunina2020Aberrant). These splicing variations are linked to specific side effects of antipsychotic treatments, such as akathisia and weight gain (Grunina2020Aberrant).

HTR2A polymorphisms are further associated with treatment resistance to atypical antipsychotic drugs, with the rs7997012 polymorphism being a significant predictor of high treatment resistance (Del2023DRD2). Additionally, HTR2A genetic variations contribute to metabolic side effects, such as increased body mass index and waist circumference, in patients undergoing antipsychotic therapy (Paderina2021Genetic).

## Interactions
The HTR2A gene encodes the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that interacts with various proteins, particularly the Gq protein subunits. The receptor's interaction with the Gaq protein is mediated by specific residues that form hydrogen bonds and a hydrophobic core, crucial for receptor-Gaq coupling. Mutations in these residues can significantly affect the receptor's ability to couple with Gaq and alter the efficacy of ligands like 25CN-NBOH (Kim2020Structure). The receptor is known to robustly activate Gq-family subunits, while its interaction with Gi and Gs family members is minimal (Kim2020Structure).

The 5-HT2A receptor also forms a heterodimer with the 5-HT2C receptor, involving both intracellular and extracellular domains. This interaction is supported by coevolutionary analysis, suggesting a functional relationship between these receptors (Fongang2019Coevolution). The study of these interactions highlights the receptor's role in neuropsychiatric conditions and its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2020Structure).

The receptor's interaction with hallucinogens like LSD and methiothepin has been structurally characterized, revealing significant conformational changes upon ligand binding and stabilization through Gaq coupling (Kim2020Structure). These interactions are critical for understanding the receptor's function and its role in signal transduction.
