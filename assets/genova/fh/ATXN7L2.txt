# ATXN7L2

## Overview
ATXN7L2 is a gene that encodes the protein ataxin 7-like 2, which is a component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, a crucial multiprotein complex involved in transcription regulation through histone modification. The protein ataxin 7-like 2 is part of the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) within the SAGA complex, playing a significant role in the deubiquitination of mono-ubiquitinated histone H2B, a process essential for regulating gene expression (Helmlinger2017Sharing). ATXN7L2 shares a high degree of homology with its paralog ATXN7, which suggests potential functional redundancy and compensatory mechanisms within the SAGA complex (Felício2023Functional). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene transcription and the maintenance of normal cellular functions.

## Function
The ATXN7L2 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, a multiprotein complex involved in transcription regulation through histone modification. ATXN7L2 shares a high degree of homology with its paralog ATXN7, suggesting functional redundancy and the ability to compensate for the partial loss of ATXN7 function within the SAGA complex (Felício2023Functional). The protein is involved in the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) of the SAGA complex, which is responsible for deubiquitinating mono-ubiquitinated histone H2B, a key step in regulating gene expression (Helmlinger2017Sharing).

ATXN7L2 can interchangeably participate with ATXN7L1 in the SAGA complex's DUBm, indicating its role in transcription regulation and possibly in the development of certain cell types, such as erythroid cells (Felício2023Functional). The presence of ATXN7L2 in the SAGA complex is mutually exclusive with its paralogs, suggesting the existence of distinct SAGA DUB modules in mammalian cells, although their specific functions remain to be fully elucidated (Helmlinger2017Sharing). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining normal cellular functions by influencing gene transcription.
