# CXCL13

## Overview
CXCL13 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13, a member of the CXC chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by guiding the migration and localization of B cells within lymphoid tissues, thereby facilitating the formation of germinal centers and the organization of lymphoid organs (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13). CXCL13 is primarily expressed in secondary lymphoid organs and interacts with the CXCR5 receptor on B cells and certain T cells, which is crucial for immune response regulation (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13). The protein's structure, characterized by a canonical chemokine fold and unique C-terminal extension, allows it to interact with heparan sulfate, influencing its bioactivity and cell migration properties (Monneau2017Solution). Alterations in CXCL13 expression are associated with various autoimmune diseases and cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Pan2022Role; Zhang2022An).

## Structure
The CXCL13 protein, encoded by the human gene CXCL13, exhibits a canonical chemokine structure with distinct features in its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. The primary structure of CXCL13 includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with specific regions contributing to its functional properties (Monneau2017Solution). The secondary structure is characterized by a disordered N-terminal region, an 'N-loop', a short 3_10-helix, a three-stranded β-sheet, and a C-terminal α-helix (Rosenberg2020The). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by conserved cysteines, which are typical of chemokines (Rosenberg2020The).

The protein also features a unique 19-residue C-terminal extension that remains unfolded and dynamic, contributing to its interaction with heparan sulfate (HS) (Monneau2017Solution). This C-terminal extension does not interact with the core domain of the protein, as confirmed by analysis of a truncated form of CXCL13 (Monneau2017Solution). The presence of an additional N-terminal methionine, resulting from expression in Escherichia coli, affects the folding of the N-terminal region, which is critical for signaling activity (Monneau2017Solution). The protein's structure allows for specific interactions with HS, with binding sites located in the α-helix and the C-terminal domain (Monneau2017Solution).

## Function
CXCL13, also known as B cell-attracting chemokine 1 (BCA-1), is a chemokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system by directing the migration and localization of B cells within lymphoid tissues. It is constitutively expressed in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches, primarily by follicular dendritic cells and macrophages (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13). CXCL13 functions by binding to the CXCR5 receptor, which is expressed on mature B lymphocytes, CD4+ follicular helper T cells, Th17 cells, and a minor subset of CD8+ T cells. This interaction is essential for the homing of B cells and follicular B-helper T cells into primary follicles in lymph nodes and the spleen, facilitating germinal center formation and lymphoid organogenesis (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13).

In healthy human cells, CXCL13 is involved in the generation of B cells with potential for autoantibody production, although these are typically low-affinity IgM antibodies that do not pose a threat to a healthy organism (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13). The chemokine system, including CXCL13, is integral to leukocyte migration and retention in tissues, making it a significant factor in immune response regulation (Klimatcheva2015CXCL13).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL13 gene are implicated in various autoimmune diseases and cancers. In autoimmune diseases, elevated CXCL13 levels are associated with disease severity and progression. For instance, in multiple sclerosis (MS), increased CXCL13 levels correlate with disease severity and relapse rates, and treatments that reduce CXCL13 levels are linked to improved outcomes (Pan2022Role). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), high CXCL13 levels are associated with lupus nephritis and correlate with disease activity markers (Zhou2023The). CXCL13 is also implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where its elevated expression exacerbates colonic inflammation (Liu2022CXCL13).

In cancer, CXCL13 expression is linked to tumor progression and immune response. It is highly expressed in several cancers, including colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer, and is associated with immune cell infiltration and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (Zhang2022An). In gynecological tumors, CXCL13 expression correlates with cancer progression and immune activation, suggesting its role in metastasis and prognosis (Ding2024Transcriptome). These findings highlight CXCL13's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in both autoimmune diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
CXCL13 interacts with heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan, through electrostatic interactions facilitated by basic amino acid residues. These interactions occur at distinct binding sites on CXCL13, specifically in the α-helix and the C-terminal extension. The α-helix, identified as cluster 1, includes residues such as Arg58, Lys60, Arg64, Arg67, and Lys72, while the C-terminal extension, known as cluster 5, involves residues Lys84, Arg85, and Arg86. These sites are crucial for HS binding, which plays a regulatory role in CXCL13's bioactivity by promoting adhesion-dependent cell migration (Monneau2017Solution).

CXCL13 also forms homodimers, a common feature in the CXC chemokine family. This dimerization occurs through the anti-parallel association of the first beta-strand of each monomer, involving specific residues in the beta-strand and alpha-helix. The presence of specific oligosaccharides, such as dp4, enhances dimerization by stabilizing the dimer state through interactions with both alpha-helices of the dimer. These interactions are characterized by strong hydrogen bonds with residues like Lys60, Arg64, Arg67, and Lys72, which are critical for the stabilization of the CXCL13 homodimer (Monneau2017Solution).
