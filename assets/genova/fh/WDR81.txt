# WDR81

## Overview
WDR81 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 81 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, including autophagy and endosomal trafficking. The protein is characterized by the presence of a BEACH domain, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, and multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling pathways (Liu2021Reduction; cavallin2017wdr81). As a cytosolic protein that associates with endolysosomal membranes, WD repeat domain 81 is crucial for the autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins, a process known as aggrephagy, and is involved in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Wang2018WDR81; Rapiteanu2016A). Mutations in the WDR81 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, including cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and quadrupedal locomotion syndrome (CAMRQ2), highlighting its clinical significance (Gulsuner2011Homozygosity; Traka2013WDR81).

## Structure
WDR81 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes such as autophagy and endosomal trafficking. The protein contains a BEACH (Beige and Chediak-Higashi) domain, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) domain, and multiple WD40 repeats (Liu2021Reduction; cavallin2017wdr81). The BEACH and MFS domains are crucial for the recruitment of WDR81 to protein aggregates, which is essential for its role in autophagic clearance (Liu2021Reduction). The WD40 repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with the ATG5-ATG12 complex, which is necessary for autophagic processes (Liu2021Reduction).

The BEACH domain, located in the N-terminal region, is also involved in interactions with p62 and LC3C, facilitating aggrephagy (Liu2017The). The WD40 repeats form a beta-propeller structure, which is typical for proteins involved in complex formation and signaling pathways (cavallin2017wdr81). WDR81's interaction with LC3C is mediated by canonical LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) within the BEACH domain, highlighting its role in autophagy (Liu2017The).

Mutations in WDR81, such as H528Y, P856L, and P1238R, can impair its function, leading to reduced cell viability and are associated with neurological disorders (Liu2021Reduction). These mutations often affect the BEACH and MFS domains, which are critical for the protein's adaptor functions (Liu2021Reduction).

## Function
The WDR81 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in several cellular processes, including autophagy and endosomal trafficking. In healthy human cells, WDR81 is involved in the autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins, a process known as aggrephagy. It interacts with the autophagy receptor p62 and LC3C to promote the recognition and clearance of these protein aggregates, maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing neurodegenerative diseases (Liu2017The). WDR81 is also part of a complex with WDR91, which is essential for the trafficking and degradation of internalized plasma membrane proteins through the endolysosomal pathway. This complex facilitates the delivery of cargo from early to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments, ensuring proper protein turnover and cellular homeostasis (Rapiteanu2016A).

WDR81 is predominantly found in the cytosolic fraction but associates with endolysosomal membranes, particularly in endocytic compartments (Rapiteanu2016A). It is also involved in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis by modulating endosomal PtdIns3P levels, which affects the TGFβ signaling pathway, crucial for neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation (Wang2018WDR81).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR81 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. One such condition is cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and quadrupedal locomotion syndrome (CAMRQ2), also known as Uner Tan syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, severe mental retardation, and a quadrupedal gait (Gulsuner2011Homozygosity; Traka2013WDR81). The p.P856L mutation in WDR81 has been specifically linked to cerebellar hypoplasia and quadrupedal locomotion in a consanguineous family (Gulsuner2011Homozygosity).

WDR81 mutations also contribute to extreme microcephaly and impaired mitotic progression, as observed in human fibroblasts and Drosophila neural stem cells. These mutations lead to significant developmental abnormalities, including extreme microcephaly and neurological impairments (cavallin2017wdr81). Additionally, a novel homozygous frameshift mutation in WDR81 has been associated with severe brain malformations such as microlissencephaly, corpus callosum agenesis, and pontocerebellar hypoplasia (Kalmár2020A).

Alterations in WDR81 expression levels are linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Reduced WDR81 levels impair autophagic clearance of protein aggregates, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Liu2021Reduction).

## Interactions
WDR81 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with p62, a cargo receptor for autophagy, facilitating the recognition of ubiquitinated proteins by p62. This interaction is essential for the autophagic clearance of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins, particularly those with K63-linked polyubiquitination (Liu2017The). WDR81 also interacts with LC3C through its BEACH domain, which contains two canonical LC3-interacting regions. This interaction is critical for the recruitment of LC3C to ubiquitinated proteins, promoting aggrephagy (Liu2017The).

WDR81 forms a complex with WDR91, playing a role in endosomal trafficking and degradation processes. This complex is important for maintaining endolysosomal pathway function and morphology, as well as for the trafficking and degradation of tetherin, a viral restriction factor (Rapiteanu2016A). WDR81 also interacts with components of the PI3K-III complex, such as VPS15 and Beclin1, to regulate endosomal PtdIns3P levels, which is crucial for normal neurogenesis (Wang2018WDR81). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of WDR81 in cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various cellular pathways.
