# HINT3

## Overview
HINT3, or histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to apoptosis and survival. The protein encoded by HINT3 is categorized as a nucleotide-binding protein, characterized by its histidine triad motif, which is crucial for its function. HINT3 plays a significant role in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where it is implicated in promoting apoptosis resistance in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. This resistance is mediated through its interaction with USP11, a deubiquitinase that stabilizes HINT3, thereby influencing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. The HINT3 protein's interactions and regulatory functions make it a potential therapeutic target for conditions like PAH, where its expression is notably increased (Jang2022USP11).

## Clinical Significance
HINT3 (histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 3) has been implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a progressive and incurable disease characterized by pulmonary vascular occlusive remodeling. In PAH, the expression of HINT3 is increased in the lungs of patients, which is associated with endothelial apoptosis-resistance. This resistance is partly due to the stabilization of HINT3 by USP11, a ubiquitin-specific protease, which prevents its degradation through deubiquitination. The stabilization of HINT3 leads to increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2, contributing to the resistance of pulmonary artery endothelial cells to apoptosis (Jang2022USP11).

The USP11/HINT3 axis has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for PAH, given its role in promoting apoptosis resistance. However, the specific mechanisms by which HINT3 regulates BCL2 expression in PAH are not fully defined. The association of HINT3 with worsened survival in PAH patients highlights its clinical significance in this condition (Jang2022USP11). While the context does not provide information on other diseases directly linked to HINT3 mutations, its role in PAH underscores its importance in disease pathology (Jang2022USP11).

## Interactions
HINT3 interacts with the protein USP11, which acts as a deubiquitinase to stabilize HINT3 by preventing its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), demonstrating a strong binding between HINT3 and USP11. The stabilization of HINT3 by USP11 influences the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. Overexpression of USP11 leads to increased levels of HINT3, which in turn augments BCL2 expression, while knockdown of USP11 results in reduced HINT3 and BCL2 levels (Jang2022USP11).

HINT3 also directly interacts with BCL2, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is significant in the context of pulmonary hypertension, where HINT3, through its stabilization by USP11, contributes to apoptosis resistance in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The knockdown of HINT3 has been shown to attenuate BCL2 expression, highlighting the regulatory role of HINT3 in cell survival pathways (Jang2022USP11). These interactions suggest that HINT3 is involved in critical cellular processes related to apoptosis and survival, particularly in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
