# CAPN6

## Overview
CAPN6 is a gene that encodes the protein calpain 6, a member of the calpain family, which is a group of calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine proteases. Unlike other calpains, calpain 6 is characterized by its lack of proteolytic activity due to a substitution in its active site, which suggests a primarily structural role rather than an enzymatic one (Sorimachi2011Impact; Tonami2011Calpain6). Calpain 6 is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility, playing a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules and influencing cellular processes such as cell movement and structure maintenance (Chen2020CAPN6; Tonami2011Calpain6). The protein interacts with various cellular components, including the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, to modulate Rac1 activity and cell motility (Tonami2011Calpain6). Additionally, calpain 6 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and chronic kidney disease-related muscle atrophy, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Miyazaki2016Calpain6; Chen2020CAPN6).

## Structure
CAPN6 (calpain 6) is a unique member of the calpain family, characterized by its lack of proteolytic activity due to the replacement of a crucial cysteine residue with lysine, which is essential for the catalytic function in other calpains (Tonami2011Calpain6). Structurally, CAPN6 lacks the typical C-terminal calmodulin-like domain found in classical calpains and instead features a calpain-type β-sandwich (cBSW) domain at the catalytic subunit, replacing the usual penta-EF-hand (PEF) domain (Chen2020CAPN6). This structural divergence suggests distinct functional and regulatory mechanisms compared to other calpains.

CAPN6 contains a diverged C2 domain, also referred to as domain T, which is similar to the Ca2+ and phospholipid-binding C2 domain found in other proteins (Tonami2011Calpain6). The protein also includes domain III, which is related to the C2 domain and is involved in microtubule binding and stabilization (Tonami2011Calpain6). CAPN6 interacts with the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 through domain II, a region that corresponds to the cysteine protease domain in other calpains, and the zinc-finger-containing N-terminal region of GEF-H1 (Tonami2011Calpain6). This interaction is crucial for regulating Rac1 activity and cell motility.

## Function
Calpain-6 (CAPN6) is a non-proteolytic member of the calpain family, primarily involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. Unlike other calpains, CAPN6 lacks protease activity due to a substitution in its active site, which suggests its role is more structural than enzymatic (Sorimachi2011Impact; Tonami2011Calpain6). CAPN6 is known to stabilize microtubules, a function crucial for maintaining cell structure and facilitating cell movement (Chen2020CAPN6; Tonami2011Calpain6).

CAPN6 interacts with the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1, which is associated with microtubules. This interaction prevents GEF-H1 from activating Rac1, a small GTPase involved in lamellipodial formation and cell motility. When CAPN6 is knocked down, GEF-H1 translocates to the lamellipodia, leading to increased Rac1 activity and enhanced cell motility (Tonami2011Calpain6). CAPN6's role in microtubule stabilization is also linked to its involvement in osteoclast function, where it promotes microtubule acetylation and stability, essential for bone resorption (Hong2010Calpain6).

Overall, CAPN6 plays a significant role in cellular processes by modulating the cytoskeleton, influencing cell motility, and maintaining microtubule stability.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAPN6 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In atherosclerosis, CAPN6 is upregulated in macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions, contributing to the disease by enhancing pinocytotic activity and cholesterol deposition in the vascular wall. CAPN6 deficiency in macrophages has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting its proatherogenic role (Miyazaki2016Calpain6).

In cancer, CAPN6 expression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. It is overexpressed in various cancers, including uterine leiomyoma, cervical cancer, osteosarcoma, and liver cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. In osteosarcoma, high CAPN6 levels are linked to chemoresistance, and its inhibition can enhance sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs (Chen2020CAPN6).

CAPN6 also plays a role in chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related muscle atrophy by inhibiting autophagy in myoblasts. Overexpression of CAPN6 in myoblasts decreases autophagy, contributing to muscle atrophy in CKD (Zhang2021Calpain).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CAPN6 expression is decreased, and its lower levels are positively associated with patient survival, indicating a potential protective role in this specific cancer type (Chen2020CAPN6).

## Interactions
CAPN6 (calpain 6) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with CWC22, a component of the exon junction complex (EJC), affecting mRNA splicing by limiting the nuclear localization of CWC22 in macrophages. This interaction is significant in the context of atherosclerosis, where CAPN6 is induced by proatherogenic mediators, leading to altered macrophage phenotypes (Miyazaki2016Calpain6).

CAPN6 also interacts with GEF-H1, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to regulate cell motility and Rac1 activity. CAPN6 stabilizes microtubules and promotes the association of GEF-H1 with them, preventing GEF-H1 from activating Rac1-mediated microtubule-actin crosstalk. Knockdown of CAPN6 results in the redistribution of GEF-H1 from microtubules to the lamellipodial region, enhancing cell motility (Tonami2011Calpain6).

In the context of cancer, CAPN6 interacts with the YAP protein, forming a CAPN6/YAP axis that influences tumor growth and metastasis. CAPN6 stabilizes YAP protein, enhancing its activity, which is part of the YAP/TEAD signaling axis. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the Hippo pathway and contributes to tumorigenesis in osteosarcoma (TchicayaBouanga2022A).
