# OR2L5

## Overview
The OR2L5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 5, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor family is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. OR2L5, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of odors by binding specific odorant molecules and initiating a neuronal response (Qiu2020aarFDC).
