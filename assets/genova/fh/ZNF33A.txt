# ZNF33A

## Overview
ZNF33A is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 33A, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, and they play crucial roles in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 33A is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression, acting as a transcription factor that can modulate the expression of target genes. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF33A are still under investigation, but its role in transcriptional regulation suggests it may be significant in cellular differentiation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC).
