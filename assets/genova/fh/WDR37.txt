# WDR37

## Overview
The WDR37 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 37 protein, a member of the WD40 repeat family, which is characterized by its seven-bladed β-propeller structure. This protein is primarily involved in facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the assembly of multiprotein complexes that participate in diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Schapira2017WD40). The WDR37 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and is implicated in cellular homeostasis and development (Reis2019De). Although the specific functions of WDR37 in human cells remain largely undefined, it is suggested to play roles in cholesterol biosynthesis, steroid metabolism, and immune regulation, with potential implications in tumor suppression (Yin2024An; Reis2019De). Mutations in the WDR37 gene are linked to a severe multisystemic syndrome, highlighting its critical role in normal development and its involvement in various congenital disorders (Reis2019De).

## Structure
The WDR37 protein is characterized by a seven-bladed propeller-like structure in its C-terminal region, formed by seven WD domains spanning from amino acid 154 to 493 (Reis2019De). These WD domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and are a common feature in proteins that form beta-propeller structures (Kanca2019De). The N-terminal region of WDR37, where several de novo missense variants have been identified, is highly conserved across species and may influence the protein's conformation, potentially adding an eighth propeller blade (Reis2019De).

The WDR37 protein also contains a coiled coil region, which is located between the amino-terminal and the first WD40 repeat. This region is evolutionarily conserved and plays a crucial role in the protein's interaction capabilities (Kanca2019De). The protein forms homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may be important for its function (Samejima2024Splicing).

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of WDR37 have not been explicitly detailed in the provided context, but these are common in proteins with complex interaction domains like WD repeats. The exact function of WDR37 remains uncertain, but its structural features suggest significant roles in cellular processes.

## Function
The WDR37 gene encodes a protein that is part of the WD40 repeat family, known for facilitating protein-protein interactions through its seven-bladed β-propeller structure. These interactions are crucial for the formation of multiprotein complexes involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Schapira2017WD40). The WDR37 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in cellular homeostasis and development (Reis2019De).

In healthy human cells, the specific function of WDR37 remains largely unknown, but it is suggested to play a role in cholesterol biosynthesis and steroid metabolism, as indicated by studies in zebrafish models (Reis2019De). The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests its potential impact on cellular lipid regulation and energy homeostasis. Additionally, WDR37 is implicated in the regulation of immune pathways, acting as a tumor suppressor by influencing immune cell infiltration and promoting the activation of tumor suppressor pathways (Yin2024An).

Despite its broad expression pattern and potential roles, the precise molecular activities of WDR37 in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated, highlighting the need for further research to understand its biological significance (Reis2019De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR37 gene are associated with a severe multisystemic syndrome characterized by a range of clinical features. These include ocular anomalies such as corneal opacity, Peters anomaly, coloboma, and microcornea, as well as dysmorphic facial features, significant neurological impairment, and structural brain defects. Patients often experience seizures, poor feeding, poor post-natal growth, and variable skeletal, cardiac, and genitourinary defects (Reis2019De). The gene is also linked to epilepsy, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Kanca2019De).

De novo missense variants in WDR37 have been identified in individuals with these conditions, and these variants are not present in the general population databases like gnomAD, indicating their rarity and potential pathogenicity (Kanca2019De; Reis2019De). Functional studies in model organisms such as zebrafish and Drosophila have shown that these variants can lead to severe developmental issues and early lethality, suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism (Kanca2019De; Reis2019De).

A novel splicing variant in WDR37 has been associated with neurooculocardiogenitourinary syndrome (NOCGUS), expanding the phenotypic expression of the syndrome to include features like anal atresia and polycystic kidney (Samejima2024Splicing). These findings underscore the critical role of WDR37 in normal development and its involvement in various congenital disorders.

## Interactions
The WDR37 protein is involved in several interactions that are significant for its function as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. It has been shown to interact with the TCP1 complex, which includes proteins such as TCP1, CCT4, CCT8, CCT6A, CCT5, and CCT7. This interaction was identified through immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments conducted in the SW1990 pancreatic cancer cell line. The interaction suggests that WDR37 may play a role in mediating the degradation of the TCP1 complex, potentially through K48 ubiquitin modification, which is a process known to target proteins for degradation via the proteasome (Yin2024An).

Additionally, WDR37 has been shown to bind with the K48 ubiquitin chain (UBA52), indicating its involvement in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways. This interaction supports the hypothesis that WDR37 exerts its tumor-suppressive effects by promoting the degradation of proteins that are involved in cancer-promoting pathways (Yin2024An). These interactions highlight the potential mechanisms by which WDR37 influences pancreatic cancer prognosis and underscores its role in cellular processes related to tumor suppression.
