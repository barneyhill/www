# CSH1

## Overview
The CSH1 gene encodes the protein chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1, also known as placental lactogen, which is a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a significant role in modulating maternal and fetal metabolism during pregnancy. It is involved in processes such as insulin resistance, lipolysis, and protein synthesis, which are crucial for ensuring an adequate nutrient supply to the developing fetus (Männik2012Differential; Sedman2008Complex). The expression of CSH1 is regulated by a locus control region on chromosome 17, and it interacts with various transcription factors to modulate its activity (Lytras2011Identification; Jain20203D). Alterations in CSH1 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as Silver-Russell syndrome and intrauterine growth restriction, highlighting its importance in fetal development and maternal health (Prager2003Characterization; Eggermann1998Paternally).

## Function
The CSH1 gene encodes chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1, also known as placental lactogen, which plays a crucial role in regulating maternal and fetal metabolism during pregnancy. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and is involved in modulating maternal metabolism to ensure an adequate nutrient supply to the developing fetus. CSH1 influences insulin resistance, promoting the mobilization of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids to the fetus, which is essential for fetal growth and development (Männik2012Differential; Sedman2008Complex).

CSH1 also plays a role in lipolysis, increasing the availability of nonesterified fatty acids, which can be used as an energy source, thereby sparing glucose for fetal use (Newbern2011Placental). The protein is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, contributing to the anabolic processes necessary for fetal development (Kimura2007Epigenetic). Additionally, CSH1 is implicated in the regulation of fetal growth by supporting the development of the placenta and influencing the expression of other growth-related genes (Awonuga2011Eomesodermin). The expression of CSH1 is tightly regulated and can be affected by various factors, including stress and pregnancy complications, which may impact its function and the overall outcome of pregnancy (Männik2012Differential; Awonuga2011Eomesodermin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSH1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. CSH1 deletions have been associated with Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), a disorder characterized by growth retardation and dysmorphic features. Studies have identified CSH1 deletions in some SRS patients, suggesting a potential link between these deletions and the SRS phenotype, although the exact contribution of CSH1 to the syndrome remains unclear (Prager2003Characterization; Eggermann1998Paternally). 

CSH1 is also expressed in the placental syncytiotrophoblast and is thought to influence fetal growth by affecting insulin sensitivity and nutrient supply. Low levels of CSH1 during pregnancy have been associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), diabetes, and preeclampsia, although these associations may be influenced by other factors such as placental issues (Prager2003Characterization). 

Despite these associations, the biological functions of CSH1 are not fully understood, and further research is needed to clarify its role in these conditions. The presence of CSH1 deletions in growth-retarded patients compared to controls suggests a possible contribution to the phenotype of some SRS patients, potentially in combination with other genetic or environmental factors (Prager2003Characterization).

## Interactions
The human gene CSH1, also known as chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function. CSH1 is part of the growth hormone (GH) locus on chromosome 17, which is regulated by a locus control region coordinating tissue-specific expression. This regulatory region affects the expression of a network of genes, suggesting that CSH1 may be involved in complex regulatory interactions within the nucleus (Jain20203D).

CSH1 interacts with transcription factors such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) and Ets family proteins, which bind to enhancer sequences of the CSH1 gene. These interactions are crucial for modulating the gene's enhancer activity, particularly in the placenta. The presence of specific binding sites for these transcription factors in the enhancer regions of CSH1 suggests a regulatory role in gene expression (Lytras2011Identification).

The study of CSH1's enhancer sequences has shown that nucleotide differences can affect the binding and activity of these transcription factors, indicating that CSH1's interactions with C/EBP and Ets proteins are finely tuned to regulate its expression in response to developmental cues (Lytras2011Identification).
