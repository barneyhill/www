# TRPC5OS

## Overview
TRPC5OS is a gene that encodes the TRPC5 opposite strand protein, which has been implicated in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with proteins such as Annexin A1, peroxiredoxin 1, and enolase 1, which are significant in cancer proliferation and patient outcomes (Peng2022Comparative). TRPC5OS is overexpressed in TNBC tissues, leading to alterations in gene expression patterns that affect cell division and DNA replication (Peng2022Comparative). These characteristics suggest that TRPC5OS may serve as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC, given its role in modulating pathways involved in tumor development (Peng2022Comparative).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TRPC5OS gene has been implicated in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies have shown that TRPC5OS is overexpressed in TNBC tissues and cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231, compared to luminal tumor tissues and normal breast cell lines. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and viability, suggesting that TRPC5OS may act as a tumor inducer in TNBC (Peng2022Comparative). 

The gene's overexpression leads to significant changes in gene expression patterns, with thousands of genes being differentially expressed. These changes are linked to biological processes such as cell division and DNA replication, and pathways like homologous recombination and TNF signaling (Peng2022Comparative). 

TRPC5OS also interacts with several proteins, including ENO1, which is associated with glycolysis and cancer proliferation. The interaction between TRPC5OS and ENO1 suggests a potential mechanism by which TRPC5OS may influence cancer progression, as ENO1 expression is correlated with poorer prognoses in breast cancer patients (Peng2022Comparative). These findings indicate that TRPC5OS could be a novel therapeutic target for TNBC.

## Interactions
TRPC5OS, also known as TRPC5 antisense RNA1, is involved in protein interactions that are significant in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis have identified 17 potential interacting proteins with TRPC5OS. Notable among these are Annexin A1 (ANXA1), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), and enolase 1 (ENO1) (Peng2022Comparative). ENO1, in particular, is highlighted as a significant protein due to its association with glycolysis and cancer proliferation. The expression of ENO1 is significantly increased following TRPC5OS overexpression, suggesting that TRPC5OS may regulate ENO1 expression, impacting cancer proliferation and patient outcomes (Peng2022Comparative).

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis further emphasizes ENO1, PRDX1, and EEF1G as proteins with the most interactions, indicating their potential roles in cancer proliferation processes such as cell division and RNA replication (Peng2022Comparative). These interactions suggest that TRPC5OS may play a role in modulating key pathways involved in tumor development, making it a potential therapeutic target for TNBC (Peng2022Comparative).
