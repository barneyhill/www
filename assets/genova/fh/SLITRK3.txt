# SLITRK3

## Overview
SLITRK3 is a gene that encodes the SLIT and NTRK-like family member 3 protein, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in the development and function of inhibitory synapses in the brain. The SLITRK3 protein is characterized by its single-pass transmembrane structure and the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate critical protein-protein interactions necessary for synaptic adhesion and signaling. Notably, SLITRK3 interacts with synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as Neuroligin 2 and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ, playing a pivotal role in GABAergic synaptogenesis and synaptic stabilization (Li2019A; Efthymiou2024Human). Beyond its neurological functions, SLITRK3 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it interacts with NTRK3 to promote oncogenic pathways (BolligFischer2021Role). Mutations in SLITRK3 are associated with various neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal brain function and disease states (Efthymiou2024Human).

## Structure
The SLITRK3 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic cell adhesion, particularly at inhibitory synapses. Its molecular structure includes two clusters of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains in the N-terminal extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and a carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain (Li2019A). The LRR domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, with the LRR1 domain mediating trans-synaptic interactions and the LRR2 domain interacting with postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules like Neuroligin 2 (NL2) (Li2019A; Li2017Molecular).

The C-terminal region of SLITRK3 contains a conserved tyrosine residue, Y969, which is critical for GABAergic synapse development and function (Li2019A). This region is important for synaptic regulation, although it is not essential for SLITRK3 homo-dimerization or surface expression (Li2019A). Mutations in SLITRK3, such as E606X and C566R, can disrupt its function, leading to impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission and altered synaptic density (Efthymiou2024Human).

SLITRK3's structure is further characterized by its interaction with other synaptic proteins, such as Neuroligin 2, through its extracellular LRR domains, which are crucial for its role in synapse development (Li2017Molecular). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for maintaining the inhibitory/excitatory balance in the brain, which is vital for normal neurological function (Efthymiou2024Human).

## Function
The SLITRK3 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of inhibitory synapses in the brain. It is highly expressed at inhibitory synapses and is involved in enhancing inhibitory synapse formation by interacting with other synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as Neuroligin 2 and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (Efthymiou2024Human). SLITRK3 is essential for GABAergic synaptogenesis, particularly at the late stage of development, and is involved in adenosine receptor-mediated inhibitory synapse stabilization (Efthymiou2024Human).

In healthy human cells, SLITRK3 promotes GABAergic synaptic transmission, as evidenced by increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) when wild-type SLITRK3 is overexpressed in neurons (Efthymiou2024Human). This suggests that SLITRK3 enhances the density and function of inhibitory synapses, which is essential for maintaining the inhibitory balance in the brain and controlling neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (Efthymiou2024Human). The protein's activity is crucial for proper neural circuitry and function, impacting processes like learning and memory. SLITRK3's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal brain function and its potential impact on neurological health when disrupted (Efthymiou2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLITRK3 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. These mutations disrupt the gene's role in GABAergic synapse development, leading to impaired synaptic function and increased seizure susceptibility. Specific mutations, such as SLITRK3-C566R and SLITRK3-E606X, have been shown to abolish the gene's ability to enhance GABAergic synapse development, resulting in deficits in inhibitory synaptic transmission (Efthymiou2024Human). 

Clinical studies have identified SLITRK3 mutations in families with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, affected individuals exhibit symptoms such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and intellectual disability. These conditions are often inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (Efthymiou2024Human). 

In addition to neurological disorders, SLITRK3 gene amplification has been implicated in squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC). This amplification leads to overexpression of SLITRK3, which activates the NTRK3 receptor, promoting a cancer stem cell phenotype and contributing to poor survival outcomes in LUSC patients. Targeting SLITRK3-dependent NTRK3 activation with NTRK inhibitors is suggested as a potential therapeutic approach (BolligFischer2021Role).

## Interactions
SLITRK3 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synaptic development and function. It interacts with Neuroligin 2 (NL2), a postsynaptic cell adhesion molecule, which is essential for GABAergic synapse development. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in mouse hippocampal lysates and HEK293T cells. The interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of SLITRK3, specifically the LRR9 module, which binds to the N-terminus of NL2 (Li2017Molecular).

SLITRK3 also interacts with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ (PTPδ) on the presynaptic side, which is important for synapse formation and maintenance (Li2019A). These interactions are critical for the regulation of inhibitory synapse development and function, as they influence synaptic connectivity and neural circuit modulation (Efthymiou2024Human).

In the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), SLITRK3 interacts with NTRK3, facilitating ligand-induced NTRK kinase activation. This interaction promotes a cancer stem cell phenotype in LUSC, highlighting a potential role for SLITRK3 in cancer biology (BolligFischer2021Role).
