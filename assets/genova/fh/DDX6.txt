# DDX6

## Overview
DDX6, or DEAD-box helicase 6, is a gene that encodes a member of the DEAD-box protein family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. The protein product, DEAD-box helicase 6, functions as an RNA helicase and plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, particularly in mRNA decay and translation regulation. As a component of cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), DEAD-box helicase 6 is involved in mRNA storage and turnover, interacting with various protein partners to facilitate these processes (Balak2019Rare). The protein's structural features, including its two RecA-like domains, are essential for its ATP-binding, ATPase, and RNA-binding activities, which are crucial for its helicase function (Majerciak2023RNA). DDX6 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, with its dysfunction linked to intellectual disability and dysmorphic features, underscoring its significance in maintaining RNA homeostasis and proper cellular function (Balak2019Rare).

## Structure
DDX6, or DEAD-box helicase 6, is a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. The protein consists of two RecA-like domains, which are crucial for its ATP-binding, ATPase, and RNA-binding/helicase activities (Majerciak2023RNA). These domains form a cleft that facilitates ATP and RNA binding, essential for its helicase function (Balak2019Rare). The DEAD-box motif is located in the RecA1 domain, while the RecA2 domain contains several conserved motifs, including QxxR and V, which are involved in protein interactions (Balak2019Rare; Majerciak2023RNA).

The C-terminal RecA-like domain of DDX6 is particularly important for protein-protein interactions, such as with CNOT1, PATL1, and 4E-T, which are involved in processing body (PB) formation (Majerciak2023RNA; Rouya2014Human). The interaction with CNOT1 involves specific residues, such as Arg386 in DDX6, forming a salt bridge with Glu1137 in CNOT1 (Rouya2014Human). Structural studies have shown that DDX6 can adopt different conformations depending on its interaction state, as seen in its complex with CNOT1 (Mathys2014Structural). These structural features underscore DDX6's role in RNA metabolism and its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes.

## Function
DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) is an RNA helicase that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism, particularly in mRNA decay and translation regulation. It is a component of cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies), which are membraneless organelles involved in mRNA storage and turnover. DDX6 facilitates the assembly of P-bodies by interacting with various protein partners, such as LSM14A, 4E-T, PAT1B, EDC3, and EDC4, which are essential for its function in mRNA regulation (Balak2019Rare).

In healthy human cells, DDX6 is involved in the regulation of gene expression through translational repression and mRNA decay. It binds to mRNAs, as demonstrated in cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments, and is implicated in the decay of GC-rich mRNAs, which are often actively translated (Balak2019Rare). DDX6 also plays a significant role in neurodevelopment by regulating the activity of microRNAs like Let-7a, which are important for neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of DDX6 in neural stem cells enhances neuronal differentiation, while its loss inhibits the formation of new neurons, indicating its essential role in neuronal differentiation and migration (Balak2019Rare).

DDX6's function is crucial for maintaining RNA homeostasis and proper cellular function, and its dysfunction can lead to significant developmental issues, including intellectual disability and dysmorphic features (Balak2019Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DDX6 gene are associated with intellectual disability (ID) and dysmorphic features. Rare de novo missense variants in DDX6, such as p.His372Arg, p.Arg373Gln, p.Cys390Arg, p.Thr391Ile, and p.Thr391Pro, have been identified in individuals with these conditions. These mutations lead to defects in processing body (P-body) assembly and RNA dysregulation, which are crucial for mRNA storage and translational repression (Balak2019Rare). The clinical manifestations of DDX6 mutations include developmental delay, gait abnormalities, cardiac anomalies, and dysmorphic facial features. The severity of these phenotypes can vary depending on the specific amino acid changes (Balak2019Rare).

DDX6 mutations result in a failure to efficiently form P-bodies, leading to a decreased number of these RNP granules in fibroblasts. This impairment affects the interaction of DDX6 with its protein partners, such as LSM14A and 4E-T, which are essential for P-body assembly (Balak2019Rare). The study of DDX6 highlights its importance in neuronal differentiation and its high expression in the cerebellar hemispheres, suggesting a significant role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Balak2019Rare). Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of DDX6 mutations on neuronal precursor proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Balak2019Rare).

## Interactions
DDX6, also known as DEAD-box helicase 6, is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in RNA metabolism and post-transcriptional regulation. It interacts with several protein complexes, including the ATXN2/ATXN2L-PABPC1 complex and the DCP1-EDC3-PAT1L decapping complex, which are involved in mRNA decay and translation repression (Bish2015Comprehensive). DDX6 also associates with proteins such as LSM14A, TIF1B, and EIF4ENIF1, which are linked to RNA processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (Bish2015Comprehensive).

The protein interacts with NUFIP2, GRAN1 (FAM195A), and GRAN2 (FAM195B), which localize to stress granules upon stress induction, suggesting a role in stress response mechanisms (Bish2015Comprehensive). DDX6 is also a sumoylation substrate, with its interacting proteins significantly enriched for sumoylation sites, indicating its involvement in various protein complexes with distinct roles in RNA metabolism (Bish2015Comprehensive).

In the nucleus, DDX6 interacts with ADAR1 and ADAR2, proteins involved in A-to-I RNA editing, suggesting a regulatory role in RNA editing and neuronal differentiation (Shih2023RNA). These interactions are direct and not mediated by RNA, highlighting DDX6's potential role in modulating RNA editing processes (Shih2023RNA).
