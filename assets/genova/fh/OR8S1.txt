# OR8S1

## Overview
OR8S1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily S member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odorant molecules, initiating a cascade of neuronal responses that contribute to the perception of smell. The genetic diversity of olfactory receptors, including OR8S1, is thought to enhance olfactory discrimination, which is vital for various biological functions such as food recognition and social interactions (Cardoso2020Wholegenome; Alonso2008Overdominance). Additionally, OR8S1 has been implicated in cancer-related pathways, suggesting a broader significance beyond olfaction (Iuliano2018Combining).

## Function
OR8S1 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR8S1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Cardoso2020Wholegenome).

The olfactory receptors, including OR8S1, interact with odorant molecules in the nasal epithelium to initiate neuronal responses that lead to odor perception. This process is crucial for various functions such as food recognition, identification of sexual partners, and mother-infant bonding (Cardoso2020Wholegenome). The genetic diversity in olfactory receptors, including OR8S1, may enhance the ability to discriminate among closely related odorants, which is important for olfactory acuity (Alonso2008Overdominance).

OR8S1, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in the olfactory signaling pathway, which is essential for the organism's ability to perceive and respond to environmental odors. This receptor's activity is a key component of the molecular processes that underlie the sense of smell in humans (Cardoso2020Wholegenome).

## Clinical Significance
The OR8S1 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in cancer cell behavior, particularly in breast cancer. It is associated with the KEGG olfactory transduction pathway, which includes genes linked to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis emergence (Iuliano2018Combining). The integration of mRNA data and copy number aberrations (CNAs) has revealed that OR8S1 is part of pathways crucial for cancer-immune evasion, such as the KEGG cytokine receptor interaction and KEGG MAPK signaling pathways (Iuliano2018Combining).

In equine studies, a copy number variation region (CNVR) within the OR8S1 gene was identified and validated, showing a concordance rate of 80% with RT-qPCR results. However, discrepancies were noted between RT-qPCR and SNP genotyping array data, indicating potential challenges in detecting CNVs accurately (Solé2019Inter). While these findings highlight the gene's involvement in cancer-related pathways, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations or expression alterations in OR8S1 are not well-documented. The gene's role in cancer suggests it may be a potential target for further research into its clinical significance in human health.
