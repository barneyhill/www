# MEIS1

## Overview
MEIS1 (Meis homeobox 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) homeodomain family. The MEIS1 protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics, primarily through its interactions with other transcription factors such as PBX and HOX proteins. These interactions facilitate the formation of multi-protein transcriptional complexes that modulate epigenetic signatures and influence various biological processes, including hematopoiesis, neuronal differentiation, and development. MEIS1 is particularly significant in the context of hematopoietic stem cell regulation and lineage commitment, as well as in developmental processes like limb and hindbrain formation. Clinically, MEIS1 is implicated in several diseases, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor in different cancer types, and is associated with Restless Legs Syndrome through specific genetic polymorphisms (Xiong2009MEIS1; Blasi2021MEIS1; Schulte2019MEIS).

## Structure
MEIS1 is a transcription factor that belongs to the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) homeodomain family, characterized by a conserved 60-residue-long helix-loop-helix homeodomain with a three-amino-acid extension (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The protein contains a DNA-binding homeodomain (HD) towards the carboxy-terminus and two protein-protein interaction domains towards the amino terminus, known as MEIS-A and MEIS-B, which are conserved within the MEINOX family (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The MEIS-A domain includes binding sequences for Pbx1, P160, and 4EHP, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

MEIS1 can form multiple protein isoforms due to alternative splicing, with two major variants being MEIS1a and MEIS1b. MEIS1b specifically regulates postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle exit (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The C-terminal domains of MEIS1A and MEIS1B are necessary for interaction with HOXA13, with the domain of MEIS1B being sufficient for this interaction (Williams2005Range). MEIS1B's C-terminal 126 amino acids are sufficient for interaction with certain HOX proteins (Williams2005Range).

The carboxy-terminal region of MEIS1 is crucial for its interactions with other proteins and contains transcriptional activation domains responsive to chromatin structure and signaling pathways (Longobardi2013Biochemistry). The protein's interactions with HOX proteins are essential for its function, with the MEIS-A domain playing a significant role in these interactions (Longobardi2013Biochemistry).

## Function
MEIS1 (Meis homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and chromatin dynamics in healthy human cells. It forms complexes with PBX proteins, which are essential for its function, and can bind DNA directly or indirectly through interactions with other transcription factors, such as HOX proteins (Schulte2019MEIS). MEIS1 is involved in orchestrating the assembly of multi-protein transcriptional complexes, modulating the epigenetic signature of DNA and chromatin. During neuronal differentiation, MEIS1 recruits the enzyme PARP1 to PBX1-primed sites, leading to chromatin decompaction and making DNA elements accessible for transcriptional activation (Schulte2019MEIS).

In hematopoiesis, MEIS1 is crucial for the early hematopoietic process, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It regulates the metabolic phenotype of HSCs through interactions with hypoxia-inducible factors, maintaining their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities (Jiang2021The). MEIS1 also plays a role in the regulation of early erythroid and megakaryocytic cell fate, promoting lineage commitment towards the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor fate (Zeddies2014MEIS1). In the context of development, MEIS1 is involved in various processes, including limb and hindbrain development, through its interaction with retinoic acid signaling pathways (Schulte2019MEIS).

## Clinical Significance
The MEIS1 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, and interaction changes. In cancer, MEIS1 acts as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context. It is downregulated in several cancers, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma, while being upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and thymoma (Li2023A). In AML, MEIS1 overexpression, often in conjunction with HOXA9, is linked to poor prognosis and inadequate response to chemotherapy (Blasi2021MEIS1). MEIS1's interaction with PBX proteins is crucial for its oncogenic activity in leukemia (Blasi2021MEIS1).

In non-cancerous conditions, MEIS1 is associated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MEIS1 gene, such as rs12469063 and rs2300478, are significantly associated with RLS, affecting mRNA and protein expression levels (Xiong2009MEIS1). These genetic variations suggest a regulatory role in MEIS1 expression, contributing to the RLS phenotype. The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its complex role in human health and disease.

## Interactions
MEIS1 (Meis homeobox 1) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. MEIS1 forms stable heterodimers with PBX proteins, such as PBX1 and PBX3, which are crucial for its function in hematopoiesis and oncogenesis. These interactions are mediated by the MEINOX domain of MEIS1, which is essential for nuclear localization and DNA binding specificity (Blasi2021MEIS1). In leukemia, MEIS1 cooperates with HOXA9 to promote cell proliferation and leukemic transformation, often forming trimeric complexes with PBX proteins (Looi; Yao2021MEIS1).

MEIS1 also interacts with other transcription factors, such as CREB and CRTC, which are involved in transcriptional activation. These interactions are facilitated by the MEIS1A C-terminus and are crucial for its transcriptional activities (Looi page 1 of 23; Looi page 22 of 23). In prostate cancer, MEIS1 interacts with HOXB13, a relationship mediated by conserved MEIS interacting domains in HOXB13, which influences cell proliferation and gene expression (Johng2018HOXB13).

Additionally, MEIS1 can bind to DNA independently or in cooperation with Hox proteins, such as Hoxa-9, stabilizing DNA binding and contributing to its role in leukemogenesis (Shen1997AbdB-Like). These interactions highlight MEIS1's complex role in various biological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
