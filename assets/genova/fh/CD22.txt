# CD22

## Overview
CD22 is a gene that encodes the CD22 protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of B cells. The CD22 protein functions as an inhibitory coreceptor for the B-cell receptor (BCR), playing a critical role in modulating B cell activation and maintaining immune tolerance. Structurally, CD22 is characterized by its seven immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its interactions with sialic acid-containing ligands, thereby influencing cell-cell adhesion and signaling pathways (EreñoOrbea2017Molecular; EreñoOrbea2021Structural). The protein's cytoplasmic domain contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1, which are essential for dampening BCR signaling (Jellusova2012Regulation). CD22 is implicated in various clinical contexts, including autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies, where its expression and function can significantly impact disease progression and treatment outcomes (Fujimoto2007B; Qazi2023CD22).

## Structure
The CD22 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on B cells, characterized by its elongated, tilted rod-like structure. Its ectodomain (ECD) consists of seven immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, labeled d1 through d7, which are crucial for its function as an inhibitory coreceptor for the B-cell receptor (EreñoOrbea2017Molecular; EreñoOrbea2021Structural). The d1 domain adopts a V-type Ig fold, while the d2 domain has a C1-type fold, and the d3 domain conforms to a C2-type Ig fold (EreñoOrbea2017Molecular). The d6 and d7 domains also possess a C2-type Ig fold, each with an intradomain disulfide linkage (EreñoOrbea2021Structural).

CD22 is heavily glycosylated, with 12 predicted N-linked glycans, which are important for its expression and function. Glycosylation sites such as N101 and N231 play significant roles in protein stability and interactions with therapeutic antibodies (EreñoOrbea2017Molecular). The protein's structure is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, contributing to its low flexibility (EreñoOrbea2017Molecular).

CD22 has multiple splice variants, including CD22a and CD22P, which differ in the number of Ig-like domains they contain (Powell1993Natural). These structural features and modifications are critical for CD22's role in B-cell interactions and immune regulation.

## Function
CD22 is a B-lymphocyte-specific membrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It functions as both a positive and negative regulator of B cell activation, modulating signal transduction pathways initiated through the BCR (Poe2012CD22; Sato1996CD22). CD22 achieves this by interacting with sialic acid-containing ligands, which are essential for its role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity (Enterina2019Coordinated; Müller2014The).

The protein is involved in cell-cell interactions through its sialic acid-dependent adhesion properties, binding to various cell types such as monocytes, erythrocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (Tuscano1996Engagement). CD22 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic domain, which recruit phosphatases like SHP-1 to dephosphorylate components of the BCR signaling cascade, thereby dampening BCR signaling and maintaining B cell quiescence (Jellusova2012Regulation; Poe2012CD22).

CD22 is expressed on the surface of mature B cells and is involved in the regulation of B cell migration and cell-cell interactions, contributing to the modulation of immune responses and the prevention of autoimmune diseases (Müller2014The; Sato1996CD22).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD22 gene, particularly the deletion of exon 12 (CD22E12), have significant clinical implications in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Patients with low CD22E12 expression exhibit worse treatment outcomes, including higher relapse rates and shorter leukemia-free and overall survival times. This low expression status is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in high-risk B-ALL patients, with hazard ratios indicating a strong association with adverse outcomes (Qazi2023CD22). The expression of a truncated CD22∆E12 protein is linked to increased proliferation and defective apoptosis of leukemic B-cell precursors, contributing to aggressive disease progression (Qazi2023CD22).

In autoimmune diseases, CD22 plays a role in modulating B cell receptor signaling. Alterations in the CD19/CD22 signaling loop can lead to autoimmune phenotypes, such as lupus-like autoimmunity, due to the failure of inhibitory feedback loops. This suggests that changes in CD22 expression or function can contribute to autoimmune disorders (Fujimoto2007B). CD22 is also a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases and B-cell malignancies (Lanza2020CD22).

## Interactions
CD22 is involved in several physical interactions that are crucial for B-cell signal transduction and immune regulation. It interacts with sialic acid-dependent ligands, including CD45, through its extracellular domain, which is similar to cell adhesion molecules (Tuscano1996Engagement). CD22 can bind to monocytes, erythrocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes by recognizing sialic acid residues on these cells (Powell1993Natural). The interaction with CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase, is significant but not fully understood (Tuscano1996Engagement).

CD22's intracellular domain contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) that recruit SHP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase, upon phosphorylation by the Src family kinase Lyn. This recruitment is a key component of its inhibitory function in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling (Nitschke2004Molecular). CD22 also associates with proteins such as p53/561yn and SH-PTPlC, which are involved in B-cell signal transduction (Tuscano1996Engagement). The interaction with SH-PTPlC, which contains SH-2 domains, may counteract the positive effects of kinases like Src and Jak family kinases, suggesting a balance between positive and negative effectors in CD22 signaling (Tuscano1996Engagement).
