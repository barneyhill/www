# TBRG1

## Overview
TBRG1, or transforming growth factor beta regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as chromosomal stability, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis. The protein, also known as the nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2 (NIAM), is characterized by a unique FYR domain, which includes FYRN and FYRC motifs that are essential for its structural integrity and function. This domain is implicated in protein interactions, particularly in chromatin biology, suggesting a role in transcription regulation and histone modifications. TBRG1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with key components of the ARF-Mdm2-Tip60-p53 tumor suppressor pathway, enhancing p53 activation and contributing to tumor suppression. Additionally, TBRG1's involvement in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway and its induction in response to DNA damage underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation (García‐Alai2010The; Reed2014NIAMDeficient; Pardo2017Myst2Kat7).

## Structure
The TBRG1 protein, also known as the nuclear interactor of ARF and MDM2 (NIAM), features a distinct FYR domain that plays a crucial role in its function. This domain includes two sequence motifs, FYRN and FYRC, which are rich in phenylalanine and tyrosine residues. These motifs form a single folded module with a novel alpha plus beta (a + b) fold, consisting of a six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet followed by four consecutive alpha-helices. The FYRN region corresponds to beta-strands 1-4 and their connecting loops, while the FYRC motif maps to beta-strand 5, beta-strand 6, and helices alpha1 to alpha4 (García‐Alai2010The).

The FYR domain's structure is stabilized by conserved residues, with specific tyrosine and phenylalanine residues forming a hydrophobic core. Hydrogen bonds involving conserved tyrosines, such as Y234 and Y222, are essential for maintaining the protein's structure. The conservation of solvent-exposed residues suggests potential functional regions, including a pocket lined by Y212 and F247, which may serve as ligand binding sites (García‐Alai2010The). The structural data imply a binding function for the FYRN/FYRC motifs, although the exact nature of potential ligands remains unclear (García‐Alai2010The).

## Function
The TBRG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosomal stability and regulating cell growth and apoptosis. It is involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway and is induced in response to DNA damage, contributing to cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression (García‐Alai2010The). TBRG1 interacts with the tumor suppressor p14ARF and MDM2, a key regulator of the p53 pathway, suggesting its involvement in chromatin-associated processes and transcription regulation (García‐Alai2010The).

The protein contains FYRN and FYRC motifs, which are part of a single folded module known as the FYR domain. This domain is involved in the heterodimerization of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins, which are essential for epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development (García‐Alai2010The). The FYR domain is more likely to have a binding function rather than a catalytic one, indicating its potential role in chromatin biology and histone modifications (García‐Alai2010The).

TBRG1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it may link antiproliferative pathways with chromatin, although its exact function in chromatin association remains unclear (García‐Alai2010The).

## Interactions
TBRG1, also known as NIAM, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in tumor suppression and cellular stability. It interacts with the ARF-Mdm2-Tip60-p53 tumor suppressor pathway, where it acts as a novel activator. TBRG1 promotes the relocalization of ARF from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, enhancing p53 activation. It also binds to Mdm2, reducing the formation of p53-Mdm2 complexes, which impairs Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53, thereby stabilizing and activating p53 signaling (Reed2014NIAMDeficient).

TBRG1 is a robust interacting partner of Myst2, a histone acetyltransferase, in mouse embryonic stem cells. This interaction suggests that TBRG1 is part of a Myst2 sub-complex involved in chromatin remodeling and cell proliferation (Pardo2017Myst2Kat7). TBRG1 also interacts with proteins such as Yy1 and Ing4, indicating its involvement in transcription, DNA replication, and repair processes (Pardo2017Myst2Kat7).

The FYR domain of TBRG1, characterized by FYRN and FYRC motifs, is involved in protein interactions, potentially related to chromatin biology. This domain is crucial for the structural integrity of TBRG1 and may play a role in nuclear sublocalization (García‐Alai2010The).
