# PRR5

## Overview
PRR5, or proline rich 5, is a gene that encodes the protein Protor-2, which is a significant component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). This protein complex is integral to the regulation of cell growth, survival, and metabolism, primarily through its role in the phosphorylation of AKT, a pivotal protein in cellular proliferation and survival pathways (McElroy2018Bipolar). Protor-2 is categorized as a regulatory protein within the mTORC2 complex and is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeleton organization and mRNA stability during stress conditions (Holmes2012Protor2). The PRR5 gene is also part of a read-through transcript with ARHGAP8, which may influence cellular processes involving mTORC2 and Rho GTPases (McElroy2018Bipolar). Alterations in PRR5 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer, where it may affect tumor invasiveness and progression (Cheng2019Identification; Ye2020Bioinformatics).

## Function
PRR5 (proline rich 5) is a component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), which plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, survival, and metabolism. mTORC2 is involved in the phosphorylation of AKT, a key protein in cell proliferation and survival pathways, thereby influencing cellular homeostasis and organismal development (McElroy2018Bipolar). PRR5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by participating in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and other cellular processes (McElroy2018Bipolar).

The PRR5 gene is part of a read-through transcript with ARHGAP8, resulting in a fusion protein that may play a role in cellular processes involving mTORC2 and Rho GTPases, although its specific functions are not fully understood (McElroy2018Bipolar). PRR5 is also implicated in the regulation of food intake and energy balance, highlighting its importance in metabolic processes (McElroy2018Bipolar). Despite its involvement in these critical pathways, the precise molecular activities of PRR5 in healthy human cells require further investigation to fully elucidate its functions and implications for human health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRR5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA), PRR5 is associated with tumor invasiveness. The gene exhibits increased DNA methylation and decreased expression levels in invasive tumors compared to non-invasive ones, suggesting that these epigenetic changes may contribute to the tumor's invasive behavior (Cheng2019Identification). This highlights PRR5 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in NFPA, where targeted treatments are currently lacking.

In the context of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), PRR5-ARHGAP8, a gene related to PRR5, is part of a nine-gene prognostic model that predicts overall survival. This model is influenced by copy number variations (CNVs), which affect the expression of PRR5-ARHGAP8, indicating that CNV-driven dysregulation might play a role in the disease's progression (Ye2020Bioinformatics).

PRR5 has also been studied in relation to its role in the mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. Alterations in PRR5 expression have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast and prostate cancers, due to its involvement in cell signaling pathways (Thedieck2007PRAS40).

## Interactions
PRR5, also known as Protor-2, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. In human cells, PRR5 interacts with tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein involved in mRNA stability during stress. This interaction is enhanced in TSC1/2 deficient cells and is important for the destabilization of TTP-regulated mRNAs, such as TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-3, and COX-2, during stress conditions. PRR5 is also necessary for the localization of TTP to stress granules and processing bodies, which are essential for mRNA regulation under stress (Holmes2012Protor2).

PRR5 is a component of the mTORC2 complex, where it interacts with Rictor, another component of the complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of mTORC2 activity, which is involved in cell growth and survival signaling pathways. The interaction between PRR5 and Rictor diminishes upon mTORC2 activation, indicating a regulatory role in mTORC2 signaling (Holmes2012Protor2).

These interactions highlight the role of PRR5 in regulating mRNA stability and its involvement in the mTORC2 complex, contributing to its functions in cell growth and stress response.
