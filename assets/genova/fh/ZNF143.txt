# ZNF143

## Overview
ZNF143 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 143, a transcription factor characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the transcriptional activation of both small RNA and protein-coding genes. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, chromatin organization, and the maintenance of cellular identity during mitosis (Huning2021The; Ye2020ZNF143). ZNF143 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes that are essential for transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Ye2020ZNF143; Vinckevicius2015Genomic). Clinically, ZNF143 is significant in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Song2019Inhibition; Paek2019The).

## Structure
ZNF143 is a transcriptional activator protein encoded by the human ZNF143 gene, consisting of 638 amino acids (Huning2021The). The protein features a central DNA-binding domain with seven tandem-arrayed C2H2-type zinc fingers, located between amino acids 236 to 445 (Huning2021The; Zhang2023Mechanism). These zinc fingers are crucial for DNA recognition and binding, with ZF7 playing a significant role in recognizing specific DNA modules (Zhang2023Mechanism).

ZNF143 contains two separable activation domains, one for mRNA activation and another for snRNA activation. The mRNA activation domain is located from amino acids 51 to 148 and consists of four 15 amino acid repeats, while the snRNA activation domain spans amino acids 148 to 236 (Huning2021The). The protein also includes intrinsically disordered regions flanking the zinc finger domain, contributing to its structural flexibility (Zhang2023Mechanism).

ZNF143 is involved in chromatin looping and 3D genome organization, often interacting with CTCF and cohesin to regulate chromatin structure (Zhang2023Mechanism). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and stability (Huning2021The).

## Function
ZNF143 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transcriptional activation of both small RNA and protein-coding genes, including those necessary for cell cycle progression and division, such as BUB1B, PLK1, AURKB, WEE1, and CDK2 (Huning2021The). ZNF143 binds to specific DNA sequences, often overlapping with other transcription factors, and is crucial for the formation of the pre-initiation complex, influencing transcriptional elongation and epigenetic marks at target promoters (Huning2021The).

ZNF143 is also involved in chromatin organization, acting as a chromatin-looping factor that helps maintain chromatin loops and genomic organization by linking distal regulatory elements (Ye2020ZNF143). It interacts with other proteins, such as CHD8, to influence chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Huning2021The). ZNF143's activity is regulated through autoregulatory feedback loops and post-translational control, allowing it to fine-tune its expression in a tissue-specific manner (Huning2021The).

In addition to its role in transcription, ZNF143 is involved in maintaining cellular fate and identity during mitosis, potentially acting as a mitotic bookmarking factor (Huning2021The). It is essential for various developmental pathways, including hematopoietic development and embryonic stem cell proliferation (Huning2021The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF143 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA repair. It is significantly expressed in cancer cells and tumors, with its knockdown leading to cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in cell proliferation (Huning2021The). In breast cancer, ZNF143 expression levels correlate with disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. High expression is associated with better outcomes, while low expression correlates with poorer prognosis (Paek2019The). ZNF143 is also involved in ovarian cancer, where it contributes to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chemoresistance, particularly to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug (Sadłecki2019Expression).

In glioma, ZNF143 acts as an oncogene, with its expression promoting tumor progression. It is part of a feedback loop involving miR-590-3p, which modulates its expression and affects glioma cell proliferation and invasion (Song2019Inhibition). In colon cancer, ZNF143 knockdown leads to increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8, which are associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis (Verma2019Loss). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZNF143 in cancer biology, particularly in terms of its expression alterations and interactions that may contribute to tumorigenesis and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
ZNF143 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. It forms complexes with proteins such as THAP11 and HCF-1, which are essential for transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation (Ye2020ZNF143; Vinckevicius2015Genomic). The ACTACA submotif is significant in guiding THAP11 and HCF-1 to ZNF143-occupied loci, facilitating their recruitment to chromatin (Vinckevicius2015Genomic).

ZNF143 also interacts with the RBPJ/Notch1 complex, with competitive binding observed at overlapping sites, influencing the transcriptional activity of adjacent genes (Ye2020ZNF143; NgondoMbongo2013Modulation). It shares binding sites with its paralog ZNF76, which can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription (NgondoMbongo2013Modulation).

In chromatin interactions, ZNF143 cooperates with CTCF and cohesin, contributing to the formation of chromatin loops and 3D chromatin domains (Ye2020ZNF143; Ye2016ZNF143). These interactions are crucial for establishing genomic organization and regulating gene expression, highlighting ZNF143's role in chromatin structure and function (Ye2020ZNF143).
