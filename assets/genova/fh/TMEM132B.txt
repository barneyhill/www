# TMEM132B

## Overview
TMEM132B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 132B, a member of the TMEM132 family, which is characterized by its role as a cell adhesion molecule. This protein is involved in linking the extracellular environment with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, facilitated by its domain architecture that includes immunoglobulin and cohesin domain homologues (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). TMEM132B is predominantly expressed in the brain and features structural motifs that suggest a role in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). Clinically, TMEM132B has been implicated in neurological conditions and cancer prognosis, particularly in rectum adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels have been associated with patient survival outcomes (Huang2021A). Despite its emerging significance, the precise molecular functions of TMEM132B remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
TMEM132B is a member of the TMEM132 family, which consists of five cell adhesion molecules characterized by a domain architecture that includes three tandem immunoglobulin domains and a cohesin domain homologue. This structure suggests a role in cellular adhesion, linking the extracellular environment with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). TMEM132B is expressed in the brain and encodes a cell-surface molecule featuring N-terminal signal peptides, C-terminal transmembrane sequences, and intracellular motifs such as Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 docking and WIRS motifs. These motifs are involved in the control of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, consistent with the co-localization of TMEM132D, a homolog, with actin filaments (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

The TMEM132 family, including TMEM132B, is involved in connecting the actin cytoskeleton with neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. The presence of intracellular motifs like a serine phosphorylation motif and a phosphatase-1 interaction motif suggests roles in actin cytoskeletal dynamics (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:). Variants in TMEM132B have been associated with conditions such as excessive daytime sleepiness, indicating its potential impact on neurological outcomes (SanchezPulido2017TMEM132:).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM132B has been identified as a significant gene in the prognosis of rectum adenocarcinoma (READ). In a study by Huang et al., TMEM132B was part of a ten-gene signature associated with survival outcomes in READ patients. This gene signature, which includes TMEM132B, was shown to predict patient prognosis with high accuracy, as indicated by a Cox P value of 0.002578. The study found that patients with higher expression levels of these genes, including TMEM132B, had better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role in patient prognosis and treatment planning (Huang2021A).

While the molecular functions of TMEM132B remain poorly understood, its inclusion in the prognostic model highlights its clinical significance in cancer. The gene's expression patterns were analyzed, revealing lower expression in cancer samples compared to normal tissues, which may contribute to its role in cancer progression (Huang2021A). The study emphasizes the potential of TMEM132B as a biomarker for early detection and risk assessment in rectal cancer, aiding in the formulation of postoperative treatment plans (Huang2021A).
