# CLEC12B

## Overview
CLEC12B is a gene that encodes the C-type lectin domain family 12 member B protein, which is a type II transmembrane receptor primarily involved in immune regulation. This protein is characterized by its C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail, which facilitates the recruitment of phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2. These interactions are crucial for modulating immune cell activation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Tone2019C‐type; Hoffmann2007Identification). CLEC12B is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis, and is notably absent in the brain (Tone2019C‐type). It is also selectively expressed in skin mast cells, indicating a specialized role in skin immune responses (Iijima2021Selective). Despite its established role in immune signaling, the specific ligands for CLEC12B remain unidentified, although it is known to interact with caveolin-1, suggesting involvement in complex cellular networks (Tone2019C‐type; Kulkarni2013Differential).

## Structure
The CLEC12B protein is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 275 amino acids, with a hydrophobic transmembrane region located between positions 42 and 65 (NietoPelegrín2020Porcine). It features a cytoplasmic tail containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is crucial for recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby modulating immune cell activation (Hoffmann2007Identification). The extracellular domain includes a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) from positions 142 to 264, which is stabilized by six conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds (NietoPelegrín2020Porcine).

CLEC12B is expressed as a disulfide-linked homodimer in transfected cells, a feature that distinguishes it from its porcine counterpart, which is expressed as a monomer (Hoffmann2007Identification; NietoPelegrín2020Porcine). The protein also contains three conserved N-glycosylation sites at positions 91, 175, and 236, which may contribute to its structural stability and function (NietoPelegrín2020Porcine). A splice variant of CLEC12B has been identified in the mammary gland and ovary, indicating potential functional diversity (Hoffmann2007Identification). The protein's structure and post-translational modifications suggest a complex role in immune regulation.

## Function
CLEC12B, a member of the C-type lectin domain family, functions as an inhibitory receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by maintaining a balance between activating and inhibitory signals, which is essential for preventing autoimmunity and excessive immune responses (Hoffmann2007Identification). The protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its intracellular domain, which recruits phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2. These phosphatases de-phosphorylate and inhibit intracellular factors that promote cellular activation, thereby counteracting activating signals like those mediated by the NKG2D receptor (Tone2019C‐type; Hoffmann2007Identification).

CLEC12B is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis, but not in the brain (Tone2019C‐type). It is also selectively expressed in skin mast cells, suggesting a role in regulating skin immune responses (Iijima2021Selective). The receptor is involved in immune cell signaling pathways, influencing processes such as pathogen recognition and clearance, and is thought to interact with caveolin-1, although its specific ligands remain unidentified (Tone2019C‐type; Kulkarni2013Differential).

## Interactions
CLEC12B, also known as Macrophage Antigen H (MAH), is a receptor that participates in several interactions with other proteins. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail, which allows it to recruit the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. These interactions are significant as they can inhibit natural killer (NK) cell function when CLEC12B is transduced into these cells (Tone2019C‐type). 

CLEC12B is also identified as a novel interaction partner of Caveolin-1 (Cav1). This interaction was discovered through differential proteomic analysis in Cav1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting a potential physical interaction between CLEC12B and Cav1 (Kulkarni2013Differential). The study indicates that CLEC12B may be involved in complex cellular networks, although specific details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Kulkarni2013Differential).

While the specific ligands for CLEC12B remain unidentified, it is thought to interact with caveolin-1, which may influence its role in cellular signaling pathways (Tone2019C‐type). These interactions highlight CLEC12B's potential regulatory role in immune responses.
