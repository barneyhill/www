# DCP1B

## Overview
DCP1B is a human gene that encodes the protein decapping mRNA 1B, which is a crucial component of the mRNA decapping complex involved in mRNA degradation and turnover. This protein functions as a cofactor in the decapping process, working alongside the catalytic enzyme DCP2 to regulate mRNA stability and gene expression. Decapping mRNA 1B is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in mRNA surveillance and decay pathways, primarily active in cytoplasmic P-bodies. It interacts with various proteins involved in translation, transcription, and cellular stress responses, highlighting its significance in diverse cellular processes (Vukovic2024Nonredundant). The activity of decapping mRNA 1B is modulated by the transcription factor p53, linking it to cellular stress responses and potential implications in disease pathogenesis (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

## Function
DCP1B is a human gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA decapping, a key step in mRNA degradation and turnover. This process is essential for regulating mRNA stability and gene expression. DCP1B functions as a cofactor in the mRNA decapping complex, which includes the catalytic enzyme DCP2. It is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation by interacting with protein degradation and translational machinery (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

DCP1B has a distinct interactome, engaging with numerous proteins involved in translation, including those with aminoacyl-tRNA ligase activity, and is part of the proteasome complex. It also interacts with proteins involved in neutrophil activation, translational initiation, and focal adhesion/adherens junctions (Vukovic2024Nonredundant). DCP1B is implicated in the turnover of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in transcription, histone acetylation, and synaptic vesicle fusion, suggesting its role in diverse cellular processes (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

In the cellular context, DCP1B is active in cytoplasmic P-bodies, where it contributes to mRNA surveillance and decay pathways, impacting cellular protein synthesis and homeostasis (Vukovic2024Nonredundant). Its activity is regulated by the transcription factor p53, which binds to the DCP1B promoter, indicating a role in stress response (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DCP1B gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. DCP1B is involved in mRNA decapping, a critical step in mRNA degradation, and its dysregulation can impact mRNA stability, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis. In the context of autism, DCP1B is identified as one of the target genes in a network involving genes related to autism and other disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia (Shen2018iTRAQ‐Based).

In cancer, DCP1B is associated with various malignancies. The FOXM1/DCP1B gene fusion has been observed, although the functional role of this fusion product requires further study (Kalathil2021FOXM1). This suggests that alterations in DCP1B may influence cancer progression through its interactions with oncogenes like FOXM1.

In neurodegenerative conditions, DCP1B's role in RNA processing is highlighted by its upregulation in TIA-1 knockout mouse models, suggesting increased mRNA decay in the absence of TIA-1, which may affect cell cycle and apoptosis-related factors (Heck2014Dysregulated). These findings indicate that DCP1B may play a role in neurological disorders through its involvement in RNA processing and degradation pathways.

## Interactions
DCP1B is a component of the human mRNA decapping complex, which plays a crucial role in mRNA turnover and regulation. It interacts with a variety of proteins, forming part of a multiprotein complex involved in mRNA decay. DCP1B interacts with DCP2, the mRNA cap hydrolase, and this interaction is stabilized by the decapping enhancer protein EDC4 (Vukovic2024Nonredundant). DCP1B also interacts with proteins involved in translation regulation, such as those with aminoacyl-tRNA ligase activity, and is associated with the proteasome complex, cadherin, RNA, and purine ribonucleotide binding proteins (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

DCP1B has a distinct interactome compared to its paralog DCP1a, indicating non-redundant roles in the decapping complex. It is involved in interactions with proteins that regulate translation initiation, mRNA splicing, and nonsense-mediated decay (Vukovic2024Nonredundant). DCP1B also plays a role in the turnover of mRNAs encoding proteins linked to transcriptional repressor complexes and histone acetyltransferase complexes, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Vukovic2024Nonredundant).

Additionally, DCP1B interacts with the Ebola virus protein VP35, which co-opts the mRNA decapping complex, indicating a potential mechanism by which the virus manipulates host cellular machinery (Davey2024A).
