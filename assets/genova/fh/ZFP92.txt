# ZFP92

## Overview
ZFP92 is a gene that encodes the ZFP92 zinc finger protein, which is categorized as a KRAB domain zinc finger protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interactions with transposable elements, such as SINE, LINE, and LTR elements, and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by repressing these elements. The ZFP92 protein is known to interact with TRIM28, a protein that forms complexes with various KRAB-ZNFs, suggesting its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. While ZFP92 has been implicated in several biological processes, including metabolic regulation and cognitive function, its precise role in human diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Chang2023AcetylationMimic; Osipovich2023ZFP92).

## Clinical Significance
The ZFP92 gene, encoding a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although direct associations with specific diseases remain to be fully established. In Alzheimer's disease research, ZFP92 has been linked to the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), suggesting a potential role in cognitive decline or functional impairment, although a direct causal relationship has not been confirmed (Wang2023X). The gene's predominant expression in pancreatic islets also hints at a role in metabolic processes, potentially linking it to metabolic disorders (Wang2023X).

In the context of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a study investigating genetic variants in ZFP92 found no significant association with the condition, suggesting that ZFP92 may not play a major role in POI's genetic etiology (Ramos2022WT1). Additionally, ZFP92 has been noted for its differential expression in mouse models, with potential implications for oocyte development and the oocyte-to-embryo transition, although specific human diseases linked to these findings are not detailed (Ma2012Compensatory).

Overall, while ZFP92 is involved in important biological processes, its direct clinical significance in human diseases requires further investigation.

## Interactions
ZFP92, a KRAB domain zinc finger protein, is known for its interactions with transposable elements and its role in gene regulation. It preferentially binds to B1/Alu SINE transposable elements, as demonstrated in studies using MIN6 cells overexpressing HA-tagged ZFP92 protein. This binding is significant in regulating the activity of nearby retroelements and genes, including the transcription factor Mafb in pancreatic islets and Acacb in adipose and muscle tissues (Osipovich2023ZFP92).

ZFP92's interaction with transposable elements is not limited to SINEs; it also affects LINE and LTR elements, suggesting a broader regulatory role influenced by genomic context and chromatin state. The absence of ZFP92 leads to dysregulation of these elements, indicating its involvement in repressive complexes that may include chromatin-modifying proteins (Osipovich2023ZFP92).

In the context of protein interactions, ZFP92 is associated with TRIM28, a protein that interacts with various KRAB-ZNFs. A study on TRIM28 mutations in leukemic K562 cells identified ZFP92 as interacting with a specific TRIM28 mutant, suggesting a potential role in modulating gene expression through these interactions (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
