# CACNA1C

## Overview
The CACNA1C gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C, a critical component of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, known as CaV1.2. This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in mediating calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization, which is essential for various physiological processes, including cardiac muscle contraction, neuronal signaling, and smooth muscle function. CaV1.2 is widely expressed in the heart, brain, and other tissues, where it contributes to the regulation of cellular excitability and calcium homeostasis. The gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that influence the channel's biophysical properties and tissue-specific functions. Mutations in CACNA1C have been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as Timothy Syndrome and Long QT Syndrome, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Herold2023CACNA1CRelated; Blancard2018An; Kessi2023Disruption).

## Structure
The CACNA1C gene encodes the CaV1.2 protein, a voltage-gated calcium channel crucial for various physiological processes. The primary structure of CaV1.2 includes approximately 2000 amino acids, forming the main subunit, CaVα1s, which features 24 transmembrane helices organized into four repeats (I-IV) (Mellor2019Type). Each repeat contains six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with S1-S4 forming the voltage-sensing domain and S5-S6 contributing to the pore (Mellor2019Type). 

The protein's tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and loops, with high-resolution crystal structures available for certain subunit interactions, such as the CaVβ subunit bound to the I-II loop and calmodulin bound to the IQ domain in the C-terminus (Mellor2019Type). The quaternary structure includes the assembly of the alpha subunit with auxiliary β and α2δ subunits, and sometimes a γ subunit, which modulate channel properties (Herold2023CACNA1CRelated).

CACNA1C undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can affect channel gating and regulation. Notably, 90 distinct transcript variants have been identified in the brain, contributing to tissue-specific channel properties (Herold2023CACNA1CRelated). These splice variants and structural features are critical for the channel's function and its role in various pathophysiological conditions.

## Function
The CACNA1C gene encodes the alpha-1C subunit of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, known as Cav1.2, which is crucial for calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization. These channels are widely distributed in the brain, heart, and smooth muscles, playing a vital role in various cellular processes. In the heart, Cav1.2 channels regulate calcium influx into ventricular cardiomyocytes, contributing to the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential and facilitating excitation-contraction coupling, which is essential for cardiomyocyte contraction (Blancard2018An).

In the brain, these channels are involved in neuronal synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. They regulate calcium homeostasis, which is critical for cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy, and are essential for maintaining mitochondrial calcium ion homeostasis, crucial for ATP generation (Kessi2023Disruption). The proper functioning of CACNA1C is also linked to lysosomal functions, including autophagy and oxidative stress sensing, which are vital for cellular health and function (Kessi2023Disruption).

Disruption in the function of CACNA1C can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, cardiac arrhythmias, and other conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Blancard2018An; Kessi2023Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA1C gene are associated with several cardiac and neurological disorders. Timothy Syndrome (TS) is a notable condition caused by missense mutations in CACNA1C, particularly in the S6 trans-membrane helix segments. TS is characterized by severe long QT syndrome (LQTS), congenital heart defects, facial dysmorphisms, and neuropsychiatric disorders. TS1 is primarily caused by the p.Gly406Arg mutation, while TS2 involves mutations like p.Gly406Arg and p.Gly402Ser (Gershon2013A; Borbás2022Geno).

A cardiac-specific form, known as cardiac-only Timothy syndrome (COTS), involves QT prolongation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and sudden cardiac death, without the extracardiac symptoms typical of TS. Mutations such as p.Arg518Cys/His are linked to COTS (Boczek2015Identification; Gakenheimer‐Smith2021Expanding).

Long QT Syndrome type 8 (LQT8) is another condition associated with CACNA1C mutations, characterized by prolonged QT intervals and arrhythmias. Some mutations, like R858H and A582D, increase calcium current density, suggesting a gain-of-function effect (Fukuyama2014Long).

Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is linked to loss-of-function mutations in CACNA1C, which can lead to abnormal ECG findings and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Novelli2022Role).

## Interactions
The CACNA1C gene encodes the α1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, which participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function. The α1 subunit interacts with auxiliary subunits such as α2δ1 and β2b, which are essential for channel trafficking and regulation (Wei2024Structural). The β2b subunit associates with the cytosolic AID region of CaV1.2, while the α2δ1 subunit is located extracellularly, interacting with specific residues from the D I repeat (Wei2024Structural).

CACNA1C also interacts with proteins involved in calcium signaling pathways, such as CALB1 (calbindin), GRIN2B (NMDA receptor GluN2B), and KCNN3 (SK3 channel), particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurons (Datta2024Key). These interactions are significant for modulating calcium actions and neuronal firing, especially under stress conditions (Datta2024Key).

The CaV1.2 channel's II-III loop is a binding site for SH3 domains in STAC proteins, affecting the channel's inactivation properties. Variants in this region can alter binding stability, impacting the channel's function (Mellor2019Type). Additionally, the C-terminus of CaV1.2 interacts with signaling molecules like calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and protein kinase A, which modulate channel activity (Sutphin2016Molecular).
