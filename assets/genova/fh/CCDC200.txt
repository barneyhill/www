# CCDC200

## Overview
The CCDC200 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 200, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC200 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. Although the specific biological functions of the CCDC200 protein are not fully elucidated, its involvement in critical physiological processes such as gametogenesis, embryonic development, and ciliogenesis has been proposed. The gene's highly conserved nature across the human population underscores its potential importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its possible implications in pathological conditions when dysregulated (Liao2023A; Du2024Enhancing).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC200 gene is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including gametogenesis, embryonic development, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, ciliogenesis, and cancer. Research indicates that the CCDC200 gene contains highly conserved motif sequences within the human population, suggesting its potential role in these processes and related diseases (Du2024Enhancing). Although specific diseases directly linked to mutations or alterations in CCDC200 are not detailed, the gene's involvement in critical biological functions implies that its dysregulation could contribute to disease states.

The study of HERV-specific motifs, which are associated with transcriptional regulation, immune function, and evolutionary adaptation, further supports the potential significance of CCDC200 in disease contexts. These motifs may influence the gene's expression and interactions, thereby affecting its role in disease mechanisms (Du2024Enhancing).

While the Liao2023A study mentions CCDC200 in the context of copy number variations (CNVs) observed in human genome assemblies, it does not provide specific information about diseases or conditions associated with these variations (Liao2023A). Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical implications of CCDC200 mutations or expression alterations.
