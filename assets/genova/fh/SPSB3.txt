# SPSB3

## Overview
SPSB3 is a gene that encodes the protein splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 3, which is a crucial component in the regulation of immune responses. The protein is characterized by its SOCS box domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins and is involved in ubiquitination processes. SPSB3 functions as a substrate receptor within the CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting nuclear cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for degradation. This regulation is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive type I interferon signaling. The protein's interaction with cGAS involves specific structural domains and residues, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses. Additionally, SPSB3 has clinical significance, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels have been linked to prognosis and treatment outcomes in non-small-cell lung cancer (Xu2024The; Van2012Genomic).

## Structure
The SPSB3 protein is characterized by the presence of a SOCS box domain, which is integral to its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The protein is part of a family that typically exhibits a conserved structure, including specific domains like the SOCS box. The interaction between SPSB3 and cGAS involves specific loops on SPSB3 that interact with the C-terminal helix of cGAS, forming hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between specific amino acids (Xu2024The). The study of the cGAS-SPSB3 complex using cryo-electron microscopy revealed a unique interface on SPSB3 for binding cGAS, highlighting the importance of specific residues in this interaction (Xu2024The).

SPSB3 is involved in the CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets nuclear cGAS for degradation. This process is facilitated by the interaction of SPSB3 with the elongin B-elongin C (ELOBC) adaptor, connecting to the CUL5-RBX2 complex (Xu2024The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The study also suggests the presence of potential splice variant isoforms, which is common among proteins in this family (Xu2024The).

## Function
SPSB3 is a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses in human cells. It functions as part of the CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets nuclear cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) for degradation. cGAS is an enzyme that detects aberrant DNA and triggers immune responses, particularly type I interferon (IFN) signaling. The CRL5-SPSB3 complex ubiquitinates nuclear cGAS, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby preventing excessive IFN signaling and maintaining immune homeostasis (Xu2024The).

SPSB3 specifically binds to the elongin B-elongin C (ELOBC) adaptor, connecting to the CUL5-RBX2 complex and recruiting substrates for ubiquitylation. This process is crucial for controlling the stability of nuclear cGAS protein, without affecting cytosolic cGAS or CGAS transcript levels (Xu2024The). The regulation of nuclear cGAS by SPSB3 is confirmed in various human cell lines and primary human endothelial cells, highlighting its role in maintaining nuclear cGAS stability (Xu2024The).

By modulating the degradation of cGAS, SPSB3 acts as a checkpoint in regulating cGAS activity and, consequently, the immune response, preventing inappropriate activation of cGAS by genomic DNA within the nucleus (Xu2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SPSB3 gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of immune responses and cancer. The CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase complex plays a crucial role in targeting nuclear cGAS for degradation, which is essential for regulating type I interferon (IFN) responses. Disruptions in this process, such as mutations in cGAS that prevent SPSB3 binding or ubiquitylation, can lead to increased IFN responses, suggesting that SPSB3 is vital for maintaining immune homeostasis (Xu2024The). Alterations in SPSB3 expression or function could influence immune signaling pathways, potentially affecting the body's response to viral infections and other immune challenges (Xu2024The).

In the context of cancer, SPSB3 has been associated with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Higher levels of SPSB3 expression have been linked to better prognosis and response to adjuvant chemotherapy, indicating its potential role in cancer treatment outcomes (Van2012Genomic). These findings suggest that SPSB3 could serve as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and disease progression in certain cancers. However, the specific mechanisms by which SPSB3 influences these conditions require further investigation.

## Interactions
SPSB3 is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of nuclear cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) through its involvement in the CRL5-SPSB3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex targets cGAS for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation, thereby modulating immune responses. SPSB3 acts as a substrate receptor within the CRL5 complex, which includes CUL5, RBX2, and the ELOBC heterodimeric adaptor. It binds to the elongin B-elongin C (ELOBC) through its SOCS box, connecting to the CUL5-RBX2 complex, and recruits substrates for ubiquitylation through its SPRY domain (Xu2024The).

The interaction between SPSB3 and cGAS is mediated by a conserved Asn-Asn (NN) degron motif at the C terminus of cGAS, which is crucial for SPSB3 recruitment and cGAS stability. Specific residues on cGAS, such as Asn513 and Asn514, form hydrogen bonds with SPSB3 residues Ser132, Thr162, Thr259, and Arg262. Acidic residues on cGAS, including Asp465, Glu509, Tyr510, Arg512, and Glu515, interact with SPSB3 residues Thr162, Tyr197, and Arg213 through electrostatic interactions (Xu2024The). These interactions are essential for the formation of the cGAS-SPSB3 complex and are conserved across vertebrate DNA-sensing cGAS enzymes and SPSB3 receptors (Xu2024The).
