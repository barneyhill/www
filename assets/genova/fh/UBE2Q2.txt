# UBE2Q2

## Overview
UBE2Q2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q2, a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family involved in the ubiquitination process, which is a critical post-translational modification regulating protein degradation and cellular signaling. The UBE2Q2 protein is classified as a Class II E2 enzyme, characterized by its conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain and additional amino-terminal extensions. This enzyme plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, although its interactions with E3 ligases are limited and not extensively characterized. UBE2Q2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Its altered expression levels have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Lei2023Ubiquitin‑conjugating; Hunt2023An; Gundogdu2019Structural).

## Structure
UBE2Q2 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that features a conserved catalytic core known as the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain. This domain is characterized by an α/β-fold structure, which includes an N-terminal helix (α1), a four-stranded β-meander (β1-4), a short 3_10-helix, a central 'cross-over' helix (α2), and two C-terminal helices (α3-α4) (Gundogdu2019Structural). The active-site cysteine, essential for catalysis, is located in a shallow groove preceding the 3_10-helix and is surrounded by conserved residues that facilitate thioester and isopeptide bond formation (Gundogdu2019Structural).

The UBE2Q2 protein shares structural similarities with other E2 enzymes, displaying a canonical E2 fold with a four-stranded, anti-parallel curled β-sheet surrounded by α-helical segments (Sheng2012A). The core domain of UBE2Q2 aligns well structurally with other E2s, despite moderate sequence conservation, with divergence mainly in the C-terminal α3-α4 region (Gundogdu2019Structural).

UBE2Q2 is classified as a Class II E2 enzyme, indicating the presence of amino-terminal extensions beyond the catalytic domain (Hosseini2019E2). The protein may also exist in various isoforms, which could affect its specificity and interactions with E1 and E3 enzymes (Soond2011How).

## Function
UBE2Q2 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation, signaling, and other cellular processes. In healthy human cells, UBE2Q2 participates in the conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins, a process that involves the sequential action of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes, and E3 ligases. This enzyme is thought to act as an accessory to other E2-E3 ubiquitin chain editing complexes, potentially without directly binding to an E3 ligase, due to the transient nature of E2-E3 interactions or low expression levels of some E3s in certain cells (Hunt2023An).

UBE2Q2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein turnover through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Although specific E3 ligase partners for UBE2Q2 have not been extensively identified, its role in ubiquitin conjugation suggests it may cooperate with other E2s, E1s, and E3s to facilitate ubiquitin-like protein conjugation, impacting cellular processes related to ubiquitination (Hunt2023An).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2Q2 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), UBE2Q2 is overexpressed in tissue samples and cells, with its promoter being more unmethylated compared to UBE2Q1. This unmethylated status may be associated with CRC progression (Lei2023Ubiquitin‑conjugating). In breast cancer, UBE2Q2 is also overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression may lead to deregulation of cytoskeletal processes such as cytokinesis, adhesion, and metastasis, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin).

UBE2Q2 is noted to be overexpressed in other malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation and chromosomal stability (Chang2014Upregulated; Shafiee2013UBE2Q1). Despite these associations, specific information on UBE2Q2 gene mutations or detailed interaction changes in these cancers is not provided in the available literature. The consistent overexpression of UBE2Q2 across different cancer types highlights its potential as a biomarker and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
UBE2Q2 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that participates in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, primarily interacting with E3 ligases to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins. Within this system, UBE2Q2 has been identified to interact minimally, with only one E3 interaction confirmed, specifically with PCGF2 (van2009A). This limited interaction profile may be attributed to its low expression levels, which are similar to those of UBE2I (Ubc9) (van2009A).

Structurally, UBE2Q2 contains a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with E3 ligases. The E3-binding site on UBE2Q2 is composed of helix 1 (α1), Loop 4 (L4), and Loop 7 (L7), with variations in these regions influencing its specificity for E3 ligases (Gundogdu2019Structural). Despite its limited interactions, UBE2Q2's structural characterization has been documented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 1ZUO), providing insights into its potential interaction mechanisms (Gundogdu2019Structural).

UBE2Q2 has also been implicated in breast cancer, where it is over-expressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This over-expression suggests a role in cytoskeletal regulation, potentially affecting processes like cytokinesis, adhesion, and metastasis (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin).
