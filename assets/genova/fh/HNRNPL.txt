# HNRNPL

## Overview
HNRNPL is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L), a multifunctional protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation regulation. As a member of the hnRNP family, hnRNP L is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which facilitate its binding to RNA and its role in RNA processing. The protein is implicated in the regulation of gene expression in different cellular contexts, such as T cell activation and epidermal renewal, by modulating splicing and interacting with specific mRNA sequences. HNRNPL's dysregulation has been associated with several cancers, where it influences tumor growth and progression through its interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules (Hung2007Diverse; Ji2019Long; Blatter2015The).

## Structure
The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) is a protein involved in RNA metabolism, characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of 589 amino acids in humans and features four RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, a Gly-rich N-terminal region, and a Pro-rich domain between RRM2 and RRM3 (Blatter2015The). The RRMs are responsible for RNA binding, with each RRM exhibiting unique structural variations, including a five-stranded β-sheet structure known as vRRM, which extends the RNA binding interface (Blatter2015The).

The protein's secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the vRRM domains forming a fifth β-strand that complements the RRM β-sheet (Blatter2015The). The tertiary structure involves conserved regions extending the canonical RRM core, forming sub-structural elements like interacting C-terminal coils (ICCs) that stabilize the protein's conformation (Blatter2015The). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the context provided.

Post-translational modifications, such as lysine acetylation in vRRM3, may regulate the protein's function by disrupting interactions within the vRRM domains (Blatter2015The). hnRNP L also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Blatter2015The).

## Function
HNRNPL (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L) is a multifunctional protein involved in various aspects of RNA processing in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in alternative splicing, a process that allows for the generation of multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. HNRNPL acts as both an activator and repressor of splicing, depending on the context, by binding to C/A-rich elements in RNA. It can enhance or repress exon recognition, regulate cassette-type exons, and influence intron retention and alternative polyadenylation site selection (Hung2007Diverse).

HNRNPL is also involved in mRNA stability and translation regulation. It interacts with the 3' UTR of specific mRNAs, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase, potentially affecting their stability. In T cells, HNRNPL regulates the CD45 gene, which is critical for T cell activation, by binding to exonic splicing silencers and promoting exon skipping (Shankarling2014TranscriptomeWide; Han2010Functional).

In the epidermis, HNRNPL is crucial for maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation. It regulates the expression of integrin and extracellular matrix genes, which are essential for epidermal renewal and the attachment of basal layer stem cells to the dermis (Li2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPL is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In invasive breast carcinoma, increased HNRNPL expression is associated with high cancer stages, lymph node metastases, and poor overall survival, marking it as a risky gene (Zhou2021Identification). In hepatocellular carcinoma, HNRNPL acts as an oncogenic protein, promoting cancer development through interactions with CASC9, affecting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Gu2020Heterogeneous). In prostate cancer, HNRNPL is linked to tumor growth and cell proliferation by regulating androgen receptor mRNA and influencing pathways like p53/p21/cyclin D1 (Gu2020Heterogeneous).

HNRNPL also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by regulating caspase-9 pre-mRNA processing. Its phosphorylation affects the splicing of caspase-9, impacting tumorigenicity (Goehe2010hnRNP). In glioblastoma, HNRNPL forms a complex with SChLAP1 and ACTN4, stabilizing ACTN4 and activating NF-kB signaling, which promotes tumor growth (Ji2019Long). These findings suggest that HNRNPL's dysregulation contributes to cancer progression and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
HNRNPL interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. In glioblastoma cells, HNRNPL forms a complex with the long noncoding RNA SChLAP1, which is crucial for stabilizing the protein ACTN4. This interaction prevents the proteasome-mediated degradation of ACTN4, leading to the activation of NF-kB signaling pathways that promote tumor growth (Ji2019Long). The RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) of HNRNPL is essential for binding SChLAP1, and the interaction is modulated by SChLAP1, which enhances the binding between HNRNPL and ACTN4 (Ji2019Long).

HNRNPL also interacts with the long noncoding RNA THRIL, where it is necessary for the regulation of TNFα expression. This interaction involves binding to the TNFα promoter, influencing its expression levels (Li2013The). In T cells, HNRNPL is involved in splicing regulation, affecting the expression of genes crucial for T cell signaling and development (Shankarling2014TranscriptomeWide).

HNRNPL binds specifically to CA repeat RNA sequences, which are involved in splicing regulation, particularly in the context of the eNOS gene (Hui2002HnRNP). It also acts as a negative regulator of LINE-1 retrotransposition by binding to the internal ribosome entry site of L1 RNA, modulating its activity (Peddigari2012hnRNPL).
