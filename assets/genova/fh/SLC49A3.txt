# SLC49A3

## Overview
SLC49A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 49 member 3, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) group of membrane transport proteins. These proteins are integral to the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes, playing crucial roles in cellular homeostasis and metabolism. While the specific substrates and transport mechanisms of SLC49A3 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular transport processes suggests a potential impact on various physiological and pathological conditions. Notably, mutations in the SLC49A3 gene have been implicated in certain cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenesis and as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment (Lin2023Identification; Akino2022Disrupted).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SLC49A3 gene, part of the solute carrier family, is primarily associated with its frequent mutations in metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Research has identified SLC49A3 as one of the most frequently mutated genes in patients with metastatic OSCC, although its specific role in cancer progression remains unclear (Lin2023Identification). The study by Lin et al. suggests that mutations in SLC49A3, along with other genes, could potentially serve as biomarkers for diagnostic or recurrence monitoring tests in OSCC, aiding in patient stratification and targeted therapy design (Lin2023Identification).

Additionally, SLC49A3 has been noted in association with ovarian cancer risk, although its functional characteristics and the mechanisms by which it influences cancer risk are not well understood (Akino2022Disrupted). The lack of detailed information on the clinical significance of SLC49A3 mutations or their association with specific diseases beyond these cancer types indicates a need for further research to elucidate its role in disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic implications (Lin2023Identification).
