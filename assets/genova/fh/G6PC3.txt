# G6PC3

## Overview
The G6PC3 gene encodes the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3, a transmembrane enzyme that plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism by catalyzing the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and inorganic phosphate within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Banka2013A). This enzyme is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis and is particularly important in neutrophils, where it supports energy metabolism and proper cellular function (Jun2011GCSF). The G6PC3 protein is characterized by its nine transmembrane helices, which anchor it in the ER membrane, and a signature phosphatase motif that is essential for its enzymatic activity (Banka2013A). Mutations in the G6PC3 gene are linked to severe congenital neutropenia and a range of other clinical manifestations, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and immune processes (Banka2013A; Desplantes2014Clinical).

## Structure
The G6PC3 protein is encoded by the G6PC3 gene located at 17q21.31 and consists of 346 amino acid residues. It is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by nine transmembrane helices, which position the active site within the ER lumen (Banka2013A). The protein includes a signature phosphatase motif, K-X6-RP-(X12-54)-PSGH-(X31-54)-SR-X5-H-X3-D, spanning residues 66 to 171. Key residues within this motif include histidine at position 167, which serves as the phosphate acceptor site, and arginine at 79 and histidine at 114, which act as proton donors (Banka2013A).

The G6PC3 protein shares structural similarities with its paralog G6PC, with 120 identical amino acids between the two proteins. However, the detailed molecular structure, including secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, has not been fully defined (Banka2013A). There is no information available on specific domains, prominent folds, or common post-translational modifications. Additionally, no splice variant isoforms have been reported (Banka2013A).

## Function
The G6PC3 gene encodes the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 3, an enzyme that plays a critical role in glucose metabolism within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate, a key step in maintaining glucose homeostasis. G6PC3 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with significant activity in neutrophils, where it is essential for proper function and energy metabolism (Jun2011GCSF; Banka2013A).

In healthy human cells, G6PC3 helps prevent the accumulation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5AG6P), a noncanonical metabolite that can inhibit hexokinase activity, thereby ensuring efficient glycolysis. This function is particularly important in neutrophils, which rely heavily on glycolysis for energy production due to their limited mitochondrial function (VeigadaCunha2019Failure; Zhen2024Molecular).

The enzyme's activity is dependent on the transport of G6P from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen, facilitated by the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT). This process is crucial for the endogenous production of glucose, supporting various cellular functions, including the respiratory burst, chemotaxis, and calcium flux activities in neutrophils (Jun2011GCSF; Goenka2020Neutrophil).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the G6PC3 gene are associated with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), a condition characterized by a significant deficiency of neutrophils, leading to recurrent bacterial infections and increased susceptibility to sepsis (Banka2013A; Desplantes2014Clinical). G6PC3 deficiency is also linked to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, including cardiac defects such as atrial septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus, urogenital anomalies, and a prominent superficial venous pattern (Boztug2012Extended; Desplantes2014Clinical). 

Patients with G6PC3 mutations may exhibit additional features such as inflammatory bowel disease, endocrine abnormalities like growth hormone deficiency, and skeletal anomalies (Banka2013A; Bégin2012Inflammatory). The condition can also present with non-hematological symptoms, including facial dysmorphism, developmental delays, and primary pulmonary hypertension (Boztug2012Extended; Banka2013A). 

G6PC3 deficiency is associated with increased apoptosis of neutrophils and other cells, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals (Banka2013A). Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can improve neutrophil counts and reduce infection rates, although untreated G6PC3 deficiency can be fatal (McDermott2010Severe; Banka2013A).

## Interactions
G6PC3, also known as glucose-6-phosphatase-β, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. It forms a complex with the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), and their activities are interdependent. This complex facilitates the transport and hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is essential for maintaining cellular energy balance (Jun2012Glucose6phosphataseβ; Hayee2011G6PC3).

In the context of glioblastoma, G6PC3 is predicted to interact with SLC37A4, another component of the glucose-6-phosphate transport system. This interaction is suggested by protein-protein interaction network analyses, indicating a potential role in glioblastoma progression through metabolic reprogramming (Torabidastgerdooei2023A). However, no direct interactions with SLC37A2 were identified in the same context (Torabidastgerdooei2023A).

G6PC3 also plays a role in immune cell function, where its deficiency affects the expression and activity of NADPH oxidase components, such as gp91 phox and p47 phox, leading to impaired respiratory burst and neutrophil function (Jun2012Glucose6phosphataseβ; Hayee2011G6PC3). These interactions highlight the importance of G6PC3 in both metabolic and immune processes.
