# PANK1

## Overview
PANK1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme pantothenate kinase 1, a key regulatory kinase involved in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), an essential cofactor in numerous metabolic pathways. As the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in CoA biosynthesis, pantothenate kinase 1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis. The activity of PANK1 is intricately regulated by various factors, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, which modulates its expression in response to cellular stress and DNA damage (Böhlig2010p53). This regulation underscores the enzyme's importance in energy metabolism and its potential involvement in stress response pathways. Additionally, PANK1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer and metabolic disorders, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and metabolic reprogramming (Ma2021PANK1; Yang2020P53PANK1miR‐107).

## Function
The PANK1 gene encodes the enzyme pantothenate kinase 1, which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a vital molecule in various metabolic pathways. PANK1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in CoA biosynthesis, which is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in healthy human cells (Böhlig2010p53). CoA is necessary for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, facilitating the acetyl-coenzyme A-dependent generation of NADH, which is subsequently oxidized in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, a process crucial for cellular energy production (Böhlig2010p53).

PANK1 is transcriptionally regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which can induce PANK1 expression in response to DNA damage, potentially influencing CoA levels in the cell (Böhlig2010p53). This regulation suggests a role for PANK1 in ensuring an adequate supply of CoA under stress conditions, supporting alternative energy supply pathways such as fatty acid β-oxidation (Böhlig2010p53). PANK1 activity is also modulated by PPARα, which increases PANK1 enzyme activity, highlighting its importance in metabolic processes and cellular energy balance (Böhlig2010p53).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PANK1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), PANK1 is identified as a prognostic biomarker. Its expression is significantly lower in ccRCC tissues compared to normal tissues, and low PANK1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients. This negative association with survival is also observed in other cancers, such as colon cancer, renal papillary cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. PANK1 expression is correlated with various clinicopathological features, including tumor stage and histological grade, and is linked to immune infiltration levels, affecting the prognosis of ccRCC (Ma2021PANK1).

In metabolic disorders, PANK1 plays a role in metabolic reprogramming and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. PANK1 is upregulated in the liver under these conditions, contributing to changes in metabolic pathways, such as enhanced gluconeogenesis and altered lipid metabolism. This upregulation is associated with insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, highlighting the gene's potential impact on metabolic health (Yang2020P53PANK1miR‐107). The regulation of PANK1 by the tumor suppressor protein p53 further implicates it in cell cycle control and cancer biology (Böhlig2010p53).
