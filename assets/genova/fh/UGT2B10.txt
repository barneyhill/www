# UGT2B10

## Overview
UGT2B10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B10, which is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the N-glucuronidation of tertiary amine-containing drugs, playing a crucial role in the detoxification and metabolic clearance of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. UGT2B10 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it facilitates the conjugation of glucuronic acid to amine groups of substrates, aiding in the metabolism and elimination of drugs such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and nicotine. The enzyme's activity is subject to regulation by factors such as microRNAs and nuclear receptors, and its expression exhibits significant inter-individual variability, impacting drug metabolism and detoxification efficiency (Lu2017Transcriptional; Sutliff2019Potential). Genetic variations in UGT2B10 can lead to altered drug metabolism, highlighting its clinical significance in pharmacogenetic studies (Sipe2020UGT2B10; Fowler2014A).

## Structure
UGT2B10 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, primarily involved in the N-glucuronidation of tertiary amine-containing drugs. The primary structure of UGT2B10 consists of 460 amino acid residues, excluding the signal peptide, transmembrane region, and eight residues surrounding the transmembrane region (Robin2022A). The secondary structure of UGT2B10 includes 35% alpha helices and three parallel beta sheets (Robin2022A). 

The tertiary structure of UGT2B10 is modeled using homology modeling techniques, employing templates from related proteins such as UGT51 from S. cerevisiae and UGT76G from S. rebaudiana (Robin2022A). The model was refined and validated using various computational tools, achieving an ERRAT score of 93.3% and a Verify3D score of 74.8% (Robin2022A). The UGT2B10 model shares structural characteristics with other UGT2 family members, particularly in the C-terminal region responsible for binding UDP-glucuronic acid (Fujiwara2016Structure).

UGT2B10 adopts a GT-B-type fold, characterized by a bidomain organization that facilitates interactions with acceptor and donor substrates (Magdalou2009Insights). The protein's quaternary structure involves potential interactions with other microsomal proteins, which may influence its enzymatic activity (Fujiwara2016Structure).

## Function
UGT2B10 is an enzyme primarily active in the liver, where it plays a crucial role in the detoxification and metabolic clearance of various endogenous and exogenous compounds. It is particularly involved in the N-glucuronidation process, where it catalyzes the conjugation of glucuronic acid to amine groups of substrates. This activity is essential for the metabolism and elimination of drugs, such as antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants, as well as nicotine and its metabolite cotinine (Lu2017Transcriptional; Sutliff2019Potential).

The enzyme's function is vital for maintaining homeostasis and protecting the body from potentially harmful substances, including carcinogens like tobacco-specific nitrosamines. UGT2B10's expression in the liver is subject to significant inter-individual variability, which can affect drug metabolism and detoxification efficiency (Lu2017Transcriptional; Sutliff2019Potential).

UGT2B10 is regulated by factors such as microRNAs and nuclear receptors. For instance, miR-485-5p can downregulate UGT2B10, potentially impacting nicotine addiction and susceptibility to carcinogenic effects (Sutliff2019Potential). Additionally, the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) can enhance UGT2B10 expression, influencing its glucuronidation activity (Lu2017Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UGT2B10 gene can significantly impact drug metabolism, leading to altered drug exposure and efficacy. A notable splice site mutation, prevalent in African populations, results in a poor-metabolizer phenotype due to the lack of functional UGT2B10 protein expression. This mutation is associated with a 136-fold increase in systemic exposure to certain drugs, such as RO5263397, in affected individuals (Fowler2014A). The rs2942857 SNP, a splice acceptor site mutation, is particularly common in African populations and leads to poor metabolism of drugs undergoing N-glucuronidation, including nicotine and tricyclic antidepressants (Fowler2014A).

In African Americans, the UGT2B10 rs116294140 variant is linked to reduced nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation, affecting cotinine pharmacokinetics and potentially leading to misinterpretation of tobacco exposure (Sipe2020UGT2B10; Taghavi2017Effect). This variant, along with the Asp67Tyr variant, contributes to higher serum cotinine levels, which can confound assessments of tobacco-related disease risks (Sipe2020UGT2B10). These genetic variations underscore the importance of considering UGT2B10 genotypes in clinical and pharmacogenetic studies to ensure accurate drug dosing and risk assessment.

## Interactions
UGT2B10, a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, is involved in the glucuronidation of various substrates, including drugs and endogenous compounds. It plays a significant role in the metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and trimipramine. UGT2B10 exhibits a higher affinity for these TCAs compared to UGT1A4, although it has a lower glucuronidation capacity (Zhou2010Role). The enzyme's activity can be selectively inhibited by nicotine, which does not affect UGT1A4, highlighting a specific inhibitory interaction that reduces TCA glucuronidation by 33 to 50% in human liver microsomes (Zhou2010Role).

UGT2B10 is also involved in the glucuronidation of nicotine, where it acts as a major enzyme responsible for this process in the human liver. This interaction is crucial for nicotine metabolism and is distinct from the activities of other UGTs like UGT1A4 and UGT2B7, which show much lower activity in nicotine glucuronidation (Kaivosaari2007Nicotine). The enzyme's expression is primarily in the liver, and its activity is regulated by micro-RNA miR-216b-5p, which binds to a target miRNA recognition element in the 3′-UTR of the UGT2B10 gene (Robin2022A).
