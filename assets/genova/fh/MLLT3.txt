# MLLT3

## Overview
MLLT3, also known as AF9, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the super elongation complex (SEC), which plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation. The MLLT3 protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered regions and specific domains, such as the ANC1 homology domain (AHD) and the YEATS domain, which facilitate interactions with various transcriptional regulators and epigenetic modifications (Kabra2022The). These interactions are crucial for the protein's function in hematopoiesis, particularly in the differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages (Pina2008MLLT3). Clinically, MLLT3 is significant due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations with the MLL gene, leading to MLL-AF9 fusion proteins that are implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Kabra2022The). The gene's role in leukemogenesis and its interactions with other proteins make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kabra2022The).

## Structure
The MLLT3 protein, also known as AF9, is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature with specific ordered regions at the N- and C-termini. The C-terminal region contains the ANC1 homology domain (AHD), which is crucial for mediating interactions with various proteins, including transcriptional activators and repressors (Kabra2022The). The AHD undergoes a coupled binding and folding event upon interaction with partner proteins such as AF4, DOT1L, BCOR, and CBX8, transitioning from a disordered to a more structured state (Kabra2022The).

The structure of the MLLT3 AHD-AF4 complex has been solved using NMR spectroscopy, revealing a mixed α-β structure. The AHD forms a β-hairpin that combines with AF4 residues to form a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet, with the rest of the AHD folding around the AF4 peptide in the form of three α-helices. This interaction is characterized by a hydrophobic core, contributing to the stability of the complex (Kabra2022The).

MLLT3 also contains a YEATS domain, which is an epigenetic reader that binds to acetylated and crotonylated lysines. This domain features an 'end-open' binding site, allowing it to accommodate larger modifications like crotonylation (Kabra2022The).

## Function
MLLT3, also known as AF9, is a critical regulator of hematopoiesis, playing a significant role in the differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is involved in maintaining the hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell (HSPC) population (Kabra2022The; Pina2008MLLT3). MLLT3 functions as part of the super elongation complex (SEC), which is crucial for transcriptional regulation by facilitating the elongation phase of RNA polymerase II. This activity is essential for maintaining gene expression programs critical for blood cell development (Kabra2022The).

MLLT3 interacts with the transcription factor GATA1, forming regulatory feedback loops that influence erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. It acts as a positive regulator of these differentiation decisions, upregulating E/Meg-affiliated transcription factors such as GATA1, GATA2, SCL, and GFI1b, while downregulating myeloid-associated factors like PU.1 and CEBPA (Pina2008MLLT3). MLLT3's role in promoting these lineages is dependent on its transcriptional regulatory activity, and it is thought to act upstream of GATA1, contributing to the initiation of E/Meg commitment and early differentiation programs (Pina2008MLLT3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MLLT3 gene are clinically significant, particularly in the context of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MLLT3 is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations with the MLL gene, resulting in MLL-AF9 fusion proteins. These fusions lead to the constitutive activation of MLL target genes, contributing to leukemogenesis (Kabra2022The). The MLL-AF9 fusion is associated with aberrant histone modifications and altered gene expression, which are critical in the pathogenesis of AML (Wang2019Integrated).

In AML, patients with MLLT3 fusions generally have better overall survival when undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) compared to those with other fusion partners (Burillo‐Sanz2018MLL‐rearranged). The MLLT3 gene is also implicated in lymphoma, where it is regulated by microRNAs such as miR-297b-5p/3p. These microRNAs can suppress MLLT3 expression, leading to decreased cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Zhang2012MicroRNA297b5p3p).

The interactions of MLLT3 with proteins like AF4 and DOT1L are crucial for the progression of MLL-AF9 leukemia, highlighting the potential of targeting these interactions for therapeutic intervention (Kabra2022The).

## Interactions
MLLT3, also known as AF9, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation and leukemogenesis. It interacts with proteins such as AF4, DOT1L, CBX8, and BCOR through its intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, known as the ANC1 homology domain (AHD). These interactions are significant in the context of MLL fusion leukemia, where MLL-AF9 fusions are observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients (Kabra2022The).

MLLT3 forms a multiprotein complex with FMR2 and mBCoR-a, as evidenced by yeast three-hybrid assays, indicating that these proteins can simultaneously bind to the C-terminus of MLLT3 (Srinivasan2003The). The protein also interacts with specific isoforms of the BCL-6 corepressor (BCoR), particularly isoforms a and b, which contain a unique 34 amino acid sequence necessary for binding (Srinivasan2003The).

MLLT3's interaction with DOT1L is crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation, as DOT1L mediates methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79), a modification associated with active transcription (Büttner2010Af9Mllt3). The interaction with CBX8, a component of the Polycomb PRC1 complex, modulates DOT1L-mediated gene expression, highlighting the complex regulatory role of MLLT3 in gene expression (Malik2013CBX8).
