# RILPL2

## Overview
RILPL2, or Rab interacting lysosomal protein like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking and lysosomal function. The RILPL2 protein is a member of the RILP family and is characterized by its interaction with Rab GTPases, particularly Rab8a and Rab36, which are crucial for vesicle transport and ciliogenesis. The protein contains conserved regions, RH1 and RH2, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as myosin-5a (Myo5a) and melanophilin (Mlph), playing a significant role in regulating motor activity and vesicle transport along the actin network. RILPL2's interaction with phosphorylated Rab8a, mediated by a dual arginine motif, is essential for the regulation of primary cilia formation, a process influenced by LRRK2 kinase activity, which is associated with Parkinson's disease. Additionally, RILPL2 has clinical significance in cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and immune response (Cao2019The; Chen2024RILPL2; Waschbüsch2021Dual).

## Structure
RILPL2 is a protein that interacts with Rab GTPases, specifically Rab8a, through its Rab-binding domain (RBD), which adopts a parallel alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. A key feature of this domain is the X-cap motif, which includes two arginine residues, R130 and R132, essential for recognizing the phosphorylated threonine (pT72) on Rab8a (Waschbüsch2021Dual). The X-cap forms an X-shaped structure over the coiled coil, facilitating electrostatic interactions with the phosphorylated threonine of Rab8a (Waschbüsch2019Structural).

The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a heterotetramer with Rab8a, where RILPL2 creates a central α-helical dimer that bridges two pRab8a molecules (Waschbüsch2019Structural). This interaction is GTP-dependent, with phosphorylated T72 being essential for binding (Waschbüsch2019Structural). The structure of RILPL2 in complex with phosphorylated Rab8a has been determined at high resolution, revealing that the dual arginine motif is critical for the interaction (Waschbüsch2021Dual).

RILPL2 also contains two conserved regions, RH1 and RH2, which are part of the RILP family proteins. These regions are involved in interactions with Myo5a and Rab36, respectively, playing a role in regulating Myo5a motor activity (Cao2019The).

## Function
RILPL2 (Rab interacting lysosomal protein like 2) is involved in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and lysosomal function. It interacts with Rab GTPases, which are crucial for vesicle transport. RILPL2 plays a significant role in the regulation of myosin-5a (Myo5a) motor activity, a processive motor protein involved in vesicle transport along the actin network. This regulation is mediated through its interaction with melanophilin (Mlph) and Rab36, a GTPase. RILPL2, along with Mlph, co-regulates Myo5a by forming a ternary complex that is essential for the activation of Myo5a motor function under physiological conditions (Cao2019The).

RILPL2 also interacts with phosphorylated Rab8a, a process that is crucial for the regulation of ciliogenesis, which is important for the formation of primary cilia in cells. This interaction is mediated by a dual arginine motif in the RH2 domain of RILPL2, which recognizes phosphorylated threonine on Rab8a, affecting the growth of primary cilia (Waschbüsch2021Dual). The phosphorylation of Rab8a by LRRK2, a kinase associated with Parkinson's disease, modulates this interaction, suggesting RILPL2's role in membrane trafficking and organelle dynamics (Waschbüsch2021Dual).

## Clinical Significance
RILPL2 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RILPL2 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to peri-cancer tissues. This reduced expression is associated with advanced clinical stages and poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients. The study suggests that RILPL2 could serve as a biomarker for predicting enhanced T cell infiltration, indicating its potential role in the immune response and cancer prognosis (Chen2024RILPL2).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, RILPL2 interacts with LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab GTPases, such as Rab8A and Rab10. These interactions are significant because they affect ciliogenesis, a process disrupted by pathogenic LRRK2 mutations. RILPL2's binding to phosphorylated Rab proteins may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by blocking ciliogenesis, which is crucial for cellular function (Dhekne2021LRRK2phosphorylated).

RILPL2 also plays a role in the regulation of myosin-5a motor activity, which is essential for melanosome transport in melanocytes. Disruptions in this pathway can lead to perinuclear accumulation of melanosomes, potentially affecting pigmentation and related cellular transport processes (Cao2019The).

## Interactions
RILPL2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to the globular tail domain (GTD) of myosin-5a (Myo5a), a motor protein involved in vesicle transport along the actin network. This interaction is crucial for the activation of Myo5a motor function, particularly in the presence of melanophilin (Mlph) and Rab36, a small GTPase. Rab36 enhances the interaction between RILPL2 and Myo5a-GTD, facilitating the binding of Mlph and activating Myo5a (Cao2019The).

RILPL2 also interacts with LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8a and Rab10, which are involved in regulating ciliogenesis. The interaction with phosphorylated Rab8a is mediated by specific residues in RILPL2, such as R132, K149, and R139, and is dependent on the GTP-bound state of Rab8a. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of membrane trafficking upon LRRK2 activation (Waschbüsch2019Structural).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, RILPL2, along with MyoVa, relocalizes to the peri-centriolar region in a phospho-Rab10-dependent manner, potentially interfering with MyoVa's role in ciliogenesis (Dhekne2021LRRK2phosphorylated).
