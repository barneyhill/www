# SEPTIN6

## Overview
SEPTIN6 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 6, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septins are cytoskeletal components that play a critical role in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell division, and vesicle trafficking. The SEPTIN6 gene is involved in the formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes, which are essential for the structural organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton (Neubauer2017The; Rosa2020Molecular). The protein septin 6, characterized by its GTPase activity, is integral to the assembly of higher-order structures such as filaments and rings, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating cellular transport mechanisms (Montagna2015Mammalian). SEPTIN6 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including hematological malignancies, where it participates in gene fusions that can affect disease progression and prognosis (Fu2021SEPT6TRIM33; Cerveira2011MLLSEPTIN).

## Structure
SEPTIN6 is a member of the septin family, characterized by its involvement in forming hetero-oligomeric complexes essential for cellular organization and cytokinesis. The primary structure of SEPTIN6 includes a GTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in GTP binding and hydrolysis (Rosa2020Molecular). The secondary structure of SEPTIN6 is composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a septin fold described as an αβα three-layered sandwich with a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Rosa2020Molecular).

In terms of tertiary structure, SEPTIN6 forms a conserved septin core, which is integral to its function and interaction with other septins. The quaternary structure involves the formation of stable heterodimers with other septins, such as SEPT2, SEPT8, and SEPT11, which are interchangeable in forming interfaces with SEPT2 (Rosa2020Molecular). The coiled-coil motif in the C-terminal domain of SEPTIN6 plays a significant role in stabilizing these oligomeric structures and facilitating protein-protein interactions (Leonardo2021Orientational).

SEPTIN6 also exhibits structural flexibility, allowing it to form both parallel and antiparallel coiled-coil arrangements, which are crucial for filament assembly and higher-order structure organization (Leonardo2021Orientational). The presence of specific residues, such as Ser163 and Lys111, suggests potential post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its structural or functional properties (Rosa2020Molecular).

## Function
SEPTIN6 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins that play a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SEPTIN6 is involved in the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, contributing to cell shape maintenance and division. It forms part of heteromeric complexes, such as the SEPT2-SEPT6-SEPT7 complex, which are essential for the assembly of higher-order structures like filaments and rings. These structures are vital for processes such as cytokinesis, exocytosis, and vesicle transport (Neubauer2017The; Montagna2015Mammalian).

SEPTIN6 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell cortex, where it participates in vesicle trafficking and membrane dynamics. It plays a role in the AP-3 adaptor complex-dependent sorting of lysosome membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) to lysosomes, indicating its involvement in endosome transport (Neubauer2017The). SEPTIN6 also contributes to the stabilization of focal adhesions and the assembly of adhesion structures, such as podosomes, which are important for cell migration and matrix adhesion (Ivanov2021Novel).

In the nervous system, SEPTIN6 is implicated in neuronal migration, axonal branching, and synaptic activity, where it helps regulate the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic vesicle fusion (Dolat2013Septin).

## Clinical Significance
SEPTIN6 is implicated in various hematological malignancies through its involvement in gene fusions. The MLL-SEPT6 fusion gene is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in pediatric cases. This fusion results from chromosomal rearrangements between the MLL gene on chromosome 11 and the SEPT6 gene on chromosome X, leading to the formation of chimeric proteins. These proteins combine the N-terminal part of MLL with most of the SEPT6 open reading frame, excluding the first ten amino acids. This fusion includes all three septin function-defining domains and is linked to significant down-regulation of both MLL and SEPT6 RNA expression in affected patients (Cerveira2008Molecular; Cerveira2011MLLSEPTIN).

In B-cell lymphomas, the SEPT6_TRIM33 fusion gene is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. This fusion acts as a prognostic factor, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for stratification and therapeutic targeting. The presence of this fusion gene correlates with shorter progression-free survival and poor treatment response, highlighting its clinical significance in the progression of B-cell lymphomas (Fu2021SEPT6TRIM33).

Alterations in SEPTIN6 expression are also observed in AML cases with MLL-SEPT6 fusions, where a significant down-regulation of SEPT6 is noted, indicating a potential role in the disease's pathology (Santos2010Expression).

## Interactions
SEPTIN6 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It forms heterodimers with SEPTIN7, facilitated by their C-terminal coiled-coil domains, and this interaction is essential for binding with the Borg3 protein, a downstream effector of the Cdc42 GTPase (Sheffield2003Borg/Septin). SEPTIN6 is also part of the SEPT2-6-7 heterotrimer, which interacts with the microtubule-associated protein MAP4. This interaction is mediated by the proline-rich domain of MAP4 and is significant for regulating microtubule stability (Kremer2005Mammalian).

SEPTIN6 interacts with SNX6, which is involved in exocytosis and intracellular trafficking, and plays a role in the regulation of endosome transport by modulating the AP-3 adaptor complex (Neubauer2017The). It also associates with CAPS1 in the mouse brain, indicating a role in vesicle fusion events (Hosono2016Interaction). SEPTIN6 is located at the mitotic spindle and midbody during cell division, interacting with actin stress fibers and contributing to the spatial organization and function of the cytoskeleton (Gönczi2020Septins). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of SEPTIN6 in cellular dynamics and structure.
