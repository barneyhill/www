# ATCAY

## Overview
The ATCAY gene encodes the protein caytaxin, which is primarily expressed in neurons and plays a significant role in intracellular transport processes. Caytaxin functions as an adaptor protein, interacting with kinesin light chains to facilitate the transport of essential cellular components, such as mitochondria, along neuronal processes. This transport is crucial for maintaining neuronal health and function, particularly in the presynaptic regions where caytaxin is concentrated. The protein contains a CRAL-TRIO domain, which is involved in binding lipophilic molecules, although its specific binding partners remain to be fully elucidated. Disruptions in the function of caytaxin, due to mutations in the ATCAY gene, are linked to neurological disorders such as Cayman cerebellar ataxia, characterized by motor coordination deficits and cerebellar dysfunction (Aoyama2009Cayman; Xiao2005Caytaxin).

## Function
The ATCAY gene encodes the protein caytaxin, which plays a crucial role in neuronal function by facilitating intracellular transport processes. Caytaxin acts as an adaptor protein that binds to kinesin light chains (KLCs), part of the kinesin-1 motor protein complex, enabling the transport of specific cargos, including mitochondria, along neurites. This transport is essential for maintaining proper neuronal function and structure, as it ensures the distribution of mitochondria to the distal ends of neurites, which is vital for energy supply and cellular health (Aoyama2009Cayman).

Caytaxin is primarily active in the cytoplasm of neurons, where it is transported along axons and dendrites. It is particularly concentrated in the presynaptic region, indicating its role in synaptic function (Aoyama2009Cayman). The protein contains a CRAL-TRIO domain, which is involved in binding lipophilic molecules, although its specific binding partners in caytaxin are not fully understood (Aoyama2009Cayman). Disruption in caytaxin function can lead to neurological disorders such as hereditary ataxia and dystonia, characterized by psychomotor retardation and cerebellar dysfunction, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal motor coordination and neurological function (Xiao2005Caytaxin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATCAY gene are associated with Cayman cerebellar ataxia, a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as birth-onset hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, cerebellar dysfunction, nystagmus, intention tremor, ataxic gait, and dysarthria (Siavashani2023Novel). The disorder was initially identified in Grand Cayman Island but has also been reported in other regions, including Pakistan and Iran (Siavashani2023Novel). 

The ATCAY gene encodes caytaxin, a neuron-restricted protein involved in glutamate synthesis regulation at synapses. Mutations, such as frameshift deletions, can lead to glutamate excitotoxicity and deregulation of glutamatergic activation, contributing to the symptoms of Cayman cerebellar ataxia (Siavashani2023Novel). In a study involving Pakistani families, a novel homozygous seven base pair deletion in the ATCAY gene was identified, leading to a premature stop codon and resulting in severe gait ataxia, cognitive impairment, and cerebellar atrophy (Manzoor2018Novel).

In animal models, such as rats and mice, mutations in the Atcay gene result in various motor dysfunctions, including ataxia and dystonia, which are similar to the human condition (Xiao2005Caytaxin). These findings underscore the critical role of ATCAY in maintaining normal neurological function and its involvement in severe motor disorders when mutated.

## Interactions
The ATCAY gene encodes the protein caytaxin, which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for neuronal function. Caytaxin interacts with kinesin light chains (KLCs) through its tetratricopeptide-repeat region, specifically recognizing the ELEWED sequence. This interaction allows caytaxin to associate indirectly with kinesin heavy chains (KHCs), facilitating its transport along neurites by kinesin-1. This transport is essential for the proper distribution of mitochondria within neurons, as suppression of caytaxin expression leads to the redistribution of mitochondria away from neurite ends (Aoyama2009Cayman).

Caytaxin also interacts with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 and kidney-type glutaminase (KGA). The CRAL-TRIO domain of caytaxin is involved in these interactions, although the precise significance of these interactions in neuronal function is not fully understood (Aoyama2009Cayman; Itoh2011Cayman). The interaction with Pin1 is particularly notable as it suggests a role in regulating glutamate homeostasis and synaptic plasticity, given caytaxin's involvement in glutamatergic neurotransmission (Itoh2011Cayman). These interactions highlight caytaxin's role as an adaptor protein, linking various cargos to the kinesin motor for transport within neurons.
