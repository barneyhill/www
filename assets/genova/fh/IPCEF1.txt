# IPCEF1

## Overview
IPCEF1, or interaction protein for cytohesin exchange factors 1, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by IPCEF1 plays a pivotal role in regulating cell migration and cytoskeletal organization by interacting with cytohesins, which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ARF GTPases. This interaction is essential for ARF-to-Rac signaling, facilitating processes such as membrane trafficking and cell adhesion. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it assembles multiprotein complexes necessary for cellular responses, including those mediated by small GTPases like Arf6. IPCEF1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neuropathic pain (White2010GRASP; Marks2021Tolllike; Attar2012CNK3).

## Function
IPCEF1, also known as interaction protein for cytohesin exchange factors 1, plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of cell migration and cytoskeletal organization. It functions as a scaffolding protein that interacts with cytohesins, which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ARF GTPases. This interaction is crucial for ARF-to-Rac signaling, a pathway that promotes cell motility by facilitating the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling at the leading edge of migrating cells (White2010GRASP; Marks2021Tolllike).

IPCEF1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, where it influences processes such as membrane trafficking and cell adhesion. It is involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes that include ARNO/cytohesin 2 and Dock180, which are essential for ARF-dependent Rac activation and subsequent cellular responses (White2010GRASP). In epithelial cells, IPCEF1 is necessary for the activation of Arf6, a small GTPase that regulates the remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, thereby promoting cell movement in response to signals like hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Attar2012CNK3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IPCEF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, IPCEF1 expression is significantly downregulated in follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FVPTCs) compared to follicular adenomas (FAs), suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for distinguishing between these thyroid conditions (Schulten2015Comparison). In colorectal cancer, higher plasma levels of the CNK3/IPCEF1 fusion protein are associated with poorer long-term survival rates in stage III patients, indicating its potential clinical significance in predicting patient outcomes (Holm2019Identification).

In autoimmune diseases, IPCEF1 plays a role in regulating Th17 cell migration, which is relevant to conditions like multiple sclerosis. Overexpression of IPCEF1 in Th17 cells reduces their migration into the central nervous system, potentially decreasing disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis (Marks2021Tolllike). This suggests that modulating IPCEF1 expression could be a therapeutic strategy for controlling Th17 cell migration and reducing autoimmune inflammation (Marks2021Tolllike).

In the context of peripheral nerve injury, IPCEF1 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in dorsal root ganglions, indicating its involvement in neuropathic pain mechanisms through altered membrane receptor trafficking (Guan2009Peripheral).

## Interactions
IPCEF1, also known as interaction protein for cytohesin exchange factors 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for cellular signaling pathways. It acts as a scaffolding protein that associates with cytohesin2/ARNO, facilitating the activation of Rac, a small GTPase involved in cell migration and cytoskeletal remodeling (White2010GRASP; Marks2021Tolllike). The interaction between IPCEF1 and cytohesin2/ARNO is mediated by the coiled-coil domain of ARNO, which is essential for assembling a multiprotein complex that includes Dock180, a Rac-activating protein (White2010GRASP).

IPCEF1 is also part of a fusion protein with CNK3, which is required for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent Arf6 activation and cell migration. This fusion protein coordinates the association of ARNO with Dock180, promoting Arf-to-Rac signaling necessary for cell motility (Attar2012CNK3). The CRAC domain within the C-terminal 120 amino acids of IPCEF1 is crucial for its interaction with cytohesin2, highlighting its role in forming protein complexes that regulate cell movement (Attar2012CNK3). These interactions underscore IPCEF1's role in modulating ARF activity and influencing cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses.
