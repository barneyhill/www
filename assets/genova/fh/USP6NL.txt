# USP6NL

## Overview
USP6NL (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 6 N-terminal Like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking and membrane dynamics. The protein, known as USP6 N-terminal like, functions primarily as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab family proteins, which are critical regulators of vesicle transport within cells. By modulating Rab protein activity, USP6NL plays a significant role in processes such as receptor recycling and signal transduction, which are essential for maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis. The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in the dynamic regulation of membrane components and cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in USP6NL expression have been linked to various cancers, where it influences pathways associated with tumor progression and drug resistance (Sun2019Tre2; Su2022UbiquitinSpecific).

## Function
USP6NL (USP6 N-terminal like) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in endocytic trafficking and membrane dynamics. It functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab family proteins, which are essential regulators of vesicle transport. By modulating the activity of Rab proteins, USP6NL influences the trafficking of vesicles within the cell, particularly in the endosomal compartments. This activity is vital for processes such as receptor recycling and signal transduction, which are key to maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis.

In healthy human cells, USP6NL is active in cellular compartments like endosomes, where it impacts the recycling of receptors back to the cell surface after endocytosis. This recycling process is critical for the regulation of receptor availability and sensitivity, affecting how cells respond to external signals. Through its role in these molecular processes, USP6NL contributes to the proper functioning of cellular signaling pathways and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The protein's activity in endosomal trafficking underscores its importance in the dynamic regulation of membrane components and the overall cellular environment.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USP6NL gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. In glioblastoma, USP6NL is overexpressed in temozolomide-resistant cells, contributing to drug resistance by enhancing cancer cell invasiveness and reducing apoptosis. This overexpression is associated with increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, which plays a role in therapy resistance and cancer progression (Su2022UbiquitinSpecific).

In breast cancer, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), USP6NL is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis. Its overexpression stabilizes the glucose transporter GLUT1, promoting aerobic glycolysis and supporting cancer cell proliferation. This metabolic shift makes breast cancer cells more sensitive to glucose deprivation, indicating a reliance on glycolysis for growth (Avanzato2018High).

In colorectal cancer, USP6NL is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by preventing β-catenin degradation, which in turn affects the expression of oncogenes like Cyclin D1 and C-myc. This suggests that USP6NL functions as an oncogene in colorectal cancer (Sun2019Tre2).

## Interactions
USP6NL interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In glioblastoma (GBM) cells, USP6NL interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), influencing its ubiquitination and protecting it from downregulation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining EGFR signaling, which is associated with drug resistance and DNA repair mechanisms in GBM (Su2022UbiquitinSpecific).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), USP6NL interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. USP6NL regulates β-catenin ubiquitination, preventing its degradation and promoting CRC cell proliferation. This interaction highlights USP6NL's role as a deubiquitinase, influencing the accumulation of β-catenin and the expression of downstream oncogenes like Cyclin D1 and C-myc (Sun2019Tre2).

In breast cancer, USP6NL is involved in stabilizing the glucose transporter GLUT1 through its interaction with the AKT signaling pathway. This stabilization supports aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation. USP6NL's effect on GLUT1 is linked to its inhibition of GLUT1 endocytosis, which is mediated by sustained AKT activation (Avanzato2018High).
