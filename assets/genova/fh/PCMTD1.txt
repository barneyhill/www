# PCMTD1

## Overview
PCMTD1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase domain containing 1. This protein is characterized by its domain similarity to methyltransferases, although it does not exhibit L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity (Liao2024The). PCMTD1 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and repair, through its interactions with components of the BTR complex, such as BLM, TOP3A, and RMI1 (Papaioannou2024circPCMTD1:). Additionally, it interacts with UNC119A and UNC119B, proteins involved in trafficking, suggesting a role in cellular localization dynamics (Yelland2021The). Clinically, mutations in the PCMTD1 gene have been linked to several conditions, including squamous cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer, where they may contribute to disease progression and drug resistance (Liu2019Characterization; Kim2021Longitudinal). The gene is also associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma, highlighting its potential significance in genetic risk profiling (Rong2016Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCMTD1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In squamous cell lung cancers (SQCC) from Appalachian Kentucky, PCMTD1 mutations were found to be significantly more common compared to other populations, suggesting a population-specific genetic profile that may influence the development of this cancer type. This finding highlights the potential for personalized treatment strategies targeting PCMTD1 mutations in this region (Liu2019Characterization).

In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), PCMTD1 mutations have been observed to emerge in post-treatment samples of patients treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody used in cancer therapy. These emergent mutations are associated with disease progression and may contribute to resistance against cetuximab, indicating a role for PCMTD1 in drug resistance mechanisms (Kim2021Longitudinal).

Additionally, the PCMTD1-ST18 locus has been associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in genetic studies, although the specific biological mechanisms remain unclear. The SNP rs1015213 in this locus has shown a significant association with PACG, suggesting a potential genetic risk factor for this condition (Rong2016Genetic).

## Interactions
PCMTD1, a protein with a domain similar to protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase, is involved in several protein interactions. It has been identified as a component of the BTR complex, interacting with proteins such as BLM, TOP3A, and RMI1. These interactions are crucial for DNA replication and repair, particularly in the context of BCR/ABL-positive leukemias, where PCMTD1 is implicated in regulating the DNA damage response (Papaioannou2024circPCMTD1:).

PCMTD1 also exhibits binding interactions with UNC119A and UNC119B, two paralogs involved in protein trafficking. It binds to UNC119A with a higher affinity compared to UNC119B, suggesting a preference in its interaction dynamics (Yelland2021The). These interactions may influence the localization and trafficking of PCMTD1 within cells, although the specific functional outcomes of these interactions require further investigation (Yelland2021The).

While PCMTD1 shares a high sequence identity with its paralog PCMTD2, it does not appear to have L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity and was not detected in certain protein analyses, indicating potentially low expression or different functional roles compared to PCMTD2 (Liao2024The).
