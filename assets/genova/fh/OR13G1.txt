# OR13G1

## Overview
The OR13G1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily G member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane helical structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction. The OR13G1 protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, contributing to the sense of smell by initiating a cascade of intracellular events upon ligand binding. This receptor is part of a large family of olfactory receptors that are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The gene is located in a unique haplotype block, indicating its potential involvement in specific genetic traits or conditions, such as myocardial infarction risk (Mills2013RNASeq; Shiffman2005Identification).

## Structure
The OR13G1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors typically exhibit a seven-transmembrane helical structure, which is characteristic of GPCRs. The primary structure of the OR13G1 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which span the cell membrane and facilitate signal transduction. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific ligands and initiate intracellular signaling pathways. While quaternary structure is less common in olfactory receptors, the OR13G1 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its stability and activity (Mills2013RNASeq; Shiffman2005Identification).

The OR13G1 gene is located in a haplotype block that does not encompass other genes, suggesting that the variant contributing to myocardial infarction risk is within OR13G1 itself (Shiffman2005Identification). The precise biological mechanisms and potential splice variant isoforms of OR13G1 remain subjects for further research.
