# ATP6V0A1

## Overview
The ATP6V0A1 gene encodes the a1 subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a transmembrane protein complex essential for proton translocation across cellular membranes. This gene plays a critical role in maintaining the acidic environment of intracellular compartments, which is vital for processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. The protein encoded by ATP6V0A1 is particularly significant in neural tissues, where it contributes to brain development and function. Mutations in ATP6V0A1 have been linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and neurodevelopment (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1; Indrawinata2023Structural).

## Structure
The ATP6V0A1 gene encodes the a1 subunit of the V0 domain of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a crucial component for proton translocation across cellular membranes. The protein is composed of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain (NTD) and a membrane-embedded C-terminal domain (CTD). The CTD includes eight transmembrane α-helices, which are integral to its function in proton translocation, forming part of the hemichannels that facilitate proton movement. The α7 and α8 helices are particularly important as they form the interface with the c-ring, essential for proton translocation (Indrawinata2023Structural).

The protein's structure is stabilized by glycosylation at N488, which is necessary for its incorporation into the V-ATPase complex (Indrawinata2023Structural). The NTD forms a hairpin-like structure with two globular segments connected by a coiled-coil known as the connecting stalk, involved in organelle targeting and interaction with other subunits (Indrawinata2023Structural).

Mutations in ATP6V0A1, such as R740Q, affect the protein's ability to translocate protons, leading to impaired lysosomal acidification and associated neurological disorders (Bott2021Variants). The protein's interaction with the c-ring and its role in neurotransmitter release highlight its importance in neural tissues (Indrawinata2023Structural).

## Function
The ATP6V0A1 gene encodes the a1-subunit of the V0 domain of vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases), which are ATP-dependent proton pumps crucial for acidifying intracellular compartments. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1). In healthy human cells, ATP6V0A1 is primarily active in lysosomes, where it maintains the acidic environment necessary for lysosomal function and cellular homeostasis (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1). The a1-subunit is strongly expressed in neurons, indicating its significant role in brain development and function (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1).

The V-ATPase complex, including ATP6V0A1, is involved in coupling ATP hydrolysis with proton translocation, which is vital for lysosomal acidification and autophagic processes (Indrawinata2023Structural). This acidification is necessary to achieve a pH optimal for enzymatic activities involved in autophagosome clearance, preventing the accumulation of autophagosomes and lysosomal bodies (Indrawinata2023Structural). The a1-subunit also interacts with SNARE proteins, which mediate vesicle fusion, thereby modulating neurotransmitter release by favoring the fusion of acidified and loaded synaptic vesicles (Indrawinata2023Structural). Disruptions in ATP6V0A1 can lead to impaired lysosomal function and are implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (Indrawinata2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP6V0A1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). These conditions are linked to both de novo and biallelic variants in the gene, which lead to impaired lysosomal acidification and dysfunction, resulting in symptoms such as developmental delay, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1; Bott2021Variants). Specific mutations, such as A512P, N534D, and R741Q, have been shown to disrupt lysosomal function and mTORC1 signaling, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1).

The ATP6V0A1 gene also plays a role in neurotransmitter regulation within synaptic vesicles. Mutations can lead to reduced neurotransmitter content and altered synaptic currents, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of DEE (Aoto2021ATP6V0A1). Additionally, the interaction between ATP6V0A1 and presenilin-1, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease, suggests a potential link to neurodegenerative conditions. Disruptions in this interaction may lead to increased amyloid-beta aggregation and impaired protein clearance, further implicating ATP6V0A1 in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Indrawinata2023Structural).

## Interactions
ATP6V0A1, a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, participates in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with presenilin-1 (PS-1), a protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease, to facilitate the N-glycosylation of ATP6V0A1, which is necessary for its proper targeting to lysosomes. This interaction is significant for the clearance of amyloid-beta aggregates, linking ATP6V0A1 to neurodegenerative processes (Indrawinata2023Structural).

ATP6V0A1 is also involved in the formation of the V-ATPase complex, interacting with other subunits such as the c-ring, which is essential for proton translocation. This interaction is crucial for the function of the V-ATPase as a proton pump, facilitating the movement of protons across membranes (Indrawinata2023Structural).

In the context of vesicular trafficking, ATP6V0A1 interacts with SNARE proteins, which are vital for vesicle fusion. This interaction is important for neurotransmitter release, as ATP6V0A1 modulates the fusion of acidified synaptic vesicles (Indrawinata2023Structural).

Additionally, ATP6V0A1 is part of a complex network of interactions involving proteins such as DMXL1, DMXL2, and NCOA7, which are specific to V-ATPase and co-localize with it in certain cell types, suggesting roles in V-ATPase regulation and trafficking (Merkulova2015Mapping).
