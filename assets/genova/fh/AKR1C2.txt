# AKR1C2

## Overview
AKR1C2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C2, which is part of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily recognized for its role as a 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), crucial in the metabolism of steroids, particularly in the inactivation of potent androgens like dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Steckelbroeck2004Human; Rižner2014Role). The AKR1C2 protein is characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, typical of the AKR family, and may function as a homodimer (Jin2006Molecular; Arthur2010Modeling). It plays a significant role in regulating androgen receptor activity and maintaining steroid hormone balance, impacting various physiological processes across tissues such as the prostate, liver, and brain (Penning2004Structure–function). Alterations in AKR1C2 expression and function have been linked to conditions like prostate cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ostinelli2021AKR1C2; Ji2003Selective).

## Structure
The AKR1C2 protein is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, characterized by a conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, also known as a TIM-barrel core. This structure is composed of eight alpha helices and eight beta sheets, forming a barrel-like configuration that is typical of the AKR family (Jin2006Molecular). The protein's tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary elements, creating a large elongated hydrophobic cavity that serves as the steroid binding pocket. This cavity is lined by residues from several loops, with the active site located at the bottom, featuring a catalytic tetrad composed of Tyr55, Asp50, Lys84, and His117 (Jin2006Molecular).

AKR1C2 may function as a homodimer, with surface residues potentially playing a role in dimer stabilization (Arthur2010Modeling). The protein's quaternary structure, therefore, might involve dimerization, although this aspect requires further structural studies for confirmation. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are common in proteins of this family, although specific modifications for AKR1C2 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein may also have splice variant isoforms that could influence its function and localization, but specific isoforms are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
The AKR1C2 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, playing a crucial role in steroid metabolism. In healthy human cells, AKR1C2 functions primarily as a 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), involved in the inactivation of potent androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by converting it into the less active 3α-androstanediol. This conversion is essential for regulating androgen receptor activity and maintaining appropriate intracellular DHT concentrations, which is significant for androgen target tissues like the prostate (Steckelbroeck2004Human; Rižner2014Role).

AKR1C2 also acts as a bidirectional oxidoreductase, catalyzing the reduction of 5α-DHT to 3α-androstanediol and the oxidation of 3α-androstanediol back to 5α-DHT, with the direction of the reaction influenced by the NAD+/NADPH ratio (Rižner2003Human). In the brain, AKR1C2 is involved in the production of neuroactive steroids like allopregnanolone, which modulate the GABA A receptor, impacting neurological functions (Rižner2014Role). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining steroid hormone balance, influencing processes such as cellular proliferation and differentiation in various tissues, including the liver, prostate, and brain (Penning2004Structure–function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the AKR1C2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, there is a notable reduction in AKR1C2 expression compared to normal prostate tissue, which may lead to increased levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in cancerous tissues, potentially promoting cancer progression (Ji2003Selective). This reduction in AKR1C2 expression is specific and not due to increased stromal content, as AKR1C2 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells (Ji2003Selective).

Genetic variations in AKR1C2, such as the F46Y variant, have been associated with decreased enzyme activity, leading to elevated DHT levels and potentially contributing to prostate cancer progression. This variant is more prevalent in individuals of African descent, paralleling the higher risk of prostate cancer in these populations (Takahashi2009The; Alshogran2017Pharmacogenetics).

In addition to prostate cancer, AKR1C2 expression is linked to body fat distribution and metabolic conditions. It is strongly expressed in adipose tissue and associated with trunk fat mass, suggesting a role in obesity and related metabolic diseases (Ostinelli2021AKR1C2). Changes in AKR1C2 expression may also contribute to chronic fatigue disorders due to its involvement in neurosteroid metabolism (Oakley2023Long).
