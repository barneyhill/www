# BMP8B

## Overview
BMP8B (bone morphogenetic protein 8b) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the TGF-β superfamily, which is involved in various biological processes, including thermogenesis and energy balance. The protein product, bone morphogenetic protein 8b, plays a critical role in the regulation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) function, enhancing the thermogenic response to stimuli such as norepinephrine. It is also implicated in the induction of primordial germ cells and the modulation of signaling pathways in hepatic stellate cells, which are relevant to conditions like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cancer. BMP8B's expression is influenced by environmental factors such as diet and temperature, and its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including reproductive disorders and various cancers (Whittle2012BMP8B; Urisarri2021BMP8; Vacca2020Bone).

## Function
BMP8B (bone morphogenetic protein 8b) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and plays a significant role in thermogenesis, particularly in brown adipose tissue (BAT). It is involved in the regulation of energy balance and thermogenic processes in mature brown adipocytes. BMP8B enhances the response of brown adipocytes to norepinephrine by increasing Smad phosphorylation and activating hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and AMPK, which are crucial for lipid storage and oxidation. This results in an elevated lipolytic response to adrenergic stimulation, priming cells for a higher maximal lipolytic response (Whittle2012BMP8B).

In the central nervous system, BMP8B is expressed in hypothalamic nuclei that control energy balance and thermogenesis. Its central treatment increases thermogenesis via neuronal activation and sympathetic tone to BAT, indicating its role in both central and peripheral actions (Whittle2012BMP8B). BMP8B also acts on the hypothalamus to induce thermogenesis, suggesting its involvement in neonatal thermoregulation and adaptation to cold exposure (Urisarri2021BMP8).

BMP8B is expressed in higher levels in BAT compared to other tissues, such as the brain and testes, and its expression is induced by thermogenic stimuli like high-fat diets and cold exposure (Whittle2012BMP8B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BMP8B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In reproductive health, BMP8B is crucial for the formation of primordial germ cells. Mutations in this gene, such as monoallelic missense variations, have been associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in humans. These mutations can lead to defects in ovarian development and contribute to the POI phenotype by affecting the development of primordial germ cells (Turkyilmaz2022Whole-exome; França2020Screening).

In cancer, BMP8B expression levels have been linked to various types. In pancreatic cancer, BMP8B is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and promote apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic role (CHENG2014BMP8B). In gastric cancer, high BMP8B expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (MIMA2013Gene). In breast cancer, BMP8B expression is significantly increased, influencing disease progression and metastasis (Liu2023Aberrant).

Alterations in BMP8B expression have also been observed in inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, where it shows differential expression patterns that could serve as diagnostic markers (Skok2021Expression).

## Interactions
BMP8B interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways, playing a significant role in different biological processes. In the context of primordial germ cell (PGC) induction, BMP8B is suggested to form heterodimers with BMP4, which are more potent than homodimers in inducing PGCs from murine epiblasts. This interaction is crucial as neither BMP4 nor BMP8B homodimers alone can induce PGCs, highlighting the necessity of both BMP pathways for PGC generation (Ying2001Induction).

In the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), BMP8B activates both branches of the BMP/TGFβ signaling pathways in hepatic stellate cells, promoting Smad 2/3 and 1/5/9 signaling pathways. This activation suggests a role in modulating inflammatory and cell proliferation pathways (Vacca2020Bone). BMP8B also interacts with the β-adrenergic response, influencing lipid metabolism and energy balance by enhancing the expression of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid uptake (Mahli2019Bone).

In brown adipose tissue (BAT), BMP8B enhances thermogenesis by activating signaling pathways such as CREB and P38 MAPK, which are essential for the induction of Ucp1 and the thermogenic response. BMP8B's effects are mediated through the activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7), as antagonism of ALK7 abolishes BMP8B's impact on norepinephrine-stimulated lipolysis (Whittle2012BMP8B).
