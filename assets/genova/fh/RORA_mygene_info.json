It can bind as a monomer or as a homodimer to hormone response elements upstream of several genes to enhance the expression of those genes. The encoded protein has been shown to interact with NM23-2, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase involved in organogenesis and differentiation, as well as with NM23-1, the product of a tumor metastasis suppressor candidate gene. Also, it has been shown to aid in the transcriptional regulation of some genes involved in circadian rhythm. Four transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
