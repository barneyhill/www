# ZNF385B

## Overview
ZNF385B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 385B, a transcription factor characterized by its matrin-type zinc finger domains. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and is primarily located in the nucleus, where it plays a role in transcriptional repression and cellular stress responses. ZNF385B is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. The protein interacts with key cellular components, such as the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing pathways related to apoptosis and cell survival. Alterations in ZNF385B expression and function have been associated with several pathological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Uddin2020Genetic; HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C; Elgaaen2012ZNF385B).

## Function
ZNF385B, also known as zinc finger protein 385B, encodes a transcription factor characterized by four matrin-type zinc fingers. This protein is highly conserved and functions primarily as a putative repressor of transcription, playing a significant role in gene expression regulation (Uddin2020Genetic). ZNF385B is expressed throughout various tissues in the adult brain, including areas involved in development such as the palate and lip, indicating its importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Uddin2020Genetic).

In healthy human cells, ZNF385B is active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional activity and cellular responses to stress. It is involved in RNA binding and regulation of gene expression, contributing to cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. These functions suggest that ZNF385B plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes (Elgaaen2012ZNF385B).

Although specific details on the function of ZNF385B in healthy cells are limited, its differential expression in pathological conditions like autism spectrum disorder and ovarian cancer implies its involvement in crucial cellular pathways that are disrupted in these diseases (Uddin2020Genetic; Elgaaen2012ZNF385B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF385B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, ZNF385B is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNF385B, such as rs11885327 and rs1964081, have been linked to an increased risk of ASD in various populations, including Bangladeshi children (Uddin2020Genetic). The gene is also involved in neuronal apoptosis, which may contribute to its role in ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In cancer research, ZNF385B expression levels have been correlated with patient survival in serous ovarian carcinomas. Lower expression of ZNF385B is associated with longer survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Elgaaen2012ZNF385B). Additionally, ZNF385B is involved in breast cancer risk as a copy-number variant (CNV) locus in individuals with BRCA1 pathogenic variants (Walker2017Evaluation).

In multiple myeloma, the methylation of miR-1258, located within the ZNF385B gene, leads to its silencing and is associated with disease progression. This methylation pattern is linked to the overexpression of PDL1, impacting the PD-1/PDL1 immune checkpoint (Wang2020Frequent).

## Interactions
ZNF385B, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. It is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, playing a role in transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses. In the context of Burkitt's lymphoma and ovarian cancer, ZNF385B has been noted to promote cell survival through direct binding to p53. This interaction can have both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects, depending on the splice variant of ZNF385B. The full-length variant of ZNF385B is associated with the induction of caspase activation via upregulation of PERP and FAS/CD95, highlighting its role in apoptosis regulation (HochgrebHägele2015Znf385C).

In addition to its interactions with p53, ZNF385B is implicated in the regulation of gene expression through its ability to bind RNA and DNA. This binding capability suggests that ZNF385B may participate in larger multiprotein complexes or transient regulatory mechanisms, although specific details of these interactions are not extensively documented in the provided context. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation underscores its potential significance in various cellular pathways and disease states (Uddin2020Genetic).
