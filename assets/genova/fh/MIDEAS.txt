# MIDEAS

## Overview
MIDEAS, also known as ELMSAN1 or c14orf43, is a gene that encodes the mitotic deacetylase associated SANT domain protein, a crucial component of the MiDAC complex. This protein is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation, primarily through its interaction with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the protein DNTTIP1 (Turnbull2020The; Itoh2015Structural). The MIDEAS protein is characterized by its ELM2-SANT domain, which facilitates both dimerization and tetramerization, essential for the structural integrity and function of the MiDAC complex (Wang2022The; Turnbull2020The). Functionally, MIDEAS plays a significant role in maintaining chromosomal stability during mitosis and in transcriptional repression by deacetylating chromatin domains (Turnbull2020The). Additionally, MIDEAS is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity, highlighting its importance in both cellular and viral gene expression regulation (Wilhelm2024Mitotic).

## Structure
The MIDEAS protein, also known as ELMSAN1, is a critical component of the MiDAC complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. MIDEAS contains an ELM2-SANT domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins in the complex, such as DNTTIP1 and HDAC1/2 (Turnbull2020The; Itoh2015Structural). The ELM2 domain of MIDEAS does not mediate dimerization directly but interacts with the dimerization domain of DNTTIP1, contributing to the unique arrangement of the HDAC1 catalytic subunits (Turnbull2020The).

The SANT domain of MIDEAS is involved in tetramerization, facilitating the formation of a three-dimensional X-shaped architecture in the MiDAC complex. This structure allows the complex to target multiple nucleosomes simultaneously, enhancing its deacetylase function (Wang2022The; Turnbull2020The). The presence of inositol phosphates, such as InsP6, is noted to improve the resolution of the HDAC1 core, suggesting a role in activation (Turnbull2020The).

MIDEAS is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function within the MiDAC complex (Wilhelm2024Mitotic). The structural characterization of MIDEAS and its interactions within the MiDAC complex provide insights into its role in chromatin targeting and gene regulation (Itoh2015Structural).

## Function
MIDEAS, also known as ELMSAN1 or c14orf43, is a critical component of the MiDAC complex, which includes histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and the protein DNTTIP1. This complex plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation by targeting multiple nucleosomes simultaneously, indicating a highly processive deacetylase function (Turnbull2020The). MIDEAS is involved in the assembly of the MiDAC complex, mediating dimerization through its ELM2 domain and tetramerization through its SANT domain, which is crucial for the complex's structure and function (Turnbull2020The; Itoh2015Structural).

In healthy human cells, MIDEAS is expressed throughout the cell cycle and is essential for proper chromosome alignment during mitosis. Its depletion leads to increased chromosome misalignment, highlighting its role in maintaining chromosomal stability (Turnbull2020The). The MiDAC complex, through MIDEAS, also plays a role in transcriptional repression by deacetylating chromatin domains, which is necessary for decommissioning gene promoters and enhancers (Turnbull2020The). The activity of the MiDAC complex may be regulated by inositol phosphates, which interact with the SANT domain of MIDEAS, further influencing its function in chromatin modification (Itoh2015Structural).

## Interactions
MIDEAS is a component of the mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC), which includes HDAC1, HDAC2, and DNTTIP1. MIDEAS interacts with DNTTIP1 through its ELM2-SANT domain, which is crucial for the assembly and function of the MiDAC complex. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of HDAC1 or HDAC2 to chromatin, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Turnbull2020The).

MIDEAS also participates in protein-DNA interactions. It binds selectively to the TASHET region of the HIV-1 core promoter, a process that is enhanced during mitosis. This binding is part of the mechanism by which MiDAC regulates HIV transcription, with MIDEAS being essential for the recruitment of the complex to the promoter region (Wilhelm2024Mitotic).

In addition to its role in chromatin remodeling, MIDEAS is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 promoter activity. Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells have shown that MIDEAS is necessary for optimal HIV-1 promoter activity, indicating its importance in viral gene expression regulation (Wilhelm2024Mitotic). The interactions of MIDEAS with other proteins, such as NAT10, further highlight its role in transcriptional regulation (Wilhelm2024Mitotic).
