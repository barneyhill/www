# WDR12

## Overview
WDR12 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 12 protein, a member of the WD-repeat protein family characterized by its seven WD-repeat motifs. These motifs form a propeller-like structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions, essential for the protein's function in cellular processes (Nal2002Wdr12; Hölzel2005Mammalian). The WD repeat domain 12 protein is a crucial component of the PeBoW complex, which plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation by participating in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence; Hölzel2005Mammalian). The protein's involvement in the PeBoW complex underscores its importance in rRNA processing and cell cycle regulation, with implications for tumorigenesis and cardiac function (Moilanen2015WDR12; Hölzel2005Mammalian). WDR12's expression is regulated by the transcription factor c-Myc, linking it to pathways that govern cell growth and proliferation (Hölzel2005Mammalian). Its dysregulation is associated with various cancers and cardiac conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Moilanen2015WDR12; Li2020Integrative).

## Structure
The WDR12 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes seven WD-repeat motifs that form a 'propeller-like' structure, typical of the WD-repeat protein family (Nal2002Wdr12; Hölzel2005Mammalian). These motifs are located from amino acid positions 99 to 423 and are crucial for the protein's function in protein-protein interactions (Nal2002Wdr12). The N-terminal region of WDR12 shows significant similarity to the Notchless protein, suggesting a role in modulating Notch signaling (Nal2002Wdr12; Hölzel2005Mammalian).

WDR12 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) between the third and fourth WD domains, which is important for its nucleolar localization (Ahn2016Functional; Nal2002Wdr12). The protein also has several potential post-translational modification sites, including phosphorylation and N-myristoylation, which are located in exposed regions, indicating roles in protein interactions or regulation (Nal2002Wdr12).

The WDR12 protein is part of the PeBoW complex, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Hölzel2005Mammalian). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence).

## Function
WDR12 is a crucial component of the PeBoW complex, which also includes Pes1 and Bop1, and is essential for ribosome biogenesis in mammalian cells. This complex is involved in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, specifically in the processing of the 32S precursor rRNA into mature 28S rRNA (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence; Hölzel2005Mammalian). WDR12 is primarily localized in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, consistent with its role in ribosome assembly, as the nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis (Hölzel2005Mammalian).

The protein contains seven WD repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and its NH2-terminal Notchless-like domain is crucial for its function in rRNA processing (Hölzel2005Mammalian). Disruption of WDR12 function, such as through deletion of the Notchless-like domain, results in impaired rRNA processing and cell proliferation, leading to cell cycle arrest and the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Hölzel2005Mammalian).

WDR12 is upregulated by the transcription factor c-Myc, indicating its role in cell growth and proliferation (Hölzel2005Mammalian). The PeBoW complex, including WDR12, is evolutionarily conserved, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular growth processes (Hölzel2005Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR12 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In glioblastoma (GBM), WDR12 is highly expressed, and its elevated levels are associated with shorter overall survival and reduced disease-free survival. Knockdown experiments in GBM cell lines have shown that reducing WDR12 expression leads to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, suggesting its role as an oncogene in promoting tumor growth (Mi2021Suppression; Li2020Integrative).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), WDR12 is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. Its overexpression correlates with aggressive clinical features and poor prognosis, including higher serum AFP levels and advanced histologic grades (Yin2018Identification).

WDR12 is also associated with cardiac conditions. It is upregulated in failing hearts and linked to the deterioration of cardiac function, particularly in the context of myocardial infarction and cardiac overload. Overexpression of WDR12 in rat hearts has been shown to impair left ventricular function, suggesting its role in cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (Moilanen2015WDR12).

Additionally, WDR12 is overexpressed in various other tumors, including bladder, breast, and lung cancers, and is linked to poor survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Eid2023Integrative).

## Interactions
WDR12 is a component of the PeBoW complex, which includes Pes1 and Bop1, and is essential for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Within this complex, WDR12 interacts directly with Bop1 and Pes1, forming a stable core complex that is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Hölzel2005Mammalian). Bop1 acts as a mediator for the interaction between Pes1 and WDR12, as WDR12 and Pes1 cannot coimmunoprecipitate in the absence of Bop1, indicating that Bop1 is essential for their interaction (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence).

WDR12 is also involved in the formation of subcomplexes. Overexpression of Bop1 leads to the formation of a Bop1/WDR12 subcomplex, which is found in the cytoplasmic fraction, while a Bop1/Pes1 subcomplex is located in the nuclear fraction (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence). The stability of WDR12 is dependent on its association with Bop1 and Pes1, as its levels decrease significantly in the absence of these proteins (Rohrmoser2007Interdependence).

In addition to its role in ribosome biogenesis, WDR12 has been implicated in cancer cell signaling. It interacts with the Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signaling pathway, facilitating the activation of this network, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Yin2018Identification).
