# LDHB

## Overview
Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) is a gene that encodes the lactate dehydrogenase B protein, a critical enzyme involved in the metabolic conversion of lactate to pyruvate. This enzyme is categorized as an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase, playing a pivotal role in cellular respiration and energy production, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands such as the heart and muscles (Schueren2014Peroxisomal). The LDHB protein functions primarily in the cytoplasm, facilitating the balance between anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Additionally, a fraction of LDHB undergoes translational readthrough, resulting in a peroxisomal form that participates in redox processes within peroxisomes (Schueren2014Peroxisomal). LDHB's interactions with other proteins, such as SIRT5, influence various cellular processes, including autophagy and tumorigenesis (Shi2018SIRT5‐mediated). Alterations in LDHB expression have been implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Deng2022Targeting).

## Structure
Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. The primary structure of LDHB consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of LDHB is a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and disulfide bridges. LDHB functions as a tetramer, representing its quaternary structure, and can form homotetramers or heterotetramers with LDHA (Damavandi2023A).

LDHB is known to have specific domains and prominent folds that are essential for its enzymatic activity. The enzyme is an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase, which highlights its role in metabolic processes (Vlasiou2023Targeting). Common post-translational modifications of LDHB include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The enzyme's structure allows it to interact with various substrates and inhibitors, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases such as cancer (Vlasiou2023Targeting; Shibata2021Identification).

## Function
The LDHB gene encodes the lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) subunit, which is a component of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This enzyme plays a crucial role in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, a key step in cellular respiration and energy production, particularly in tissues with high metabolic demands such as the heart and muscles (Schueren2014Peroxisomal). LDHB is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain the balance between anaerobic and aerobic metabolism by facilitating the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate (Schueren2014Peroxisomal).

In addition to its cytosolic functions, a small fraction of LDHB undergoes translational readthrough, resulting in an extended form known as LDHBx. This form contains a hidden peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1), allowing it to localize to peroxisomes. Within peroxisomes, LDHBx is involved in redox processes, potentially contributing to the regeneration of NAD+ from NADH during fatty acid β-oxidation (Schueren2014Peroxisomal). This localization suggests a role for LDHB in coordinating redox balance between the cytosol and peroxisomes, which is essential for efficient cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Schueren2014Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LDHB gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic cancer, elevated LDHB expression is associated with poor overall survival and is identified as a regulator of telomerase activity, which is crucial for maintaining telomere length and preventing cancer cell senescence (Wang2022Lactate). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LDHB is essential for maintaining oxidative phosphorylation in tumor-initiating cells. Silencing LDHB leads to mitochondrial DNA damage and reduced tumorigenesis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Deng2022Targeting). 

In colorectal cancer, the deacetylation of LDHB by SIRT5 promotes autophagy and tumorigenesis, with low acetylation levels correlating with poor prognosis (Shi2018SIRT5‐mediated). In hepatocellular carcinoma, decreased LDHB expression due to promoter hypermethylation is linked to poor prognosis, highlighting its role in immune regulation pathways (Zhang2024Epigenetic). 

LDHB expression also varies in liver cancer, where a low LDHB/LDHA ratio is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (Hong2019Lactic). These findings underscore the complex role of LDHB in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LDHB (lactate dehydrogenase B) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It forms tetrameric complexes with LDHA, creating different isoenzymes that play a role in metabolic pathways (Schueren2014Peroxisomal). LDHB interacts with SIRT5, a sirtuin protein, which deacetylates LDHB at lysine-329. This interaction enhances LDHB's enzymatic activity, promoting autophagy and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (Shi2018SIRT5‐mediated). 

In the context of viral infections, LDHB interacts with the non-structural protein NS3 of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV). This interaction is significant for the virus's replication and immune evasion strategies. LDHB inhibition induces mitophagy, which facilitates CSFV infection by altering mitochondrial dynamics and inhibiting NFKB signaling, a crucial pathway for innate immunity (Fan2020LDHB). 

LDHB also plays a role in apoptosis and autophagy in tumor cells. Knocking down LDHB enhances taxol-induced apoptosis, which can be reversed by reintroducing LDHB. This suggests a regulatory role in apoptosis through interactions with apoptotic proteins (Urbańska2019Unappreciated).
