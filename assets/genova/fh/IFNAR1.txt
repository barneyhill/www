# IFNAR1

## Overview
The IFNAR1 gene encodes the interferon alpha and beta receptor subunit 1, a critical component of the type I interferon receptor complex. This transmembrane receptor is integral to the immune response, mediating the effects of type I interferons, including IFN-α and IFN-β. The IFNAR1 protein, in conjunction with IFNAR2, facilitates the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal for antiviral defense, tumor surveillance, and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity (Platanias2005Mechanisms; Piehler2012Structural). Structurally, IFNAR1 is characterized by its extracellular fibronectin type III-like subdomains, which are essential for ligand binding and receptor activation (Piehler2012Structural; CajeanFeroldi2004Identification). Clinically, mutations in IFNAR1 can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, underscoring its importance in maintaining effective antiviral defenses (Huynh2024A; Abolhassani2022Inherited).

## Structure
The IFNAR1 protein is a transmembrane component of the type I interferon receptor complex, characterized by its extracellular domain composed of four fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like subdomains, labeled SD1 through SD4 (Piehler2012Structural; CajeanFeroldi2004Identification). These subdomains are organized into two domains of approximately 200 amino acids each, with each FNIII subdomain containing seven β-strands distributed in two sheets (CajeanFeroldi2004Identification). The primary structure includes specific residues critical for ligand binding, such as residues 62 FSSLKLNVY 70 in the S5-S6 loop of the N-terminal subdomain and tryptophan-129 in the second subdomain (CajeanFeroldi2004Identification).

The tertiary structure of IFNAR1 involves the formation of a heterotrimeric receptor-ligand complex with IFNAR2 and the IFN ligand, where the IFNAR1-IFN interface buries approximately 2200 Å² of surface area (Piehler2012Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by the formation of a ternary productive complex with IFNAR2 and IFN, leading to signal transduction (CajeanFeroldi2004Identification). The D4 domain, which is membrane-proximal, is attached to D3 by a flexible linker, allowing it to adopt multiple conformations (Walter2020The). The mechanistic role of the D4 domain in receptor activation remains unclear (Walter2020The).

## Function
The human gene IFNAR1 encodes a subunit of the type I interferon receptor, which is crucial for mediating the effects of type I interferons (IFNs) such as IFN-α and IFN-β. This receptor is composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, and is involved in the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Upon binding of type I IFNs, the receptor undergoes a ligand-dependent rearrangement and dimerization, leading to the activation of associated Janus kinases (JAKs), specifically TYK2 and JAK1. This activation results in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, forming the STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex known as ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription (Platanias2005Mechanisms; Piehler2012Structural).

IFNAR1 is involved in various immune responses, including antiviral activities, tumor surveillance, and the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. It plays a role in promoting B-cell survival, enhancing humoral immunity, and regulating natural killer cell function. In the central nervous system, IFNAR1 is vital for viral immunity and protection from autoimmune diseases (de2012The). The receptor's activity is regulated through mechanisms such as ubiquitination and endocytosis, which control its availability and sensitivity to IFNs (Qian2011Pathogen; Piehler2012Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFNAR1 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly in the context of immune system function. Biallelic damaging variants in IFNAR1 are associated with an inborn error of immunity, resulting in increased susceptibility to severe diseases from live attenuated viruses, such as those in the measles-mumps-rubella/varicella (MMR/V) or yellow fever vaccines, as well as natural infections with viruses like influenza, herpes simplex, and SARS-CoV-2 (Huynh2024A). Patients with IFNAR1 deficiency may experience severe adverse reactions to live vaccines, including measles and yellow fever, due to impaired type I interferon signaling, which is crucial for antiviral immunity (Hernandez2019Inherited).

In the context of COVID-19, IFNAR1 deficiency has been linked to severe pneumonia and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). This deficiency impairs the type I interferon response, which is essential for controlling viral replication and preventing severe disease (Abolhassani2022Inherited; Khanmohammadi2021A). The deficiency can also lead to severe viral infections, such as herpes simplex encephalitis, and adverse reactions to other viral infections (Khanmohammadi2021A). These findings underscore the critical role of IFNAR1 in maintaining effective antiviral defenses and highlight the potential for severe clinical outcomes when this gene is mutated.

## Interactions
The IFNAR1 protein, a subunit of the type I interferon receptor, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, facilitating signal transduction. It interacts with protein tyrosine kinases from the Janus kinase family, specifically Tyk2, which associates with the intracytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1. This interaction is essential for the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Abramovich1997A). IFNAR1 also binds to the transcription factor Stat2 at a site containing phosphotyrosine Y466, which is crucial for forming the interferon-induced ISGF3 transcription complex. Stat3 is another transcription factor that interacts with IFNAR1, particularly upon IFN-β treatment (Abramovich1997A).

The protein-arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, also known as IR1B4, binds to the intracytoplasmic domain of IFNAR1. This interaction suggests a role for PRMT1 in the regulation of interferon action, potentially affecting the methylation of RNA-binding proteins involved in mRNA processing (Abramovich1997A). IFNAR1 is also involved in the formation of a ternary complex with IFNAR2 and interferons, which is stabilized by interactions with Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases. These kinases phosphorylate each other and the receptor's cytoplasmic domains, facilitating signal transduction (Schreiber2015The).
