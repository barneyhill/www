# NTAQ1

## Overview
NTAQ1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-terminal glutamine amidase 1, which is a crucial component of the Arg/N-end rule pathway, a subset of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. This enzyme is classified as an amidase due to its role in deamidating N-terminal glutamine residues, converting them into glutamate, which serves as a secondary destabilizing residue necessary for tagging proteins for degradation (Cantor2011Expression; Park2014Crystal). The activity of N-terminal glutamine amidase 1 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein stability and turnover, impacting processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and meiosis (Yoshida2024A). The enzyme's function is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its importance in normal cellular and organismal functions (Varshavsky2011The). Defects in the NTAQ1 gene can lead to severe neurological phenotypes, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (Yoshida2024A).

## Structure


## Function
The NTAQ1 gene encodes the enzyme N-terminal glutamine amidohydrolase 1, which plays a critical role in the Arg/N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. This pathway is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where the half-life of a protein is determined by its N-terminal residue. NTAQ1 specifically deamidates N-terminal glutamine residues, converting them into glutamate, which is a secondary destabilizing residue. This conversion is essential for tagging proteins for degradation, facilitating their recognition and processing by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Cantor2011Expression; Park2014Crystal).

NTAQ1 is involved in regulating protein stability and turnover, impacting various cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and meiosis. It is crucial for the degradation of misfolded proteins and the regulation of cellular homeostasis (Yoshida2024A; Park2014Crystal). The enzyme's activity is linked to physiological processes, including brain development, as defects in NTAQ1 can lead to severe brain function phenotypes (Yoshida2024A). NTAQ1's function is evolutionarily conserved across various species, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Varshavsky2011The).

## Clinical Significance
The NTAQ1 gene, encoding N-terminal glutamine amidase 1, has been implicated in several neurological conditions due to its role in the Arg/N-end rule protein degradation pathway. Genetic defects in NTAQ1 are associated with severe brain function phenotypes, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Yoshida2024A). In Drosophila, a mutation in the NTAQ1 gene is linked to long-term memory defects, suggesting a broader role in neurological processes (Yoshida2024A). 

In humans, alterations in NTAQ1 expression levels can significantly impact protein degradation pathways, potentially affecting cellular proteostasis and contributing to disease states (Yoshida2024A). The gene's interaction with other proteins, such as ATE1, is crucial for regulating the degradation of specific substrates, and disruptions in these interactions may lead to pathological conditions (Yoshida2024A).

Additionally, a study using proteogenomics identified a genetic variant in NTAQ1, rs13258747, which affects testosterone levels, indicating a potential link to endocrine disorders (Kuliesius2024Efficient). While direct clinical data on NTAQ1 mutations in humans are limited, these findings suggest that NTAQ1 may play a role in various diseases, particularly those involving neurological and hormonal regulation.

## Interactions
NTAQ1, also known as N-terminal glutamine amidase 1, is involved in the Arg/N-end rule protein degradation pathway. It plays a role in the deamidation of N-terminal glutamine residues, converting them into glutamic acid, which is crucial for subsequent protein degradation steps (Wang2009GlutamineSpecific). NTAQ1 is hypothesized to interact with ATE1, another component of the N-end rule pathway, although direct interactions have not been observed. Computational predictions suggest potential association points between NTAQ1 and ATE1, particularly involving residues 151-166 in the outer loop of NTAQ1 (Yoshida2024A).

The interaction between NTAQ1 and ATE1 is thought to be important for the efficient transfer of arginine to substrate proteins, a necessary step for their degradation. Overexpression of NTAQ1 has been shown to suppress the degradation of specific substrates, such as Q-YFP-FLAG, by reducing their polyubiquitination, indicating a regulatory role in the pathway (Yoshida2024A). The structural analysis of NTAQ1 reveals a catalytic triad (Cys28, His81, Asp97) that is essential for its amidase activity, and this structure is conserved across different organisms (Wang2009GlutamineSpecific; Park2014Crystal).
