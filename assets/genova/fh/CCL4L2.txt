# CCL4L2

## Overview
CCL4L2 is a gene that encodes the protein C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 like 2, which is part of the chemokine superfamily. This family of proteins is integral to the immune system, primarily involved in the regulation of leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory responses. The CCL4L2 protein is similar to CCL4, another chemokine, but differs due to a mutation at the intron-exon boundary that results in aberrant splicing and the production of multiple mRNA variants. The most common variant of CCL4L2 lacks five amino acids, which may influence its ability to form aggregates or bind to glycosaminoglycans, potentially affecting its chemokine function (Colobran2010Copy). The gene is also notable for its copy number variations, which have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases, including viral infections and autoimmune disorders (Colobran2010Copy). Understanding the genetic and functional nuances of CCL4L2 is essential for elucidating its role in immune regulation and its implications in disease pathogenesis.

## Function
CCL4L2 is a gene that encodes a protein similar to CCL4, a chemokine involved in immune responses. The CCL4L2 protein is part of the chemokine superfamily, which plays a crucial role in regulating leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory responses. Chemokines like CCL4L2 are small cytokines that guide the movement of immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury by binding to specific receptors on target cells, primarily in the extracellular space (Blanchet2012Touch).

CCL4L2 shares identical coding sequences with CCL4L1, but a mutation at the intron-exon boundary in CCL4L2 leads to aberrant splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA variants. The most abundant variant produces a protein lacking five amino acids, which may affect its ability to form aggregates or heterodimers and reduce its binding capacity to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These amino acids are important for chemokine function, including self-association and GAG binding, which are critical for directing leukocyte trafficking (Colobran2010Copy).

The functional consequences of these differences in CCL4L2 are not fully understood, but they suggest potential impacts on immune regulation and chemokine activity, particularly in the context of inflammatory and immune responses (Colobran2010Copy).

## Clinical Significance
CCL4L2 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in immune response regulation. Mutations in CCL4L2, particularly at the intron-exon boundary, lead to aberrant splicing and the production of multiple mRNA variants. The most abundant variant lacks five amino acids, potentially affecting its ability to form aggregates or bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which may alter its chemokine function (Colobran2010Copy). These alterations in CCL4L2 expression or splicing can influence inflammatory processes and immune system regulation, contributing to conditions such as autoimmune diseases and infections (Colobran2010Copy).

The gene's copy number variations (CNVs) are also significant, as they are associated with disease susceptibility. For instance, CNVs in the CCL3L-CCL4L region, which includes CCL4L2, have been linked to viral infections and autoimmune diseases (Colobran2010Copy). The complexity of CNVs in this region, including smaller CNVs within larger ones, necessitates further research to understand their phenotypic impact (Colobran2010Copy). Understanding these genetic variations is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving disease management strategies.
