# GYG2

## Overview
The GYG2 gene encodes glycogenin-2, a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in glycogen biosynthesis. Glycogenin-2 is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in the initiation of glycogen synthesis by self-glucosylating to form a primer for glycogen synthase, which then extends the glycogen chain. This protein is a member of the glycosyltransferase family 8 and features a glycosyltransferase A (GT-A) fold, essential for its enzymatic activity (Mu1997Glycogenin2; Marr2022Mechanism). Glycogenin-2 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and forms oligomers, likely dimers, which are crucial for its function (Mu1998Characterization). The gene's mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Leigh syndrome and late-onset Pompe disease, underscoring its importance in human health (Imagawa2013A; De2023Distribution).

## Structure
The GYG2 gene encodes glycogenin-2, a protein involved in glycogen biosynthesis. Glycogenin-2 is a member of the glycosyltransferase family 8 and contains a glycosyltransferase A (GT-A) fold with a Rossmann fold domain at the N-terminus, which is essential for binding the glucose donor uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-G) (Marr2022Mechanism). The C-terminus of glycogenin-2 has a conserved region of approximately 34 residues, which serves as the minimal targeting region for binding glycogen synthase (GS) (Marr2022Mechanism).

Glycogenin-2 exists in multiple isoforms, including glycogenin-2α, -β, and -γ, which are generated through alternative splicing at the NH2 terminus (Mu1998Characterization). These isoforms have predicted molecular weights of 55,150, 51,841, and 50,995, respectively (Mu1997Glycogenin2). The protein is predominantly expressed in the liver, with some expression in the heart and pancreas (Mu1998Characterization).

The quaternary structure of glycogenin-2 suggests it forms oligomers, likely dimers, and its self-glucosylation involves modification of one subunit by another (Mu1998Characterization). The protein's interaction with glycogenin-1 may enhance its glucosylation activity, potentially forming stable complexes as homo- or heterodimers (Mu1998Characterization).

## Function
The GYG2 gene encodes glycogenin-2, a protein that plays a critical role in the initiation of glycogen biosynthesis in human cells. Glycogenin-2 is a self-glucosylating protein, meaning it can add glucose units to itself, which is a crucial step in forming an oligosaccharide primer for glycogen synthase to elongate the glycogen chain (Mu1997Glycogenin2; Mu1998Characterization). This process is essential for the synthesis of glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose that serves as a carbohydrate reserve, primarily in the liver (Zhai2000Structure).

Glycogenin-2 is most prominently expressed in the liver, with lesser expression in the heart and pancreas, indicating its significant role in liver glycogen metabolism (Mu1997Glycogenin2; Zhai2001Do). The protein's self-glucosylation activity is dependent on divalent metal ions, with Mn2+ being the most effective (Mu1997Glycogenin2). Glycogenin-2 can also transfer glucose to small molecule acceptors, although its transglucosylation activity is less than that of glycogenin-1 (Mu1997Glycogenin2).

The protein is covalently associated with glycogen in human liver tissue, highlighting its role in glycogen storage (Mu1998Characterization). Glycogenin-2's activity is crucial for energy storage and metabolism, particularly in liver cells, where it may have distinct regulatory properties compared to glycogenin-1 (Zhai2001Do).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GYG2 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A hemizygous missense mutation, c.665G>C (p.W222S), in the GYG2 gene has been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder. This mutation was identified in two siblings with Leigh syndrome, suggesting a potential link between GYG2 abnormalities and the disease. The mutation is thought to destabilize the protein structure, impairing its function and leading to the clinical symptoms observed in the patients, such as neurological regression and basal ganglia lesions (Imagawa2013A).

In addition to Leigh syndrome, the GYG2 gene has been studied in the context of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). Variants in GYG2, among other genes involved in glycogen metabolism, have been found with a higher incidence in LOPD patients compared to the general population. These variants may influence the clinical presentation of the disease, although no single variant has been identified as a strong phenotypic modifier (De2023Distribution).

A large deletion spanning the GYG2 gene has also been linked to the Xgnull phenotype, which affects the production of anti-Xga antibodies, highlighting the gene's involvement in other genetic conditions (Lee2019A).

## Interactions
GYG2, also known as glycogenin 2, is involved in glycogen biosynthesis and interacts with glycogen synthase (GS) to facilitate this process. The interaction between GYG2 and GS is crucial for glycogen synthesis, as GYG2 acts as a primer by autoglucosylating itself and then extending the glucose chain. This interaction is mediated by a conserved region near the COOH terminus of GYG2, characterized by the sequence -W-E-X-X-X-X-D-Y-M-G-X-F-, which is important for binding to glycogen synthase (Zhai2000Structure).

The structural analysis of the GS-GYG2 complex reveals that GYG2 dimers interact with a GS tetramer, forming a 4:4 stoichiometry. This interaction involves hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, particularly between specific alpha helices of GS and GYG2. The phosphorylation state of GS plays a significant role in its activity, with phosphorylation leading to an inactive state. Dephosphorylation or the presence of glucose-6-phosphate can activate GS, highlighting the regulatory nature of its interaction with GYG2 (Marr2022Mechanism).

Disruptions in the interaction between GYG2 and GS can lead to metabolic disorders, such as muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, underscoring the importance of this interaction in maintaining normal glycogen metabolism (Marr2022Mechanism).
