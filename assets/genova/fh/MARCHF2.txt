# MARCHF2

## Overview
MARCHF2, also known as MARCH2, is a gene that encodes the membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 2 protein, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the regulation of protein trafficking and degradation, primarily within the endosomal and lysosomal membranes. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, MARCHF2 plays a critical role in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover. The protein's activity is essential for various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. Dysregulation of MARCHF2 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Ito2024MARCH2; Alexander2022Identification).

## Function
MARCHF2, also known as MARCH-II, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in regulating protein trafficking and degradation in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the endosomal and lysosomal membranes, where it influences the trafficking of proteins between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (Alexander2022Identification). MARCHF2 functions as a molecular bridge with ubiquitin ligase activity, tagging proteins for degradation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein regulation (Alexander2022Identification).

The ubiquitination process mediated by MARCHF2 is essential for controlling protein turnover, ensuring that damaged or unnecessary proteins are efficiently degraded. This activity is vital for various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Alexander2022Identification). MARCHF2's role in these processes highlights its importance in the regulation of cellular functions and its potential impact on organismal health. Variations in the MARCHF2 gene may lead to deleterious effects on protein function, which could have implications for motor neuron survival and other cellular processes (Alexander2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MARCHF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, MARCHF2, also known as MARCH2, plays a significant role in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Overexpression of MARCH2 leads to the degradation of SNAIL, a transcription factor involved in EMT, thereby suppressing metastasis and improving prognosis in breast cancer patients (Ito2024MARCH2). Conversely, in colon cancer, downregulation of MARCH2 has been associated with inhibited tumor growth, indicating a context-specific function (Ito2024MARCH2).

In neurodegenerative diseases, MARCHF2 has been identified as having potential regulatory functions that could affect motor neuron survival. It is suggested to be involved in cellular trafficking and ubiquitin ligase activity, which may be relevant to conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Alexander2022Identification).

Additionally, MARCHF2 is involved in the regulation of immune signaling and immunoregulatory molecules, which could impact tumor growth and metastasis in the context of immunocompetence (Ito2024MARCH2). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
MARCHF2, also known as MARCH2, is a membrane-associated RING-CH-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions. It is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. MARCH2 interacts with the Golgi-localized CFTR-associated ligand (CAL) and syntaxin 6 (STX6) to form a complex that promotes the lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR. This interaction is dependent on the PDZ motif of CFTR, and silencing CAL or MARCH2 inhibits CFTR degradation, indicating their crucial roles in this process (Cheng2013Ubiquitination).

MARCH2 also interacts with the SNAIL protein, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It acts as a novel E3 ligase for SNAIL, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which suppresses metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This interaction is regulated by PTK6 kinase activity, and the RING domain of MARCH2 is essential for SNAIL ubiquitination (Ito2024MARCH2).

Additionally, MARCH2 is involved in vesicle trafficking through its interaction with STX6 and has been reported to regulate the surface expression of various receptors, including the IL6 receptor and integrin α4β1 (Ito2024MARCH2).
