# TAF11L7

## Overview
TAF11L7 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 7, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex. TAF11L7 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that are essential for the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II. The protein's function is integral to the modulation of gene expression, influencing various cellular processes and pathways. Understanding the role of TAF11L7 and its encoded protein is significant for elucidating the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and its implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
