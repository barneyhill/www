# MICALL1

## Overview
MICALL1 is a gene that encodes the MICAL-like 1 protein, which is a crucial component in cellular processes related to endocytic recycling. The MICAL-like 1 protein functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the interaction and coordination of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rab35, Arf6, and Rab8a, which are essential for the recycling of cell surface receptors and the biogenesis of recycling endosome tubules (Giridharan2013Cooperation; Rahajeng2011MICAL‐L1). This protein is involved in the regulation of receptor trafficking through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, MICALL1 is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, implicating it in the DNA damage response and potentially in tumorigenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer (Takahashi2017Regulation). The interactions and functions of MICAL-like 1 underscore its importance in cellular growth, response mechanisms, and its potential clinical significance in cancer biology.

## Function
MICAL-L1 is a key protein involved in the regulation of receptor trafficking through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) in human cells. It functions as a scaffold or functional hub, connecting several small GTP-binding proteins, including Rab35, Arf6, and Rab8a, to facilitate the recycling of cell surface receptors. MICAL-L1 is crucial for the localization of these proteins to tubular endosomes, which are essential for receptor recycling pathways (Rahajeng2011MICAL‐L1).

MICAL-L1 interacts with Rab35, which regulates its localization and function. The activation of Rab35 leads to the inactivation of Arf6, affecting MICAL-L1's localization to tubular endosomes. This interaction is vital for the recruitment of Rab8a to these structures, highlighting MICAL-L1's role in coordinating the activities of various GTP-binding proteins (Rahajeng2011MICAL‐L1).

In addition to its role in receptor recycling, MICAL-L1 is involved in the biogenesis of recycling endosome tubules. It interacts with Synd2 and phosphatidic acid (PA) to stabilize its localization on membranes, facilitating tubule formation. This process is essential for sorting and recycling internalized cargo and lipids back to the plasma membrane, contributing to efficient endocytic recycling (Giridharan2013Cooperation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MICALL1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, particularly in the context of p53 mutations. The p53-MICALL1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating tubular recycling endosome biogenesis, and disruptions in this pathway can contribute to cancer progression. In colorectal cancer tissues with p53 mutations, MICALL1 expression is significantly reduced, which may affect endosomal recycling processes and contribute to tumor development (Takahashi2017Regulation).

MICALL1 is a downstream target of p53, and its expression is induced by DNA damage and p53 activation. This suggests that MICALL1 is involved in the p53-mediated DNA damage response, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Takahashi2017Regulation). The interaction between MICALL1 and CD2AP is also significant in the context of DNA damage, as both proteins show altered localization to tubular recycling endosomes in response to such stress. This interaction is important for suppressing cell proliferation, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role for MICALL1 (Takahashi2017Regulation).

Overall, changes in MICALL1 expression and its interactions due to p53 mutations may have clinical significance in colorectal cancer, potentially affecting prognosis and treatment strategies (Takahashi2017Regulation).

## Interactions
MICALL1 (MICAL-like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes. It is identified as a downstream target of the p53 protein, with p53 binding specifically to the p53 binding sequence in the 5' flanking region of the MICALL1 gene (Takahashi2017Regulation). MICALL1 interacts with CD2AP, a protein involved in cellular signaling and structure, as confirmed by western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T and HCT116 cells (Takahashi2017Regulation). This interaction is significant in the regulation of tubular recycling endosomes (TREs) and the cellular response to DNA damage, where MICALL1, along with CD2AP and RAB8A, shows altered localization to TREs after DNA damage (Takahashi2017Regulation).

MICALL1 also plays a role in endocytic recycling, interacting with small GTP-binding proteins such as Rab35 and Arf6. It forms a complex with Arf6, which is crucial for its recruitment to tubular endosomes, and this interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Rahajeng2011MICAL‐L1). These interactions highlight MICALL1's role as a central hub in regulating receptor recycling pathways and its involvement in cellular growth and response mechanisms.
