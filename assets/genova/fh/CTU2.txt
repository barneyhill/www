# CTU2

## Overview
The CTU2 gene encodes the cytosolic thiouridylase subunit 2 protein, which is a crucial component of a conserved enzymatic complex involved in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. This protein functions primarily in the cytoplasm, where it collaborates with CTU1 to facilitate the 2-thiolation of the wobble uridine (U34) in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. This modification is essential for enhancing codon-anticodon interactions, thereby ensuring the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis. The CTU2 protein is categorized as a thiouridylase, playing a significant role in maintaining genome integrity and supporting cellular growth, particularly under stress conditions. Disruptions in CTU2 function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including DREAM-PL syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Dewez2008The; Xue2024Activation; Shaheen2019Biallelic).

## Function
The CTU2 gene encodes a protein that is part of a highly conserved complex involved in the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, CTU2, in conjunction with CTU1, is responsible for the 2-thiolation of the wobble uridine (U34) in the anticodon loop of tRNAs. This modification is crucial for maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis by enhancing codon-anticodon interactions and preventing misreading of near-cognate codons (Dewez2008The; Shaheen2019Biallelic).

In healthy human cells, CTU2 plays a critical role in ensuring accurate protein translation, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and function. The thiolation process facilitated by CTU2 is important for maintaining genome integrity and supporting cellular growth, particularly under nutritionally challenging conditions (Xue2024Activation). The CTU2 protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the proper decoding of mRNA by the ribosome, thus safeguarding against translation defects that could lead to genome instability (Dewez2008The).

Overall, CTU2's function in tRNA modification is vital for the accurate and efficient synthesis of proteins, which is fundamental to the maintenance of normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CTU2 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CTU2 is upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes. Its elevated expression promotes tumor cell proliferation, lipogenesis, and tumor progression, making it a potential therapeutic target in HCC treatment, especially in combination with liver X receptor (LXR) agonists (Xue2024Activation).

CTU2 mutations are also implicated in a rare congenital disorder known as DREAM-PL syndrome, characterized by dysmorphic facies, renal agenesis, ambiguous genitalia, microcephaly, polydactyly, and lissencephaly. This syndrome results from biallelic variants in CTU2, which impair the thiolation of tRNA wobble uridine, crucial for accurate protein synthesis. The mutations lead to decreased levels of thiolated tRNA, affecting translational efficiency and fidelity, and contributing to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Shaheen2016The; Shaheen2019Biallelic).

In addition, CTU2 is involved in maintaining genome integrity through its role in tRNA thiolation. Disruption of the CTU1-CTU2 complex can lead to translation errors, genome instability, and increased mutagenesis, which are associated with cancer development (Dewez2008The).

## Interactions
The CTU2 protein, or cytosolic thiouridylase subunit 2, is known to interact with CTU1 to form a complex essential for the thiolation of tRNA at the wobble uridine position (U34). This interaction is crucial for proper codon-anticodon interactions and protein synthesis. The CTU1-CTU2 complex is highly conserved across species, including plants, yeast, and humans, and is responsible for the thiolation of tRNAs such as those for lysine, glutamine, and glutamate (Dewez2008The; Shaheen2019Biallelic).

In Arabidopsis thaliana, CTU2 interacts with the CTU1 homolog ROL5, which is essential for tRNA thiolation. This interaction was confirmed through yeast-two-hybrid experiments, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Philipp2014The). The CTU1-CTU2 complex is also involved in maintaining genome integrity by preventing translation defects that can lead to genome instability (Dewez2008The).

In humans, disruptions in the CTU1/CTU2 complex have been linked to DREAM-PL syndrome, characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. This highlights the critical role of CTU2 in maintaining proper tRNA function and protein synthesis (Shaheen2019Biallelic).
