# PGAM5

## Overview
PGAM5 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial serine/threonine protein phosphatase known as PGAM family member 5. This protein is a member of the phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) family and is characterized by its unique phosphatase activity, which is specific for serine/threonine residues. Unlike typical phosphotransferases, PGAM5 lacks activity for small metabolites and instead plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. It is anchored to the mitochondrial membrane and is involved in processes such as mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, and the cellular response to oxidative stress. PGAM5's interactions with various proteins, including DRP1, FUNDC1, and KEAP1, underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Its involvement in apoptosis regulation and response to cellular stress further highlights its significance in cellular physiology (Yu2020Mitochondrial; Ruiz2019Functional; Chaikuad2017Structures).

## Structure
PGAM5 is a mitochondrial protein phosphatase that forms part of the phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) branch of the histidine acid phosphatase superfamily. It is characterized by a phosphatase domain with a phosphoglycerate mutase-like fold, featuring a three-layer sandwich topology with a six-stranded beta sheet flanked by alpha helices (Chaikuad2017Structures). The protein contains a canonical RHGE catalytic motif, although it lacks typical phosphotransferase or phosphohydrolase activity for small metabolites, instead displaying phosphatase activity specific for serine/threonine residues (Chaikuad2017Structures).

PGAM5 forms stable dimers and can assemble into a fully active dodecameric form, which is crucial for its catalytic activation (Ruiz2019Functional; Chaikuad2017Structures). The dodecameric assembly is a ring-shaped structure with a central six-fold symmetry axis, essential for its function (Ruiz2019Functional). The N-terminal region contains a conserved WDXNWD motif, which is important for phosphatase activity and multimeric assembly (Chaikuad2017Structures).

PGAM5 is anchored to the mitochondrial membrane via a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and contains a linker domain with a multimerization motif (MM) that promotes higher-order oligomerization (Ruiz2019Functional). The protein's ability to form filaments composed of dodecameric rings adds complexity to its signaling roles (Ruiz2019Functional).

## Function
PGAM5 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cellular homeostasis. It is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria and is involved in several key cellular processes. PGAM5 modulates mitochondrial fission by dephosphorylating DRP1, a protein essential for mitochondrial division, thereby influencing mitochondrial morphology and turnover (Yu2020Mitochondrial). It also interacts with FUNDC1 to regulate mitophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria, thus maintaining mitochondrial quality and function (Lu2016Mitochondrial; Chen2014A).

PGAM5 forms a ternary complex with KEAP1 and NRF2, anchoring it to the mitochondria and playing a role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by modulating NRF2-dependent gene expression (Lo2008PGAM5). This interaction helps maintain cellular redox balance and protect against oxidative damage. PGAM5's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular physiology, including its role in apoptosis regulation and response to cellular stress (Ma2019Dynamic; Lo2006PGAM5). Through these mechanisms, PGAM5 contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial and cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PGAM5 expression or function have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In the context of Parkinson's disease, PGAM5 is crucial for the stabilization of PINK1, a protein involved in mitophagy. Deficiency in PGAM5 leads to impaired mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and increased oxidative stress, which contributes to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Parkinson's-like symptoms in mice (Lu2014Genetic). Although PGAM5 mutations have not been reported in human Parkinson's disease, its role in mitochondrial function suggests potential clinical significance (Lu2014Genetic).

In cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high PGAM5 expression is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. PGAM5 enhances Bcl-xL-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling, contributing to the survival of cancer cells and resistance to chemotherapy (Cheng2018High). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PGAM5 expression is higher in cancerous tissues and is linked to patient mortality, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential prognostic marker (Ng2018PGAM5). These findings highlight PGAM5 as a potential therapeutic target in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
PGAM5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds with the apoptosis regulator Bcl-XL, promoting its degradation and forming a complex with BAX and DRP1, which implicates PGAM5 in apoptosis regulation (Chaikuad2017Structures). PGAM5 also interacts with KEAP1, a substrate adaptor involved in the KEAP1-Nrf2 protein degradation pathway, and this interaction is crucial for regulating signaling pathways such as the activation of ASK1 in MAPK pathways (Chaikuad2017Structures).

PGAM5 is involved in mitochondrial quality control by stabilizing PINK1, a kinase associated with mitophagy, and interacts with the mitophagy receptor FUNDC1, facilitating its dephosphorylation (Ruiz2019Functional; Chaikuad2017Structures). It also associates with the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL necrosome in mitochondria, leading to the activation of DRP1, which is necessary for necroptosis (Chaikuad2017Structures).

In antiviral responses, PGAM5 interacts with MAVS, a key component of the RIG-I signaling pathway, influencing the TBK1/IRF3 signaling pathway and promoting IFNβ production (Yu2020PGAM5MAVS). This interaction is enhanced by intracellular poly(I:C) treatment, indicating PGAM5's role in antiviral signaling (Yu2020PGAM5MAVS).
