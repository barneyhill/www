# PRSS33

## Overview
PRSS33 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 33, which is categorized as a transmembrane serine protease. This protein is predominantly expressed in human eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses. Serine protease 33 is localized within the granule vesicles of eosinophils and is translocated to the cell surface upon degranulation, a process that occurs during immune activation (Toyama2017Human). The protein is implicated in tissue remodeling, as it has been shown to enhance the expression of extracellular matrix components in human fibroblasts, potentially through the activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) (Toyama2017Human). This suggests a role in conditions such as asthma, where airway remodeling is a characteristic feature (Toyama2017Human). Despite its significant expression in eosinophils, the precise physiological functions of PRSS33 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Toyama2017Human).

## Function
PRSS33, or serine protease 33, is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in human eosinophils, with significantly higher mRNA levels compared to other leukocyte types (Toyama2017Human). It is localized in the granule vesicles of eosinophils and is translocated to the cell surface upon degranulation, such as after GM-CSF stimulation, indicating a role in eosinophil function (Toyama2017Human). PRSS33 is not released from eosinophils upon activation, suggesting its function may be related to intracellular processes rather than extracellular activities (Toyama2017Human).

The protein is involved in tissue remodeling, as recombinant human PRSS33 has been shown to increase the expression of mRNA for extracellular matrix components like Col1A1, Col8A1, fibronectin, and versican in human fibroblasts (Toyama2017Human). This activity suggests that PRSS33 may contribute to the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, potentially through the activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), and may play a role in airway remodeling in conditions such as asthma (Toyama2017Human). Despite its significant expression, PRSS33's specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Toyama2017Human).

## Interactions
PRSS33, a serine protease, is primarily expressed in human eosinophils and is associated with granule membranes. It is not released into the culture supernatant upon eosinophil activation, suggesting a specific intracellular role (Toyama2017Human). PRSS33 is identified as a transmembrane protein that becomes present on the cell surface following degranulation, stimulated by GM-CSF (Toyama2017Human).

The study by Toyama et al. explored the effects of recombinant PRSS33 on human fibroblasts, noting increased mRNA expression of extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin. This suggests that PRSS33 may interact with fibroblasts to promote extracellular matrix remodeling, potentially through the activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) (Toyama2017Human). The interaction with PAR-2 was supported by the observation that these effects were diminished with the addition of a protease inhibitor cocktail and a PAR-2 antagonist (Toyama2017Human).

While the specific protein or nucleic acid partners of PRSS33 are not detailed, its role in extracellular matrix remodeling and potential signaling pathways through PAR-2 indicates its involvement in complex cellular interactions (Toyama2017Human).
