# KLHL31

## Overview
KLHL31 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 31, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically functioning as an adaptor protein. This protein is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and is part of the Kelch superfamily, known for its role in protein-protein interactions. Kelch-like family member 31 is involved in the regulation of muscle integrity by facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, such as Filamin-C, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle fibers. Additionally, it plays a significant role in the organization of contractile proteins into sarcomeres and modulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, which are vital for muscle development and myogenesis (AbouElhamd2015Klhl31; Papizan2017Deficiency). The gene's dysfunction is associated with congenital myopathies, highlighting its importance in muscle health and development (Papizan2017Deficiency).

## Structure


## Function
KLHL31 is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining skeletal muscle integrity and function. It is part of the Kelch superfamily and is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. KLHL31 functions as an adaptor protein in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, such as Filamin-C (FlnC), which is involved in crosslinking actin at the Z-disc. This process is essential for muscle function, as it helps maintain the structural integrity of muscle fibers and prevents the toxic accumulation of proteins that can destabilize the Z-disc and myofibrils (Papizan2017Deficiency).

KLHL31 is also involved in the organization of contractile proteins into sarcomeres and the coupling of the contractile apparatus to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is vital for muscle function (Papizan2017Deficiency). In addition, KLHL31 modulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is important for embryonic muscle development and myogenesis. It attenuates β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling, influencing somite differentiation and the balance between proliferation and differentiation in embryonic myoblasts (AbouElhamd2015Klhl31).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the KLHL31 gene have been associated with congenital myopathies, a group of muscle disorders characterized by muscle weakness and structural abnormalities. In particular, KLHL31 deficiency in mice leads to congenital myopathy, which includes symptoms such as hypotrophic fibers, Z-disc streaming, central cores, centronuclear myopathy, and late-onset sarcotubular myopathy (Papizan2017Deficiency). The loss of KLHL31 disrupts normal protein turnover at the Z-disc, resulting in the toxic accumulation of proteins and destabilization of the Z-disc and myofibrils (Papizan2017Deficiency).

KLHL31 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it recruits Filamin-C (FlnC) for degradation. In the absence of KLHL31, FlnC accumulates, leading to Z-disc instability, a condition observed in both human and mouse models of FlnC myopathies (Papizan2017Deficiency). This accumulation is linked to muscle-related issues, suggesting that KLHL31 mutations or expression alterations could contribute to congenital myopathy due to the instability of muscle structures like the Z-disc (Papizan2017Deficiency).

The study of KLHL31 in mice provides insights into its potential role in human myopathies, although further research is needed to determine if similar mutations occur in humans (Papizan2017Deficiency).

## Interactions
KLHL31 is a protein that primarily functions as a substrate adapter in Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. One of the key interactions of KLHL31 is with Filamin C (FlnC), a protein involved in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. KLHL31 binds to FlnC and promotes its polyubiquitination, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This interaction is crucial for preventing the accumulation of FlnC, which can lead to muscle defects if not properly regulated (Papizan2017Deficiency).

KLHL31 also interacts with Cullin 3 (Cul3), forming a complex that is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction was demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation assays, which showed a strong binding between myc-tagged Cul3 and 3XFlag-tagged KLHL31 in COS-7 cells (Papizan2017Deficiency). The presence of KLHL31, Cul3, and ubiquitin is necessary for the degradation of FlnC, highlighting the role of KLHL31 in protein turnover at the Z-disc of muscle cells (Papizan2017Deficiency). These interactions underscore the importance of KLHL31 in maintaining muscle structure and function.
