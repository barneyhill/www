# DMRT3

## Overview
DMRT3 is a gene that encodes the protein doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3, which is a member of the DMRT family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by the presence of a DM domain, a zinc-finger motif that facilitates its role as a transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences. The DMRT3 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression, functioning as either an activator or repressor depending on the context. It plays a significant role in various biological processes, including development and disease pathogenesis. Notably, DMRT3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers and non-cancerous conditions, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) (Priyadharshini2021Transcriptome; CasadoNavarro2022DMRT). The gene's expression and genetic alterations have been associated with clinical outcomes in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Yang2022Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DMRT3 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of cancer, DMRT3 is frequently upregulated in several types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. High expression levels of DMRT3 are associated with poor overall survival and progression-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in these cancers (Yang2022Comprehensive). Genetic alterations such as mutations, amplifications, and deletions of DMRT3 have been observed in cancers like lung cancer and esophagogastric cancer, with these alterations linked to lower overall survival rates (Yang2022Comprehensive).

In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, DMRT3 is located in a region of chromosome 9p that frequently undergoes deletion. This suggests a potential role as a tumor suppressor gene, with its deletion contributing to SCC pathogenesis (Koo2010Frequent). In non-cancerous conditions, DMRT3 is overexpressed in nasal polyp epithelial cells of patients with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), indicating its involvement in nasal polyp pathogenesis (Priyadharshini2021Transcriptome). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of DMRT3 in both oncological and non-oncological diseases.

## Interactions
DMRT3 is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily through its DM domain, a zinc-finger motif followed by an alpha-helical recognition domain. This domain enables DMRT3 to bind sequence-specific DNA motifs, allowing it to regulate transcription by either activating or repressing target genes. DMRT3 can form heterodimers on DNA, suggesting potential functional interactions through mixed complexes with other DMRT proteins (CasadoNavarro2022DMRT).

In the context of nasal polyp epithelial cells, DMRT3 is over-expressed and may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). It is hypothesized to control estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) promoter activity, indicating a regulatory interaction at the transcriptional level. DMRT3 is also associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma, where it may be involved in a regulatory circuit with transcription factors SOX2 and TP63, although the specific role of TP63 in nasal polyps remains unclear (Priyadharshini2021Transcriptome).

While specific physical interactions of DMRT3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its ability to bind ubiquitin in vitro suggests a role in protein stabilization (CasadoNavarro2022DMRT).
