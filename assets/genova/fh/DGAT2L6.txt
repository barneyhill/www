# DGAT2L6

## Overview
The DGAT2L6 gene encodes the protein diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 like 6, which is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the esterification of alcohols to form wax diesters. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid homeostasis, particularly in the sebaceous glands, where it is highly expressed. DGAT2L6 is part of a gene cluster on the X chromosome and is distinct in its preference for forming wax diesters over monoesters. The protein's activity is essential for the production of bodily secretions such as sebum and meibum, which are important for the protective and antimicrobial properties of the skin and ocular surfaces (Holmes2010Comparative; Ruggles2013Making). Disruptions in the function or expression of DGAT2L6 have been linked to various dermatologic and ophthalmologic disorders, as well as potential associations with autism spectrum disorder and epidermolysis bullosa simplex (Chen2015The; Bchetnia2011Expression).

## Function
The DGAT2L6 gene encodes a protein involved in the esterification of long-chain and short-chain alcohols, specifically in the formation of wax diesters. This process is crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis in human cells. DGAT2L6 is part of a gene cluster located on the X chromosome and is highly expressed in the sebaceous glands. Unlike other genes in its cluster, DGAT2L6 predominantly mediates the esterification of 1,2 dialcohols to form wax diesters, rather than wax monoesters (Holmes2010Comparative; Ruggles2013Making).

The activity of DGAT2L6 is significant in the production of wax diesters, which are key components of bodily secretions such as sebum and meibum. These secretions contribute to the viscosity and antimicrobial properties of the skin and ocular surfaces, playing a vital role in maintaining the barrier functions of tissues like the skin and cornea (Ruggles2013Making). The gene's expression and activity suggest its involvement in dermatologic and ophthalmologic health, as disruptions in lipid homeostasis can lead to disorders in these areas (Ruggles2013Making).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DGAT2L6 gene have been implicated in several disorders. DGAT2L6 is involved in the synthesis of wax esters, and its expression is notably high in the human sebaceous gland. Disruptions in its function or expression may contribute to dermatologic and ophthalmologic disorders due to altered lipid homeostasis (Ruggles2013Making). 

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rare inherited variants of DGAT2L6 have been identified in patients, suggesting a potential link between mutations in this gene and ASD (Chen2015The). However, a study involving a maternally inherited duplication of DGAT2L6 in a family with autism did not find it to be pathogenic, as the duplication was also present in an unaffected sibling (JiménezBarrón2015Genomewide).

In epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), altered expression of DGAT2L6 has been observed, indicating its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of this skin disorder. The study found higher expression levels of DGAT2L6 in EBS patients, although the gene is not directly associated with specific mutations causing the disease (Bchetnia2011Expression).
