# TRAPPC4

## Overview
TRAPPC4 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 4, which is a core component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complexes, specifically TRAPP II and TRAPP III. These complexes are integral to intracellular trafficking, particularly in the secretory pathway, where they facilitate the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and beyond. The TRAPPC4 protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, playing a critical role in vesicular transport and membrane trafficking processes. It is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in neuronal differentiation and autophagy, contributing to cellular homeostasis and response to nutrient deprivation. Mutations in the TRAPPC4 gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ren2021TRAPPC4; Van2019Deficiencies; Ghosh2020A).

## Function
TRAPPC4, also known as synbindin, is a core subunit of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complexes, specifically TRAPP II and TRAPP III, which are involved in intracellular trafficking and autophagy. In healthy human cells, TRAPPC4 plays a crucial role in the secretory pathway, facilitating the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently to the plasma membrane (Van2019Deficiencies; Ghosh2020A). It acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, such as Rab1, Rab11, and Rab43, which are essential for vesicular transport and membrane trafficking processes (Jenkins2020The).

TRAPPC4 is highly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in postsynaptic membrane trafficking, contributing to neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (Van2019Deficiencies). It is also implicated in the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway, which is important for cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Van2019Deficiencies). The protein's role in autophagy is particularly significant, as it is involved in the formation and sealing of autophagosomes, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and response to nutrient deprivation (Van2019Deficiencies).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC4 gene are associated with several severe neurodevelopmental disorders. A notable pathogenic variant, c.454+3A>G, leads to a condition known as NEurodevelopmental Disorder with Epilepsy, Spasticity, and Brain Atrophy (NEDESBA). This disorder is characterized by severe developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, early-onset seizures, and spastic quadriparesis. The variant causes defective splicing, resulting in exon 3 skipping and a frameshift, which likely leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA (Ghosh2020A).

The TRAPPC4 c.454+3A>G variant also results in reduced TRAPPC4 protein levels, affecting the assembly and function of the TRAPP complex, which is crucial for vesicular transport and autophagy. This disruption is linked to severe syndromic intellectual disability, characterized by early-onset seizures, profound intellectual disability, microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, spastic quadriparesis, and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (Van2019Deficiencies).

In some cases, TRAPPC4 mutations lead to a neurodegenerative syndrome with symptoms such as motor, language, and social developmental stagnation, psychomotor regression, and critical cognitive decline. Patients may also exhibit microcephaly, facial dysmorphic features, and various seizure types (Ghosh2020A).

## Interactions
TRAPPC4, a core subunit of the TRAPP complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking. It physically interacts with PD-L1 and RAB11a, facilitating the recycling of PD-L1 to the cell membrane. This interaction is significant for maintaining PD-L1 on the cell surface, which is important for immune evasion in cancer cells (Ren2021TRAPPC4). TRAPPC4 acts as a scaffold protein, colocalizing with RAB11-positive recycling endosomes, and its knockdown leads to PD-L1 degradation in lysosomes (Ren2021TRAPPC4).

TRAPPC4 is also part of the TRAPP complex, which includes subunits such as TRAPPC1, C2, C3, C5, C6, and C2L, forming a stable core. This core can interact with TRAPPC9 or C10 to form TRAPP complex II, or with TRAPPC8, C11, C12, and C13 to form TRAPP complex III (Kaur2020Recurrent). These complexes are involved in vesicle tethering and trafficking processes, including roles in the secretory pathway and autophagy (Ren2021TRAPPC4).

Additionally, TRAPPC4 interacts with the MAP kinase ERK2, influencing the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation, impacting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (Brunet2014In).
