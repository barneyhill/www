# ATF4

## Overview
ATF4, or activating transcription factor 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ATF/CREB family of basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) transcription factors. The ATF4 protein plays a pivotal role in the integrated stress response (ISR), where it regulates the expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and cellular stress responses. It functions primarily as a transcription factor, forming homodimers or heterodimers with other proteins to bind specific DNA sequences and modulate gene expression. The activity and stability of ATF4 are tightly regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions with other proteins and its degradation. ATF4 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, glaucoma, schizophrenia, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Pons2007Phosphorylationdependent; Kasetti2020ATF4; Wortel2017Surviving).

## Structure
The ATF4 protein is a member of the ATF/CREB b-ZIP family of transcription factors, characterized by a basic region and a leucine zipper domain (b-ZIP) essential for its function as a transcription factor (Pons2007Phosphorylationdependent). The primary structure of ATF4 includes a DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper motif, which facilitates dimerization, a critical aspect of its quaternary structure (Wang2019Structural). ATF4 can form homodimers or heterodimers, influencing its ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression (Wang2019Structural).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification of ATF4, particularly at serine residues 219 and 224. This modification is crucial for its interaction with the F-box protein b-TrCP, part of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which regulates ATF4 degradation (Pons2007Phosphorylationdependent). The phosphorylated form of ATF4 adopts a structured conformation, including a type b-turn, which is essential for its interaction with b-TrCP (Pons2007Phosphorylationdependent). This structural change is significant for ATF4's stability and activity, particularly in stress response pathways (Pons2007Phosphorylationdependent). The interaction with DISC1 also affects ATF4's dimerization and DNA binding, further influencing its transcriptional activity (Wang2019Structural).

## Function
ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4) is a crucial transcription factor involved in the integrated stress response (ISR) in healthy human cells. It primarily functions as a heterodimer with other transcription factors, such as those from the ATF, FOS/JUN, and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) subfamilies, to regulate gene expression by binding to DNA sequences known as cAMP responsive elements (CREs) or C/EBP-ATF response elements (CAREs) (Wortel2017Surviving). ATF4 plays a significant role in managing cellular stress responses by controlling the expression of genes involved in amino acid transport, metabolism, redox homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones, which are essential for stress relief and survival (Dey2010Both; Wortel2017Surviving).

In the context of the ISR, ATF4 is activated under stress conditions such as hypoxia, amino acid limitation, and oxidative stress. It regulates a wide range of adaptive genes that help cells endure these stress conditions, promoting cell survival through the expression of genes involved in salvage pathways (Wortel2017Surviving). ATF4 also influences autophagy, a process that can either promote survival by replenishing essential amino acids and clearing protein aggregates or induce cell death if it leads to excessive breakdown of cellular components (Wortel2017Surviving). The regulation of ATF4 involves both transcriptional and translational control, with phosphorylation of eIF2α being a key mechanism that enhances the translation of ATF4 mRNA under stress conditions (Dey2010Both).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ATF4 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, ATF4 is upregulated in tumor cells, particularly in hypoxic and nutrient-deprived regions, where it supports cell survival by regulating amino acid uptake, autophagy, and redox balance. Its persistent signaling is necessary for maintaining the transformed state of cancer cells, and its expression is linked to drug resistance, including resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin (Rzymski2009Role; Singleton2012Targeting). 

In glaucoma, ATF4 contributes to disease progression by promoting protein synthesis and increasing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) client protein load, leading to ER stress and cell death in trabecular meshwork cells. This process is associated with increased intraocular pressure and TM cell apoptosis, key features of glaucoma (Kasetti2020ATF4).

ATF4 is also associated with schizophrenia, particularly in male patients. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ATF4 gene have shown significant associations with the disorder, suggesting a sex-dependent effect on schizophrenia susceptibility (Qu2008Associations). 

In metabolic conditions, ATF4 plays a role in cholesterol metabolism. Its loss affects the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, leading to increased free cholesterol levels in liver tissues (Fusakio2016Transcription).

## Interactions
ATF4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses. One significant interaction is with the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, which regulates ATF4's stability through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. This interaction involves the serine residue 219 of ATF4 and is essential for its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The presence of βTrCP enhances ATF4 ubiquitination, while a mutant form of βTrCP decreases it, highlighting the importance of the F-box motif in βTrCP for its function (Lassot2001ATF4).

ATF4 also interacts with the Abro1 scaffold protein, which is part of the BRISC deubiquitinating enzyme complex. This interaction is crucial for the cytoprotective function of Abro1, especially during oxidative stress. Under stress conditions, Abro1 translocates to the nucleus and co-localizes with ATF4, suggesting a role in modulating the activity of the BRISC complex (Ambivero2012ATF4).

Additionally, ATF4 interacts with HDAC4, particularly under ER stress conditions. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm and involves the leucine zipper II region of ATF4. HDAC4 regulates ATF4's transcriptional activity and influences the expression of apoptosis-related genes, providing a protective effect against ER stress-induced apoptosis (Zhang2014HDAC4).
