# TSPEAR

## Overview
The TSPEAR gene encodes a protein known as thrombospondin type laminin G domain and EAR repeats, which is primarily involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is characterized by its thrombospondin type 1 repeats and laminin G-like domains, facilitating interactions within the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, thereby contributing to structural integrity and intercellular communication (Kuçi2019Molecular). TSPEAR plays a significant role in tissue development and maintenance, particularly in the dental and auditory systems, and is implicated in conditions such as ectodermal dysplasia and tooth agenesis (Bowles2021TSPEAR). Although initially thought to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss, recent studies have questioned this link, suggesting a more definitive role in ectodermal organogenesis (Bowles2021TSPEAR). Additionally, TSPEAR expression has prognostic implications in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and immune modulation (Xue2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
The TSPEAR protein is encoded by the TSPEAR gene located on chromosome 21q22.3 and is composed of 669 amino acids. It features two primary functional domains: the N-terminal thrombospondin-like laminin G domain and the C-terminal seven Epilepsy-Associated Repeats (EARs) domain (Rabie2022Confirmation). The thrombospondin-like laminin G domain is commonly found in extracellular matrix proteins and is located in exons 2-5 of the TSPEAR gene (Bowles2021TSPEAR). The EARs domain forms a seven-bladed β propeller structure, which is presumed to act as a ligand-binding domain (Rabie2022Confirmation).

The TSPEAR protein is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for hair and tooth development (Rabie2022Confirmation). The protein's structure was predicted using AlphaFold and retrieved from the Uniprot database, with a per-residue model confidence score (pLDDT) ranging from 0 to 100 (Rabie2022Confirmation). The TSPEAR protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions.

## Function
The TSPEAR gene encodes a protein involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is characterized by thrombospondin type 1 repeats and laminin G-like domains, which facilitate interactions with other cellular components. TSPEAR is primarily active in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, contributing to the structural integrity and communication between cells (Kuçi2019Molecular).

In terms of its role in cell biology, TSPEAR is implicated in tissue development and maintenance, particularly within the dental and auditory systems. It has been associated with ectodermal dysplasia and tooth agenesis, conditions that affect the development of skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands (Bowles2021TSPEAR). While initial studies suggested a potential link between TSPEAR and nonsyndromic hearing loss, subsequent research has cast doubt on this association, indicating that its role in hearing function remains unclear (Bowles2021TSPEAR).

The gene's expression in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) suggests a role in early osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis, highlighting its involvement in the differentiation potential of these cells (Kuçi2019Molecular). Despite these findings, further research is needed to fully elucidate TSPEAR's function in healthy human cells, particularly concerning its potential impact on hearing loss (Bowles2021TSPEAR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TSPEAR gene are primarily associated with ectodermal dysplasia (ED) and tooth agenesis. These conditions are characterized by abnormalities in the development of ectodermal tissues, including hair, teeth, and nails. In particular, TSPEAR variants have been linked to phenotypes such as sparse scalp hair, high anterior hairline, and dental anomalies like oligodontia and conical-shaped teeth (Rabie2022Confirmation). The gene's role in ectodermal organogenesis is highlighted by its involvement in these conditions, with specific variants being classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (Rabie2022Confirmation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TSPEAR expression levels have prognostic significance. High TSPEAR expression is associated with lower immune cell infiltration and poorer overall survival in CRC patients. It is also linked to higher tumor purity and lower immune response levels, suggesting a role in tumor progression through immune modulation (Xue2024Comprehensive). The gene's expression is upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis (Xue2024Comprehensive).

While initial studies suggested a link between TSPEAR variants and nonsyndromic hearing loss, subsequent research has cast doubt on this association, indicating a stronger connection to ectodermal dysplasia and tooth agenesis (Bowles2021TSPEAR).
