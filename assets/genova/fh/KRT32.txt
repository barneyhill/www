# KRT32

## Overview
KRT32 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 32, a type I hair keratin involved in the structural and immune functions of the skin. Keratin 32 is categorized as an intermediate filament protein, characterized by its central alpha-helical rod domain, which is essential for forming intermediate filaments that provide structural integrity to hair and epithelial cells (Shi2024Lossoffunction). The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining skin immune homeostasis by regulating keratinocyte proliferation and modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway through interactions with NEMO, a key component of this pathway (Shi2024Lossoffunction). Mutations in the KRT32 gene are associated with the skin condition pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP), highlighting its clinical significance in skin health and disease (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

## Structure
Keratin 32 (KRT32) is a type I hair keratin protein characterized by a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-alpha-helical N-terminal (head) and C-terminal (tail) domains. The rod domain is divided into Coil 1A, 1B, and 2 subdomains by linker sequences, forming the intermediate filament (IF) rod domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Shi2024Lossoffunction). These interactions are essential for the assembly of keratin into intermediate filaments, providing structural integrity to hair and epithelial cells.

The KRT32 protein structure was modeled using the AlphaFold program, and its quality was assessed with Ramachandran map calculations via the PROCHECK program (Shi2024Lossoffunction). This modeling approach helps predict the three-dimensional conformation of the protein, which is important for understanding its functional interactions.

KRT32 is involved in the regulation of skin immune homeostasis, interacting with proteins such as NEMO, a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction is facilitated by specific mutation sites on KRT32 that form hydrogen-bond interactions with NEMO, affecting the protein's stability and function (Shi2024Lossoffunction). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function.

## Function
Keratin 32 (KRT32) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in maintaining skin immune homeostasis and regulating keratinocyte proliferation. In healthy human cells, KRT32 is predominantly expressed in basal keratinocytes, where it plays a crucial role in suppressing keratinocyte cell proliferation. This suppression is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the epidermis and preventing excessive cell growth, which can lead to skin disorders (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

KRT32 also functions as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is vital for controlling inflammation. It achieves this by binding to NEMO, a key component of the NF-κB pathway, promoting its degradation through K48-linked polyubiquitination. This interaction prevents the formation of the IKK complex, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activation and reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining skin immune balance and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

Overall, KRT32 is essential for maintaining both the structural and immune integrity of the skin, highlighting its importance in skin health and disease prevention (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT32 gene are significantly associated with the skin condition pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP), an inflammatory disorder characterized by hyperkeratotic follicular papules and erythematous desquamative plaques. These mutations lead to a loss of function in KRT32, disrupting skin immune homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of PRP (Shi2024Lossoffunction). The KRT32 gene is involved in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway by interacting with the NEMO protein. Loss-of-function mutations impair this interaction, resulting in the hyperactivation of NF-κB and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, which exacerbate PRP symptoms (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

In KRT32 knockout mouse models, the absence of KRT32 leads to PRP-like dermatitis, characterized by epidermal thickening and increased keratinocyte proliferation, further supporting the gene's role in maintaining skin immune balance (Shi2024Lossoffunction). These findings suggest that KRT32 mutations are critical drivers of PRP and highlight the gene as a potential therapeutic target for managing the condition (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

## Interactions
Keratin 32 (KRT32) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. One of the primary interactions of KRT32 is with NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator), a key component of the NF-κB pathway. KRT32 binds to NEMO, promoting its K48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting the formation of the IKK complex, thereby suppressing NF-κB activation and controlling inflammatory responses (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

Mutations in KRT32 can disrupt its interaction with NEMO, leading to reduced polyubiquitination and increased stability of NEMO, which results in the hyperactivation of the NF-κB pathway. This disruption is associated with increased phosphorylation of IKKα/IKKβ and overactivation of NF-κB, contributing to inflammatory conditions such as pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) (Shi2024Lossoffunction).

The interaction between KRT32 and NEMO is mediated by specific amino acid residues in KRT32, such as Arg115, Arg203, and Glu303, which form hydrogen bonds with NEMO. Other mutations within the interaction interface can alter the domain conformation, weakening the interaction and affecting the protein's regulatory functions (Shi2024Lossoffunction).
