# ING5

## Overview
ING5 is a gene that encodes the protein inhibitor of growth family member 5, which is a part of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family of proteins. This protein is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, functioning as a tumor suppressor. It is characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc-binding motif that facilitates its interaction with histone modifications, such as H3K4me3, and its incorporation into histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. ING5 plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair, often interacting with key proteins like p53 to modulate cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The gene is known to produce multiple splice variants, suggesting diverse functional roles in cellular processes. Alterations in ING5 expression or mutations have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in tumor suppression and potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2022The; Champagne2008The; Coles2008The; Cengiz2010Tumor‐specific).

## Structure
The ING5 protein contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a zinc-binding motif crucial for its function in chromatin recognition and transcription regulation. The PHD finger domain of ING5 has been crystallized in complex with an H3K4me3 histone peptide, revealing that it forms a complex with the peptide, crystallizing in space group P4 3 with two complexes in the asymmetric unit. The domain features two zinc-binding clusters, with the first zinc ion coordinated by one histidine and three cysteine residues, and the second zinc ion coordinated by four cysteine residues. These zinc ions stabilize three loops within the domain. The core of the domain is formed by a double-stranded antiparallel beta sheet, with additional short beta strands at the N-terminus and two short alpha helices. The H3K4me3 peptide binds to the ING5 PHD domain by forming a third antiparallel beta strand that pairs with the protein's central beta sheet, fitting into a hydrophobic pocket formed by specific residues (Champagne2008The).

ING5 is known to have multiple splice variants, with five alternative splicing variants identified, resulting in different mRNA transcripts and potentially truncated proteins (Cengiz2010Tumor‐specific). The presence of these variants suggests that ING5 may have diverse roles in cellular processes.

## Function
ING5 is a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family of proteins, which are involved in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair. ING5 functions as a tumor suppressor and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, such as the HBO1-containing HAT complex, and interacts with the p53 protein to influence its activity. ING5 can recruit p300 to acetylate p53 on lysine-382, a modification that affects p53's role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Coles2008The; Yang2018Expression).

ING5 is also involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly in the S-phase, and can induce apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. It enhances the transcriptional regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a target gene of p53, thereby contributing to cell cycle arrest (Campos2004Biological; Coles2008The). ING5's interaction with histone H3K4me3 and its role in HAT complexes suggest its involvement in epigenetic regulation, influencing gene expression related to cellular growth and tumor suppression (Taheri2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
ING5, a tumor suppressor gene, plays a significant role in various cancers through its involvement in cell growth regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Alterations in ING5 expression or mutations can contribute to cancer progression and poor prognosis. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ING5 mutations and downregulation are observed, with 61% of primary tumors showing decreased mRNA expression compared to normal tissues. This downregulation may contribute to its role as a tumor suppressor in OSCC (Cengiz2010Tumor‐specific).

In lung cancer, ING5 expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its nuclear expression correlates with ki-67 expression. Cytoplasmic ING5 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis, indicating its potential as a marker for cancer aggressiveness (Zhao2016The). ING5 is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where its overexpression suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth, while its lower expression is linked to different histological subtypes and dedifferentiation (Zheng2017The).

ING5's role in chemoresistance is linked to anti-apoptosis and activation of pathways like PI3K/Akt/NF-κB, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2022The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ING5 in cancer, suggesting that alterations in its expression or interactions could impact cancer progression and treatment responses (Zheng2022The).

## Interactions
ING5, a member of the inhibitor of growth (ING) family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. ING5 is known to interact with histone H3K4me3, a modification associated with active transcription, through its plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. This interaction is essential for the acetyltransferase activity of the MOZ/MORF and HBO1 complexes, which ING5 is a component of (Champagne2008The).

ING5 also forms part of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, such as the ING5-histone acetyltransferase KAT7-JADE and ING5-MOZ-related factor-bromodomain-PHD finger protein complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling (Yang2018Expression). It interacts with the p300 protein, promoting its autoacetylation and enhancing its HAT activity, which in turn increases the acetylation of p53 at specific lysine residues (Zhang2017ING5).

ING5's interaction with INCA1 is critical for its antiproliferative effects. This interaction influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, as demonstrated in experiments with murine embryonic fibroblast cells (Zhang2011The). ING5 also interacts with the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which is crucial for DNA replication (Jacquet2021ING).
