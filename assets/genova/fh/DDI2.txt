# DDI2

## Overview
DDI2 is a gene that encodes the protein DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2, which is a member of the Ddi1-like protein family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where it functions as a protease. The DDI2 protein contains several distinct domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a helical domain of Ddi1 (HDD), and a retroviral protease-like (RVP) domain, which collectively contribute to its role in cellular stress responses and protein degradation (Sivá2016Human). DDI2 is particularly important for the cleavage and activation of transcription factors such as TCF11/NRF1, which are crucial for the induction of proteasome subunits and the management of proteotoxic stress (Siva2020DDI2). The protein's interactions with other components of the UPS, including the proteasome subunit hRPN13 and the tumor suppressor protein p53, underscore its regulatory functions in maintaining proteostasis and cellular homeostasis (Muslim2024Molecular).

## Structure
The human DDI2 protein is structurally distinct from its yeast ortholog and is part of the Ddi1-like protein family. It contains several key domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N-terminus, a helical domain of Ddi1 (HDD), and a retroviral protease-like (RVP) domain. The UBL domain of human DDI2 binds weakly to ubiquitin, differing from the yeast Ddi1, which has a stronger interaction (Sivá2016Human). The HDD is a conserved α-helical bundle consisting of four α-helices with a hydrophobic core, supported by a salt bridge, and serves as an interaction platform (Sivá2016Human). The RVP domain resembles the structure of HIV-1 protease and contains a catalytic triad characteristic of aspartic proteases, although it does not exhibit intrinsic proteolytic activity unless in complex with other proteins (Sivá2016Human).

Human DDI2 lacks the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain found in yeast Ddi1 but features a novel ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) at its C-terminus, which binds weakly to ubiquitin (Sivá2016Human). The protein's structure includes a novel α-helical architecture in the HDD domain and a conserved fold in the RVP domain, with differences in the flap region compared to other retroviral proteases (Sivá2016Human).

## Function
The DDI2 gene encodes a protease that plays a crucial role in maintaining proteostasis and regulating cellular responses to stress. In healthy human cells, DDI2 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for degrading intracellular proteins, including misfolded or damaged ones. DDI2 specifically cleaves the transcription factor TCF11/NRF1, enabling its nuclear translocation and activation. This process is essential for the induction of proteasome subunits and other factors related to the UPS, which help in managing proteotoxic stress (Siva2020DDI2).

DDI2's protease activity is vital for the proper functioning of the TCF11/NRF1 pathway, which is involved in proteasome formation and cellular responses to stress. In the absence of DDI2, cells experience severe proteotoxic stress, leading to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and integrated stress response (ISR) pathways, and an increase in type I interferon signaling (Siva2020DDI2). DDI2 is also crucial for the activation of NFE2L1, a transcription factor involved in the UPS, during ferroptosis, a form of cell death. This activation is dependent on DDI2, as shown by experiments using DDI2 knockout cells (Bartelt2023Activating).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the DDI2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. DDI2 is involved in the NGLY1-DDI2-TCF11/NRF1 axis, which is crucial for cellular responses to proteasome inhibition. This pathway is activated by proteasome inhibitors used in treating multiple myeloma, suggesting that DDI2 could be a target for drug development in cancer and conditions with proteasome impairment (Siva2020DDI2). In cancer biology, DDI2 has been identified as an oncogene in colorectal cancer and plays a role in the resistance of solid tumors to proteasome inhibitors. Targeting DDI2 could enhance the efficacy of these inhibitors, as DDI2-deficient cells show increased sensitivity to them (Northrop2020Disabling).

DDI2 also plays a role in embryonic development and inflammation. DDI2 deficiency leads to proteotoxic stress and the activation of type I interferon signaling, which can impair stem cell function and differentiation potential. This has implications for conditions like cancerogenesis and proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (Siva2020DDI2). Additionally, DDI2 is crucial for maintaining proteostasis during ferroptosis, a form of cell death, and its inhibition increases susceptibility to ferroptotic cell death (Bartelt2023Activating).

## Interactions
The human DDI2 protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. DDI2 interacts with the proteasome subunit hRPN13 through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, suggesting a role in the regulation of ubiquitinated substrate degradation (Muslim2024Molecular). This interaction is significant as hRPN13 is known to bind ubiquitin and UBL domain proteins with high affinity, indicating that DDI2 may act as an alternative ubiquitin receptor (Muslim2024Molecular).

DDI2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, particularly in the context of proteasomal inhibition, where it may function as a 'shuttle factor' to regulate p53 degradation (Muslim2024Molecular). This interaction is crucial for maintaining p53 stability after DNA damage, highlighting DDI2's role in cellular stress responses (Muslim2024Molecular).

Additionally, DDI2 has been shown to interact with components of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, such as Rpt4, supporting its involvement in proteasome-related functions (Muslim2024Molecular). These interactions underscore DDI2's role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and its potential regulatory functions in protein degradation and cellular stress responses.
