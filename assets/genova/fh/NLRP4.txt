# NLRP4

## Overview
NLRP4 is a gene that encodes the NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 protein, which is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family. This protein is characterized by its pyrin domain (PYD), which is involved in protein-protein interactions crucial for inflammasome signaling (Eibl2012Structural). NLRP4 plays a significant role in regulating autophagy and immune responses, acting as a negative regulator of autophagy by interacting with Beclin1 and influencing the maturation of autophagosomes (Jounai2011NLRP4). Additionally, NLRP4 modulates immune signaling by inhibiting nuclear factor-kB activation and type I interferon signaling, which are essential for antiviral defense (Uh2019Association). The protein's interactions with various partners, such as TBK1 and the class C vacuolar protein-sorting complex, underscore its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stressors (Charoenthongtrakul2012The; Jounai2011NLRP4). NLRP4's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with conditions such as asthma and certain cancers, where genetic variants and mutations may influence disease pathogenesis (Moon2021Somatic; Uh2019Association).

## Structure
The NLRP4 protein is characterized by its pyrin domain (PYD), which adopts a typical death domain (DD) fold. This fold consists of six α-helices tightly packed around a central hydrophobic core, formed by conserved hydrophobic residues such as Leu11, Tyr14, and Leu15 (Eibl2012Structural). The NLRP4 PYD features unique structural elements, including a disordered helix α3 that becomes fully folded upon binding to downstream partners, a feature important for protein-protein interactions in inflammasome signaling (Eibl2012Structural).

The NLRP4 PYD also has a highly charged surface, with a second positively charged surface formed by residues Arg74, Lys78, and Lys82 on helices α5 and α6, which may engage in homotypic type II interactions (Eibl2012Structural). Despite structural similarities with other PYDs, such as those of NLRP7 and NLRP1, NLRP4 does not interact with the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), indicating a complex specificity in PYD interactions (Eibl2012Structural).

In crystallographic studies, NLRP4 PYD forms dimers, although it remains monomeric in solution, similar to the CARD of NLRC1 (Eibl2012Structural). The dimerization observed in crystal structures is not due to disulfide bonds, as the relevant cysteine residues are too far apart (Eibl2012Structural).

## Function
The NLRP4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, which plays a crucial role in regulating autophagic processes in healthy human cells. NLRP4 negatively regulates autophagy by interacting with Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy, through its NACHT domain. This interaction inhibits the initiation of autophagy, a process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive autophagic activity that could lead to cellular damage or death (Jounai2011NLRP4).

NLRP4 also associates with the class C vacuolar protein-sorting complex, affecting the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, which is important for controlling autophagic flux and the elimination of intracellular bacteria (Jounai2011NLRP4). In the context of bacterial infections, NLRP4 is transiently recruited to bacteria-containing autophagosomes and modulates the autophagic response, influencing the cellular response to pathogens (Jounai2011NLRP4).

Additionally, NLRP4 is involved in modulating immune responses by inhibiting nuclear factor-kB activation and negatively regulating type I interferon signaling, which is crucial for antiviral defense (Uh2019Association). These functions highlight NLRP4's role in maintaining cellular balance and responding to stressors.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NLRP4 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of asthma, genetic variants of NLRP4, particularly the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16986718G > A, have been linked to increased frequency of asthma exacerbations. This association is especially pronounced in individuals who smoke, suggesting that smoking exacerbates the genetic predisposition to asthma exacerbations linked to this SNP. The minor allele of rs16986718G > A is associated with a higher prevalence of frequent exacerbations, potentially due to smoking-induced attenuation of the defense mechanism against respiratory viral infections (Uh2019Association).

In cancer, NLRP4 has been implicated in gastric and colonic cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). A frameshift mutation in NLRP4 was identified in gastric cancer, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers. The study suggests that NLRP4, along with other NLRP genes, can act as tumor suppressors or promoters depending on the context, highlighting its dual role in cancer development (Moon2021Somatic).

These findings underscore the importance of NLRP4 in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis through genetic and environmental interactions.

## Interactions
NLRP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in regulating autophagic processes and immune responses. It associates with Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy, through its NACHT domain, which interacts with Beclin1's evolutionarily conserved domain (ECD). This interaction negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting autophagosome maturation and formation (Jounai2011NLRP4). NLRP4 also interacts with the class C vacuolar protein-sorting (C-VPS) complex, which includes VPS11, VPS16, and VPS18, further influencing autophagosome and endosome maturation (Jounai2011NLRP4).

In the context of immune signaling, NLRP4 interacts with TBK1, a kinase involved in type I interferon signaling. It acts as a negative regulator by promoting K48-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1, leading to its proteasomal degradation. This process involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4, with NLRP4 serving as an adaptor molecule (Charoenthongtrakul2012The). NLRP4 is also part of a complex with USP38 and DTX4/TRIP, which regulates TBK1 ubiquitination and stability, impacting antiviral responses (Lin2016USP38).

These interactions highlight NLRP4's role in modulating autophagy and immune signaling pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and defense mechanisms.
