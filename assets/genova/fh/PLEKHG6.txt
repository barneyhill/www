# PLEKHG6

## Overview
PLEKHG6 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G6, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, particularly RhoG, and plays a significant role in cytoskeletal rearrangements within epithelial cells. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Dbl homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are essential for its activity in modulating actin-rich structures such as microvilli and membrane ruffles. These structures are crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating processes like macropinocytosis. PLEKHG6 interacts with the ERM protein ezrin, which is vital for its localization to the apical surface of epithelial cells and for the recruitment of RhoG to this compartment. The gene has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in colon and rectal adenocarcinoma, where its expression is influenced by specific genetic polymorphisms (Ke2020Genetic; D’Angelo2007Interaction).

## Structure
The PLEKHG6 protein is a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is 790 amino acids long and has a relative molecular mass of 89 kDa (D’Angelo2007Interaction). Its primary structure includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are crucial for its function in modulating Rho family GTPases (D’Angelo2007Interaction). The DH domain of PLEKHG6 shows significant homology with the DH domain of human GEF720, as well as with uncharacterized Dbl-related proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Similarly, the PH domain shows homology with the PH domain of GEF720 and putative PH domains of the Drosophila and C. elegans proteins (D’Angelo2007Interaction).

The C-terminal region of PLEKHG6 (amino acids 579-790) interacts with the N-terminal domain of ezrin, indicating a specific binding site necessary for its interaction with ezrin (D’Angelo2007Interaction). This interaction is part of the signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal organization and membrane dynamics (Kawaguchi2022Pathophysiological). The protein does not contain other known functional domains or motifs in its N- or C-terminal regions (D’Angelo2007Interaction). Information on secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
PLEKHG6 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that primarily activates the small GTPase RhoG, playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal rearrangements in epithelial cells. It is involved in the formation of actin-rich structures such as microvilli and membrane ruffles, which are essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating processes like macropinocytosis, a form of endocytosis important for nutrient uptake and cellular internalization (D’Angelo2007Interaction). PLEKHG6 localizes to the apical surface of epithelial cells, where it interacts with ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein. This interaction is vital for the recruitment of RhoG to the apical compartment, promoting the formation of apical actin structures (D’Angelo2007Interaction).

The protein's activity is not limited to RhoG; it also exhibits weak activity towards Rac1, another member of the Rho GTPase family, although RhoG is its primary target (D’Angelo2007Interaction). PLEKHG6's interaction with ezrin is crucial for its localization and function in specific cellular compartments, although it is not necessary for its catalytic activity (D’Angelo2007Interaction). The highest expression of PLEKHG6 mRNA is found in the placenta, suggesting a role in nutrient exchange processes in placental microvilli (D’Angelo2007Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLEKHG6 gene have been implicated in the development of colon and rectal adenocarcinoma. A specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11064124, located in a super-enhancer region, affects the expression of PLEKHG6 by altering its interaction with the vitamin D receptor (VDR). This SNP is associated with a reduced risk of colon and rectal adenocarcinoma, as it enhances the activity of the super-enhancer, thereby increasing the expression of PLEKHG6, which functions as a tumor suppressor gene (Ke2020Genetic). 

Functional assays have demonstrated that knockdown of PLEKHG6 promotes cell proliferation, suggesting its role in inhibiting tumor growth (Ke2020Genetic). The rs11064124-A allele specifically has been shown to activate the promoters of PLEKHG6, indicating allele-specific long-range chromatin interactions that influence gene expression (Ke2020Genetic). 

Alterations in the expression or interaction of PLEKHG6, mediated by super-enhancer polymorphisms, may contribute to the development of colorectal cancer, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in cancer biology (Ke2020Genetic).

## Interactions
PLEKHG6 interacts with the ERM protein ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker, which is crucial for its localization to the apical surface of epithelial cells. This interaction promotes RhoG-dependent apical cytoskeleton rearrangements, leading to the formation of actin-rich structures such as microvilli and membrane ruffles. The interaction between PLEKHG6 and ezrin is dependent on the conformation of ezrin, occurring only when ezrin is in an open conformation. PLEKHG6 specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of ezrin, and this interaction is essential for the morphogenic effects at the apical surface (D’Angelo2007Interaction).

PLEKHG6 also forms a ternary complex with ezrin and RhoG, acting as a bridge between these proteins, which is essential for RhoG-mediated signaling pathways. This complex formation is necessary for efficient macropinocytosis in EGF-stimulated A431 cells (D’Angelo2007Interaction). Additionally, PLEKHG6 interacts with the RhoG effector ELMO, independently of ezrin, allowing the formation of a ternary complex involving all three proteins. This interaction is crucial for the induction of dorsal ruffles and subsequent macropinocytosis (D’Angelo2007Interaction).
