# ALDH3B2

## Overview
The ALDH3B2 gene encodes the protein aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member B2, which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, converting them into less reactive carboxylic acids, thereby playing a critical role in cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress. ALDH3B2 is categorized as an enzyme and is notably localized to lipid droplets, where it participates in lipid metabolism by oxidizing medium- and long-chain aldehydes. This function is particularly significant in tissues with high lipid content, such as white adipose tissue. Beyond its metabolic roles, ALDH3B2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in cholangiocarcinoma, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor progression (Wang2021Aldehyde; Kitamura2014Mouse).

## Function
ALDH3B2 is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family, which plays a crucial role in the detoxification of aldehydes by converting them into carboxylic acids. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. In healthy cells, ALDH3B2 is primarily localized to lipid droplets, where it is involved in the metabolism of lipid-derived aldehydes. This localization is facilitated by two C-terminal tryptophan residues and lipid modifications, such as prenylation, which are critical for its membrane association and enzymatic function (Kitamura2014Mouse).

ALDH3B2 exhibits broad substrate specificity, efficiently oxidizing medium- and long-chain aldehydes, which are often generated during lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. This activity is particularly important in tissues with high lipid content, such as white adipose tissue, where ALDH3B2 is highly expressed (Kitamura2014Mouse). By detoxifying reactive aldehydes, ALDH3B2 contributes to the maintenance of cellular health and prevents oxidative stress-related damage, supporting its role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Kitamura2014Mouse).

## Clinical Significance
ALDH3B2 is implicated in the progression of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a type of cancer originating from the bile ducts. High expression levels of ALDH3B2 are associated with poor prognosis in CCA patients, as the gene promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by facilitating the transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle (Wang2021Aldehyde). ALDH3B2 enhances the expression of integrin beta 1 (ITGB1), which activates downstream signaling pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis (Wang2021Aldehyde). Knockdown of ALDH3B2 in experimental models reduces these cancerous behaviors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021Aldehyde).

In addition to its role in CCA, ALDH3B2 is part of prognostic models for other cancers, such as colorectal and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its broader significance in oncology (Wang2021Aldehyde). The gene's expression is notably higher in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues, further supporting its role in tumor progression (Wang2021Aldehyde).
