# YBX3

## Overview
YBX3 is a gene that encodes the Y-box binding protein 3, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and mRNA stability. The protein is characterized by its conserved cold shock domain (CSD), which facilitates nucleic acid binding, and is categorized as a nucleic acid-binding protein. YBX3 plays a critical role in epithelial morphogenesis, cell proliferation, and survival, and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. It interacts with several cellular components, including mitochondrial tRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, and is implicated in cancer-related processes, such as metastasis and tumor progression. The protein's ability to modulate key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers (Dupasquier2014Validation; Fan2021YBX3; Sun2022Identification).

## Structure
YBX3, also known as Y-box binding protein 3, is characterized by its conserved cold shock domain (CSD), which is crucial for its nucleic acid-binding capabilities. The CSD is 68 amino acids long and contains specific RNA-binding motifs, contributing to its primary structure (Kleene2018Ybox). This domain is flanked by linkers, NC9 and CC13, which may extend the binding surface or influence interactions with nucleic acids or proteins (Kleene2018Ybox). The C-terminal domain of YBX3 is basic and rich in arginine, forming arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) that are essential for site-specific RNA binding (Kleene2018Ybox).

YBX3 exists in two isoforms, YBX3S and YBX3L, which are produced by alternative splicing. These isoforms differ in the number of ARMs and acidic motifs (AcidMs), with YBX3S having three ARMs and YBX3L having four (Kleene2018Ybox). The presence of these motifs and their specific sequences contribute to the protein's functional diversity and binding specificity (Kleene2018Ybox).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence YBX3's function and interactions, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided (Lyabin2020YB3). The structural organization of YBX3, including its CSD and ARMs, allows it to participate in various RNA-binding and regulatory functions.

## Function
Y-box binding protein 3 (YBX3), also known as CSDA or ZONAB, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a transcription factor and regulates mRNA stability, playing a crucial role in epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis. YBX3 modulates cellular processes such as cell density control, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It interacts with the cell cycle-regulating kinase CDK4 and upregulates the transcription of PCNA (Proliferative Cell Nuclear Antigen) and Cyclin-D1, which are essential for cell proliferation (Dupasquier2014Validation).

In kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells, YBX3 stimulates proliferation and represses genes involved in apical differentiation, such as cubilin and megalin/LRP-2. It also binds to p21 mRNA, stabilizing and enhancing its translation, which promotes cell survival in response to cellular stress (Dupasquier2014Validation).

YBX3 shares functional similarities with YB-1, another Y-box binding protein, and can substitute for YB-1 in mRNA binding and translation inhibition. In YB-1-null cells, YBX3 is overexpressed, leading to a similar molecular phenotype characterized by a global decrease in translation, indicating its role in translation repression (Lyabin2020YB3; Eliseeva2024YBoxBinding).

## Clinical Significance
YBX3, also known as Y-box binding protein 3, has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene expression regulation. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), YBX3 is significantly upregulated, and its knockdown has been shown to suppress cell migration and metastasis. This suggests that YBX3 promotes NPC metastasis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, making it a potential therapeutic target for this type of cancer (Fan2021YBX3).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), YBX3 expression varies with tumor grade, being higher in low-grade tumors and lower in high-grade tumors. This differential expression suggests that YBX3 could be part of a signature for RCC grading. The study also highlights the importance of selecting appropriate reference genes for accurate gene expression analysis, as normalization against different housekeeping genes can significantly impact the interpretation of YBX3 expression data (Dupasquier2014Validation).

YBX3 is also associated with other cancers, such as low-grade glioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where it may influence tumor progression and the tumor microenvironment. However, the specific mechanisms and clinical significance of YBX3 in these contexts require further investigation (Yuan2024Comprehensive).

## Interactions
YBX3, a member of the Y-box binding protein family, is known to interact with various nucleic acids and proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. In the cytosol, YBX3 directly interacts with mitochondrial tRNAs (mt tRNAs), such as Lys, Phe, and Val, forming heterodimeric complexes. These interactions have been confirmed through in vivo RNA-protein cross-linking and gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which demonstrate concentration-dependent mobility retardation of mt tRNAs when incubated with YBX3 (Jády2018Dynamic).

YBX3 is also involved in cancer-related processes. In colon cancer, YBX3 interacts with the long noncoding RNA HEIH, as identified in RNA pull-down assays. This interaction suggests a regulatory relationship where HEIH influences YBX3 expression, impacting cancer progression and patient prognosis (Sun2022Identification). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, YBX3 is implicated in metastasis through its regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and MMP1 expression (Fan2021YBX3).

These interactions highlight YBX3's role in both normal cellular functions and disease states, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
