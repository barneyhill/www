# PRAMEF33

## Overview
PRAMEF33 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 33, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. PRAME family member 33 is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which is typically expressed in a limited number of normal tissues but is upregulated in various cancers. The expression pattern of PRAMEF33 suggests its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and its utility as a biomarker for certain malignancies. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms and pathways in which PRAMEF33 is involved, as well as its potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Qiu2020aarFDC).
