# TARBP2

## Overview
TARBP2, or Trans-Activation Response RNA-Binding Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex, which is crucial for RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms. The TARBP2 protein is characterized as an RNA-binding protein, containing two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a Medipal domain, which facilitate its role in microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways. These pathways are essential for gene silencing and regulation of gene expression. Beyond its role in RNA processing, TARBP2 is involved in modulating immune responses and has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor growth and progression (Fish2019Nuclear; Caramuta2013Clinical; Yamashita2010Structures).

## Structure
The TARBP2 protein, a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex, contains two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a Medipal domain. The dsRBDs, specifically dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, exhibit an α2β2β2β2α fold, a common feature of dsRNA-binding domains (Yamashita2010Structures). The structures of dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 are similar, with a slight shift in the first alpha helix, and the residues involved in dsRNA binding are conserved (Yamashita2010Structures). 

The second dsRBD (dsRBD2) contains a tryptophan residue (Trp152) in the L1 loop, which contributes to its higher thermal stability compared to dsRBD1. This residue interacts with surrounding residues through cation-π interactions, stabilizing the domain structure (Yamashita2010Structures). The full-length TRBP, which includes TARBP2, can bind simultaneously to a single siRNA molecule, resulting in a subnanomolar dissociation constant, indicating a strong binding affinity (Yamashita2010Structures).

Post-translational modifications of TARBP2 may include phosphorylation, and splice variants can result in different isoforms with distinct functions. These structural features and modifications are crucial for its role in microRNA processing and gene silencing.

## Function
TARBP2, or Trans-Activation Response RNA-Binding Protein 2, is a crucial component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex, primarily active in the cytoplasm. It plays a significant role in the microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways by facilitating the loading of these RNA molecules onto Argonaute proteins, which is essential for gene silencing and regulation of gene expression (St1992A). 

In healthy human cells, TARBP2 is involved in RNA processing and stability within the nucleus. It interacts with RNA processing and export factors, including WTAP and the m6A methylation machinery, leading to increased intron retention and transcript destabilization. This interaction marks target transcripts for methylation, affecting their stability and processing (Fish2019Nuclear). TARBP2 also plays a role in regulating RNA splicing through m6A methylation, affecting the expression of mature transcripts by modulating the binding of splicing regulators like SRSF1 (Fish2019Nuclear).

Additionally, TARBP2 is involved in modulating the immune response. It acts as a negative regulator of virus-induced IFN-β production by targeting MAVS, thereby inhibiting the cellular antiviral response (Ling2018TARBP2). This multifunctional role highlights TARBP2's importance in both RNA interference mechanisms and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TARBP2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), TARBP2 is significantly over-expressed compared to adenomas and normal adrenal cortices. This over-expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting a role in tumor growth. TARBP2 expression serves as a strong molecular predictor for distinguishing between adenomas and carcinomas, with high sensitivity and specificity (Caramuta2013Clinical).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TARBP2 is consistently downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. Its reduced expression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in HCC (Li2021Loss).

TARBP2 also plays a role in lung cancer, where its increased activity is linked to oncogenic growth. It influences RNA splicing and decay, affecting the expression of numerous transcripts involved in cancer progression (Fish2019Nuclear).

In gastric cancer, TARBP2 interacts with LINC01526, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration, further highlighting its role in cancer progression (Zhou2022LINC01526).

## Interactions
TARBP2, also known as TRBP, is a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex. It interacts with Dicer, a ribonuclease essential for microRNA processing, through a specific 69 amino acid C4 domain in TRBP, which is crucial for RNA interference (RNAi) activity. This interaction facilitates the loading of double-stranded RNA into the RISC, a process necessary for effective gene silencing (Daniels2009Characterization).

TARBP2 also interacts with Ago2, another core component of the RISC. SUMOylation of TARBP2 enhances its interaction with Ago2, promoting the efficiency of miRNA/siRNA-mediated gene silencing by stabilizing Ago2 and facilitating the formation of the RISC-loading complex (Chen2015SUMOylation).

In addition to its role in RNAi, TARBP2 is involved in modulating antiviral signaling pathways. It interacts with MAVS and RIG-I, negatively regulating virus-triggered type I IFN signaling by inhibiting the formation of IRF3 dimers and promoting the proteasomal degradation of RIG-I through increased K48-linked ubiquitination (Ling2018TARBP2).

TARBP2 also affects the stability and ubiquitination of TRAF6 and IRF7, influencing immune response signaling. It decreases TRAF6-linked linear ubiquitination while enhancing K48-linked ubiquitination, leading to TRAF6 degradation. TARBP2 also attenuates the interaction between TRAF6 and IRF7, reducing IRF7's K63-linked ubiquitination and stability (Ling2019TARBP2).
