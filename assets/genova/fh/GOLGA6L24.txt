# GOLGA6L24

## Overview
GOLGA6L24 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 24, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family like 24 is thought to contribute to the tethering and fusion of vesicles at the Golgi, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are of interest due to their potential involvement in various cellular processes and implications in disease pathways, although further research is needed to clarify these roles (Qiu2020aarFDC).
