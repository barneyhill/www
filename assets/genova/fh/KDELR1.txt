# KDELR1

## Overview
KDELR1 is a gene that encodes the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 1, a seven-transmembrane receptor involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. This receptor plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper localization of ER-resident proteins, which is essential for protein quality control and proteostasis (Blum2019Transcriptomics; Cela2022KDEL). Structurally, KDELR1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha helices, which form a configuration similar to the SWEET transporter family (Jia2020KDEL). Functionally, KDELR1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of stress responses, intracellular signaling pathways, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Kamimura2015KDEL; Cela2022KDEL). It interacts with several proteins, such as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and Src family kinases, to regulate processes like T-cell homeostasis and extracellular matrix degradation (Kamimura2015KDEL; Cela2022KDEL). Clinically, mutations in KDELR1 have been linked to immune deficiencies and cancer, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yuan2022KDELR1; Siggs2015Mutation).

## Structure
The KDELR1 protein is a seven-transmembrane receptor involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. Its structure is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha helices, which are organized into two internal triple helix bundles (THBs). These bundles consist of the first three N-terminal and the last three C-terminal helices, connected by a linker helix, TM4. This arrangement is typical of the SWEET transporter family, to which KDELR1 shows structural similarity despite low sequence identity (Jia2020KDEL).

The receptor's luminal side features a large polar cavity crucial for recognizing KDEL-containing proteins. The binding of the KDEL signal sequence involves electrostatic interactions, with specific residues forming salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the peptide (Bräuer2019Structural). The receptor undergoes significant conformational changes upon peptide binding, including the movement of transmembrane helix 7, which creates a new cavity facing the cytoplasm (Bräuer2019Structural).

KDELR1 is also expressed on the plasma membrane, where it functions as a putative cell surface receptor for certain growth factors, such as mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) (Jia2020KDEL). The receptor's trafficking involves complex recycling pathways through the endolysosomal compartment and the Golgi, utilizing clathrin-mediated transport carriers (Jia2020KDEL).

## Function
KDELR1, or KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 1, is a crucial component in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins from the Golgi apparatus back to the ER. This process is essential for the proper functioning of the ER, ensuring protein quality control and maintaining proteostasis within the cell (Blum2019Transcriptomics; Cela2022KDEL). KDELR1 recognizes proteins with a C-terminal KDEL sequence, initiating retrograde transport to prevent their premature secretion and ensure their retention in the ER (Blum2019Transcriptomics).

KDELR1 is also involved in modulating cellular stress responses and intracellular signaling pathways. It activates Src family kinases at the Golgi complex, which are involved in various signaling cascades, including those regulating invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation (Kamimura2015KDEL; Cela2022KDEL). Additionally, KDELR1 plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, processes critical for managing cellular stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cela2022KDEL; Tapia2019KDEL).

In the context of T cells, KDELR1 regulates the integrated stress response (ISR) by interacting with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to control the phosphorylation of eIF2a, thereby preventing excessive apoptosis and maintaining T-cell homeostasis (Kamimura2015KDEL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KDELR1 gene have significant clinical implications. A specific mutation, Y158C, in KDELR1 is associated with lymphopenia, reduced T-cell receptor expression, and compromised antiviral immunity. This mutation affects the sixth transmembrane domain, crucial for KDEL recognition, leading to impaired T-cell development and survival, as well as increased CD44 expression (Wires2021The; Siggs2015Mutation). 

KDELR1 mutations can also result in cell-intrinsic lymphopenia and a failure to control chronic viral infections. These mutations lead to increased apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, reducing naïve T-cells and compromising antiviral immunity (Siggs2015Mutation; Cela2022KDEL). 

In cancer, KDELR1 expression is upregulated in gliomas, correlating with poor prognosis. Higher KDELR1 expression is linked to shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in glioma patients, making it an independent prognostic factor. Its expression is associated with immune infiltration and microenvironment parameters, suggesting a role in glioma progression and immune response regulation (Yuan2022KDELR1). 

These findings highlight the potential of KDELR1 as a therapeutic target in diseases involving immune deficiencies and cancer.

## Interactions
KDELR1, a KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins that are essential for its function in cellular processes. KDELR1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a key phosphatase involved in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating T-cell homeostasis by controlling the dephosphorylation of eIF2a, thereby modulating stress responses and apoptosis in naive T cells (Kamimura2015KDEL).

KDELR1 also interacts with Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) to regulate invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. This process involves the recruitment and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is necessary for ECM degradation (Cela2022KDEL). Additionally, KDELR1 is involved in autophagy and interacts with Gαo on Golgi membranes, influencing membrane protrusion formation and anterograde trafficking (Cela2022KDEL).

Mutations in KDELR1 can disrupt its interaction with PP1, leading to increased apoptosis of T lymphocytes and impaired immune responses, highlighting the importance of these interactions in maintaining immune function (Cela2022KDEL). These interactions underscore KDELR1's role in various signaling pathways and cellular processes.
