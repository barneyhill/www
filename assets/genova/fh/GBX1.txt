# GBX1

## Overview
The GBX1 gene encodes the gastrulation brain homeobox 1 protein, a homeobox transcription factor that is pivotal in the development of the central nervous system during embryogenesis. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression necessary for neural development and patterning. GBX1 is dynamically expressed in the early neural plate and later becomes localized to specific regions of the spinal cord, such as the dorsal mantle zone, by embryonic day 12.5. It is essential for the development and maintenance of sensorimotor circuits, influencing the assembly of proprioceptive sensorimotor circuits and the development of ISL1+ ventral motor neurons, which are crucial for coordinated movement. Additionally, GBX1 is involved in the patterning and survival of interneurons and motor neurons, maintaining PAX2+ dorsal inhibitory interneurons and preventing excessive apoptosis in the ventral spinal cord (Buckley2013Characterization; Buckley2020Gbx1).

## Function
The GBX1 gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system, particularly during embryogenesis. GBX1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression necessary for the proper formation and patterning of neural structures. It is dynamically expressed in the neural plate and later becomes restricted to specific regions of the spinal cord, such as the dorsal mantle zone, by embryonic day 12.5 (Buckley2013Characterization; Buckley2020Gbx1).

In the spinal cord, GBX1 is essential for the development and maintenance of sensorimotor circuits, which are critical for normal locomotion. It influences the assembly of proprioceptive sensorimotor circuits and the development of ISL1+ ventral motor neurons, which are necessary for coordinated movement (Buckley2013Characterization). GBX1 also plays a role in the patterning and survival of interneurons and motor neurons, as evidenced by its involvement in maintaining PAX2+ dorsal inhibitory interneurons and preventing excessive apoptosis in the ventral spinal cord (Buckley2020Gbx1).

GBX1's function as a transcription factor is further highlighted by its nuclear localization, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and tissue patterning (Obinata2011Tgm2Gh).
