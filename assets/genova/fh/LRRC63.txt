# LRRC63

## Overview
The LRRC63 gene encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing 63 protein, which is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. The LRRC63 protein is implicated in several biological functions, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its ability to interact with other proteins. Although the precise role of LRRC63 in human physiology is not fully understood, it is believed to play a part in the regulation of cellular pathways and may have implications in certain diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
