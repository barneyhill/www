# PTGER3

## Overview
PTGER3 is a gene that encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, primarily through its interaction with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). As a transmembrane receptor, EP3 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses, vascular tone, and platelet function. It achieves these roles by influencing intracellular signaling pathways, such as the ERK pathway, through its multiple isoforms that arise from mRNA splice variants. The receptor's activity is crucial in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including its involvement in cancer progression and drug resistance mechanisms (Norel2020International; Ueta2010Prostaglandin; RodriguezAguayo2019PTGER3).

## Function
The PTGER3 gene encodes the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3), a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes by mediating the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In healthy human cells, the EP3 receptor is involved in regulating inflammatory responses, particularly in the ocular surface. It has been shown to suppress the production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in human conjunctival epithelial cells, suggesting a role in mitigating allergic conjunctivitis (Ueta2010Prostaglandin).

The EP3 receptor is also implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, where it mediates PGE2-induced contraction in human blood vessels, such as coronary and pulmonary arteries (Norel2020International). Additionally, the receptor is involved in platelet function, where it inhibits cAMP production via Gi protein coupling, thereby potentiating platelet aggregation (Norel2020International).

EP3 has multiple isoforms due to mRNA splice variants, which differ in their signaling capabilities. These isoforms can activate distinct signaling pathways, such as ERK activation, influencing downstream gene expression and cellular responses (Norel2020International; Israel2009EP3). The receptor's activity is primarily localized to cell membranes, where it modulates immune responses and smooth muscle function.

## Clinical Significance
PTGER3, encoding the prostaglandin E receptor 3, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In ovarian cancer, PTGER3 is associated with tumorigenesis and resistance to cisplatin therapy. High expression levels of PTGER3 correlate with shorter overall and disease-free survival in patients, suggesting its role in poor prognosis. The gene contributes to chemoresistance through the Ras-MAPK/ERK-ETS1-ELK1 signaling pathway, and its silencing can increase sensitivity to cisplatin, reduce cell proliferation, and promote apoptosis in resistant cancer cells (RodriguezAguayo2019PTGER3).

In colorectal cancer, PTGER3 is often hypermethylated, indicating a role in the disease's epigenetic landscape. This hypermethylation is a key mechanism in the deregulation of the PTGS pathway, which is involved in inflammation and cancer progression. PTGER3 overexpression in tumor tissues is linked to increased tumor growth and may contribute to treatment resistance by reactivating cancer stem cells (Cebola2015Epigenetics).

These findings highlight PTGER3 as a potential therapeutic target in both ovarian and colorectal cancers, where its altered expression and interactions contribute significantly to disease pathogenesis and resistance to conventional therapies.

## Interactions
PTGER3, or prostaglandin E receptor 3, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In ovarian cancer, PTGER3 is implicated in the regulation of the Ras-MAPK/ERK-ETS1-ELK1 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for its role in tumorigenesis and resistance to cisplatin therapy. PTGER3 up-regulates this pathway, leading to increased cell growth and reduced apoptosis in cancer cells (RodriguezAguayo2019PTGER3).

PTGER3 also interacts with transcription factors such as ELK1 and ETS1, which bind to the CFTR1 promoter. This interaction is part of the mechanism by which PTGER3 influences drug resistance, particularly by affecting the expression of drug efflux pumps like MDR1 and CFTR1 (RodriguezAguayo2019PTGER3).

In the context of gastric carcinoma, PTGER3 is identified as a key gene in the competing endogenous RNA network influenced by Compound Kushen Injection (CKI). Molecular docking studies have shown that PTGER3 interacts with compounds such as sophoranol, forming hydrophobic bonds with specific residues, which suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer treatment (Zhou2021An). These interactions highlight PTGER3's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
