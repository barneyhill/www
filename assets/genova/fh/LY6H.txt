# LY6H

## Overview
The LY6H gene encodes the protein lymphocyte antigen 6 family member H, which is a member of the Ly6/uPAR superfamily. This protein is characterized by its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, allowing it to attach to the cell membrane, and its LU domain, which features a three-fingered structural motif stabilized by disulfide bridges (Loughner2016Organization). The LY6H protein is primarily involved in the regulation of nicotinic cholinergic signaling within the nervous system, acting as a negative modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 subtype (Moriwaki2020Endogenous). Its structural flexibility and post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, facilitate a range of interactions with membrane components, contributing to its functional role in neuronal activity (Zaigraev2022Orientational). The protein is expressed in both exocrine and endocrine epithelial cells, as well as in the central nervous system, highlighting its significance in various physiological processes (Loughner2016Organization).

## Structure
The LY6H protein is a member of the Ly6/uPAR superfamily, characterized by the LU domain, which features a three-fingered structural motif stabilized by disulfide bridges connecting conserved cysteine residues (Loughner2016Organization). This structure is similar to that of snake venom neurotoxins, with three β-sheet loops (Loughner2016Organization). The LU domain's flexibility allows for a wide range of intermolecular interactions, which is crucial for its function (Loughner2016Organization).

LY6H is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, meaning it is tethered to the cell membrane via a GPI anchor, which is encoded by the third exon of its gene (Moriwaki2020Endogenous; Loughner2016Organization). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which plays a role in its interactions with membrane lipids (Zaigraev2022Orientational). The protein's orientation and interactions with the membrane are influenced by its GPI-anchor and glycosylation, contributing to its stability and function (Zaigraev2022Orientational).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly through its loop II region, which is crucial for its inhibitory function (Moriwaki2020Endogenous). The R38 residue within this loop is essential for binding to α7 nAChRs (Moriwaki2020Endogenous).

## Function
The LY6H gene encodes a protein that is part of the Ly6/uPAR family, which is involved in various physiological functions, particularly in the nervous system. The LY6H protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that plays a role in regulating nicotinic cholinergic signaling, which is crucial for neuronal activity (Zaigraev2022Orientational). This protein is characterized by a LU domain, a compact disulfide-stabilized β-structural core with three protruding loops, which is typical of the Ly6/uPAR family (Zaigraev2022Orientational).

In terms of cellular localization, LY6H is expressed in exocrine and endocrine epithelial cells and the central nervous system (CNS) (Loughner2016Organization). The protein's orientation and interaction with the cell membrane are influenced by its GPI-anchor, which allows it to float at the bilayer surface and interact with various membrane components (Zaigraev2022Orientational). The LY6H protein exhibits high conformational flexibility, which may enable it to interact with multiple targets, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and potentially other unidentified molecular targets (Zaigraev2022Orientational). This flexibility is crucial for its function in healthy human cells, although the specific molecular processes remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
LY6H interacts with the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) at the plasma membrane, where it acts as a negative modulator of receptor activity. This interaction does not affect the intracellular trafficking of α7 nAChR but inhibits ligand-evoked channel activity. The binding of LY6H to α7 nAChR is facilitated by specific residues, particularly the R38 residue in loop II of LY6H, which is crucial for its suppressive effect on receptor currents (Moriwaki2020Endogenous).

LY6H is a GPI-anchored protein, and its inhibitory effect on α7 nAChR is abolished when the GPI-anchor is cleaved, indicating that LY6H acts from the cell surface. Soluble LY6H protein can also decrease α7 nAChR currents, though less effectively than the GPI-anchored form, supporting its role in modulating receptor activity extracellularly (Moriwaki2020Endogenous).

The protein's conformational flexibility, as indicated by its bimodal center of mass distribution, suggests that LY6H may interact with multiple membrane targets, potentially including unidentified targets beyond nAChRs (Zaigraev2022Orientational).
