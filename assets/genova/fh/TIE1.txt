# TIE1

## Overview
TIE1 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1, a receptor tyrosine kinase predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling by modulating endothelial cell function and interacting with the TIE2 receptor to influence angiopoietin signaling pathways. Structurally, TIE1 is characterized by an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like repeats and EGF homology domains, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which are essential for its signaling capabilities (Rees2007The). Functionally, TIE1 acts as a mechanosensor, responding to shear stress and maintaining vessel integrity, particularly at vascular branch points (Dalton2016Constitutive). Clinically, mutations in the TIE1 gene have been linked to primary lymphedema and lymphatic malformations, underscoring its significance in vascular and lymphatic system development and stability (Brouillard2024Lossoffunction; Michelini2020TIE1).

## Structure
The TIE1 protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase primarily expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Its molecular structure includes an extracellular domain composed of three immunoglobulin-like repeats, three epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology domains, followed by another immunoglobulin motif and three fibronectin type III domains (Rees2007The). The intracellular portion contains a tyrosine kinase domain with a kinase insert, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Rees2007The).

TIE1 shares structural similarities with its family member Tie2, with approximately 30% amino acid identity in the extracellular domain and 75% in the intracellular domain (Rees2007The). The protein undergoes regulated proteolytic cleavage, releasing its extracellular domain and generating a 45 kDa truncated receptor fragment consisting of the transmembrane and intracellular domains (Rees2007The).

Post-translational modifications of TIE1 include phosphorylation, which is significant for its function in signaling pathways (Brouillard2024Lossoffunction). The protein's structure is sensitive to specific amino acid changes, which can impact its function in the lymphatic system, as evidenced by the effects of missense variants (Michelini2020TIE1). These structural features and modifications are essential for TIE1's role in vascular and lymphatic system development.

## Function
The TIE1 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling by regulating endothelial cell function. TIE1 interacts with the TIE2 receptor to form heterodimers that inhibit TIE2 activation and clustering, modulating the effects of angiopoietin ligands, particularly Ang1 and Ang2 (Seegar2010Tie1Tie2). In endothelial cells, TIE1 acts as a mechanosensor, responding to shear stress and maintaining vessel integrity, especially at vascular branch points (Dalton2016Constitutive). It is involved in the regulation of endothelial cell survival and function by sustaining Ang1-TIE2 signaling, which is crucial for cell survival pathways such as Akt activation (Savant2015The).

TIE1 is essential for maintaining vascular stability by preventing unnecessary vessel sprouting and ensuring proper endothelial cell proliferation and survival during vessel remodeling (Korhonen2016Tie1). The absence of TIE1 leads to increased TIE2 activity, which can result in enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis and impaired vascular remodeling (Savant2015The). TIE1's role in angiopoietin signaling is context-dependent, contributing to vascular stability and remodeling in both non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions (Korhonen2016Tie1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TIE1 gene have been implicated in the development of primary lymphedema, a condition characterized by tissue swelling due to lymphatic dysfunction. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations in TIE1 can lead to late-onset primary lymphedema, as these mutations result in decreased TIE1 signaling activity, which is crucial for maintaining normal lymphatic vessel function (Brouillard2024Lossoffunction). The study identified several pathogenic variants, including missense mutations such as R983W and M1110R, which alter receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling, contributing to lymphatic dysfunction (Brouillard2024Lossoffunction).

In addition to lymphedema, TIE1 mutations have been associated with lymphatic malformations. The TIE1 gene is considered a candidate for genetic testing in patients with lymphatic malformations, as variants in this gene can lead to functional defects in the lymphatic system (Michelini2020TIE1). Alterations in TIE1 expression or its interactions, such as with the TIE2 receptor, can also impact vascular stability and are linked to conditions like inflammation-induced vascular leakage and potentially atherosclerosis (Korhonen2016Tie1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TIE1 in various vascular and lymphatic disorders.

## Interactions
TIE1 is known to interact with the TIE2 receptor, forming heterodimeric complexes that are crucial for angiopoietin signaling. These interactions are enhanced by angiopoietin stimulation, particularly at endothelial cell junctions, and are important for vascular remodeling and inflammation (Leppänen2017Structural; Korhonen2016Tie1). TIE1 does not directly bind angiopoietins but is phosphorylated in a TIE2-dependent manner, suggesting a complex formation between TIE1 and TIE2 (Korhonen2016Tie1).

The structural basis for TIE1 and TIE2 interaction involves the Fn3 domains, which facilitate heterodimerization through intermolecular β-sheet formation. Mutations in these domains can affect the phosphorylation and activation of TIE2, indicating their importance in receptor signaling (Leppänen2017Structural).

TIE1 also interacts with integrins, such as α5β1 and αVβ3, through its Ig and EGF domains. These interactions are crucial for maintaining endothelial cell stability and are implicated in the response to shear stress. TIE1's association with integrins is not significantly enhanced by fibronectin, unlike TIE2, which suggests distinct roles for these receptors in integrin-mediated signaling (Dalton2016Constitutive).
