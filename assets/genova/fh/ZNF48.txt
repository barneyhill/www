# ZNF48

## Overview
ZNF48 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 48, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. These proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and proliferation. Zinc finger protein 48, in particular, is implicated in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of target genes. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF48 are still under investigation, but its role in transcriptional regulation suggests potential implications in cellular homeostasis and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
