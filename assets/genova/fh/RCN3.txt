# RCN3

## Overview
Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) is a gene that encodes the protein reticulocalbin 3, a member of the CREC protein family, which is characterized by its calcium-binding properties. The protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions as a molecular chaperone, playing a crucial role in protein biosynthesis, modification, and intracellular transport. Reticulocalbin 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of collagen production and extracellular matrix organization, and it has been implicated in postnatal tendon development and fibrotic conditions (MartínezMartínez2017Differential; Park2021Reticulocalbin; Honoré2009The). Additionally, RCN3 is associated with cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and the tumor microenvironment, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies (He2023Reticulocalbin; Ding2022PanCancer).

## Structure
Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) is a member of the CREC protein family, characterized by multiple EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs. The primary structure of RCN3 consists of 328 amino acids, including a signal sequence at the N-terminus and an HDEL ER-retention signal at the C-terminus, which are typical features of proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Wu2023TGFβ1RCN3TGFBR1; Honoré2009The). The secondary structure includes six EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that facilitate calcium binding, crucial for the protein's function as a molecular chaperone in the secretory pathway (Honoré2009The).

The tertiary structure of RCN3 involves the three-dimensional folding of these EF-hand motifs, stabilized by calcium ions, which is essential for its role in protein synthesis, modification, and intracellular transport (MartínezMartínez2017Differential). While specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, RCN3 is known to interact with other proteins, such as proPACE4, suggesting potential protein-protein interactions (Honoré2009The).

RCN3 may undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions. The gene may also produce splice variants, leading to different isoforms with potential functional diversity (Honoré2009The).

## Function
Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) is a calcium-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a significant role in protein biosynthesis and transportation. It is involved in various molecular processes, including the organization of the extracellular matrix and signal transduction (He2023Reticulocalbin). RCN3 functions as a molecular chaperone, particularly interacting with the precursor of subtilisin-like proprotein convertase, proPACE4, suggesting a role in the retention and proper processing of proteins within the ER (Honoré2009The).

In healthy human cells, RCN3 is implicated in the regulation of collagen production. It acts as a negative mediator of collagen type I and III production in human cardiac fibroblasts, influencing intracellular pathways such as Akt phosphorylation (MartínezMartínez2017Differential). This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular function and structure, as excessive collagen production can lead to fibrotic conditions.

RCN3 is also involved in postnatal tendon development, where it regulates collagen fibrillogenesis and tenocyte maturation. Its deficiency leads to decreased tendon thickness and altered collagen fibril ultrastructure, highlighting its importance in maintaining tendon structure and function (Park2021Reticulocalbin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RCN3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. RCN3 is generally overexpressed in many cancer types, including lung squamous cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma, while it is underexpressed in kidney chromophobe and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (Ding2022PanCancer). High RCN3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, such as colorectal cancer, where it correlates with larger tumor size, nodal metastasis, and advanced stages, leading to poorer overall survival (Ding2022PanCancer). In glioblastoma, RCN3 is significantly overexpressed, particularly in the mesenchymal subtype, and is linked to poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (He2023Reticulocalbin).

RCN3 also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment by interacting with immune cells. It is positively correlated with tumor-associated macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which may affect the efficacy of immunotherapy (Ding2022PanCancer). In glioblastoma, RCN3 is crucial for the proliferation and self-renewal of glioma stem cells, indicating its role in tumor initiation and progression (He2023Reticulocalbin). These findings suggest that RCN3 could be a potential target for therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with EZH2, an epigenetic methyltransferase. RCN3 binds to EZH2, reducing its nuclear presence and the associated H3K27me3 enrichment at the TGFBR1 promoter. This interaction relieves transcriptional repression of TGFBR1, facilitating TGFβ1 signaling and fibroblast activation in pulmonary fibrosis. The direct interaction between RCN3 and EZH2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Bio-Layer Interferometry, with a dissociation constant of 1.54 µM (Wu2023TGFβ1RCN3TGFBR1).

RCN3 also interacts with proteins involved in the collagen network, particularly in cardiac fibroblasts. It has been shown to decrease collagen type I and III production, suggesting a role in modulating collagen synthesis. This interaction is mediated through the Akt signaling pathway, where RCN3 increases Akt phosphorylation, leading to its antifibrotic effects (MartínezMartínez2017Differential).

In cancer, RCN3 is associated with tumor-associated macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, indicating its involvement in the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. It is linked to immunosuppressive molecules and chemokines, suggesting a role in tumor immune regulation (Ding2022PanCancer).
