# GRIK2

## Overview
The GRIK2 gene encodes the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 2, commonly referred to as GluK2, which is a critical component of kainate receptors in the central nervous system. These receptors are categorized as ionotropic glutamate receptors and play a pivotal role in mediating excitatory neurotransmission by facilitating ion flow across neuronal membranes upon glutamate binding (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The GluK2 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple domains such as the N-terminal domain, agonist binding domain, and transmembrane domain, which contribute to its function as an ion channel (Hansen2021Structure). The gene's expression and the protein's function are modulated through mechanisms like RNA editing and alternative splicing, which influence receptor properties such as calcium permeability and synaptic plasticity (Hansen2021Structure; Barbon2001Genomic). GRIK2 and its encoded protein are implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, underscoring their significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and development (Guzmán2017A; Córdoba2014Expanding).

## Structure
The GRIK2 gene encodes the GluK2 subunit of kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors, which are involved in excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The primary structure of the GluK2 protein consists of 908 amino acids in its longest splice variant (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The protein features several domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), the agonist binding domain (ABD), the transmembrane domain (TMD), and the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain (CTD) (Hansen2021Structure). The TMD is composed of transmembrane helices M1, M3, and M4, which contribute to the ion channel's core and share sequence homology with potassium channels (Traynelis2010Glutamate).

The GluK2 subunit can undergo RNA editing at the Q/R site, which alters its calcium permeability and sensitivity to polyamine channel blockers (Hansen2021Structure). This editing, along with alternative splicing, results in multiple isoforms with variations in the C-terminal domains and transmembrane regions, affecting the receptor's molecular structure and function (Barbon2001Genomic). The quaternary structure of GluK2 involves its assembly into tetrameric complexes, which can form either homotetramers or heterotetramers with other kainate receptor subunits (Hansen2021Structure).

## Function
The GRIK2 gene encodes the GluK2 subunit of kainate receptors, which are ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. These receptors are crucial for fast excitatory neurotransmission by mediating ion flow across the cell membrane upon glutamate binding (Barbon2001Genomic). GluK2-containing receptors are expressed in various brain regions, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum, where they play roles in modulating synaptic integration, frequency-dependent spike transmission, and excitatory and inhibitory tone (Hansen2021Structure; Traynelis2010Glutamate).

GluK2 receptors are involved in both ionotropic and metabotropic signaling. They participate in G-protein-coupled signaling cascades, modulating afterhyperpolarization conductance in pyramidal cells, which is important for neuronal excitability (Traynelis2010Glutamate). The receptors undergo RNA editing at specific sites, such as the Q/R site, which affects calcium permeability and channel conductance, influencing synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling (Hansen2021Structure).

The presence of auxiliary subunits like Neto1 and Neto2 modulates the function of GluK2-containing receptors, affecting their gating, trafficking, and synaptic targeting, which are essential for proper neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (Hansen2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIK2 gene, which encodes a subunit of the kainate receptor, have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. A notable mutation, the A657T variant, is a gain-of-function mutation that causes constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to severe neurodevelopmental delays, congenital gait ataxia, and intellectual disability in affected individuals. This mutation alters the biophysical properties of the receptor, impacting neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Guzmán2017A).

In another study, a homozygous nonsense mutation (p.Arg198*) in the GRIK2 gene was identified in a consanguineous family, where affected siblings exhibited intellectual disability, epilepsy, dystonia, and behavioral disorders. This mutation was shown to co-segregate with intellectual disability, highlighting its potential role in familial neurodevelopmental disorders (Córdoba2014Expanding).

Additionally, copy number variations in GRIK2 have been associated with intellectual disabilities, although the pathogenic burden is considered limited. A specific complex loss-of-function mutation involving deletions and inversions in GRIK2 has been linked to non-syndromic intellectual disability, resulting in the loss of critical domains of the GluK2 protein and leading to severe cognitive impairment (Soto2014Glutamate).

## Interactions
GRIK2, also known as GluK2, is a subunit of kainate receptors that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function and localization. The C-terminus of GluK2 interacts with the neuronal cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin, which is essential for its recruitment to mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus (Evans2017Exciting). GluK2 also binds to the synaptic scaffold protein PSD95 through its C-terminal PDZ ligands, which is important for kainate receptor synaptic localization (Hu2022Ultrarare; Evans2017Exciting). The presence of ultrarare mutations in GRIK2, such as GRIK2 p.Arg300Ter, can disrupt its interaction with PSD95, potentially affecting synaptic function (Hu2022Ultrarare).

GluK2 interacts with C1q-like proteins, specifically C1ql2 and C1ql3, which bind to its N-terminal domains and contribute to the localization of kainate receptors at mossy fiber synapses (Hansen2021Structure). The transmembrane proteins Neto1 and Neto2 associate with kainate receptor complexes through binding to GluK2 subunits, although their role in GluK2 trafficking and synaptic incorporation is not fully established (Evans2017Exciting). GluK2 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by PKC and ubiquitination by Parkin, which regulate its surface expression and degradation (Evans2017Exciting).
