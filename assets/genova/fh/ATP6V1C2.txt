# ATP6V1C2

## Overview
ATP6V1C2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit C2, a component of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and plays a crucial role in the acidification of intracellular compartments such as endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus. The ATP6V1C2 gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the kidney and lung, where it contributes to processes like urinary acidification and pulmonary surfactant storage (Feng2005Differential; Smith2002Molecular). The protein's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including its overexpression in colon adenocarcinoma and its potential role in distal renal tubular acidosis (Cornière2020Identification; Li2022High).

## Structure
The ATP6V1C2 gene encodes a protein that is 381 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 43.9 kDa (Smith2002Molecular). The C2 subunit is a hydrophilic protein with no apparent transmembrane segments, suggesting its location in the peripherally associated V1 sector of the H+-ATPase (Smith2002Molecular). The primary structure of ATP6V1C2 is defined by its amino acid sequence, but specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Smith2002Molecular).

The ATP6V1C2 gene produces two distinct splice variants: C2-a and C2-b. C2-a contains an insertion of 46 residues and is specific to the lung, while C2-b lacks this insertion and is found in the kidney and testis (Rahman2016Binding). The C2 isoform tends to dimerize, with more non-conserved amino acids at the dimer interface compared to the C1 isoform, which may contribute to its dimerization (Rahman2016Binding). The electrostatic potential analysis indicated that C2 has more non-conserved acidic residues at the interface compared to C1 (Rahman2016Binding). Homology modeling suggests a head-to-tail dimer formation similar to yeast (Rahman2016Binding).

## Function
The ATP6V1C2 gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically the C2 subunit of the V1 domain. This complex is essential for acidifying various intracellular compartments, such as endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi apparatus, which is crucial for numerous cellular processes including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Feng2005Differential). The C2 subunit is a hydrophilic protein that is part of the peripheral V1 sector of the V-ATPase, and it is proposed to play a role in the assembly or activity of the V-ATPase complex (Smith2002Molecular).

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1C2 is expressed predominantly in the kidney and a few other tissues, suggesting a role in tissue-specific functions such as urinary acidification and bone resorption (Smith2002Molecular). The protein is also involved in maintaining the acidic environment of lamellar bodies in lung cells, which is important for the storage and secretion of pulmonary surfactant (Feng2005Differential). The differential expression of ATP6V1C2 in various tissues and its involvement in specific cellular compartments highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ATP6V1C2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), ATP6V1C2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and increased metastatic potential. This overexpression is associated with a higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) score and reduced CD8 T effector pathway activity, suggesting a role in tumor progression and immune evasion. The gene's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway further supports its contribution to COAD tumorigenesis and metastasis (Li2022High).

In the context of renal health, ATP6V1C2 has been identified as a novel candidate gene for distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by impaired urinary acidification. Mutations in ATP6V1C2 can disrupt the function of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, essential for proton secretion and acid-base balance in the kidney. A specific mutation, changing isoleucine 168 to threonine, has been shown to impair the enzyme's function, contributing to dRTA (Cornière2020Identification).

In esophageal carcinoma, ATP6V1C2 expression is lower compared to other V-ATPase subunits, suggesting a distinct role in tumorigenesis. The expression pattern of ATP6V1C2, along with other subunits, may serve as a diagnostic marker for esophageal tumors (CoutoVieira2020Multicancer).

## Interactions
ATP6V1C2 is a subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, which is involved in acidifying intracellular compartments. This protein is part of the V1 domain of the V-ATPase and interacts with other subunits to form the functional enzyme complex. The V-ATPase complex is composed of two main sectors: the V1 domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and the V0 domain, which translocates protons across membranes. ATP6V1C2, as a component of the V1 domain, plays a role in the assembly and activity of the V-ATPase complex (Smith2002Molecular).

In the context of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), ATP6V1C2 has been shown to interact with other genes and proteins involved in cancer progression. The study by Li et al. identified interactions between ATP6V1C2 and other ATP family members, such as ATP6V0A4, ATP6V1B1, and ATP6V1E2, which were upregulated in COAD tissues. These interactions were analyzed using the GeneMANIA and STRING databases, which revealed a network of co-expressed genes and protein-protein interactions (Li2022High). However, specific direct interactions of ATP6V1C2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in the context of COAD or other conditions are not detailed in the available literature.
