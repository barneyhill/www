# CNIH4

## Overview
CNIH4, or cornichon homolog 4, is a gene that encodes the cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 4, a transmembrane protein involved in the early secretory pathway. This protein plays a critical role in the trafficking and maturation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by facilitating their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and ultimately to the cell surface. CNIH4 interacts with components of the COPII vesicle machinery, such as Sec23 and Sec24, acting as a cargo-sorting receptor that ensures the proper incorporation of GPCRs into transport vesicles. The protein's function is crucial for the maturation and function of GPCRs, and its expression levels have been linked to various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Sauvageau2014CNIH4; Liu2022Potential; Mishra2019The).

## Structure
The CNIH4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cornichon family, involved in the early secretory pathway, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. CNIH4 is predicted to have three transmembrane domains, with a cytosolic N-terminus and a luminal C-terminus (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). There are splice variants of CNIH4, with one variant lacking the third transmembrane domain, resulting in a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. This structural difference may affect its interaction with other proteins, as evidenced by different BRET signals observed in experiments (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). The longer splice variant retains all three transmembrane domains, similar to homologues found in yeast and Drosophila (Sauvageau2014CNIH4).

CNIH4 interacts selectively with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in their maturation and trafficking. The protein's localization to the ER and Golgi has been confirmed through immunofluorescence microscopy, showing colocalization with ER-resident proteins (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). CNIH4's interaction with the COPII vesicle machinery, particularly with Sec23 and Sec24, suggests a role in facilitating the ER exit of GPCRs (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). Specific details on post-translational modifications or prominent folds are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CNIH4, or cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 4, plays a crucial role in the trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human cells. It is primarily involved in the export of newly synthesized GPCRs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface, a process essential for the proper maturation and function of these receptors (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). CNIH4 interacts with components of the COPII coat complex, specifically Sec23 and Sec24, which are vital for the formation of transport vesicles that mediate ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). This interaction suggests that CNIH4 acts as a cargo-sorting receptor, facilitating the recruitment of GPCRs into COPII vesicles for ER export (Sauvageau2014CNIH4).

CNIH4 is selective in its interactions, associating with various GPCR families but not with other transmembrane proteins like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). It is localized in the early secretory pathway, particularly in the ER and Golgi apparatus, where it influences the maturation and trafficking of GPCRs (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). Overexpression of CNIH4 can rescue the maturation of mutant GPCRs that are otherwise retained in the ER, highlighting its role in promoting their exit and proper cellular localization (Sauvageau2014CNIH4).

## Clinical Significance
CNIH4 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), CNIH4 is expressed at higher levels and is associated with worse overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The overexpression of CNIH4 in HNSC is likely due to an increased gene copy number, and it is correlated with cancer stemness, cell cycle activity, and DNA repair processes. These findings indicate that CNIH4 may contribute to tumor progression and could be a target for therapeutic intervention in HNSC (Liu2022Potential; Li2021Potential).

In colon cancer, CNIH4 is part of a pro-metastatic regulatory loop involving TMED9, TGFα, and GLI1. It plays a crucial role in promoting metastasis by enhancing the secretion of TGFα, a ligand for EGFR, which is essential for metastatic progression. The regulation of CNIH4 by TMED9 suggests its involvement in a complex signaling network that influences metastatic states in colon cancer cells. CNIH4's expression levels have predictive value for disease-free survival, highlighting its clinical significance in assessing the metastatic potential of colon cancer (Mishra2019The).

## Interactions
CNIH4 interacts with components of the COPII coat complex, specifically the Sec23 and Sec24 isoforms (Sec24B and Sec24D), which are involved in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins. This interaction suggests that CNIH4 may function as a cargo-sorting receptor, facilitating the recruitment of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to ER-exit sites for incorporation into COPII vesicles (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). The interaction between CNIH4 and Sec23-Sec24 is specific, as no interaction was detected with a shorter splice variant of CNIH4 lacking the cytoplasmic loop domain, which is essential for COPII interaction (Sauvageau2014CNIH4).

CNIH4 also interacts with newly synthesized GPCRs, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), and plays a role in their export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). It has been shown to interact with the immature core-glycosylated form of β2AR, which is an ER form of the receptor, but not with the fully glycosylated forms present at the plasma membrane (Sauvageau2014CNIH4). This indicates that CNIH4 acts as a sorting molecule targeting GPCRs to COPII-coated budding sites of the ER (Sauvageau2014CNIH4).
