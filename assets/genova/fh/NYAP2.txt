# NYAP2

## Overview
NYAP2, or Neuronal Tyrosine-Phosphorylated Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Adaptor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neuronal signaling pathways. The protein encoded by NYAP2 functions as an adaptor protein, playing a critical role in linking phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling to cytoskeletal dynamics through its interaction with the WAVE1 complex, which is essential for actin polymerization (Mack2011New). This protein is implicated in various neurodevelopmental processes and has been associated with the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through its involvement in the Contactins-NYAPs-WAVE1 pathway (Guo2017Genomewide). Additionally, NYAP2 is a substrate for Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), indicating its role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuronal development and function (Tanga2019The). The study of NYAP2 and its interactions provides insights into its potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.

## Interactions
NYAP2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal signaling pathways. It interacts with the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which is essential for activating PI3K and downstream signaling pathways such as Akt and Rac (Mack2011New). This interaction is significant in the context of actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics, as NYAP2 links PI3K signaling to the WAVE1 complex, a key player in Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (Mack2011New).

NYAP2 is also part of the Contactins-NYAPs-WAVE1 pathway, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This pathway involves interactions with proteins such as NCKAP1, ABI2, CYFIP2, and HSP300, which are components of the WAVE1 complex (Guo2017Genomewide). The phosphorylation of NYAP2 is regulated by Contactin5, a GPI-anchored cell adhesion protein, which acts as an upstream regulator (Mack2011New).

Additionally, NYAP2 is identified as a substrate for Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPRZ), where its tyrosine phosphorylation is enhanced by pleiotrophin treatment, suggesting a role in the PI3K-AKT pathway (Tanga2019The). These interactions highlight NYAP2's involvement in neurodevelopmental processes and its potential link to disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.
