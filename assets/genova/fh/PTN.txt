# PTN

## Overview
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a gene that encodes the pleiotrophin protein, a heparin-binding growth factor involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The pleiotrophin protein is characterized by its two thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) domains, which facilitate interactions with glycosaminoglycans and other receptors, playing a crucial role in angiogenesis and neural development (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin; Ryan2021Pleiotrophin). As a growth factor, pleiotrophin is implicated in cancer progression, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis through its interactions with receptors such as protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTPβ/ζ) and integrins (Meng2000Pleiotrophin; Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). The gene's expression is significant in various tissues during development, and its dysregulation is associated with several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Vanderwinden1992Cellular; Shi2017Tumour-associated).

## Structure
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a protein characterized by its 136 amino acid sequence, following the removal of a 32-residue secretory signal, resulting in a mature form (Wang2020Pleiotrophin:). The protein structure includes two thrombospondin type-1 repeat (TSR) domains, which are crucial for its interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and other receptors (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin; Ryan2021Pleiotrophin). These TSR domains are stabilized by five intrachain disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Hamma‐Kourbali2007Inhibition; Muramatsu2002Midkine).

The N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of PTN are linked by a flexible region, with each domain containing three antiparallel beta strands (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin; Muramatsu2002Midkine). The protein is highly basic, with a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 9.66, and lacks N-glycosylation and other post-translational modifications (Wang2020Pleiotrophin:). PTN's termini are unstructured, with clusters of basic amino acids that facilitate interactions with GAGs (Miles2022Pleiotrophin; Ryan2021Pleiotrophin).

PTN does not typically form oligomers due to electrostatic repulsion, although it can form dimers in vivo, potentially enhancing receptor affinity (Wang2020Pleiotrophin:). The protein's structure is highly flexible, allowing it to adapt to various binding partners (Ryan2021Pleiotrophin).

## Function
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a heparin-binding growth factor that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is particularly significant in angiogenesis, where it induces the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells into tube-like structures, essential steps in the formation of new blood vessels (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). PTN interacts with its receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTPβ/δ), to regulate these processes, influencing cancer cell functions and growth (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin).

In the nervous system, PTN is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth and has mitogenic activity towards fibroblasts, indicating its role in neural development and tissue repair (Vanderwinden1992Cellular). PTN is also expressed in various tissues during development, such as the brain and mesenchyme of organs like the lung and kidney, suggesting its involvement in growth and differentiation (Vanderwinden1992Cellular).

PTN's interaction with integrins, such as Mac-1, facilitates leukocyte adhesion and migration, highlighting its role in inflammation and immune responses (Shen2017Pleiotrophin). Additionally, PTN is active in the extracellular matrix, where it influences cell signaling pathways, including those involving ALK and ERK1/2, contributing to its diverse biological functions (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin).

## Clinical Significance
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor progression and metastasis. In melanoma, PTN is up-regulated compared to nevi, correlating with increased metastasis risk. Inactivation of PTN in melanoma cells inhibits tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). In prostate cancer, PTN is essential for cell migration and growth, with its depletion leading to reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). PTN is also up-regulated in testicular cancer and ovarian carcinoma, where it may serve as a biomarker (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin).

In glioblastoma, PTN expression is associated with poor survival outcomes. It is secreted by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promotes glioblastoma stem cell maintenance through the PTN-PTPRZ1 signaling axis. Disrupting this pathway reduces tumor growth and improves survival in animal models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2017Tumour-associated). PTN also plays a role in glioma invasion, particularly in the subventricular zone, where it acts as a chemoattractant for glioma cells (Qin2017Neural). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PTN in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Pleiotrophin (PTN) is known for its interactions with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. PTN interacts with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta (RPTPβ/ζ), acting as a natural ligand that inactivates the phosphatase activity of RPTPβ/ζ. This interaction leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, a key signaling molecule involved in cellular growth and differentiation (Meng2000Pleiotrophin). PTN also competes with vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) for binding to RPTPβ/ζ, affecting endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin).

PTN interacts with integrin αvβ3, which is crucial for angiogenesis and tumor growth, and with nucleolin (NCL) on the surface of endothelial and cancer cells, mediating cell migration (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). It also binds to neuropilin-1, promoting endothelial cell migration and tumor invasion (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin). PTN's interaction with syndecan-3 is involved in cancer cell migration and metastasis (Papadimitriou2016Pleiotrophin).

Additionally, PTN interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a flexible and adaptable manner, with the charge density of the GAGs being a key determinant of interaction strength (Ryan2021Pleiotrophin). These interactions highlight PTN's role in modulating cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression and angiogenesis.
