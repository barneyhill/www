# LGALS13

## Overview
LGALS13 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin 13, which is a member of the galectin family, known for their carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin 13 is predominantly expressed in the placenta and plays a vital role in modulating the maternal immune response during pregnancy. It is involved in processes such as inducing apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes and promoting angiogenesis, which are crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and supporting placental function (Balogh2019Placental). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as annexin II and beta/gamma actin, facilitate its localization and function within the syncytiotrophoblast, a key layer of the placenta (Than2014Placental). Alterations in LGALS13 expression are associated with pregnancy-related disorders, including preeclampsia, highlighting its clinical significance in maternal-fetal health (Than2014Placental).

## Function
Galectin-13 (LGALS13) is a protein primarily expressed in the placenta, where it plays a crucial role in regulating the maternal immune response during pregnancy. It is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast at the maternal-fetal interface and is involved in inducing apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes, which helps maintain immune tolerance and prevent the rejection of the semi-allogeneic fetus (Balogh2019Placental). Galectin-13 increases the expression of CD95 and CD25 on T cells, enhancing their sensitivity to apoptosis, and induces the production of cytokines such as IL-8, which may promote angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface (Balogh2019Placental).

The protein is also involved in the differentiation and fusion of villous trophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts, a process essential for placental function and regulated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) (Than2014Placental). Galectin-13's expression is developmentally regulated and decreases in conditions like preeclampsia and miscarriages, which are linked to maternal anti-fetal rejection (Balogh2019Placental). Through these mechanisms, Galectin-13 contributes to creating an immunoprivileged environment at the maternal-fetal interface, supporting successful pregnancy outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LGALS13 gene, which encodes galectin 13, are associated with several pregnancy-related disorders, most notably preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a serious condition characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, often leading to significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Reduced expression of LGALS13 in the placenta is linked to preeclampsia, particularly in severe preterm cases, and is associated with impaired trophoblast syncytialization, a process crucial for normal placental development (Than2014Placental). 

Specific genetic variants of LGALS13, such as the 'truncated' variant due to a deletion in exon 3, are linked to severe early preeclampsia. This variant affects the carbohydrate recognition domain, impacting immune tolerance during pregnancy (Sammar2019Galectin). Another variant, the '-98A/C' promoter polymorphism, influences PP13 expression levels and is associated with preeclampsia risk (Than2014Placental).

Alterations in PP13 levels are also significant. Lower maternal serum concentrations of PP13 in the first trimester are associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, while higher concentrations in later trimesters are linked to ischemic placental stress and systemic inflammation (Than2014Placental). These changes in PP13 levels have been used to develop diagnostic tests for predicting preeclampsia (Than2014Placental).

## Interactions
LGALS13, also known as galectin 13, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function during pregnancy. It interacts with annexin II and beta/gamma actin, which are important for its localization and function in the syncytiotrophoblast, a layer of the placenta. These interactions facilitate the formation of 'galectin-glycan lattices' on cell surfaces, which are essential for cellular interactions and signaling (Than2014Placental). 

LGALS13 also binds to sugar residues of extracellular and connective tissue molecules, aiding in the expansion of uterine arteries and veins through endothelial cell-dependent mechanisms involving eNOS and prostaglandin signaling pathways (Sammar2019Galectin). This binding is mediated by its carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which allows it to interact with glycoconjugates on cell surfaces (Than2014Placental).

Additionally, LGALS13 has been shown to bind to the B and AB antigens of the ABO blood groups, influencing the availability of free PP13 in the blood and affecting preeclampsia risk assessment (Sammar2019Galectin). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of LGALS13 in placental function and immune regulation during pregnancy.
