# EFCAB10

## Overview
EFCAB10 is a gene that encodes the protein EF-hand calcium binding domain 10, which is characterized by its EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain capable of binding calcium ions. This protein is involved in calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The EF-hand calcium binding domain 10 protein plays a role in modulating intracellular calcium levels, thereby influencing cellular activities such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. Although the specific functions and interactions of EFCAB10 are not fully elucidated, its involvement in calcium-dependent pathways suggests it may have significant implications in cellular physiology and potentially in disease mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and potential therapeutic targets associated with EFCAB10.
