# KRT38

## Overview
KRT38 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 38, a type I cytokeratin involved in the formation of intermediate filaments within epithelial cells. As a structural protein, keratin 38 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the mechanical stability and resilience of cells, particularly in tissues such as skin, hair, and nails. The protein is characterized by its alpha-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update). Keratin 38 is predominantly expressed in the cortex cells of the hair, contributing to the structural integrity of hair fibers (Sulayman2018Association). Its interactions with other keratins and regulation by transcription factors like HOXC13 underscore its importance in hair follicle development and epithelial tissue protection (Wang2018The; Zhang2023Labelfree).

## Structure
KRT38, or keratin 38, is a type I cytokeratin that forms part of the intermediate filament network in epithelial cells. The primary structure of KRT38 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This rod domain is characterized by a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the protein's structural integrity (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of KRT38 predominantly features alpha-helices, which contribute to its ability to form stable coiled-coil structures. These coiled-coil formations are crucial for the tertiary structure, allowing KRT38 to interact with other keratin proteins to form intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update).

In terms of quaternary structure, KRT38 typically heterodimerizes with type II keratins, forming antiparallel tetramers that are the building blocks of intermediate filaments. This interaction is facilitated by a hydrophobic interface, which is critical for the stability and assembly of the filament network (Ho2022Update).

Common post-translational modifications of KRT38 include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Ho2022Update).

## Function
KRT38, a type I keratin gene, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of epithelial cells. Keratins, including KRT38, are intermediate filament proteins that provide mechanical support and resilience to cells, particularly in the skin, hair, and nails. In humans, KRT38 is distributed in the cortex cells of the hair cortex layer, where it is composed of microfibrils and macrofibrils, indicating its role in hair structure (Sulayman2018Association). 

The protein is involved in forming stable heterodimers and homodimers, contributing to the cellular stability and protection against physical stress (Ho2022Update). KRT38 is part of the hair-nails-tongue keratin group, which evolved to adapt to terrestrial life, providing protection from friction and dehydration (Ho2022Update). 

Although specific expression data for KRT38 in human tissues is limited, it is known that keratins are highly expressed in tissues like hair, nails, and tongue, which are not included in some expression databases (Ho2022Update). The protein's role in maintaining the structural integrity of skin epidermis is crucial for the organismal outcome of providing resilience and protection to epithelial tissues (Zhang2023Labelfree).

## Interactions
KRT38, a type I keratin protein, is involved in various interactions that contribute to the structural integrity of hair fibers. In Inner Mongolia Cashmere Goats, KRT38 is expressed in both down hair (DH) and guard hair (GH), and it is part of a network of interactions with other keratins, such as KRT1. This network suggests that KRT38 plays a role in the structural composition of hair fibers, as indicated by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses (Zhang2023Labelfree).

The transcription factor HOXC13 has been shown to regulate the expression of KRT38. Wild-type HOXC13 can up-regulate the promoter activity of KRT38, while mutations in HOXC13 impair this regulatory function. This interaction highlights the role of HOXC13 in the regulation of keratin genes, including KRT38, during hair follicle development (Wang2018The).

In Changthangi goats, KRT38 is identified as a significant node in network analyses, indicating its involvement in the structural integrity and quality of hair fibers. This suggests that KRT38 interacts with other keratin genes to influence hair fiber characteristics (Ahlawat2020Skin).
