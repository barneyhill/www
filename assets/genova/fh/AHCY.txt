# AHCY

## Overview
The AHCY gene encodes the enzyme adenosylhomocysteinase, a critical component in the methionine metabolism pathway. This enzyme is classified as a hydrolase and is responsible for the reversible conversion of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into adenosine and L-homocysteine, a reaction essential for maintaining cellular methylation balance. The AHCY protein is a tetrameric enzyme, highly conserved across species, and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, functioning in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of SAH, which can inhibit methyltransferases and disrupt methylation processes vital for gene expression and epigenetic regulation (Grbeša2017Mutations; Vizán2021Functional). Mutations in the AHCY gene can lead to S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder with significant clinical implications (Barić2004S).

## Structure
The AHCY protein, also known as adenosylhomocysteinase, is a tetrameric enzyme composed of four identical subunits, each containing 431 amino acids (Hu1999Crystal). The enzyme's structure includes three main domains: the catalytic domain, the NAD+ binding domain, and a small C-terminal domain. The catalytic domain spans residues 1-181 and 352-402, while the NAD+ binding domain includes residues 182-351, and the C-terminal domain comprises residues 403-431 (Hu1999Crystal). 

The secondary structure of AHCY is characterized by 16 alpha-helices and 15 beta-strands, forming an ellipsoidal shape with a typical alpha/beta twisted open sheet structure (Hu1999Crystal). The NAD+ binding domain forms the core of the tetramer, contributing significantly to the enzyme's structural stability (Hu1999Crystal). 

In terms of quaternary structure, AHCY forms a homotetramer with pseudo-222 symmetry, where the subunits are arranged around a central channel lined with hydrophilic residues. This channel contains NAD+ molecules and water, although its biological role is not fully understood (Hu1999Crystal). The enzyme's structure allows for flexibility in the catalytic sites, with the catalytic domain moving towards the NAD+ binding domain during the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (Hu1999Crystal). 

The AHCY protein is highly conserved, with the rat enzyme being 97% identical to the human enzyme, indicating a strong evolutionary conservation of its structure and function (Hu1999Crystal).

## Function
Adenosylhomocysteinase (AHCY) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, responsible for the reversible catalysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into adenosine and L-homocysteine. This reaction is vital for maintaining the balance of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and SAH, which is essential for the cell's methylation capacity. Methylation is a key cellular process affecting DNA, RNA, and proteins, and is involved in gene expression regulation and epigenetic modifications (Vizán2021Functional). AHCY's activity is necessary to prevent the accumulation of SAH, a potent inhibitor of methyltransferases, thereby ensuring proper methylation reactions (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

AHCY is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with methyltransferases to enhance transmethylation efficiency (Grbeša2017Mutations). The enzyme's function is influenced by its structural integrity and intracellular localization, with its nucleocytoplasmic distribution being crucial for its role in cellular metabolism (Grbeša2017Mutations). AHCY also plays a role in circadian transcription and gene expression, interacting with components of the circadian clock to maintain proper circadian rhythms (Greco2020S-adenosyl-).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AHCY gene, which encodes the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, lead to a rare genetic disorder known as S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency. This condition disrupts methionine metabolism and is characterized by a range of clinical manifestations, including neuromuscular symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delay, and myopathy. Patients often exhibit elevated plasma levels of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), along with reduced enzymatic activity of AHCY (Barić2004S; Buist2006S‐Adenosylhomocysteine).

The deficiency is associated with various biochemical abnormalities, including elevated creatine kinase levels and abnormal DNA methylation patterns, which may contribute to the observed muscle and neurodevelopmental issues (Barić2005S‐Adenosylhomocysteine; Petković2022Case). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg49Cys and p.Asp86Gly, have been identified as significantly reducing the enzyme's catalytic activity, leading to severe clinical outcomes (Vugrek2009Sadenosylhomocysteine).

Treatment strategies, including dietary methionine restriction and supplementation with creatine and phosphatidylcholine, have shown some success in improving symptoms and biochemical markers in affected individuals (Barić2005S‐Adenosylhomocysteine; Petković2022Case).

## Interactions
AHCY, or adenosylhomocysteinase, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular methylation processes. AHCY self-associates to form hydrolytically active tetramers, primarily through its C-terminal domain (Lepur2016Combining). It interacts with AHCYL1, a structurally similar protein, through their C-termini, and this interaction has been confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation and BiFC assays (Grbeša2017Mutations; Lepur2016Combining). AHCYL1 influences the nuclear translocation of AHCY, affecting its subcellular localization (Grbeša2017Mutations).

AHCY also interacts with galectin-3, a protein involved in various cellular processes. This interaction was identified using a BiFC assay and is observed in multiple fusion topologies, although a mutant form of AHCY (nAHCY) does not interact with galectin-3 (Lepur2016Combining). The interaction between AHCY and galectin-3 localizes in endosomal compartments and the Golgi apparatus, indicating a role in vesicular structures (Lepur2016Combining).

AHCY's interaction with nucleic acids is suggested by its association with chromatin, where it is linked to ribosomal protein gene transcription and stem cell proliferation. It occupies transcription start sites of active genes, facilitating mRNA cap methylation in embryonic stem cells (Aranda2019Chromatin).
