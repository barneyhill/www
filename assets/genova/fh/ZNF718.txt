# ZNF718

## Overview
ZNF718 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 718, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes. The zinc finger protein 718 is implicated in various biological functions, including gene regulation and transcriptional processes, and has been associated with several diseases and conditions, such as periodontitis, cancer, schizophrenia, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Toren2014Novel; Zhu2018Systematic; Hernández2021ZNF718). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential significance in both normal physiological and pathological contexts.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF718 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in gene regulation and transcriptional processes. In periodontitis, ZNF718 is differentially hypermethylated, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis through altered methylation patterns. This hypermethylation is associated with immune-related processes, such as antigen processing and presentation, indicating a potential role in inflammatory responses (Hernández2021ZNF718).

ZNF718 has also been linked to cancer, particularly prostate cancer, where its dysregulation may contribute to tumor formation. This association highlights its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Toren2014Novel). In schizophrenia, ZNF718 carries more de novo mutations in patients compared to unaffected siblings, suggesting a role in disease predisposition. These mutations may affect early neurodevelopmental processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which is crucial for schizophrenia-related traits (Jiang2020Retracted).

Additionally, ZNF718 is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) through copy number variations, indicating its potential role in developmental disorders (Zhu2018Systematic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF718 in various diseases, emphasizing the impact of its genetic and epigenetic alterations.
