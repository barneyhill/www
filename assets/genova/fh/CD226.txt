# CD226

## Overview
CD226, also known as DNAM-1, is a gene that encodes a cell surface receptor protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor is predominantly expressed on immune cells such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes, where it plays a pivotal role in mediating immune responses. The CD226 protein is characterized by its unique structural configuration, featuring two Ig-like domains that facilitate its interaction with ligands such as CD155 and CD112. These interactions are crucial for the activation and cytotoxic functions of NK and T cells, contributing to immune surveillance and the body's defense against tumors. CD226 is also involved in costimulatory signaling pathways that enhance T cell activation and proliferation. Clinically, alterations in CD226 expression and function have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker (Bottino2003Identification; Chiang2022TIGITCD226PVR; Shibuya2003CD226).

## Structure
The CD226 protein, also known as DNAM-1, is characterized by a unique molecular structure within the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features two extracellular Ig-like domains, specifically IgV domains, arranged in a side-by-side configuration, which is distinct from the conventional head-to-tail arrangement seen in other Ig-like molecules (Wang2018Binding). Each IgV domain follows a canonical V-set arrangement pattern with nine strands forming two β-sheets, stabilized by conserved disulfide bonds (Wang2018Binding). The side-by-side arrangement is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds, forming a super β-sheet that provides structural rigidity (Wang2018Binding).

The CD226 protein's ectodomain was crystallized for structural analysis, revealing a spiral-staircase-like super β-ladder (Wang2018Binding). The D1 domain is crucial for binding to its ligand CD155, while the D2 domain provides supportive architecture and also directly interacts with CD155 (Wang2018Binding). The protein lacks a tyrosine-based activation motif in its intracellular domain, instead transmitting signals through phosphorylation and association with integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (Wang2018Binding). The study does not mention specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of CD226 (Wang2018Binding).

## Function
CD226, also known as DNAM-1, is a protein expressed on the surface of various immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. It plays a critical role in immune cell adhesion, activation, and cytotoxicity. CD226 is involved in the costimulatory signaling necessary for the differentiation and proliferation of naive T cells, particularly through its interaction with lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) (Shibuya2003CD226). This interaction is crucial for the LFA-1-mediated costimulatory signals that trigger naive T cell differentiation and proliferation (Shibuya2003CD226).

CD226 also interacts with its ligands, CD155 and CD112, enhancing the cytotoxicity mediated by NK and T cells. This interaction is essential for the immune system's ability to target and destroy cells expressing these ligands (TaharaHanaoka2004Functional). In T cells, CD226 signaling is associated with the promotion of T cell activation and proliferation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFNγ (Lozano2012The). CD226 expression is higher in memory T cells compared to naive T cells and is linked to the promotion of T helper 1 (TH1) responses and the secretion of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), a key cytokine in immune responses (Fuhrman2015Divergent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CD226 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In cancer, CD226 plays a crucial role in antitumor immunity. Its expression is often reduced in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, correlating with an exhaustion phenotype and poor responsiveness to immune-checkpoint therapies (Jin2021Hitting). CD226 is also involved in the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell responses against tumors, where its interaction with ligands like CD155 and CD112 enhances NK cell activity (Du2018CD226). In multiple myeloma, CD226 expression is essential for effective immunosurveillance and the efficacy of certain antimyeloma therapies (Guillerey2015Immunosurveillance).

In autoimmune diseases, the CD226 rs763361 polymorphism is associated with increased susceptibility, particularly in certain ethnic groups and disease subtypes. This polymorphism results in an amino acid substitution that may affect CD226-mediated signaling pathways, serving as a potential biomarker for autoimmune diseases (Bai2019Role). Additionally, CD226 expression on leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is linked to a more differentiated phenotype and favorable prognosis, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Chashchina2021DNAM1CD226). These findings highlight the importance of CD226 in both cancer and autoimmune disease contexts.

## Interactions
CD226, also known as DNAM-1, is a cell surface receptor that interacts with several proteins, primarily through its engagement with the ligands CD155 (PVR) and CD112 (Nectin-2). These interactions are crucial for the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, facilitating immune responses against tumor cells (Bottino2003Identification). CD226 binds to CD155 and CD112, promoting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. This interaction can be inhibited by anti-CD226 monoclonal antibodies, indicating a specific and functional interaction (TaharaHanaoka2004Functional).

The binding of CD226 to CD155 involves a unique side-by-side arrangement of its two IgV domains, with the D1 domain playing a primary role and the D2 domain providing structural support. This interaction is characterized by a double-lock-and-key motif, similar to the binding motif of TIGIT and CD155/CD112 (Wang2018Binding). CD226 also interacts with the integrin LFA-1 in cis, which is important for T cell costimulation and NK cell function (Seth2009Heterogeneous).

CD226 competes with the inhibitory receptor TIGIT for binding to shared ligands, such as CD155, which can modulate immune cell activation and inhibition (Chiang2022TIGITCD226PVR). The interaction between CD226 and its ligands is essential for immune surveillance and has implications for cancer immunotherapy (Chiang2022TIGITCD226PVR).
