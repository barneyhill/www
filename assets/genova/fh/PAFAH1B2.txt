# PAFAH1B2

## Overview
PAFAH1B2 is a gene that encodes the α2 subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) enzyme complex, which is a serine hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and other phospholipids. The protein product of PAFAH1B2, known as the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b catalytic subunit 2, plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including neuronal development, spermatogenesis, and inflammatory response modulation (Kono2019Plateletactivating). The α2 subunit forms part of a heterotetrameric enzyme complex and is characterized by a serine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad, typical of serine hydrolases (Chang2015Selective). PAFAH1B2 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to its involvement in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Ma2018PAFAH1B2; Kono2019Plateletactivating).

## Structure
The PAFAH1B2 gene encodes the α2 subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) enzyme complex. This subunit is a serine hydrolase and forms part of a heterotetrameric enzyme complex with other subunits, including α1 and a noncatalytic β subunit (Kono2019Plateletactivating). The α2 subunit is composed of 229 amino acids and shares approximately 62.4% identity with the α1 subunit, indicating a high degree of sequence similarity (Kono2019Plateletactivating).

The α2 subunit, like its counterpart α1, possesses a serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad, which is typical of serine hydrolases, although it lacks the common GXSXG motif (Chang2015Selective; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The quaternary structure of the PAF-AH I complex involves the α2 subunit forming homodimers or heterodimers with α1, which are embraced by the WD40 repeats of the β subunits, creating an open scissors structure (Kono2019Plateletactivating).

The α2 subunit is involved in various cellular processes, including endosomal membrane trafficking, where it interacts with phosphoinositides and affects dynein-dependent transport (Bechler2011The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a significant role in cellular organization and function.

## Function
PAFAH1B2 encodes a subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in various biological processes. In healthy human cells, the α subunits of PAF-AH, including PAFAH1B2, are implicated in neuronal development and function. During postnatal stages in rat neuronal cells, the catalytic subunits transition from an α1/α2 heterodimer to an α2/α2 homodimer, suggesting a significant role in neuronal development (Kono2019Plateletactivating). Functional hemizygosity of the α1 subunit in humans, due to chromosomal translocation, leads to mental retardation and brain atrophy, highlighting the importance of these subunits in brain function (Kono2019Plateletactivating).

PAFAH1B2 is also involved in spermatogenesis. Mice lacking Pafah1b2 exhibit infertility and impaired spermatogenesis, indicating that the α1 and α2 subunits have somewhat redundant roles in this process (Kono2019Plateletactivating). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism (Kono2019Plateletactivating). These functions underscore the gene's critical role in both cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
PAFAH1B2 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PAFAH1B2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced pTNM staging, regional lymph node involvement, and poorer overall and disease-free survival in patients. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing migratory and invasive behaviors in PDAC cells, and is linked to increased liver metastases in mouse models (Ma2018PAFAH1B2). PAFAH1B2 is also identified as a target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a), suggesting a mechanism by which hypoxia may drive PDAC progression (Ma2018PAFAH1B2).

In the context of other cancers, PAFAH1B2, as part of the α subunits of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases, is associated with high-grade lymphoma due to translocation events affecting its expression. Its knockdown impairs cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression (Kono2019Plateletactivating). Additionally, PAFAH1B2 is involved in neuronal development, with alterations linked to neurological disorders such as mental retardation and ataxia (Kono2019Plateletactivating).

## Interactions
PAFAH1B2, a catalytic subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) complex, participates in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. The Alpha2 subunit of PAFAH1B2 specifically interacts with Dab1, a key mediator in the Reelin signaling pathway, in a phosphorylation-independent manner. This interaction is unique to Alpha2 and is not observed with the Alpha1 subunit (Zhang2009Differential). The binding of Alpha2 to Dab1 can occur even in the absence of Reelin expression, indicating that the interaction does not require Dab1 phosphorylation (Zhang2009Differential).

PAFAH1B2 also interacts with Lis1, a non-catalytic regulatory subunit of the PAF-AH complex. However, Alpha2's binding to Dab1 can disrupt the formation of the Lis1-Dab1 complex, suggesting a modulatory role in protein complex formation (Zhang2009Differential). Additionally, PAFAH1B2 is involved in a potential trimeric complex with VLDLR and Dab1, as it does not interfere with the VLDLR-Dab1 interaction (Zhang2009Differential).

In the context of lung cancer, PAFAH1B2 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA linc00662, which acts as a sponge for miR-145-5p. This microRNA binds to the 3'UTR of PAFAH1B2, negatively regulating its expression (Xu2021Silencing).
