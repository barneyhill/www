# SLITRK2

## Overview
SLITRK2 is a gene that encodes the SLIT and NTRK-like family member 2 protein, a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in synaptic cell adhesion. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for synaptic differentiation and maintenance. SLITRK2 plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of excitatory synapses, particularly in the hippocampal CA1 region, by organizing trans-synaptic signaling pathways and interacting with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases and PDZ domain-containing proteins. These interactions are essential for synapse formation, transmission, and spine development. Mutations in the SLITRK2 gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Afsar2024Lossoffunction; Han2019Slitrk2; El2022SLITRK2).

## Structure
The SLITRK2 protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein that is part of the SLIT and NTRK-like family, characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. It contains two extracellular LRR modules, LRR1 and LRR2, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are flanked by cysteine-rich capping domains (Proenca2011Slitrks; Won2019Synaptic). These LRR domains are crucial for the protein's role in synaptic adhesion and interaction with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs), such as PTPδ (Yamagata2015Structure).

The intracellular domain of SLITRK2 includes an NPxY motif near the juxtamembrane region, which is similar to motifs found in Trk receptors and is involved in intracellular signaling cascades (Proenca2011Slitrks; Won2019Synaptic). SLITRK2 also contains a conserved tyrosine residue near the C-terminus, homologous to Y791 of TrkA, which may mediate tyrosine-kinase signaling cascades (Won2019Synaptic).

SLITRK2 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as PSD-95 and Shank3, through a type I PDZ domain-binding motif at its C-terminus, which is crucial for its role in excitatory synapse development (Loomis2020Identification; Han2019Slitrk2). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in synaptic differentiation and maintenance (Yamagata2015Structure).

## Function
The SLITRK2 gene encodes a synaptic cell adhesion protein that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of excitatory synapses in the brain. SLITRK2 is involved in organizing trans-synaptic signaling pathways by binding to specific proteins such as PTPσ and PDZ domain-containing scaffolds, which are essential for proper excitatory synapse development, particularly in the presynaptic assembly and postsynaptic maintenance (El2022SLITRK2). The protein contains a PDZ domain-binding motif at its C-terminus, allowing it to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins like PSD-95 and Shank3. These interactions are critical for the localization of SLITRK2 to dendritic spines and the development of excitatory synapses (Han2019Slitrk2).

SLITRK2 is specifically active in the hippocampal CA1 region, where it is crucial for synapse formation, transmission, and spine development (Han2019Slitrk2). The protein's interactions with PTPσ and other intracellular complexes transduce extracellular information into specific intracellular signaling pathways, which are vital for synapse formation, assembly, and stabilization (Han2019Slitrk2). SLITRK2's function is essential for maintaining synaptic integrity and function in healthy human cells, and its disruption can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (El2022SLITRK2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLITRK2 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. SLITRK2 is associated with schizophrenia, with specific mutations such as V89M and L626F linked to the disorder (Proenca2011Slitrks; Kang2016Slitrk). These mutations can affect synaptic connectivity and neural signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

SLITRK2 variants have also been connected to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities. Variants such as L74S, P374R, R426C, and E461* have been shown to impair excitatory synaptic function and cognition in mice, which may mirror clinical features observed in humans (El2022SLITRK2). These variants can lead to improper protein trafficking and synaptic dysfunction, affecting cognitive and motor functions (El2022SLITRK2).

SLITRK2 is also involved in X-linked intellectual developmental disorders, presenting symptoms such as impaired intellectual development, motor and speech impairments, and behavioral issues (Afsar2024Lossoffunction). The gene's interaction with the PDZ domain-containing excitatory scaffold Shank3, linked to ASDs, further underscores its clinical significance (El2022SLITRK2).

## Interactions
SLITRK2 is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that plays a significant role in excitatory synapse development through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with key synapse organizers such as PSD-95 and Shank3 via PDZ domain-mediated interactions, which are crucial for promoting excitatory synapse structure and transmission both in vitro and in vivo (Han2019Slitrk2). The C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of SLITRK2 is essential for its interaction with these proteins, and deletion of this motif disrupts these interactions, leading to reduced synaptic targeting and function (Han2019Slitrk2).

SLITRK2 also interacts with members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, such as PSD-93 and PSD-95, through a non-canonical Src homology 3 (SH3) domain binding motif. This interaction is important for the clustering of SLITRK2 in cells (Loomis2020Identification). Additionally, SLITRK2 forms a synaptogenic trans-synaptic adhesion complex with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ), which is crucial for synaptic differentiation (Yamagata2015Structure). These interactions highlight the role of SLITRK2 in synaptic organization and maintenance, with implications for neurodevelopmental disorders (El2022SLITRK2).
