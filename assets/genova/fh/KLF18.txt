# KLF18

## Overview
KLF18 is a gene that encodes the KLF transcription factor 18, a member of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family of zinc finger proteins. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, often by interacting with GC-rich regions. The KLF18 protein is distinguished by its long N-terminal region, which contains a unique repeated motif that may facilitate protein-protein interactions, and its C-terminal region, which includes three C2H2-type zinc finger domains essential for DNA binding (Pei2013A). While the structural features of KLF18 suggest a role in transcriptional regulation, the lack of expression data in some species raises the possibility that it may function as a pseudogene, although it generally lacks the typical deterioration signals associated with pseudogenes (Pei2013A).

## Structure
The KLF18 protein is characterized by a long N-terminal region exceeding 300 amino acids, which contains a unique repeated motif with the pattern "[YC]x[sE][QH]". In this motif, tyrosine (Y) is preferred over cysteine (C) at the first position, and glutamine (Q) is common at the last position. This motif is densely repeated, with human KLF18 having 50 copies, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially recruiting transcription coactivators or corepressors to specific chromosomal locations (Pei2013A).

The C-terminal region of KLF18 contains three C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding. These domains are conserved across the SP/KLF family and are responsible for binding to GC-rich regions in DNA. The zinc fingers have a specific pattern: "CX4CX12HX3HX7CX4CX12HX3HX7CX2CX12HX3H", which includes conserved cysteines and histidines essential for zinc binding and structural integrity (Pei2013A).

Despite these structural predictions, there is a lack of expression data for KLF18, raising the possibility that it may function as a pseudogene in some species. However, the predicted coding regions generally lack deterioration signals typical of pseudogenes (Pei2013A).
