# NDUFS6

## Overview
The NDUFS6 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S6, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is part of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy production by facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane necessary for ATP synthesis. NDUFS6 is categorized as an accessory subunit within complex I, and it is essential for the assembly and stability of the complex, particularly through its zinc-binding site that stabilizes iron-sulfur clusters crucial for electron transfer. Mutations in the NDUFS6 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial complex I deficiency, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (ArmirolaRicaurte2024Alternative; Kmita2015Accessory; Kirby2004NDUFS6).

## Structure
The NDUFS6 protein is a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is located on the 'calf' of the complex I boot and consists of an N-terminal domain with minimal secondary structure, followed by a coil and a short α-helix that connects to a C-terminal domain formed by five β-strands (Padavannil2022The). The C-terminal domain of NDUFS6 contains a zinc-finger motif (zf-CHCC), which coordinates a Zn2+ ion in a nearly tetrahedral geometry, crucial for the assembly and stability of complex I (ArmirolaRicaurte2024Alternative; Kmita2015Accessory). This zinc-binding site is essential for the proper folding and association of the subunit with the enzyme complex, playing a critical role in stabilizing the FeS clusters, particularly the N4 cluster, which is important for electron transfer (Kmita2015Accessory).

The structure of NDUFS6 varies between different organisms, with the N-terminal domain missing in plant and algal complex I, indicating evolutionary differences (Padavannil2022The). Alternative splicing of the NDUFS6 gene can lead to different isoforms, with some variants maintaining the open reading frame and others causing frameshifts, affecting the protein's function and stability (ArmirolaRicaurte2024Alternative).

## Function
The NDUFS6 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays a significant role in cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, generating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for ATP synthesis (Forbes2013Deficiency). 

In healthy human cells, NDUFS6 is involved in the proper assembly and stability of complex I. It contains a zinc-binding site that is essential for the biogenesis of complex I, particularly for the insertion or stabilization of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, such as the N4 cluster, which are critical for the electron transfer chain within the complex (Kmita2015Accessory). The NDUFS6 subunit is located in the iron-sulfur fraction of complex I, and its proper function is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and overall cellular energy metabolism (Kirby2004NDUFS6). 

Mutations in NDUFS6 can lead to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and the stability of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which include complexes I, III, and IV (ArmirolaRicaurte2024Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFS6 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial complex I. One significant condition linked to NDUFS6 mutations is Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of mental and movement abilities. The c.344G>A mutation, which results in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at codon 115, has been identified as deleterious and is associated with fatal neonatal lactic acidemia, particularly among Caucasus Jews (Spiegel2009Mutated). 

NDUFS6 mutations also contribute to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which can manifest as lethal neonatal conditions. Specific mutations, such as c.186+2T>A and large deletions affecting exons 3 and 4, lead to splicing abnormalities and reduced mRNA levels, resulting in severe clinical phenotypes (Kirby2004NDUFS6). 

Additionally, the NDUFS6 gene has been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a peripheral neuropathy. The c.309+5G>A variant, which affects splicing, has been associated with a milder phenotype of axonal CMT, expanding the clinical spectrum of NDUFS6-related disorders (ArmirolaRicaurte2024Alternative). 

In mouse models, NDUFS6 deficiency has been linked to cardiomyopathy and renal disease, highlighting the gene's role in tissue-specific manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction (Forbes2013Deficiency; Ke2012Tissuespecific).

## Interactions
NDUFS6 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of complex I, which is essential for mitochondrial electron transport and ATP production. NDUFS6 interacts with other subunits within complex I, particularly in the iron-sulfur fraction, to facilitate electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone (Kirby2004NDUFS6). 

Mutations in NDUFS6 can disrupt these interactions, leading to defects in complex I assembly and function. For instance, the c.343 T > C (p. Cys115Arg) variant affects a conserved cysteine residue crucial for the stable insertion of the Fe-S cluster N4, necessary for complex I function (Rouzier2019NDUFS6). 

NDUFS6 also interacts with mitochondrial connexin 43 (Cx43) in mouse heart tissue, suggesting a potential functional relationship between Cx43 and NDUFS6 in mitochondrial respiration (Denuc2016New). This interaction may influence complex I activity and oxygen consumption, highlighting the broader role of NDUFS6 in mitochondrial function beyond its structural role in complex I. These interactions underscore the importance of NDUFS6 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
