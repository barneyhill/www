# GJD3

## Overview
The GJD3 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta 3, also known as connexin 30.2 (Cx30.2), which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of gap junctions, which are specialized intercellular channels that facilitate direct communication between adjacent cells by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules. This communication is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and coordinating various physiological processes. GJD3 is particularly significant in cardiac and auditory tissues, where it plays roles in cardiac conduction and hearing, respectively. The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation by various factors, including potential post-translational modifications and interactions with other connexins, which may influence its role in health and disease (EscaleraBalsera2024A; Oyamada2013Regulation).

## Structure
The GJD3 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta-3, also known as connexin 30.2 (Cx30.2) or CX31.9. This protein is a member of the connexin family, which forms intercellular channels known as gap junctions. These channels facilitate the direct transfer of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular communication and homeostasis (EscaleraBalsera2024A; Oyamada2013Regulation).

The primary structure of GJD3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its function as a channel-forming unit. In terms of quaternary structure, GJD3 assembles into hexameric complexes known as connexons. These connexons can dock with connexons from adjacent cells to form complete gap junction channels (EscaleraBalsera2024A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the function and assembly of GJD3, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the provided context. The gene may also produce splice variant isoforms, potentially leading to proteins with distinct functions (EscaleraBalsera2024A).

## Function
The GJD3 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta 3, also known as connexin 30.2 (Cx30.2), which is involved in forming gap junctions. These specialized intercellular connections facilitate direct communication between cells by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and coordinating cellular activities (EscaleraBalsera2024A; Oyamada2013Regulation).

In the heart, GJD3 is specifically expressed in the sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN), where it contributes to cardiac conduction and rhythm regulation. Cx30.2 is involved in slowing down impulse propagation in the AVN, thereby limiting the number of beats conducted from the atria to the ventricles (Bhattacharyya2019Using; Oyamada2013Regulation). This function is crucial for coordinating the timing of atrial and ventricular contractions, ensuring efficient cardiac performance (Bhattacharyya2019Using).

In the inner ear, GJD3 is expressed in structures such as the tectorial membrane and organ of Corti, where it plays a role in maintaining ionic balance, particularly potassium (K+), which is essential for hearing. The gene's expression is higher in younger mice, suggesting a role in development (EscaleraBalsera2024A). GJD3 may also form heteromeric connexons with other connexins, contributing to cochlear function (EscaleraBalsera2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GJD3 gene, which encodes connexin 30.2, have been associated with several clinical conditions. A protective missense variant in GJD3, specifically rs201955556-T, has been linked to a lower risk of developing varicose veins in the Finnish population. This variant is predicted to be deleterious and affects the extracellular domain of the protein, influencing molecular transport between cells and potentially impacting platelet function, which is crucial for wound repair and thrombosis (Helkkula2023Genomewide).

In the context of cancer, GJD3 has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis to the brain. Studies have shown that GJD3 is significantly overexpressed in primary breast cancers that metastasize to the brain, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative cases. This overexpression suggests a potential role for GJD3 in the progression of breast cancer to brain metastasis, although the exact mechanisms remain under investigation (Pedrosa2021Differential).

Overall, the GJD3 gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, although further research is needed to fully understand its role in disease pathology and to explore its potential in clinical applications.

## Interactions
The GJD3 gene encodes the gap junction protein delta-3, also known as connexin 30.2 (Cx30.2), which is involved in forming gap junctions that facilitate intercellular communication. GJD3 can form heterotypic channels with other connexins, such as Cx26, Cx30, and Cx31, particularly in the cochlea, which is crucial for maintaining ionic balance and potassium cycling essential for hearing (EscaleraBalsera2024A). These interactions are important for the formation of gap junctions that enable ion transport and cellular communication.

The GJD3 protein is also part of the connexin family, which forms hexameric complexes called connexons. These connexons create hemichannels in the plasma membrane, and the arrangement of two connexons between adjacent cells forms a gap junction. This structure allows the exchange of small molecules, metabolites, and ions between cells, which is vital for maintaining fluid homeostasis in the inner ear (EscaleraBalsera2024A).

In addition, GJD3 has been identified as a potential target for miRNAs that interact with circPSEN1s, suggesting its involvement in a regulatory network mediated by these miRNAs, although specific physical interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed (Sanadgol2023Presenilin1Derived).
