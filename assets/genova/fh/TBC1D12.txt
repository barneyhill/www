# TBC1D12

## Overview
TBC1D12 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 12, which is involved in cellular processes related to endosomal recycling. The protein is categorized as a Rab11-binding protein, specifically interacting with the GTP-bound form of Rab11A, a small GTPase crucial for endocytic recycling. Unlike typical Rab GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), TBC1 domain family member 12 does not exhibit significant GAP activity towards Rab11A, suggesting a unique role in modulating Rab11-dependent pathways. It localizes to recycling endosomes and is implicated in processes such as neurite outgrowth, particularly in neuronal models like PC12 cells, where it promotes neurite extension in a Rab11-dependent manner. This highlights its potential involvement in neuronal development and function, although it does not appear to affect other Rab11-dependent pathways such as transferrin recycling or autophagy in certain cell types (Oguchi2017TBC1D12).

## Function
TBC1D12 is a protein that interacts with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in endosomal recycling, and is identified as a novel Rab11-binding protein. It localizes to recycling endosomes, which are crucial for endocytic recycling and other cellular processes such as cytokinesis, autophagy, and neurite outgrowth (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). TBC1D12 binds specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rab11A, acting as a Rab11-binding protein rather than a Rab11-GAP, as it does not exhibit significant GAP activity towards Rab11A (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). 

In PC12 cells, a model for neuronal differentiation, TBC1D12 promotes neurite outgrowth in a Rab11-dependent manner, independent of its GAP activity. This suggests that TBC1D12 modulates specific Rab11-dependent cellular events, particularly neurite outgrowth (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). The protein's role in endosomal trafficking processes in neurons highlights its potential involvement in cellular processes regulated by Rab11 (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). Despite its interaction with Rab11, overexpression of TBC1D12 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts does not affect transferrin recycling or autophagy, indicating a specific modulatory role without directly influencing these Rab11-dependent pathways in healthy cells (Oguchi2017TBC1D12).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TBC1D12 is a novel Rab11-binding protein that interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of Rab11A (Rab11A-Q70L) and not with the GDP-bound form (Rab11A-S25N). This interaction occurs primarily through the middle region of TBC1D12, which contains a coiled-coil domain often serving as a Rab-binding domain (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). Despite this interaction, TBC1D12 does not exhibit significant Rab11A-GAP activity, indicating its role as a Rab11-binding protein rather than a Rab11-GAP (Oguchi2017TBC1D12).

TBC1D12 is recruited to recycling endosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner, where it colocalizes with the transferrin receptor, a marker for recycling endosomes (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). The protein modulates neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a Rab11-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the elimination of this effect upon Rab11A/B knockdown (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). Overexpression of TBC1D12 promotes neurite outgrowth independently of its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, as shown by experiments with a GAP-activity-deficient mutant (Oguchi2017TBC1D12). These findings suggest that TBC1D12 acts as a modulator of neurite outgrowth through its interaction with Rab11.
