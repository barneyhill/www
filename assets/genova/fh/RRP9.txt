# RRP9

## Overview
RRP9 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal RNA processing 9, U3 small nucleolar RNA binding protein, which plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of ribosomes. The protein is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, essential for the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the small subunit (SSU) processome. It contains a WD40 domain that forms a β-propeller structure, facilitating critical protein-protein interactions necessary for the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit (Zhang2013Structural; Clerget2020Synergistic). The RRP9 protein is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it interacts with various proteins to ensure the structural integrity and function of the SSU-processome, thereby contributing to ribosome biogenesis and cellular function (Zhang2013Structural; Clerget2020Synergistic).

## Structure
The RRP9 protein, also known as U3-55K in humans, is integral to ribosomal RNA processing and is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex. The protein contains a WD40 domain, which is composed of seven WD repeats that fold into a β-propeller structure. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions within the SSU-processome, a complex involved in ribosome assembly (Zhang2013Structural; Clerget2020Synergistic).

The WD domain of RRP9 adopts a seven-bladed propeller fold, with each blade consisting of four antiparallel β-strands. This structure is responsible for binding the B/C motif of U3 snoRNA, and its association is enhanced by the prior binding of the protein Snu13 (Zhang2013Structural). The 7bc loop on the WD domain is particularly important for U3 RNP assembly and nucleolar localization (Zhang2013Structural).

RRP9 also contains an N-terminal region with a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), which includes the M1 and M2 motifs. These motifs are important for nuclear import, although the protein can localize to the nucleolus without the complete NLS (Zhang2013Structural). The R289 residue within the β-propeller domain is critical for efficient pre-rRNA cleavage and interaction with other proteins like Rrp36 (Clerget2020Synergistic).

## Function
The RRP9 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the small subunit (SSU) processome. This complex is involved in the early cleavages of pre-rRNA at sites A0, A1, and A2, which are necessary for the maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit (VENEMA2000Yeast; Clerget2020Synergistic). The RRP9 protein contains a WD40 domain that forms a β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions within the SSU-processome (Clerget2020Synergistic). 

RRP9 interacts with other proteins such as Rrp36, Sgd1, and Utp20, forming a network crucial for the structural integrity and function of the SSU-processome (Clerget2020Synergistic). Mutations in RRP9, such as the R289A mutation, can impair these interactions, leading to defects in pre-rRNA processing and affecting cell growth (Clerget2020Synergistic). The protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis and cellular function (Zhang2013Structural).

## Interactions
RRP9, also known as U3-55K in humans, is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex, which is essential for the processing of pre-rRNA into mature rRNA. RRP9 interacts with U3 snoRNA, specifically recognizing the B/C motif, which is critical for its assembly into the U3 snoRNP complex. This interaction is enhanced by the presence of the Snu13 protein, although no direct interaction between RRP9 and Snu13 has been detected (Zhang2013Structural; Granneman2009Identification).

RRP9 also participates in a complex protein-protein interaction network within the SSU-processome. It interacts with proteins such as Rrp36, Sgd1, Utp10, Utp20, and Rrp5. The interaction between RRP9 and Rrp36 is mediated by the C-terminal β-propeller domain of RRP9, and this interaction is significantly destabilized by the R289A mutation in RRP9 (Clerget2020Synergistic). The full-length RRP9 is necessary for interaction with Sgd1, while the C-terminal region of Rrp36 is sufficient for interaction with Rrp5 (Clerget2020Synergistic).

These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the SSU-processome, affecting pre-rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Clerget2020Synergistic).
