# MSANTD4

## Overview
MSANTD4 is a gene that encodes the protein Myb/SANT DNA binding domain containing 4 with coiled-coils. This protein is characterized by its DNA binding domain, which suggests a role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The Myb/SANT domain is typically involved in transcriptional regulation, indicating that the protein may influence the expression of other genes. MSANTD4 has been studied in various contexts, including its potential involvement in diabetic cardiomyopathy and temporal lobe epilepsy, where it appears to play a role in gene network connectivity and expression patterns (Zhao2024LncRNA; Winden2015Molecular). Despite its emerging significance, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of action of the MSANTD4-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The MSANTD4 gene has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression or connectivity. In the context of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), MSANTD4 is identified as one of the down-regulated long non-coding RNAs in the heart tissues of diabetic mice. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of DCM, although specific details on its function in this condition are not fully elucidated (Zhao2024LncRNA).

In temporal lobe epilepsy, MSANTD4 is noted as the most highly connected gene within a module associated with the condition, indicating its significant role in the organization and function of this gene network. The gene's connectivity is particularly strong in non-epileptic regions, suggesting that its expression pattern may be altered by epileptic processes, potentially contributing to the disease's pathology (Winden2015Molecular).

While MSANTD4 is not specifically mentioned in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation suggests that mutations or dysregulation could impact cellular processes relevant to these neurodevelopmental disorders. However, further research is needed to clarify its role in these conditions.
