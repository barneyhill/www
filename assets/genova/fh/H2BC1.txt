# H2BC1

## Overview
H2BC1 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 1, a variant of the histone H2B family. This protein is integral to chromatin organization and gene expression regulation, primarily through its role in the formation and function of H2AK119ub-modified nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are crucial for gene silencing mediated by Polycomb repressive complexes, highlighting the importance of H2BC1 in maintaining epigenetic regulation (Shen2024Role). The H2B clustered histone 1 protein interacts with DNA and other histone proteins to stabilize nucleosome structure, thereby influencing chromatin dynamics and function (Shen2024Role). Its expression is notably high in early spermatocytes and oocytes, suggesting a role in chromatin conformation during development (Shen2024Role).

## Function
H2BC1, a histone variant, plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. It is a key component of H2AK119ub-modified nucleosomes, which are involved in gene silencing through Polycomb repressive complexes. H2BC1 is necessary for the ubiquitination of histone H2AK119, as its knockout results in the loss of H2AK119ub, indicating its importance in maintaining H2AK119ub levels and Polycomb gene silencing (Shen2024Role).

H2BC1 contributes to the structural organization of chromatin by interacting with DNA at specific super helical locations, enhancing nucleosome stability and organization. This interaction is crucial for the dynamic organization and functional diversification of H2AK119ub nucleosomes (Shen2024Role). The genomic binding profiles of H2BC1 overlap significantly with H2AK119ub, particularly in gene bodies, suggesting a role in regulating chromatin functions, including splicing efficiency (Shen2024Role).

H2BC1 is also involved in nucleosome structural transitions, potentially enhancing induced pluripotent stem cell generation, and is highly expressed in early spermatocytes and oocytes, indicating its role in chromatin conformation during development (Shen2024Role).

## Interactions
H2BC1, a histone variant, plays a crucial role in the organization of H2AK119ub nucleosomes. It is identified as a component of these nucleosomes through GST-UAB pulldown assays and mass spectrometry analyses. Structural analysis using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that H2BC1 interacts with DNA at the super helical location (SHL) 3, where the arginine at position 34 (R34) engages with the minor groove and lysine at position 35 (K35) contacts the DNA backbone. These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleosome (Shen2024Role).

H2BC1 also interacts with other histone proteins within the nucleosome. H2A1B envelops H2BC1 through multiple interactions, including hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces, which contribute to the stability and organization of the nucleosome (Shen2024Role). The presence of H2BC1 in H2AK119ub nucleosomes is essential for cellular H2AK119 ubiquitination, as knockout studies show that the absence of H2BC1 abolishes H2AK119ub (Shen2024Role). These interactions suggest that H2BC1 is integral to the dynamic organization and function of H2AK119ub nucleosomes, potentially influencing chromatin function and gene regulation.
