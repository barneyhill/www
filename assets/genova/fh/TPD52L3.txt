# TPD52L3

## Overview
The TPD52L3 gene encodes the protein TPD52-like 3, which is a member of the TPD52-like protein family characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil motif. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and storage, through its role in lipid droplet formation. TPD52-like 3 interacts with other proteins in the TPD52 family, which are known to play significant roles in cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The gene's expression and the protein's function have been linked to several pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and various cancers, notably breast and prostate cancer. Alterations in TPD52L3 expression can influence disease progression by affecting lipid metabolism and cellular growth pathways (N2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TPD52L3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of metabolic disorders and cancer. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the downregulation of TPD52L3 has been observed, suggesting a potential impact on lipid metabolism. TPD52L3 is involved in lipid droplet formation and storage, and changes in its expression could affect the number and size of lipid droplets, thereby influencing metabolic processes related to diabetes (N2020Identification).

Beyond metabolic disorders, TPD52L3 has been associated with various cancers. Alterations in its expression, such as overexpression or mutations, may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. This is particularly noted in breast and prostate cancers, where TPD52L3's role in cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis becomes significant. The protein encoded by TPD52L3 interacts with other TPD52-like proteins, which are involved in lipid metabolism, and these interactions are facilitated by a coiled-coil motif characteristic of the TPD52-like protein family. Such interactions may be disrupted in cancerous conditions, further contributing to disease progression (N2020Identification).
