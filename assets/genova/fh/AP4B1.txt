# AP4B1

## Overview
The AP4B1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is integral to the intracellular trafficking of proteins, particularly within the endosomal-lysosomal system. The AP4B1 protein is a component of the AP-4 complex, which includes other subunits such as epsilon, sigma, and mu, and is involved in the sorting and transport of specific cargo proteins, including those essential for autophagy and neuronal function. As a cytoplasmic protein, AP4B1 plays a critical role in the Golgi apparatus, facilitating the proper localization and function of proteins like ATG9A and DAGLB. Mutations in the AP4B1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47), underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neuronal development (Davies2017AP4; Behne2020Adaptor; Ebrahimi‐Fakhari2017Clinical).

## Structure
The AP4B1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which plays a crucial role in the sorting of cargo proteins to the endosomal-lysosomal system. The protein structure of AP4B1 includes multiple domains that are essential for its function in vesicle formation and cargo selection. These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins and contribute to the specificity of cargo recognition.

The quaternary structure of the AP4B1 protein involves its assembly with other subunits, specifically epsilon, sigma, and mu, to form the complete AP-4 complex. This assembly is critical for the functional integrity of the complex, allowing it to effectively mediate its role in cellular transport processes.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in the AP4B1 protein and can regulate its activity. These modifications may influence the protein's interactions and stability, thereby affecting its function in the cell.

Splice variant isoforms of AP4B1 may exist, potentially altering the protein's function or localization. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's activity, impacting its role in the endosomal-lysosomal sorting pathway.

## Function
The AP4B1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is crucial for the transport of specific proteins within cells. In healthy human cells, AP-4 is involved in the trafficking of the cargo protein ATG9A from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to peripheral compartments. This process is essential for the proper localization and function of ATG9A, which plays a role in autophagy, a cellular degradation process (Behne2020Adaptor). The AP-4 complex, including AP4B1, is also responsible for the axonal transport of proteins such as DAGLB, which is involved in the production of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, crucial for neuronal signaling and axonal growth (Davies2020AP4; Davies2022AP4mediated).

AP4B1 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the Golgi apparatus, where it helps sort and traffic membrane proteins. The proper functioning of AP-4 is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal neuronal development. Deficiencies in AP4B1 can lead to mislocalization of proteins like ATG9A and DAGLB, resulting in disrupted autophagy and impaired neuronal function, which are associated with neurological disorders (Davies2022AP4mediated; Davies2017AP4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP4B1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 47 (SPG47). This condition is characterized by progressive spasticity, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. Patients often exhibit symptoms such as microcephaly, absent or delayed speech, and seizures. Brain imaging frequently reveals structural abnormalities, including a thin corpus callosum and delayed myelination (Abdollahpour2014An; Ebrahimi‐Fakhari2017Clinical).

The AP4B1 gene mutations typically result in loss-of-function, leading to impaired formation of the AP-4 complex, which is crucial for intracellular protein trafficking. This disruption is believed to contribute to the neurological symptoms observed in affected individuals (Accogli2018A; Salayev2022AP4B1associated). The majority of reported cases involve homozygous mutations in consanguineous families, although compound heterozygous mutations have also been identified (Salayev2022AP4B1associated; Ebrahimi‐Fakhari2017Clinical).

Clinical features of AP4B1-related disorders can include spastic tetraplegia, stereotypic laughter, and growth retardation. The condition is often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy due to overlapping symptoms, highlighting the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (lamichhane2013new; Ebrahimi‐Fakhari2017Clinical).

## Interactions
AP4B1 is a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4), which is involved in the trafficking of cargo proteins. It physically interacts with other subunits of the AP-4 complex, including AP4E1, AP4M1, and AP4S1, to form a functional complex essential for protein sorting. The stability of the AP-4 complex is dependent on the presence of all its subunits, as demonstrated by the reduction in AP4E1 levels in patient-derived fibroblasts with bi-allelic variants in AP4B1 (Behne2020Adaptor).

AP4B1 also interacts with cargo proteins such as ATG9A, a core autophagy protein, which is crucial for autophagosome biogenesis. The AP-4 complex facilitates the trafficking of ATG9A from the trans-Golgi network to the cell periphery, a process essential for proper autophagy and neuronal function (Davies2018AP4). In AP-4-deficient cells, ATG9A is mislocalized, indicating its dependence on AP4B1 for correct trafficking (Davies2018AP4).

Additionally, AP4B1 is involved in interactions with accessory proteins such as RUSC2, which aids in the peripheral delivery of ATG9A. This interaction is part of the broader role of AP-4 in spatial control of autophagy (Davies2018AP4). These interactions highlight the critical role of AP4B1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in protein trafficking pathways.
