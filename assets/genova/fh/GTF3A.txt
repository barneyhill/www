# GTF3A

## Overview
GTF3A is a gene that encodes the protein general transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), a zinc finger protein that plays a pivotal role in the transcription of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase III. This protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it binds to the internal control region of the 5S rRNA gene, facilitating the assembly of the transcription initiation complex. TFIIIA is essential for the synthesis of 5S rRNA, a critical component of the ribosomal large subunit, thereby playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (Anuraga2021Comprehensive; Wang2022Transcriptional). Beyond its fundamental role in transcription, TFIIIA is involved in forming the 7S ribonucleoprotein particle, which is crucial for the nuclear export and stability of 5S rRNA (Wang2022Transcriptional). The gene's involvement in cellular growth and proliferation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and highlights its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and viral infections (Gwinn2005Transcriptional; Skouboe2023Inborn).

## Function
GTF3A (general transcription factor IIIA) is a zinc finger protein that plays a critical role in the transcription of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase III. It is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it binds to the internal control region of the 5S rRNA gene, facilitating the assembly of the transcription initiation complex (Wang2022Transcriptional). This process is essential for the synthesis of 5S rRNA, a component of the ribosomal large subunit, which is crucial for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis (Anuraga2021Comprehensive).

GTF3A also contributes to the formation of the 7S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) complex, which serves as a nuclear export signal to transfer 5S rRNA to the cytoplasm, protecting it from degradation (Wang2022Transcriptional). This function is vital for maintaining cellular growth and protein production, as ribosomes are the cellular machinery responsible for translating mRNA into proteins.

In healthy human cells, GTF3A's role in ribosome biogenesis underscores its importance in cellular growth and proliferation. Although its specific functions in normal tissues are not extensively detailed, its involvement in fundamental processes like transcription and ribosome assembly highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Gwinn2005Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
GTF3A has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GTF3A is overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. It promotes CRC progression by upregulating cystatin A (CSTA), which is involved in cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasion (Anuraga2021Comprehensive; Wang2022Transcriptional). Knockdown of GTF3A in CRC cell lines results in decreased cell viability and impaired migration and invasion capabilities, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis (Wang2022Transcriptional).

GTF3A is also involved in antiviral immunity. Variants in GTF3A have been linked to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) due to their impact on the transcription of RNA species crucial for immune responses. These variants can lead to decreased interferon responses, which are essential for combating viral infections (Skouboe2023Inborn).

In the context of obesity, GTF3A has been identified as a potential locus associated with obesity-related traits, suggesting its involvement in metabolic processes (Butler2016Single). Additionally, GTF3A is mentioned in studies related to Huntington's disease, where it is involved in inflammation pathways that may affect disease progression (Onur2021Downregulation).

## Interactions
GTF3A, also known as human transcription factor IIIA (hTFIIIA), is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of 5S rRNA genes by RNA polymerase III. It specifically binds to the internal control region of the 5S rRNA gene, facilitating the assembly of the transcription initiation complex, which includes TFIIIB and TFIIIC (Seifart1989Purification). GTF3A also interacts with 5S rRNA transcripts, forming a 7S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that is important for the nuclear export of 5S rRNA (Fridell1996Amphibian).

In addition to its role in 5S rRNA transcription, GTF3A has been shown to bind to the promoter of the cystatin A (CSTA) gene, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is significant in the context of colorectal cancer progression, where GTF3A upregulates CSTA expression, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2022Transcriptional). The binding of GTF3A to the CSTA promoter has been demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Wang2022Transcriptional).

GTF3A's interactions with nucleic acids and other proteins underscore its multifaceted role in gene regulation and cellular processes, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states.
