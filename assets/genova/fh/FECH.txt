# FECH

## Overview
The FECH gene encodes the enzyme ferrochelatase, a critical component in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Ferrochelatase is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX, forming heme, an essential molecule for various biological functions, including oxygen transport and electron transfer. As a homodimeric enzyme, ferrochelatase is categorized as a lyase, specifically functioning within the inner mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and mitochondrial function. Mutations in the FECH gene can lead to disorders such as erythropoietic protoporphyria, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Di2005A; Ricci2022Iron).

## Structure
Ferrochelatase (FECH) is an enzyme involved in the terminal step of heme biosynthesis, catalyzing the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form protoheme. The primary structure of FECH consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the FECH gene. The enzyme's secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. 

In terms of tertiary structure, FECH forms a homodimer, with each monomer containing a TIM barrel fold, which is a common structural motif in enzymes that facilitates substrate binding and catalysis (Maio2019Dimeric). The enzyme is conformationally dynamic, undergoing several structural changes during its catalytic cycle, which are essential for its interaction with various protein partners and for the regulation of substrate delivery and product release (Piel2016A).

FECH also contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is necessary for its enzymatic activity and regulation (Piel2016A). The quaternary structure of FECH involves its interaction with other proteins, such as ABCB7 and ABCB10, forming a complex essential for heme biosynthesis (Maio2019Dimeric). This complex is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis. The enzyme's activity is regulated by interactions with transporters or chaperones, such as PGRMC1, which may stabilize specific conformational states of FECH (Piel2016A).

## Function
The FECH gene encodes the enzyme ferrochelatase, which is crucial for the final step of heme biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme, a vital component of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins (Phillips2019Strong; Ricci2022Iron). Ferrochelatase is a homodimeric enzyme located on the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a key role in the intersection of porphyrin and iron metabolism (Ricci2022Iron). The enzyme's activity is enhanced by erythropoietin (EPO) signaling, which leads to its phosphorylation (Ricci2022Iron).

In healthy human cells, proper functioning of the FECH gene ensures adequate heme production, which is essential for oxygen transport and various cellular processes (Ricci2022Iron). Ferrochelatase is part of a mitochondrial complex with other enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis, which helps manage iron within the mitochondrial matrix and protect against oxidative damage (Ricci2022Iron). The enzyme contains a [Fe-S] cluster that provides structural stability and possibly redox sensing functions, and it receives iron from mitoferrin, a mitochondrial solute carrier (Ricci2022Iron). The integrity of mitochondrial cristae is essential for its proper function (Ricci2022Iron).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FECH gene, which encodes the enzyme ferrochelatase, are primarily associated with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a disorder characterized by photosensitivity and liver complications due to the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. A specific point mutation in the promoter region of the FECH gene, a G>C substitution at position -250, disrupts an SP1 binding site, significantly reducing gene transcription and leading to EPP (Di2005A). This mutation impairs the binding of transcription factors necessary for normal gene expression, highlighting the critical role of the SP1 site in FECH gene regulation (Di2005A).

In addition to promoter mutations, deep intronic variants in the FECH gene can also affect gene expression and splicing. For instance, the c.464-1169 A>C variant disrupts an exonic splicing silencer, leading to the inclusion of a cryptic exon with a stop codon, which can alter normal splicing and reduce FECH mRNA levels (Chiara2020Targeted). These genetic alterations contribute to the clinical manifestations of EPP by affecting the enzyme's activity and expression levels, which are crucial for heme biosynthesis (Chiara2020Targeted). The inheritance of a low-expressed wild-type FECH allele alongside a mutated allele is often required for the clinical expression of EPP, suggesting a complex genetic background for the disease (Gouya1999Inheritance).

## Interactions
Ferrochelatase (FECH) is involved in several protein interactions critical for heme biosynthesis. It forms a multimeric complex with ABCB7 and ABCB10, essential for heme production. This complex is approximately 480 kDa in size, with FECH mediating an indirect interaction between ABCB7 and ABCB10, forming a hetero-hexameric complex with a 2:2:2 stoichiometry (Maio2019Dimeric). FECH also interacts with protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) and aminolevulinic acid synthase-2 (ALAS2) in a 250 kDa complex, which is part of the mitochondrial heme metabolism complex (Medlock2015Identification).

In yeast, the homolog of FECH, Hem15, interacts with the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, which supports its optimal performance. This interaction is dynamic and not essential for Hem15 activity but enhances its efficiency (Dietz2021Mitochondrial). In humans, FECH can form both homodimers and heterodimers with adrenodoxin reductase (ADR), with isatin enhancing the affinity of this interaction by forming a ternary complex at the interface of the two proteins (Ershov2020Mechanism). These interactions highlight the central role of FECH in coordinating heme biosynthesis and mitochondrial function.
