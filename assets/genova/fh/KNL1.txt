# KNL1

## Overview
KNL1, or kinetochore scaffold 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial scaffold protein involved in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a key structure for chromosome segregation during cell division. The KNL1 protein is characterized by its large size and complex structure, featuring multiple domains and motifs that facilitate interactions with other kinetochore components. As a scaffold protein, KNL1 plays a pivotal role in ensuring the proper attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. It is a part of the KNL1/MIS12 complex/NDC80 complex (KMN) network, which is integral to microtubule binding at kinetochores. KNL1's interactions with proteins such as BUB1, BUBR1, and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) are critical for the spindle assembly checkpoint and the regulation of kinetochore function, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Vleugel2013Arrayed; Caldas2013KNL1:; Liu2010Regulated).

## Structure
KNL1 is a large protein involved in kinetochore assembly and function, characterized by a complex structure with multiple domains and motifs. The protein is predominantly disordered, with a structured region at the C-terminus containing a globular domain with tandem RWD motifs and a coiled-coil domain. These RWD motifs facilitate interaction with the Mis12 complex, while the coiled-coil domain interacts with Zwint-1, both essential for proper kinetochore assembly (Caldas2013KNL1:).

The N-terminal region of KNL1 includes motifs such as RVSF and SILK, which bind to the phosphatase PP1, and KI motifs that interact with SAC proteins Bub1 and BubR1 (Caldas2013KNL1:). The protein also contains MELT-like motifs, which, when phosphorylated, serve as docking sites for the BUB1-BUB3 dimer, crucial for spindle assembly checkpoint signaling (Tromer2015Widespread).

KNL1's interaction with ZWINT forms a bent parallel coiled coil structure, terminating into the KNL1 C-terminal globular domain, supported by additional interactions forming a four-helix bundle (Polley2024Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function (Tromer2015Widespread). KNL1 may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
KNL1 (kinetochore scaffold 1) is a critical component of the kinetochore complex, playing a vital role in chromosome segregation during mitosis. It functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of kinetochores and ensuring proper attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. This attachment is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation to opposite spindle poles during anaphase (Caldas2013KNL1:).

KNL1 is involved in the regulation of kinetochore function by recruiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to the outer kinetochore, which opposes the activity of Aurora B kinase. This interaction is essential for maintaining the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of kinetochore substrates, stabilizing microtubule attachments, and ensuring accurate chromosome alignment (Liu2010Regulated).

The N-terminal region of KNL1 contains motifs that mediate interactions with other kinetochore proteins, such as Bub1 and BubR1, which are crucial for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). KNL1's role in SAC involves delaying anaphase until all kinetochores are properly attached, preventing premature mitotic exit (Caldas2013KNL1:). KNL1 also facilitates the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by promoting Aurora B kinase activity, which is necessary for proper kinetochore-microtubule dynamics (Caldas2013KNL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KNL1 gene have significant clinical implications. KNL1 is associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH4), a condition characterized by reduced brain size. Mutations in KNL1, particularly those near the carboxyl terminal, can lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons, resulting in protein truncation or nonsense-mediated decay. These mutations disrupt the protein's function, affecting dividing brain cells and leading to microcephaly (Genin2012Kinetochore; Takimoto2017D40KNL1CASC5).

In cancer, KNL1 is highly expressed in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and correlates with clinical features such as FIGO stage, tumor invasion, and lymphatic metastasis. Its expression is linked to poor prognosis, making it a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for UCEC (He2023KNL1). KNL1 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is a downstream target of miR-4677-3p, influencing cell proliferation and motility (Wang2020LINC02418).

Alterations in KNL1 interactions, particularly with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) at the kinetochore, can affect cell viability and chromosome segregation, contributing to chromosomal instability and cancer progression (Liu2010Regulated).

## Interactions
KNL1, a key component of the kinetochore complex, participates in several critical interactions essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis. It is part of the KNL1/MIS12 complex/NDC80 complex (KMN) network, which is crucial for microtubule binding at kinetochores. KNL1 interacts with the paralogues BUB1 and BUBR1, which are important for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and chromosome biorientation. These interactions are facilitated by the N-terminal region of KNL1, which contains motifs such as TxxΩ and MELT that recruit BUB proteins to kinetochores (Vleugel2013Arrayed).

KNL1 also interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) through a conserved RVSF motif, which is essential for counteracting the activity of Aurora B kinase at kinetochores. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing microtubule attachments and ensuring proper chromosome alignment (Liu2010Regulated).

In C. elegans, KNL-1 forms a complex with CeNDC-80 and HIM-10, which are homologs of Ndc80p/HEC1 and Nuf2p, respectively. This complex is essential for kinetochore-microtubule interactions, highlighting KNL-1's role in directing the assembly of the microtubule-binding interface of the kinetochore (Desai2003KNL1).
