# RHOXF2

## Overview
RHOXF2 is a gene that encodes the Rhox homeobox family member 2 protein, a transcription factor primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The protein is characterized by a homeodomain, which is a DNA-binding domain typical of homeobox proteins, and a proline-rich domain, which together facilitate its role in transcriptional regulation (Niu2011Rapid). RHOXF2 is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it plays a crucial role in the survival and differentiation of male germ cells, contributing to normal spermatogenesis and fertility (Borgmann2016The). The gene has undergone rapid evolution, particularly in primates, indicating its adaptive significance in reproductive and possibly neural functions (Niu2011Rapid). Mutations in RHOXF2 have been associated with male infertility, highlighting its clinical importance (Borgmann2016The). Additionally, RHOXF2 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, where it is part of a regulatory axis involving long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs (LOXL1AS1; Zhao2020&lt; p&gt).

## Structure
The RHOXF2 gene encodes a protein consisting of 288 amino acids, featuring two functional domains: the homeodomain and the proline-rich domain. The homeodomain is a 60-amino-acid helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, characteristic of homeobox proteins, which facilitates the protein's role in transcriptional regulation (Niu2011Rapid). The RHOXF2 protein is similar to the rodent Rhox5, promoting the survival and differentiation of male germ cells during spermatogenesis (Niu2011Rapid).

Mutations in RHOXF2, such as c.202G > A (p.Gly68Arg) and c.679G > A (p.Gly227Arg), can alter the protein's tertiary structure, affecting its folding and binding properties. These mutations change a Glycine to an Arginine, potentially impacting the protein's ability to regulate downstream genes (Borgmann2016The). The RHOXF2 protein is expressed primarily in the testis, with its localization shifting from the cytoplasm in fetal testes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in adult testes (Borgmann2016The).

The RHOXF2 gene has undergone rapid evolution and positive selection, particularly in primates, with frequent amino acid substitutions in the homeodomain region, suggesting adaptive changes in its function (Niu2011Rapid).

## Function
The RHOXF2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis by regulating gene expression in reproductive tissues, particularly in the testis. It is primarily expressed in spermatogonia and, to a lesser extent, in spermatocytes, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells during both fetal and adult stages (Le2023Mammal; Borgmann2016The). RHOXF2 functions as a transcriptional regulator, suppressing LINE1 transposition to maintain genomic stability, which is essential for normal spermatogenesis and fertility (Le2023Mammal).

In healthy human cells, RHOXF2 is involved in the upregulation of genes such as DNAJB1, HSPA1A, HSPA6, and HSPH1, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of male infertility (Le2023Mammal). The gene's activity is crucial for stress protection and cell survival during the early stages of spermatogenesis, as it regulates genes encoding proteins important for these processes (Borgmann2016The). RHOXF2 also plays a role in the Sertoli-cell pathway, influencing germ cell survival by regulating downstream genes like Unc5c, Pltp, and Gdap1, which are also significant in the nervous system (Niu2011Rapid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RHOXF2 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly in conditions such as severe oligozoospermia, which is characterized by a low sperm count. Specific mutations, such as c.202G > A and c.679G > A, have been identified as impairing the gene's ability to upregulate downstream gene expression, which is crucial for normal spermatogenesis. The c.679G > A mutation, in particular, has been found exclusively in patients with severe oligozoospermia, suggesting a strong link to this condition (Le2023Mammal; Borgmann2016The).

The RHOXF2 gene is also involved in suppressing LINE1 transposition, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. Mutations that disrupt this function can lead to infertility (Le2023Mammal). Additionally, a guanine insertion (c.381dupG) in RHOXF2 can induce a premature stop codon, further impairing spermatogenesis (Le2023Mammal).

The gene's rapid evolution and copy number variation in primates, driven by positive selection, suggest its role in adaptive evolution, potentially affecting both reproductive and neural functions (Niu2011Rapid). However, the clinical significance of these evolutionary changes in humans remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
RHOXF2, a transcription factor, is involved in various interactions that influence gene expression. It is known to regulate the expression of several target genes, including those encoding HSP70 family chaperones, which are crucial for stress response and cell survival (Le2023Mammal; Borgmann2016The). RHOXF2's regulatory role is significant in the context of male infertility, where it is implicated in the protection of germ cells from heat stress during spermatogenesis (Borgmann2016The).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RHOXF2 is part of a regulatory axis involving the long non-coding RNA LOXL1-AS1 and miR-3128. LOXL1-AS1 negatively regulates miR-3128, which in turn inhibits RHOXF2 expression. This interaction suggests that RHOXF2 is involved in NSCLC progression through the miR-3128/RHOXF2 axis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (LOXL1AS1; Zhao2020&lt; p&gt).

RHOXF2 also exhibits unusual cytoplasmic accumulation, differing from the typical nuclear localization of homeobox proteins, which may affect its interactions with other proteins and its role in drug resistance in certain cancer cell lines (Arnoldo2014A; Borgmann2016The).
