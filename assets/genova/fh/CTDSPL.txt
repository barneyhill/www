# CTDSPL

## Overview
The CTDSPL gene encodes the CTD small phosphatase-like protein, which is a member of the small carboxy-terminal domain serine phosphatase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle and transcriptional processes by dephosphorylating key substrates such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and RNA polymerase II. Through its phosphatase activity, CTDSPL contributes to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary and modulates transcriptional activity, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor in various tissues (Anedchenko2008Downregulation; Beniaminov2016Interaction). The gene is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues and is frequently downregulated in several cancers, including cervical cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer, often due to genetic deletions and epigenetic modifications (Krasnov2023Tumor; Senchenko2010Simultaneous; Chen2018Genomewide).

## Function
The CTDSPL gene encodes a small carboxy-terminal domain serine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control in healthy human cells. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is essential for arresting the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary. This process prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation by allowing Rb to bind and inactivate E2F-family transcription factors, thereby inhibiting the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (Anedchenko2008Downregulation; Beniaminov2016Interaction).

CTDSPL is also part of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain small serine phosphatases family, which dephosphorylates Ser5 in the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat of the Pol II large subunit. This activity is crucial for regulating transcriptional activity, ensuring proper transcriptional regulation in cells (Beniaminov2016Interaction). The gene is expressed ubiquitously in normal tissues, including the lung, and contributes to growth suppression by reducing the phosphorylated form of the RB protein, potentially blocking the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary (Senchenko2010Simultaneous). CTDSPL's function as a tumor suppressor is evident in its ability to maintain normal cellular functions and prevent carcinogenesis (Beniaminov2016Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
The CTDSPL gene has been implicated in several cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In cervical cancer, a 6367bp deletion in intron 1 of CTDSPL is associated with a 2.54-fold increased risk of the disease. This deletion disrupts transcription factor binding sites, leading to downregulation of CTDSPL and contributing to poor prognosis in patients (Chen2018Genomewide). The gene is frequently deleted in cervical tumors, particularly in squamous cell carcinoma with metastases, and its promoter is often hypermethylated, further reducing its expression (Chen2018Genomewide).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CTDSPL is significantly downregulated, correlating with high-grade tumors and poorer survival outcomes. This downregulation is linked to intronic hypermethylation and interactions with specific microRNAs, which may regulate its expression (Krasnov2023Tumor). CTDSPL's tumor suppressive properties in ccRCC are demonstrated by its ability to inhibit cell growth when expressed in cell lines (Krasnov2023Tumor).

CTDSPL is also involved in lung cancer, where it is frequently downregulated due to genetic and epigenetic alterations, including promoter methylation, contributing to tumorigenesis (Senchenko2010Simultaneous).

## Interactions
CTDSPL, a small carboxy-terminal domain serine phosphatase, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. One of the primary interactions of CTDSPL is with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), another tumor suppressor. CTDSPL dephosphorylates and activates Rb, leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary. This interaction was demonstrated using a GST pull-down assay, which showed that CTDSPL can precipitate Rb from MCF-7 cell extracts, indicating a physical interaction. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) further confirmed a direct interaction between CTDSPL and Rb (Beniaminov2016Interaction).

CTDSPL also interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), as it can precipitate Pol II from MCF-7 cell lysates, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Beniaminov2016Interaction). In the context of uveal melanoma, CTDSPL is targeted by the miR-181 family, particularly miR-181b, which leads to the repression of CTDSPL expression. This interaction affects the pRB-E2F1 pathway, promoting cell cycle progression (Zhang2018The). These interactions highlight CTDSPL's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential role in cancer pathogenesis.
