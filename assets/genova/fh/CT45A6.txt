# CT45A6

## Overview
CT45A6 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A6, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. These proteins are typically expressed in the testis and various cancer types, making them of particular interest in oncology for their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The CT45A6 protein is implicated in several cancer-related processes, including tumorigenesis and metastasis, through its involvement in pathways such as the AKT pathway in breast cancer and its association with DNA hypomethylation in epithelial ovarian cancer (Zhang2015DNA; Niu2021Uev1A). Its expression in cancers like Hodgkin's lymphoma and B-cell lymphomas further underscores its role in aggressive disease phenotypes, highlighting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Chen2010Expression).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CT45A6, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), CT45A6 expression is activated through DNA hypomethylation, which is associated with disease progression and reduced survival rates. This hypomethylation leads to increased expression of CT45A6 in late-stage and high-grade EOC, correlating with poor prognosis (Zhang2015DNA).

In breast cancer, CT45A6 is upregulated by UEV1A through the AKT pathway, promoting cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes that are crucial for metastasis. This suggests that CT45A6 plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer (Niu2021Uev1A).

CT45A6 is also expressed in Hodgkin's lymphoma and other B-cell lymphomas, where its presence is linked to aggressive disease phenotypes and poor prognosis. The antigen's expression in these cancers makes it a potential target for immunotherapy, although immune responses against CT45A6 are often suppressed in the tumor microenvironment (Chen2010Expression).
