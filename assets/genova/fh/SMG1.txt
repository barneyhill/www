# SMG1

## Overview
SMG1 is a gene that encodes the SMG1 nonsense mediated mRNA decay associated PI3K related kinase, a serine/threonine-protein kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family. This kinase is integral to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a critical cellular mechanism for identifying and degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons, thereby preventing the synthesis of potentially harmful truncated proteins. The SMG1 protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes an N-terminal α-solenoid and a C-terminal catalytic core, which are essential for its kinase activity and interaction with other NMD components. SMG1 forms a complex with SMG8 and SMG9, known as the SMG1C complex, which regulates its activity and facilitates the phosphorylation of UPF1, a key step in NMD. The gene's role extends beyond mRNA surveillance, with implications in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression fidelity (MeravigliaCrivelli2022IL6STAT3; Yamashita2001Human; AriasPalomo2011The).

## Structure
The SMG1 protein is a large serine/threonine-protein kinase and a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, playing a crucial role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). It is composed of an N-terminal extended α-solenoid with 14 parallel HEAT repeats, forming a C-shaped fold, and a C-terminal compact catalytic core domain. The core domain includes middle HEAT repeats, a FAT domain, a kinase domain (KD), and a FATC domain (Zhu2019CryoEM; AriasPalomo2011The).

The kinase domain of SMG1 is unique within the PIKK family due to a characteristic insertion that connects helices kα9 and kα10, and it is structurally similar to mTOR (Zhu2019CryoEM). The FAT and FATC domains are critical for the kinase's activity, with the FAT domain stabilizing the N-lobe of the kinase domain (AriasPalomo2011The).

SMG1 forms a complex with SMG8 and SMG9, known as the SMG1C complex. SMG9 acts as a bridge between SMG1 and SMG8, facilitating large-scale conformational changes that regulate SMG1's kinase activity (Zhu2019CryoEM; AriasPalomo2011The). The SMG1C complex is essential for the phosphorylation of UPF1, a key step in NMD (Langer2020Structure).

## Function
The SMG1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, playing a crucial role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This pathway is a cellular surveillance mechanism that identifies and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs), which can arise from mutations or errors in transcription and mRNA processing. By degrading these faulty mRNAs, SMG1 prevents the accumulation of truncated proteins that could be nonfunctional or harmful (Yamashita2005The; Yamashita2001Human).

SMG1 functions by phosphorylating the Upf1 protein, a key component of the NMD pathway, upon recognition of a PTC during the initial round of translation. This phosphorylation is essential for the recruitment of other NMD factors, facilitating ribosome dissociation and mRNA decay (Yamashita2001Human; Yamashita2013Role). SMG1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis by maintaining mRNA quality control and regulating gene expression (Yamashita2001Human).

In healthy human cells, SMG1's role in NMD is vital for protecting against the potential deleterious effects of aberrant mRNAs, thereby ensuring the fidelity of gene expression and preventing disease (Yamashita2001Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SMG1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, high SMG1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, correlating with worse survival outcomes and lower immune infiltration (MeravigliaCrivelli2022IL6STAT3). SMG1 is upregulated by the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway in an inflammatory context, which may affect tumor immunity by silencing frameshift-derived neoantigens (MeravigliaCrivelli2022IL6STAT3). In mice, SMG1 heterozygosity exacerbates cancer development, particularly lymphomas, in the absence of ATM, a gene crucial for DNA repair, suggesting a specific interaction between SMG1 and ATM pathways (Ho2019SMG1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SMG1 has been identified as a regulator of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease. Reduced SMG1 levels are associated with increased phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein, a modification linked to disease progression in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (HendersonSmith2013SMG1). These findings suggest that SMG1 may play a significant role in the pathology of these diseases, potentially offering a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SMG1, a serine/threonine-protein kinase, is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. It forms a complex with SMG8 and SMG9, known as the SMG1C complex, which plays a significant role in regulating its kinase activity. SMG8 acts as an inhibitor of SMG1, while SMG9 serves as a positive regulator, although it also functions with SMG8 as an inhibitor (Yamashita2009SMG8). The SMG1-8-9 complex is involved in the autoinhibitory regulation of SMG1, with the SMG1 insertion domain and SMG8 contributing to this state (Langer2021CryoEM).

SMG1 interacts with UPF1, a key NMD factor, phosphorylating it at specific serine residues, which is essential for NMD function (Yamashita2001Human). The SMG1-UPF2-SMG7 complex is also crucial for NMD, with UPF2 playing a central role in connecting SMG1 and SMG7 (Padariya2024In). SMG1's interactions extend to the mRNA surveillance complex, where it associates with components like eRF1 and eRF3, forming part of the SURF complex that recognizes premature termination codons during translation termination (Yamashita2009SMG8). These interactions highlight SMG1's pivotal role in mRNA surveillance and decay processes.
