# PRAMEF17

## Overview
PRAMEF17 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 17, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) gene family. This family is characterized by its involvement in cancer-testis antigens, which are typically expressed in a variety of tumors and are associated with immune evasion and tumor progression (Kern2021The). The PRAMEF17 protein is implicated in oncological research due to its altered expression in certain cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer and olfactory neuroblastoma, where it may influence disease progression and patient outcomes (SATO2024Identification; Yang2023Genomic). While the precise biological functions of PRAMEF17 remain to be fully elucidated, its potential role in cancer pathogenesis and as a target for immunotherapy is of significant interest in the field of cancer biology.

## Clinical Significance
PRAMEF17, a member of the PRAME gene family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low expression of PRAMEF17 is associated with a high risk of early recurrence and poor survival outcomes, although it does not correlate with immune checkpoint molecules (SATO2024Identification). This suggests that PRAMEF17 may play a role in the progression of TNBC, potentially affecting patient prognosis.

In olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), PRAMEF17 has been observed to undergo copy-number variations, with a loss noted in 21% of cases. While the specific clinical significance of these alterations in ONB is not fully detailed, the loss of PRAMEF17 could imply a potential role in the pathogenesis of this cancer type (Yang2023Genomic).

The PRAME gene family, including PRAMEF17, is known for its involvement in cancer-testis antigens, which are often overexpressed in tumors and can contribute to immune evasion and tumor growth. This characteristic makes PRAMEF17 a potential target for cancer immunotherapy, although specific therapeutic applications for PRAMEF17 have not been extensively documented (Kern2021The).
