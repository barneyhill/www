# NAT16

## Overview
NAT16 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetyltransferase 16 (putative), which is part of the N-acetyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to various substrates, a process that is crucial for numerous biological functions, including drug metabolism and the regulation of protein function. Although the specific biological role of NAT16 remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to participate in acetylation processes similar to other members of its enzyme family. The protein is categorized as an acetyltransferase, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that require acetylation for regulation and function. Further research is needed to clarify the precise mechanisms and pathways in which NAT16 and its encoded protein are involved.
