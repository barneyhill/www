# GSTO2

## Overview
GSTO2, or glutathione S-transferase omega 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the omega class of glutathione S-transferases, a family of enzymes involved in detoxification processes. The protein encoded by GSTO2 is primarily known for its role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress through its dehydroascorbate reductase activity (Petrovic2023The; Board2016Structure). This enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and esophagus, where it contributes to cellular detoxification and tissue homeostasis (Terayama2019Glutathione; Board2016Structure). GSTO2 is also implicated in several cellular interactions, influencing processes such as cell growth and adhesion via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway (Terayama2019Glutathione). Additionally, genetic variations in GSTO2 have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Baba2021GSTT1null; Allen2012Glutathione).

## Function
GSTO2 (glutathione S-transferase omega 2) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It exhibits high dehydroascorbate reductase activity, which is crucial for preserving ascorbate levels and maintaining the balance between reactive species and antioxidants in cells (Petrovic2023The; Board2016Structure). This activity is important for cellular detoxification processes, as GSTO2 catalyzes reduction reactions that help neutralize toxins (Board2016Structure).

GSTO2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it may contribute to neurological health by modulating oxidative stress and maintaining redox balance (Board2016Structure). In the esophagus, GSTO2 is expressed in the basal cell layer of the mucosa, particularly in non-proliferative cells, and is involved in regulating cell growth and adhesion through the p38 signaling pathway (Terayama2019Glutathione). The enzyme's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and cellular integrity. GSTO2's activity in the cytoplasm further highlights its involvement in cellular detoxification and protection against oxidative damage (Petrovic2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the GSTO2 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, the GSTO2 polymorphism rs156697 has been associated with an increased risk of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), with the GSTO2-GG variant genotype identified as a poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival in B-ALL patients (Baba2021GSTT1null). The GSTO2 polymorphism is also linked to an elevated risk of breast cancer, particularly in Caucasian populations (Xu2014Genetic). In ovarian cancer, the GSTO2 variant G allele is associated with increased susceptibility, and specific haplotypes involving GSTO2 are linked to higher risks of ovarian, bladder, and renal cell cancers (Simic2024The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, GSTO2 polymorphisms have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The rs156697 polymorphism in GSTO2 is associated with increased AD risk in individuals diagnosed after 80 years of age, potentially due to its impact on brain GSTO2 levels and oxidative stress (Allen2012Glutathione). The GSTO2 gene's role in these conditions may be related to its enzymatic activity, affecting redox balance and inflammatory processes (Board2016Structure).

## Interactions
GSTO2 (glutathione S-transferase omega 2) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In human esophageal squamous cells, GSTO2 regulates cell growth and the expression of E-cadherin by post-transcriptionally down-regulating β-catenin. This interaction is mediated through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, where GSTO2 overexpression leads to increased phosphorylation of p38 and its downstream molecule HSP27. Inhibition of p38 phosphorylation restores β-catenin and E-cadherin expression, indicating a regulatory interaction between GSTO2 and these proteins (Terayama2019Glutathione).

GSTO2 also plays a role in sperm function. It is localized in the postacrosomal sheath of spermatozoa and is involved in the oxidative regulation of the plasmalemma during capacitation. GSTO2's presence on the sperm surface suggests it may interact with components involved in oxidative stress regulation, although specific protein interactions are not detailed (Hamilton2019GSTO2).

In the context of disease, GSTO2 has been associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with genetic studies linking GSTO2 alleles to the age of onset of these conditions. However, specific physical interactions with proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not described (Board2016Structure).
