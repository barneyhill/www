# IL18R1

## Overview
The IL18R1 gene encodes the interleukin 18 receptor 1, a transmembrane protein that is integral to the immune system's response to inflammation and infection. As a receptor, it forms part of the interleukin 18 receptor complex, which is crucial for the binding and signal transduction of the cytokine interleukin 18 (IL-18). This interaction plays a significant role in both innate and adaptive immunity by activating immune cells such as T cells and natural killer cells, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The IL18R1 protein contains specific domains, including an immunoglobulin-like domain and a TIR domain, which are essential for its signaling functions. Located on chromosome 2q12, the IL18R1 gene is associated with various immunoregulatory processes and has been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including asthma and systemic rheumatic diseases (Omair2012An; Simula2024The; Zhu2008Interleukin).

## Structure
IL18R1, or interleukin 18 receptor 1, is a protein that plays a significant role in the immune response. The primary structure of IL18R1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of IL18R1 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules. In terms of quaternary structure, IL18R1 can assemble with other protein subunits to form functional complexes.

IL18R1 contains specific domains that are essential for its activity. Notably, it includes an immunoglobulin-like domain and a TIR domain, both of which are critical for its role in signaling pathways. These domains facilitate the protein's ability to bind to interleukin 18 and initiate immune responses. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur in IL18R1, influencing its stability and activity. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of IL18R1 can result in different functional forms of the protein, potentially affecting its role in the immune system. These structural features and modifications underscore the complexity and versatility of IL18R1 in immune regulation.

## Function
The IL18R1 gene encodes the interleukin 18 receptor 1, a protein that is a critical component of the interleukin 18 receptor complex, which also includes IL18RAP as a subunit. This receptor is essential for the binding and signal transduction of interleukin 18 (IL-18), a cytokine involved in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity (Omair2012An; Zhu2008Interleukin). IL18R1 is primarily expressed on the surface of immune cells such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it plays a pivotal role in activating these cells and promoting the secretion of interferon gamma (IFN-γ). This activation leads to the stimulation of macrophages, which subsequently secrete cytokines like TNF-α and IL1, contributing to immune responses and matrix degradation (Omair2012An).

The interaction of IL-18 with IL18R1 triggers MyD88-dependent signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of IL1R-associated kinases and other downstream effectors. This process results in the activation of activator protein 1 and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), which may enhance the transcription of cytokines such as IL4 and IL13 (Zhu2008Interleukin). The IL18R1 gene is located on chromosome 2q12, a region associated with numerous immunoregulatory genes linked to asthma and other inflammatory disorders (Omair2012An; Zhu2008Interleukin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL18R1 gene are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In allergic asthma, IL18R1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis by promoting TH1 and TH2 immune responses. Overexpression of IL-18, which interacts with IL18R1, leads to increased airway inflammation and heightened airway hyperresponsiveness, characteristic of asthma. Polymorphisms in IL18R1 are linked to asthma susceptibility, particularly in children, and increased serum levels of soluble IL18Rα are observed in allergic asthmatics (Lunding2015Allergic).

In systemic rheumatic diseases (SRDs) such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis (SSc), IL18R1 polymorphisms have been identified as having both protective and causative effects. Specific polymorphisms, such as those at chr2_103010912, show a protective effect in RA, SLE, and Sjögren's syndrome, while others, like chr2_103013408, are associated with increased risk in SSc (Simula2024The).

In coal workers' pneumoconiosis, IL18R1 polymorphisms, in conjunction with environmental factors like coal-dust exposure, may influence disease progression and lung health outcomes (Nadif2006IL18). These findings underscore the gene's varied impact on disease pathways and its potential as a target for further research.

## Interactions
IL18R1, or interleukin 18 receptor 1, is a critical component of the IL-18 receptor complex, which also includes IL18RAP. This complex is essential for the interaction with interleukin-18 (IL-18), a cytokine involved in immune responses. Upon binding with IL-18, IL18R1 initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events. This interaction recruits the adaptor protein MyD88, which is pivotal for downstream signaling. MyD88 subsequently associates with IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), leading to the activation of key signaling pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK. These pathways are crucial for the transcription of genes involved in inflammatory responses. The interaction between IL18R1 and these signaling molecules underscores its role in mediating immune and inflammatory responses.
