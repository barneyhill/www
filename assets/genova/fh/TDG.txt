# TDG

## Overview
Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a gene that encodes the enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase, a key player in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. The TDG protein is categorized as a DNA glycosylase, responsible for excising mismatched thymine residues and other modified bases from DNA, thereby preventing mutations and contributing to active DNA demethylation. This enzyme is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, through its interactions with nuclear receptors and transcriptional coactivators. TDG's activity and interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which influence its role in DNA repair and transcription. The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cellular context (Onabote2022The; Sjolund2013MBD4; Hassan2020TDG).

## Structure
Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a protein involved in base excision repair, characterized by a central catalytic domain flanked by disordered N- and C-terminal regions. The primary structure of TDG includes a sequence of 410 amino acids, with the catalytic domain spanning residues 112-339 (Coey2018Defining). The secondary structure of TDG features α-helices and β-sheets, with the C-terminal region forming a protruded α-helix upon SUMO-1 conjugation, which is crucial for DNA dissociation (Baba2005Crystal). The tertiary structure of TDG is globular, facilitating its interaction with DNA, and shares similarities with E. coli mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) (Baba2005Crystal).

TDG undergoes post-translational modifications, including sumoylation at lysine 330, which affects its enzymatic activity and DNA binding (SmetNocca2011SUMO1). This modification induces structural rearrangements, particularly in the C-terminal domain, enhancing enzymatic turnover by overcoming product inhibition (SmetNocca2011SUMO1). The N-terminal region, although disordered, plays a regulatory role and is involved in protein-protein interactions and transcription regulation (SmetNocca2008The). TDG also contains SUMO-binding motifs that facilitate non-covalent interactions with SUMO proteins, impacting its conformational dynamics and function (SmetNocca2011SUMO1).

## Function
Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a crucial enzyme in DNA repair and epigenetic regulation within healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, where it excises mismatched thymine residues from G:T mismatches and removes uracil and other modified bases, such as 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC), which are oxidation products of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) generated by TET enzymes (Onabote2022The; Sjolund2013MBD4). This activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression regulation (Onabote2022The).

TDG plays a significant role in active DNA demethylation, a process crucial for transcriptional regulation, embryonic development, and cell differentiation. It interacts with nuclear hormone receptors, such as the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), enhancing their affinity for target genes and recruiting co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 to facilitate transcriptional activation (Onabote2022The). TDG is also involved in chromatin reorganization and enhancer RNA transcription, acting as a scaffold protein that stabilizes protein complexes at target genes (Onabote2022The). Its activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as sumoylation, which influences its interaction with other proteins and its enzymatic turnover (Sjolund2013MBD4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TDG gene are associated with various cancers and conditions. In colorectal cancer, TDG is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene, promoting tumorigenesis through the WNT signaling pathway. Knockdown of TDG in colorectal cancer cell lines reduces tumor formation, indicating its role in cancer cell proliferation (Onabote2022The). In glioma, particularly glioblastoma, TDG expression is elevated, correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer patient outcomes. High TDG expression is associated with shorter overall survival in glioma patients, and its suppression inhibits glioma cell proliferation and tumor growth (Xu2024TNC).

TDG also plays a role in liver malignancies. Conditional deletion of TDG in mice leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma, with a male sex bias. The loss of TDG disrupts active DNA demethylation, affecting metabolic processes and predisposing to HCC (Hassan2020TDG). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TDG-mediated histone acetylation promotes the expression of LINC00467, a long non-coding RNA that acts as a tumor promoter. High TDG expression is linked to advanced clinical stages and shorter overall survival in NSCLC patients (Zhu2020LINC00467).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TDG, such as Gly199Ser and Val367Met, are associated with increased cancer risk, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (D’Errico2017Single). These findings highlight the dual role of TDG as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cancer type and context.

## Interactions
Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a critical role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. TDG interacts with transcription factors such as c-Jun, nuclear receptors like RAR and RXR, and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), influencing their DNA binding and transcriptional activities (Sjolund2013MBD4). It also acts as a coactivator for estrogen receptor α (ERα) in a ligand-dependent manner (Sjolund2013MBD4).

TDG forms complexes with transcriptional coregulators, including SRC1 and NCoR3, and interacts with coactivators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300, which modify chromatin structure to facilitate transcription (Sjolund2013MBD4). It is acetylated by CBP/p300, affecting its interactions and suggesting a coordination between DNA repair and transcription functions (Sjolund2013MBD4).

TDG interacts with DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a, inhibiting its methylation activity while enhancing TDG's catalytic activity, crucial for repairing deaminated 5-methylcytosine (Sjolund2013MBD4). It also associates with proteins involved in base excision repair, such as APE1, XRCC1, and ligase III, facilitating the repair process (Hang2003Protein−Protein). Sumoylation of TDG modulates its interactions, affecting its binding to AP sites and interaction with other proteins (Coey2018Defining).
