# TINAG

## Overview
The TINAG gene encodes the tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen, an extracellular matrix protein predominantly expressed in the tubular basement membranes of the kidney. This protein is integral to renal development, particularly in the formation of renal tubules, known as tubulogenesis. As a component of the extracellular matrix, TINAG is involved in cell adhesion processes, interacting with laminin and type IV collagen, albeit with relatively low affinity (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix, thereby supporting epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis (Kanwar1999Tubulointerstitial). TINAG's role extends to the regulation of epithelial cell adhesion in kidney tubules, highlighting its importance in cell communication with the extracellular microenvironment (You2021Promising). Additionally, TINAG is implicated in various kidney-related diseases and conditions, including autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis and nephronophthisis, as well as in certain cancers, where it may influence disease progression and metastasis (Zhang2023Function; Lennon2017Extracellular).

## Structure


## Function
The TINAG gene encodes an extracellular matrix protein that is primarily expressed in the tubular basement membranes of the kidney. This protein plays a crucial role in renal development, particularly in the process of tubulogenesis, which involves the formation of renal tubules. TINAG is involved in cell adhesion processes by interacting with laminin and type IV collagen, components of the basement membrane, although its affinity for these interactions is relatively low (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial). It promotes cell adhesion, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix in healthy cells (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial).

TINAG is also implicated in the regulation of epithelial cell adhesion in kidney tubules, suggesting its importance in cell communication with the extracellular microenvironment (You2021Promising). It interacts with integrins α3β1 and αVβ3, which are involved in nephrogenesis, although it lacks the RGD sequence typically essential for cell-matrix interactions, indicating that other motifs may regulate its functions (Kanwar1999Tubulointerstitial). These interactions are vital for sustaining epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis, highlighting TINAG's role in kidney development and function (Kanwar1999Tubulointerstitial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TINAG gene are associated with several kidney-related diseases and conditions. TINAG is implicated in nephronophthisis, a condition affecting cell survival, where mutations in the gene can lead to disease progression (You2021Promising). It is also involved in autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), a condition characterized by inflammation of the kidney's tubules, where TINAG acts as an antigen (Lennon2017Extracellular). Alterations in TINAG expression and methylation status are linked to the histologic grade and T stage of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), with decreasing RNA expression levels associated with lower tumor grades and higher tumor T stages (You2021Promising).

In addition to kidney-related conditions, TINAG has been identified in other diseases. A novel heterozygous stop-gain variant in TINAG was found in patients with pectus excavatum, a congenital chest wall deformity, suggesting a potential role in its pathogenesis (Tong2020TINAG). In cancer, TINAG is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and is linked to pathological metastasis, stage, and node, indicating its involvement in cancer progression through pathways like PI3K/AKT (Zhang2023Function).

## Interactions
TINAG (tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen) is known to interact with several components of the basement membrane, particularly laminin and type IV collagen. These interactions are specific and saturable, occurring with low micromolar affinity. TINAG binds to type IV collagen in a 1:1 molar ratio, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.0 pM, indicating a relatively low affinity (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial). TINAG does not interact with heparin, a model for basement membrane proteoglycans, suggesting specificity in its binding partners (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial).

TINAG influences the polymerization of laminin by reducing the turbidity of laminin solutions, which suggests it may affect the structural organization of the basement membrane. However, it does not affect the polymerization of type IV collagen, indicating that its binding site on collagen is not critical for this process (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial). TINAG also promotes cell adhesion, although it is less effective than laminin or type IV collagen in this role (Kalfa1994Tubulointerstitial).

In diabetic conditions, TINAG is up-regulated and interacts with collagen VI, which is also increased in diabetic kidneys. This interaction may contribute to the pathology of diabetic nephropathy (Gong2009Quantitative).
