# SLC25A42

## Overview
SLC25A42 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial carrier protein known as solute carrier family 25 member 42. This protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, which is characterized by its role in transporting essential molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. Specifically, SLC25A42 facilitates the transport of coenzyme A (CoA) and adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (PAP), which are critical for various mitochondrial processes such as fatty acid beta-oxidation, the Krebs cycle, and heme biosynthesis (Palmieri2013The; Fiermonte2009A). The protein's structure includes six transmembrane alpha-helices that form a funnel-shaped cavity, allowing it to function as a transmembrane transporter (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). Mutations in the SLC25A42 gene have been linked to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Aldosary2021SLC25A42‐associated).

## Structure
The SLC25A42 protein is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices form a funnel-shaped cavity that is open towards the cytosol, facilitating the transport of molecules such as Coenzyme A, dephospho-CoA, ADP, and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate across the mitochondrial membrane (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The protein's structure includes three homologous domains, each containing two hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic sequence, which is a common feature among the solute carrier family 25 (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The primary structure of SLC25A42 consists of amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane domains, while the secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha-helices. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a stable conformation, supported by a network of salt bridges formed by conserved motifs, which are crucial for the protein's transport mechanism (Palmieri2020Diseases; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). Although specific details on post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of SLC25A42 are not provided, such modifications are common in proteins of this family and can influence their function and localization.

## Function
SLC25A42 encodes a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a crucial role in transporting coenzyme A (CoA) and adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate (PAP) across the mitochondrial membrane. This transport is essential for various mitochondrial processes, including fatty acid beta-oxidation, the Krebs cycle, heme biosynthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, the urea cycle, protein acetylation, and type II fatty acid synthase (Palmieri2013The; Fiermonte2009A). The protein facilitates a counter-exchange mechanism, importing CoA into mitochondria in exchange for intramitochondrial nucleotides and PAP, which is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Palmieri2020Diseases; Fiermonte2009A).

SLC25A42 is highly expressed in virtually all human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular metabolism (Fiermonte2009A). The protein's activity is characterized by a high affinity for CoA and PAP, and it is inhibited by known mitochondrial carrier inhibitors, suggesting its specificity and regulatory mechanisms in mitochondrial transport processes (Fiermonte2009A). The transport of CoA by SLC25A42 is vital for the synthesis of lipoic acid and long-chain fatty acids, as well as for the phosphopantetheinylation of acyl carrier protein, which are essential for cellular energy homeostasis (Palmieri2020Diseases).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A42 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily characterized by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. This condition manifests with symptoms such as muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, developmental delays, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and dystonia. Specific mutations, including the homozygous missense variant c.871A > G:p.Asn291Asp, have been identified predominantly in individuals of Saudi origin, while a splice site variant c.380 + 2 T > A has been found in a German individual (Aldosary2021SLC25A42‐associated). These mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial function, as evidenced by decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP production, and reduced glycolysis (Aldosary2021SLC25A42‐associated).

The clinical presentation of SLC25A42-related disorders is heterogeneous, with some patients experiencing severe motor and speech impairments, while others have near-normal development. Common features include elevated serum lactate levels and basal ganglia lesions observed in MRI scans (Aldosary2021SLC25A42‐associated). The pathogenic effects of SLC25A42 mutations are supported by zebrafish models, which show severe muscle disorganization and weakness upon gene knockdown (Palmieri2020Diseases). The variability in clinical severity, even among patients with the same mutation, poses challenges in understanding the full spectrum of SLC25A42 deficiency (Palmieri2020Diseases).
