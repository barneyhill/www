# PTPRS

## Overview
The PTPRS gene encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type S (RPTPσ), a transmembrane protein that is part of the LAR-RPTP subfamily. This protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which includes immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, and its intracellular region, which contains two protein tyrosine phosphatase domains. RPTPσ is involved in a variety of cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system, where it regulates neuronal growth and synaptic function. It interacts with several ligands and proteins, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, influencing cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, RPTPσ plays a role in maintaining epithelial integrity and modulating receptor tyrosine kinase activity. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and have potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer prognosis (Uetani2009Maturation; Muise2008Apical; Cornejo2021LAR).

## Structure
The PTPRS protein is a member of the LAR-RPTP subfamily, characterized by a specific molecular structure. It features an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and eight fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, which resemble cell adhesion molecules (CAM) (Muise2008Apical; Cornejo2021LAR). The Ig-like domains form a V-shaped conformation crucial for ligand binding, while the FNIII domains have a flexible 'beads on a string' conformation that aids in motility and interaction with ligands (Cornejo2021LAR). The protein also includes a single transmembrane domain and two intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains. The intracellular region contains a catalytically active membrane-proximal PTP domain (D1) and a membrane-distal domain (D2) that lacks catalytic activity but stabilizes the protein in the synaptic zone (Cornejo2021LAR).

Alternative splicing of PTPRS results in different isoforms, affecting ligand binding and synaptic organization. Specific splice variants, such as those including mini-exons meA and meB, modulate ligand binding activity and influence interactions with synaptic proteins like IL1RAPL1 and IL-1RAcP (Cornejo2021LAR). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing, forming a 150-KDa extracellular subunit and an 85-KDa subunit containing the transmembrane peptide and intracellular domains (Cornejo2021LAR).

## Function
The PTPRS gene encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type S (RPTPσ), a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, RPTPσ plays a crucial role in nervous system development and function. It negatively regulates dendritic and axonal growth, influencing neuronal structure and synaptic function. RPTPσ interacts with ligands such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which modulate its activity and impact neuronal growth (Cornejo2021LAR).

RPTPσ is also involved in maintaining epithelial integrity in the colon by stabilizing adherens junctions through the dephosphorylation of E-cadherin and β-catenin, which are essential for cell adhesion and barrier function (Muise2008Apical). In the context of synaptic processes, RPTPσ mediates the dephosphorylation of presynaptic Neurexin-1, promoting postsynaptic activity crucial for recognition memory (Cornejo2021LAR).

Additionally, RPTPσ interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases such as Ret, modulating their phosphorylation and influencing signaling pathways involved in cell survival and apoptosis (Uetani2009Maturation). These activities highlight the diverse roles of PTPRS in cellular signaling and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPRS gene have been implicated in several diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis (UC), has been associated with polymorphisms in the PTPRS gene. These polymorphisms can disrupt intestinal barrier defense, leading to increased permeability, a key factor in UC pathogenesis (Muise2008Apical). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTPRS, such as rs8100586, have been linked to UC, with certain haplotypes resulting in a splice variant that may increase susceptibility to the disease (Muise2008Apical).

PTPRS is also associated with neurological functions. Mice lacking PTPRS expression exhibit neurological defects, suggesting its role in neurodevelopment and potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders (Cornejo2021LAR). Although no direct brain pathologies are linked to PTPRS mutations, reduced expression has been observed in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), potentially affecting axonal regeneration (Cornejo2021LAR).

In cancer, PTPRS has been identified as a potential biomarker for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). High serum levels of PTPRS are associated with longer survival times in CCA patients, indicating its role as an independent prognostic marker (Lertpanprom2022High). These findings suggest that PTPRS may play a role in the progression and prognosis of various diseases.

## Interactions
PTPRS (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type S) is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in synaptic organization and neuronal development. It interacts with several synaptic partners, including N-cadherin and β-catenin, promoting their complex formation and influencing axonal growth (Cornejo2021LAR). PTPRS also forms complexes with glypican-4 (GPC-4) and LRRTM4, which are involved in modulating synaptic transmission and excitatory synapse development (Cornejo2021LAR). 

PTPRS interacts with presynaptic Neurexin-1 through a complex with liprin-α, promoting NMDAR-mediated postsynaptic activity, which is essential for synaptic processes like long-term potentiation (Cornejo2021LAR). It also binds to SALMs, except SALM4, and interacts with interleukin-1 receptor accessory proteins (IL1RAPL1 and IL1RAPL2), suggesting a role in synaptic organization and immune system processes (Wojtowicz2020A). 

The interaction with Slitrks, particularly Slitrk1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, coordinates excitatory synapse development, involving liprin-α and p250GAP (Cornejo2021LAR). PTPRS's interaction with CSPGs and HSPGs regulates its phosphatase activity, influencing axonal growth and regeneration (Cornejo2021LAR). These interactions highlight PTPRS's multifaceted role in neuronal signaling and synaptic development.
