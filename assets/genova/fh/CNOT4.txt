# CNOT4

## Overview
CNOT4 is a gene that encodes the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 4, a protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, marking them for degradation. This function is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. CNOT4 is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, a multi-subunit assembly involved in transcriptional regulation, mRNA decay, and deadenylation, which are vital for controlling gene expression and mRNA stability (Albert2002Identification; Kulkarni2024Human). The protein's structure includes a unique C4C4 RING finger domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and an RNA recognition motif that suggests a role in RNA binding (Albert2000Isolation; Albert2002Identification). CNOT4's activity is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cell cycle regulation, stress responses, and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Hagkarim2023Disruption; Wang2024TNKS1BP1).

## Structure
The human CNOT4 protein is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It contains a unique C4C4 RING finger domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) such as UbcH5B. This domain binds two zinc atoms using eight cysteine residues in a cross-brace manner, a feature that distinguishes it from the classical C3HC4 RING fingers (Hanzawa2001The; Albert2002Identification). The RING domain is located within the first 63 residues of the protein and is necessary for E2 enzyme binding, forming a triangular interface with a shallow hydrophobic groove (Albert2002Identification).

The N-terminal region of CNOT4 also includes an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a C3H-type zinc finger, which are implicated in RNA binding (Albert2000Isolation; Albert2002Identification). The C-terminal region is less conserved and varies among isoforms, which may affect its interactions and functions (Albert2000Isolation). CNOT4 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and interactions within the CCR4-NOT complex (Xu2014Insights).

## Function
CNOT4 is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, a global regulator of gene expression involved in various molecular processes. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacting with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) through its C4C4 RING domain, which is crucial for its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation (Albert2002Identification). This activity is essential for transcriptional regulation, as CNOT4 can influence the stability and turnover of proteins involved in transcription machinery (Albert2002Identification).

CNOT4 also plays a significant role in mRNA metabolism, particularly in mRNA decay and deadenylation, processes critical for regulating mRNA half-life and gene expression (Chalabi2020The; Kulkarni2024Human). Depletion of CNOT4 leads to increased mRNA decay rates, suggesting its role in stabilizing mRNAs (Kulkarni2024Human). It is involved in the repression of retrotransposon elements by regulating the transcription of KRAB-Zinc-Finger-proteins, which are transcriptional repressors of these elements (Kulkarni2024Human).

CNOT4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and stress responses (Hagkarim2023Disruption). Its interaction with ribosomes suggests a role in translation regulation and ribosome quality control (Absmeier2022Specific).

## Clinical Significance
CNOT4, a component of the CCR4-NOT transcription complex, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in key cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alterations in CNOT4 expression are linked to cancer progression and immune evasion. The ubiquitination and degradation of CNOT4, facilitated by TNKS1BP1 and TRIM21, lead to the inactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and reducing autophagy (Wang2024TNKS1BP1). Lower expression levels of CNOT4 in HCC patients are associated with poorer prognosis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wang2024TNKS1BP1).

CNOT4 is also implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Its involvement in the CCR4-NOT complex affects transcription regulation, mRNA degradation, and DNA repair, processes that are crucial for neuronal function. Disruptions in these processes have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, with CNOT4's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity being a common theme in neurodevelopmental genetics (Lopes2017The).

Additionally, CNOT4 is involved in the DNA damage response and stress responses, with its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway being crucial for protein degradation and cellular proteostasis. Disruptions in CNOT4 function could lead to issues with protein degradation and cellular stress responses (Chalabi2020The).

## Interactions
CNOT4, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with a subset of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), particularly the UBC4/5 subfamily, including UbcH5B, UbcH6, and UbcH9. These interactions are mediated by the RING domain of CNOT4, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity (Albert2002Identification). The interaction with UbcH5B is particularly significant, as it supports the autoubiquitylation of CNOT4 and is crucial for its function in polyubiquitin chain assembly (Albert2002Identification).

CNOT4 also interacts with other components of the CCR4-NOT complex. It binds to the C-terminal part of CNOT1 and interacts with CNOT9 through a conserved 23-amino acid motif, which overlaps with binding sites for other proteins like Bam and Roquin (Chalabi2020The; Pavanello2023Regulation). Despite these interactions, CNOT4 is not stably integrated into the human CCR4-NOT complex, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may involve post-translational modifications or other factors (Lau2009Human). These interactions highlight CNOT4's role in ubiquitination processes and its regulatory functions within the CCR4-NOT complex.
