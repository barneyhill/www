# SMAP1

## Overview
The SMAP1 gene encodes the small ArfGAP 1 protein, a GTPase-activating protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. As a type II membrane protein, small ArfGAP 1 is characterized by its ArfGAP domain, which facilitates the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, a critical step in vesicle formation and trafficking (Rühle2017Rare; Sato1998Involvement). The protein is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, particularly influencing the internalization of transferrin receptors and the regulation of Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells (Tanabe2005A; Watanabe2021Arf). Additionally, small ArfGAP 1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and hematological disorders, where its altered expression or mutations can affect cell proliferation and migration (Harms2022Pals1; Kon2014Altered). The gene's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The SMAP1 protein, encoded by the SMAP1 gene, is involved in vesicle trafficking and cellular processes. It contains an ArfGAP domain, which is crucial for its GTPase-activating function, facilitating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, a key step in vesicle formation and trafficking (Rühle2017Rare). The protein is characterized as a type II membrane protein, with its C-terminal part exposed extracellularly, and includes a transmembrane domain (Sato1998Involvement). The structure of SMAP1 includes regions of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, with a transmembrane domain necessary for its membrane association (Sato1998Involvement).

SMAP1 also features a KE-rich region and a Cys-Cys Zinc finger motif, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Sato1998Involvement). The protein has three potential N-glycosylation sites and several phosphorylation sites, indicating its nature as a glycoprotein and suggesting regulation through post-translational modifications (Sato1998Involvement). The presence of direct repeats of KKD/E units in the protein sequence is similar to those found in microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting a role in microtubule interactions (Sato1998Involvement). The SMAP1 gene may have splice variants, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions (Rühle2017Rare).

## Function
SMAP1, a small ArfGAP, is a GTPase-activating protein that specifically acts on Arf6, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In healthy human cells, SMAP1 plays a critical role in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, particularly in the internalization of transferrin receptors. It directly interacts with the clathrin heavy chain through its clathrin-box, and both its GAP domain and clathrin-box are essential for its role in this process (Tanabe2005A). SMAP1's activity influences the subcellular localization of AP-2, a clathrin adaptor protein, suggesting that it regulates Arf6 activity specifically in the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (Tanabe2005A).

SMAP1 is also involved in the regulation of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) and the transport of von Willebrand factor (vWF) in endothelial cells. It prevents the degradation of WPBs in lysosomes, and its depletion leads to smaller WPBs, which secrete vWF with lower adhesive activity to platelets (Watanabe2021Arf). Additionally, SMAP1 is expressed in the erythroid lineage and other hematopoietic lineages, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal hematopoietic functions and possibly in the regulation of platelet numbers and function (Rühle2017Rare).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SMAP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and hematological disorders. In colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability, mutations in SMAP1 often occur as short deletions or insertions within a 10-adenine repeat in the coding region. These mutations lead to premature termination codons, resulting in reduced or abolished SMAP1 protein levels. This reduction is associated with enhanced cell proliferation by shortening the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, contributing to cancer progression (Kon2014Altered).

SMAP1 also plays a role in colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion. It functions redundantly with Pals1 to regulate Arf6 activity, which affects Rac1-dependent cell migration. When both SMAP1 and Pals1 are inactivated, there is an increase in Arf6/Rac1 activity, leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis in patients (Harms2022Pals1).

In hematological contexts, SMAP1 deficiency in gene-targeted mice has been linked to a predisposition for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which can progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SMAP1(-/-) mice serve as a model for human MDS, showing increased endocytosis of transferrin and impaired degradation of KIT, leading to persistent signaling and increased proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors (Kon2014Altered).

Additionally, rare genetic variants in SMAP1 have been associated with pediatric venous thromboembolism (VTE). Nonsynonymous variants in SMAP1 are predicted to be deleterious, potentially affecting vesicle processing in blood cells, which may contribute to VTE susceptibility in children (Rühle2017Rare).

## Interactions
SMAP1, a GTPase-activating protein for Arf6, is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis and interacts directly with the clathrin heavy chain (CHC). This interaction is mediated by a specific region in SMAP1 known as the clathrin-box, which contains the LLGLD sequence. The clathrin-box is crucial for the association between SMAP1 and CHC, as demonstrated by GST-pull-down experiments. Mutations in this region, such as the L192A mutation, significantly reduce the interaction with CHC, highlighting the importance of the clathrin-box for binding (Tanabe2005A).

SMAP1's GAP activity is necessary for the impairment of AP-2 recruitment, a component of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. The GAP-negative mutant of SMAP1 (SMAP1 R61Q) still inhibits transferrin internalization but through a different mechanism than the wild-type, indicating complex interactions involving multiple pathways (Tanabe2005A). SMAP1 does not affect actin reorganization, distinguishing it from other Arf6GAPs, and specifically regulates Arf6 activity in the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (Tanabe2005A).
