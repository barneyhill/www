# ARL4C

## Overview
ARL4C is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 4C, which is a member of the small GTPase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and cell signaling. It plays a significant role in the formation of epithelial tubular structures and is activated by signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and EGF/Ras, which are crucial for cell proliferation and morphological changes (Fujii2016Epigenetic; Matsumoto2014A). ARL4C is particularly noted for its involvement in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, interacting with proteins like IQGAP1 and MMP14 to facilitate these processes (Harada2021Localization; Harada2021Recruitment). Its expression levels have been linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kimura2020ARL4C; Hu2017Identification).

## Function
ARL4C is a small GTP-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and cell signaling. In healthy human cells, ARL4C plays a crucial role in the formation of epithelial tubular structures. It is expressed in response to Wnt3a and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, which induces changes in cell morphology and promotes the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ, key transcription activators in the Hippo pathway. This process is essential for cell proliferation and morphological changes necessary for tubulogenesis (Matsumoto2014A).

ARL4C regulates the activities of small GTPases Rac and Rho, which are involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. Its expression leads to the formation of F-actin-rich membrane ruffles, indicating its role in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Matsumoto2014A). ARL4C is also involved in the elongation and branching of kidney ureteric buds, suggesting its role in the development of tubular organs (Matsumoto2014A).

In the context of cell signaling, ARL4C is activated by Wnt/β-catenin and EGF/Ras pathways, which are common in various cellular processes. It promotes cellular proliferation through YAP, forming tube-like structures in cultured epithelial cells (Fujii2016Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARL4C gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis. In gastric cancer, high ARL4C expression is associated with peritoneal dissemination and poor overall survival, making it a significant prognostic factor. Its expression is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing the migration and invasion capabilities of cancer cells (Hu2017Identification). In colorectal cancer, ARL4C is highly expressed at the invasion front and is associated with high-grade tumor budding and EMT phenotype, suggesting a role in worsening prognosis (Kanai2023ARL4C).

In lung adenocarcinoma, ARL4C expression correlates with disease progression and poor relapse-free survival, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kimura2020ARL4C). The gene is also involved in drug resistance, as seen in non-small cell lung cancer, where its downregulation is linked to resistance to Erlotinib, a common therapeutic agent (Liao2020The).

ARL4C's expression is associated with poor prognosis in several other cancers, including bladder cancer, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and low-grade glioblastoma, while acting as a protective factor in skin cutaneous melanoma and thymoma (Zhao2023The). These findings highlight ARL4C as a potential target for cancer therapy and a prognostic marker across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
ARL4C, a small GTPase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer cell invasion. One of the primary interactions of ARL4C is with IQGAP1, a protein that plays a significant role in the invasive ability of pancreatic cancer cells. This interaction is facilitated by the polybasic region (PBR) at the C terminus of ARL4C, which is essential for its binding to IQGAP1. Mutations affecting the PBR or the N-terminal myristoylation site of ARL4C result in decreased binding to IQGAP1 and loss of localization to membrane protrusions (Harada2021Localization; Harada2021Recruitment).

ARL4C also interacts with MMP14, a downstream effector recruited to membrane protrusions through the ARL4C-IQGAP1 signaling axis. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of the extracellular matrix, promoting cancer cell invasion (Harada2021Localization; Harada2021Recruitment). Additionally, ARL4C can recruit cytohesin ARNO to the plasma membrane, although this interaction is more prominent in other cell types like HeLa cells and not in pancreatic cancer cells (Hofmann2007The). These interactions highlight ARL4C's role in modulating cellular signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
