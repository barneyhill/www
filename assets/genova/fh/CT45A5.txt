# CT45A5

## Overview
CT45A5 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A5, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is primarily expressed in cancerous tissues and testis, and it plays a significant role in the regulation of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways. CT45A5 interacts with various proteins, including the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, influencing its phosphatase activity and thereby modulating DDR signaling (Coscia2018Multilevel). The protein is also involved in interactions with DNA repair factors, suggesting its role in DNA repair processes (Coscia2018Multilevel). CT45A5 is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where its expression is associated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in endometrial and ovarian cancers (Coscia2018Multilevel; Suzuki2021YBX2). Its potential as a therapeutic target is underscored by its involvement in chemosensitivity and disease progression, making it a focus of interest for cancer research and treatment strategies.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CT45A5, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancers, notably endometrial and ovarian cancer. In endometrial cancer, CT45A5 expression is associated with increased stemness, chemoresistance, and malignancy. It is critical for the self-renewal capacity of cancer cells, as demonstrated by reduced sphere-forming ability upon CT45A5 knockdown. Its expression also correlates with resistance to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, but not to cisplatin or carboplatin, indicating a specific role in chemoresistance (Suzuki2021YBX2). High CT45A5 expression is linked to poor prognosis, higher tumor grade, and stage, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Suzuki2021YBX2).

In ovarian cancer, CT45A5 is part of the broader CT45 family, which is associated with chemosensitivity and serves as a potential target for immunotherapy. CT45 expression correlates with increased DNA damage response and repair pathways, enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin. This suggests a role in mediating chemosensitivity and improving patient outcomes (Coscia2018Multilevel). CT45A5's expression is also linked to DNA hypomethylation, which is associated with disease progression and reduced survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (Zhang2015DNA). These findings highlight CT45A5's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CT45A5, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of ovarian cancer. It interacts with the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, specifically binding to the regulatory subunit PP4R3b. This interaction was confirmed through methods such as co-immunoprecipitation and isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding of CT45 to PP4 reduces the phosphatase activity of PP4, indicating that CT45 acts as a regulator of PP4 signaling, which is crucial in DNA damage response (DDR) signaling (Coscia2018Multilevel).

CT45A5 has also been shown to be in close proximity to DNA repair factors such as 53BP1 and BRCA1, suggesting potential interactions with these proteins, although the exact nature of these interactions is not fully detailed (Coscia2018Multilevel). Additionally, CT45A5 interacts with proteins like SMEK2 and PPP4R2, as demonstrated through binding experiments using size exclusion chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry (Coscia2018Multilevel). These interactions highlight the role of CT45A5 in modulating pathways related to DNA repair and chemosensitivity, making it a potential target for cancer therapy.
