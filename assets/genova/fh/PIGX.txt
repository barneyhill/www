# PIGX

## Overview
The PIGX gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class X protein, a regulatory subunit involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are critical for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, influencing cellular processes such as signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The PIGX protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it plays a non-catalytic, regulatory role by stabilizing the GPI-mannosyltransferase I (GPI-ManT-I) complex, particularly through its interaction with the catalytic subunit PIGM (Ashida2005Mammalian; Kinoshita2020Biosynthesis). This interaction is essential for the initial stages of GPI anchor synthesis, facilitating the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI intermediate (Liu2021A). PIGX is expressed in various human tissues, and its expression levels have been implicated in different cancer types, suggesting a broader role in cellular function and potential implications in health and disease (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Structure
The PIGX protein is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 3q29 and has two main isoforms resulting from alternative splicing. The canonical isoform, PIGX Q8TBF5-1, consists of 258 amino acids with a mass of 28,788 Da. It features a signal peptide (amino acids 1-21) that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The soluble portion of the protein (amino acids 22-230) resides in the ER lumen, while amino acids 231-251 are embedded in the ER membrane, and the C-terminal region (amino acids 252-258) is cytoplasmic (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

The tertiary structure, as predicted by AlphaFold DB, shows a random coil structure and β-sheets in the luminal region, with a single α-helix in the transmembrane region (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). Post-translational modifications include an N-glycosylation site at asparagine 103, a phosphorylation site at serine 136, and ubiquitination sites at lysines 66 and 82 (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGX is known to associate with PIGM, although the specific domain responsible for this interaction is not yet identified (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The protein plays a role in stabilizing the GPI-mannosyltransferase I enzyme, which is crucial for glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis (Kinoshita2020Biosynthesis).

## Function
The PIGX gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the GPI-mannosyltransferase-I (GPI-ManT-I) complex, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are essential for attaching proteins to the cell membrane, impacting various cellular functions such as signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Liu2021A; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGX is involved in the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI intermediate, a critical step in GPI anchor formation. Although the knockout of PIGX results in weak expression of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), it does not completely halt their biosynthesis, indicating its regulatory role rather than a catalytic one (Liu2021A).

PIGX is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, digestive, and reproductive systems, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The protein is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is associated with the stabilization of the PIGM protein, which is essential for the initial stages of GPI synthesis (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGX's role in maintaining the stability and function of PIGM influences the biosynthesis of GPI anchors and the surface expression of GPI-APs (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role).

## Clinical Significance
The PIGX gene plays a significant role in various cancers and its expression levels have been linked to clinical outcomes. In cervical cancer, low expression of PIGX is observed, while in breast cancer, high levels of PIGX mRNA are associated with decreased survival in disease-free patients. This suggests that PIGX expression promotes cancer cell proliferation, potentially by suppressing tumor suppressor genes such as ZIC1 and EHD2 (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). 

In lung cancer, mutations in PIGX have been identified in young, non-smoker patients, indicating a potential pathogenic role in this cancer type (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). Despite these associations, no specific diseases or conditions caused by mutations in the PIGX gene have been conclusively identified. The absence of reported pathogenic mutations might be due to the rarity of such conditions or the possibility that mutations in PIGX are not compatible with life, leading to early embryonic death (knaus2019phenotypic).

PIGX is also involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis, and its deficiency can lead to weak expression of GPI-anchored proteins, which are crucial for various cellular functions (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). However, specific diseases directly linked to PIGX mutations remain unidentified.

## Interactions
PIGX is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-mannosyltransferase I (GPI-MT-I) complex, where it interacts with PIGM, the catalytic subunit of the complex. This interaction is essential for the stability and function of PIGM, as PIGX significantly increases the expression level of PIGM by stabilizing it (Ashida2005Mammalian; Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). PIGX does not possess a catalytic domain itself but plays a regulatory role in the GPI biosynthesis pathway by forming a complex with PIGM, facilitating the transfer of the first mannose to the GPI intermediate (Liu2021A).

In addition to its interaction with PIGM, PIGX may form a protein complex with Reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1) and RCN2 in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in regulating calcium-dependent activity. This interaction suggests a broader role for PIGX in cellular processes beyond GPI biosynthesis (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). The BioGRID database indicates that PIGX can bind to six proteins, although the specific biological contexts of these interactions are not fully understood (Torres‑Valdetano2024Role). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PIGX in cellular function and its potential implications in health and disease.
