# PNMA8A

## Overview
PNMA8A is a gene that encodes the protein PNMA family member 8A, which is part of the paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis and immune response regulation. Although the specific functions of PNMA8A are not fully characterized, it is believed to play a role in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The protein's involvement in apoptosis suggests it may have regulatory functions in cell death pathways, which could be significant in understanding its role in disease mechanisms (Lopez2020OXPHOS; DíazCampos2024Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the PNMA8A gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions. In the context of Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), PNMA8A was found to be upregulated in affected individuals compared to carriers, although its specific role in the disease remains unclear. The study noted that none of the differentially expressed genes, including PNMA8A, have been previously associated with LHON, indicating a need for further research to determine their clinical significance (Lopez2020OXPHOS).

In cancer research, PNMA8A has been discussed in relation to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). While primarily associated with apoptosis and colorectal cancer, its role in lung cancer is not well established. The gene, along with PLPPR3, is suggested to have potential implications in NSCLC, warranting further investigation into its role and interactions with other genes in cancer development (DíazCampos2024Functional).

Overall, while PNMA8A is recognized for its involvement in certain diseases, its precise clinical implications require more comprehensive studies to elucidate its role in these conditions.
