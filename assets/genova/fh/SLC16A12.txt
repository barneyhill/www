# SLC16A12

## Overview
SLC16A12 is a gene that encodes the protein monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), a member of the solute carrier family 16. MCT12 is a transmembrane protein characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of substrates across cell membranes. This transporter primarily functions as a facilitative creatine transporter, playing a crucial role in energy metabolism by mediating the efflux of creatine in tissues with high energy demands, such as skeletal muscles, heart, and brain. MCT12 operates independently of ion gradients and is stabilized by interactions with proteins like CD147, which aid in its localization to the plasma membrane. Mutations in SLC16A12 have been linked to clinical conditions such as juvenile cataracts and renal glucosuria, highlighting its significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Takahashi2020Functional; Halestrap2004The; Dhayat2015Mutation).

## Structure
The SLC16A12 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), which is part of the solute carrier family 16. MCT12 is characterized by a typical structure of 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among monocarboxylate transporters, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Halestrap2013The; Halestrap2004The). This structural arrangement facilitates the transport of substrates across cell membranes.

Key amino acids within the transmembrane domains are crucial for the function of MCT12. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified that charged residues such as Arg37, Asp65, and Asp299 are essential for creatine transport, indicating their role in substrate recognition and transport (Takahashi2020Functional). These residues are likely involved in forming the substrate binding site or in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for transport activity.

MCT12 operates through facilitated diffusion, driven by concentration gradients, and its activity is independent of ion gradients, unlike other members of the MCT family (Takahashi2020Functional). The presence of CD147 is important for the stabilization and localization of MCT12 in the plasma membrane, suggesting a potential quaternary structure interaction (Takahashi2020Functional).

## Function
SLC16A12, also known as monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), functions as a facilitative creatine transporter in mammalian cells. It primarily mediates the efflux of creatine through facilitated diffusion, driven by an outwardly directed concentration gradient of creatine across the plasma membrane (Takahashi2020Functional). This process is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, as creatine is a key molecule in energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as skeletal muscles, heart, and brain (Takahashi2020Functional).

MCT12's activity is not dependent on ion gradients and is enhanced under basic pH conditions, distinguishing it from other monocarboxylate transporters (Takahashi2020Functional). The transporter is stabilized by the presence of CD147, which aids in its localization to the lateral membranes of cells (Takahashi2020Functional). Mutations in specific amino acid residues, such as Arg37, can significantly impact its function, highlighting the importance of these residues in substrate recognition and transport (Takahashi2020Functional). Overall, MCT12 plays a vital role in creatine metabolism, contributing to the regulation of energy balance in cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC16A12 gene have been associated with juvenile cataracts and renal glucosuria. The gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), which is involved in creatine transport. Alterations in its function can disrupt normal metabolic processes, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Takahashi2020Functional). Although specific diseases directly caused by mutations in SLC16A12 are not detailed in some studies, the gene has been implicated in conditions such as cataracts and glycosuria (Takahashi2020Functional). 

A study by Nasser Dhayat et al. mentions a mutation in SLC16A12 that affects guanidinoacetate excretion, although it does not cause glucosuria (Dhayat2015Mutation). This suggests that mutations in SLC16A12 can have varied effects on metabolic processes, potentially leading to different clinical manifestations. 

The gene's expression and interaction with other proteins, such as CD147, are crucial for its function in creatine transport. Disruptions in these interactions may also contribute to disease states, although specific conditions resulting from such disruptions are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Takahashi2020Functional).

## Interactions
SLC16A12, also known as monocarboxylate transporter 12 (MCT12), is involved in creatine transport and interacts with several proteins to facilitate its function. One significant interaction is with CD147, a molecular chaperone that enhances the localization and stabilization of MCT12 at the plasma membrane. Coexpression of MCT12 with CD147 in MDCKII cells increases the fluorescence intensity of GFP-tagged MCT12 and localizes it to the lateral membranes, indicating CD147's role in stabilizing and localizing MCT12 (Takahashi2020Functional).

MCT12 also interacts with CRT1, another creatine transporter, to mediate creatine efflux in HEK293 cells. This interaction significantly reduces intracellular creatine levels over time, suggesting a cooperative role in creatine transport (Takahashi2020Functional). The presence of CD147 further enhances this efflux activity, highlighting its importance in MCT12 function (Takahashi2020Functional).

Site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified key amino acids, such as Asp65 and Arg37, that are crucial for MCT12's function in creatine efflux. These residues are important for substrate recognition and transport function, indicating specific protein interactions at the molecular level (Takahashi2020Functional).
