# THUMPD3

## Overview
THUMPD3 is a gene that encodes the THUMP domain containing 3 protein, which plays a pivotal role in RNA modification, particularly in the methylation of RNA molecules. The protein is characterized by the presence of a THUMP domain, which is integral to its function in catalyzing N2-methylguanosine (m2G) modifications, a process crucial for RNA stability and processing. This modification is essential for the maturation of ribosomal RNA within the nucleolus, thereby supporting efficient cellular protein synthesis. Additionally, THUMPD3 is involved in the methylation of specific tRNA isodecoders, underscoring its importance in the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins (Klimontova2024PhOxiseq).

## Function
THUMPD3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in RNA modification processes, specifically in the methylation of RNA molecules. The THUMPD3 protein contains a THUMP domain, which is crucial for its role in catalyzing N2-methylguanosine (m2G) modifications in RNA. This modification is important for RNA stability and processing, contributing to the proper functioning of cellular protein synthesis (Klimontova2024PhOxiseq). 

In healthy human cells, THUMPD3 is active in the nucleolus, where it plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA maturation. This activity is essential for maintaining efficient cellular protein synthesis, as ribosomal RNA is a key component of ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein production (Klimontova2024PhOxiseq). 

The protein is particularly involved in the methylation of tRNAs, with specific activity at position 6 within certain tRNA isodecoders, such as tRNA-Gly-GCC-2 and tRNA-Gly-CCC-2. Depletion of THUMPD3 results in a significant reduction of m2G at these sites, indicating its critical role in m2G methylation (Klimontova2024PhOxiseq). This methylation process is vital for the proper functioning of tRNAs, which are essential for accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins.
