# RAB8A

## Overview
RAB8A is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, RAB8A, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicular trafficking, acting as a molecular switch that cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. As a GTPase, RAB8A is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell shape regulation, and ciliogenesis. It is essential for the recycling of internalized membranes to the plasma membrane and the formation of primary cilia, impacting cell morphogenesis and polarized transport of membrane proteins. RAB8A interacts with several proteins, such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like Rabin8, and motor proteins like Myosin Vb, which are crucial for its function in vesicle transport and actin remodeling. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which affects its interactions and functional dynamics. Alterations in RAB8A are implicated in diseases such as Parkinson's disease and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer cell invasiveness (MaderoPérez2018Parkinson; Banworth2017Consequences; Guo2013Intermediates; Peränen2011Rab8).

## Structure
RAB8A is a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking, characterized by its ability to cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states (Guo2013Intermediates). The primary structure of RAB8A includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific regions such as switch I and switch II playing crucial roles in its function and interactions (Guo2013Intermediates). 

The secondary structure of RAB8A features alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common in GTPases. The tertiary structure involves a GTP-binding domain, essential for its role as a molecular switch (Guo2013Intermediates). 

In terms of quaternary structure, RAB8A can form complexes with other proteins, such as its interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Rabin8 and GRAB, which facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, activating RAB8A (Guo2013Intermediates). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating RAB8A's interactions. For instance, phosphorylation at serine 111 affects its interaction with Rabin8 by altering side chain interaction networks, even when the modified residue is not directly at the binding interface (PourjafarDehkordi2019Phosphorylation).

## Function
RAB8A is a small GTPase involved in various cellular processes, primarily regulating membrane trafficking and cell shape. It plays a crucial role in the recycling of internalized membranes back to the plasma membrane, which is essential for forming new dynamic cell surface domains and is involved in exocytosis, where it is required for the docking and fusion of exocytotic vesicles (Peränen2011Rab8). RAB8A is also implicated in ciliogenesis, where it is essential for the formation and function of primary cilia, acting in the transport of rhodopsin-containing vesicles to the connecting cilium in rod photoreceptors (Peränen2011Rab8).

In the context of cell morphogenesis, RAB8A is involved in the polarized transport of newly synthesized membrane proteins, impacting cell shape by promoting the formation of cellular protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia (Hattula2006Characterization). It also regulates the actin-dependent movement of vesicular structures and is involved in the retrograde transport of cholera toxin B to the Golgi compartment (Hattula2006Characterization). RAB8A's activity is crucial for maintaining a balance between exocytosis and endocytic recycling, which is vital for cell surface domain formation and stabilization (Hattula2006Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAB8A gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). RAB8A is a substrate for the LRRK2 kinase, and its phosphorylation by LRRK2 is linked to centrosomal cohesion deficits and impaired ciliogenesis, which are cellular processes disrupted in PD. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2, such as G2019S, lead to increased phosphorylation of RAB8A, resulting in its accumulation at the centrosome and contributing to deficits in cell polarity and neurite outgrowth. These alterations are associated with early PD symptoms and may impair adult neurogenesis (MaderoPérez2018Parkinson).

The phosphorylation of RAB8A by LRRK2 also affects its interaction with regulatory proteins, such as GDI1/2 and Rabin8, and leads to a toxic gain-of-function effect on centrosomal cohesion while potentially causing a loss-of-function in vesicular trafficking (MaderoPérez2018RAB7L1Mediated). These cellular alterations suggest that RAB8A phosphorylation could serve as a biomarker for PD and that targeting LRRK2 kinase activity might be a therapeutic strategy (Lara2019RAB8).

In cancer, RAB8A's role in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis is linked to cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis, as it is involved in delivering matrix metalloproteinases to the cell surface, promoting cell migration and invasion (Banworth2017Consequences).

## Interactions
RAB8A, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. RAB8A interacts with Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates RAB8A by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP. This interaction is essential for processes such as actin remodeling and polarized membrane transport (Hattula2002A). Rabin8 binds to the GDP-bound form of RAB8A, promoting its activation (Hattula2002A).

RAB8A also interacts with Myosin Vb, a motor protein involved in vesicle transport. This interaction is part of a tubular network containing EHD1 and EHD3, which is distinct from pathways involving Rab11a (Roland2007Myosin). Additionally, RAB8A is involved in a GEF-effector interaction network with Rabin8 and Sec15, which is important for primary ciliogenesis (Feng2012A).

Phosphorylation of RAB8A at serine 111 affects its interaction with Rabin8, reducing the nucleotide exchange rate and binding affinity, which highlights the regulatory role of phosphorylation in modulating RAB8A's activity (PourjafarDehkordi2019Phosphorylation).
