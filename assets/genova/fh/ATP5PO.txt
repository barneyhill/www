# ATP5PO

## Overview
The ATP5PO gene encodes the ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit OSCP, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, also known as complex V. This protein is integral to the peripheral stalk of the enzyme, which connects the catalytic F1 sector to the membrane-embedded FO sector, ensuring the structural integrity and efficient energy conversion necessary for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Ganapathi2022A; Giorgio2018OSCP). The OSCP subunit is involved in maintaining the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex, modulating proton conductance, and interacting with other subunits to resist mechanical stress during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis (Ganapathi2022A; Giorgio2018OSCP). Additionally, OSCP plays a role in the regulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP), although its exact function in PTP formation and regulation remains a subject of research (He2017Permeability; Giorgio2018OSCP). Mutations in ATP5PO have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction pathways, underscoring its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial integrity (Ganapathi2022A; Aldosary2020Rett).

## Structure
The ATP5PO gene encodes the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP), a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. The OSCP subunit is part of the peripheral stalk, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the enzyme complex. The primary structure of OSCP includes a sequence that allows for the formation of specific secondary structures, such as α-helices and β-sheets. The N-terminal domain of OSCP consists of six α-helices (OH1-OH6), which provide binding sites for subunit α E through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The C-terminal domain features a β-hairpin followed by two α-helices (OH7 and OH8), with a flexible stretch of about 30 amino acids between them (Giorgio2018OSCP).

The tertiary structure of OSCP involves the formation of a five-helix bundle with the N-terminal α-helix of F6 and a segment of subunit b, creating an extensive interface between the three subunits. This structure is crucial for the enzyme's function, as it influences the position of the peripheral stalk relative to the rest of the F-ATP synthase (Giorgio2018OSCP). OSCP undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, although the functional implications of these modifications are not fully understood (Giorgio2018OSCP).

## Function
The ATP5PO gene encodes the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP), a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, also known as complex V. This complex is essential for oxidative phosphorylation, the process by which ATP, the primary energy currency of cells, is produced. ATP5PO is part of the peripheral stalk of the ATP synthase complex, which connects the catalytic F1 sector to the membrane-embedded FO sector, ensuring structural integrity and efficient energy conversion (Ganapathi2022A; Giorgio2018OSCP).

In healthy human cells, ATP5PO plays a crucial role in maintaining the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase complex, facilitating the conversion of ADP to ATP. It interacts with other subunits to resist mechanical stress during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, and modulates proton conductance within the FO sector, influencing the enzyme's function (Ganapathi2022A; Giorgio2018OSCP). The OSCP subunit is also involved in the regulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP), although its exact role in PTP formation and regulation is debated (He2017Permeability; Giorgio2018OSCP). Overall, ATP5PO is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production in healthy cells (Giorgio2018OSCP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5PO gene, which encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, have been linked to several severe clinical conditions. Notably, a homozygous splice variant in ATP5PO has been associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder. This variant leads to exon skipping, resulting in decreased assembly and function of mitochondrial complex V, which is crucial for ATP production. Affected individuals exhibit symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and progressive epileptic encephalopathy (Ganapathi2022A).

The clinical manifestations of ATP5PO mutations can vary significantly, even among patients with the same genetic variant. These mutations are associated with a range of symptoms, including lactic acidosis, seizures, microcephaly, brain atrophy, dystonia, and hypotonia. In some cases, these mutations lead to severe or lethal phenotypes, with many patients dying within the first year of life or during childhood (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

Alterations in ATP5PO expression have also been implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction pathways, contributing to conditions like Rett syndrome. In this context, ATP5PO is involved in oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic processes, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial function (Aldosary2020Rett).

## Interactions
The ATP5PO gene encodes the OSCP subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, which is involved in several critical interactions within the enzyme complex. OSCP is part of the peripheral stalk that connects the catalytic F1 sector and the membrane-embedded FO subcomplex, ensuring structural coupling essential for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis (Giorgio2018OSCP). The N-terminal domain of OSCP binds strongly to the alpha subunits of F1, while the C-terminal domain interacts with the peripheral stalk, forming a five-helix bundle with subunit b and the N-terminal α-helix of F6 (Giorgio2018OSCP).

OSCP also interacts with Cyclophilin D (CyPD), which binds to the peripheral stalk of F-ATP synthase at OSCP, influencing the regulation of the permeability transition pore (PTP) (Giorgio2018OSCP). This interaction is mainly electrostatic and can be displaced by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the permeability transition (Giorgio2018OSCP). OSCP is a client protein of the chaperone Hsp90, and its levels are stabilized by Hsp90 inhibitors in colon cancer cells, promoting apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway (Giorgio2018OSCP). Additionally, OSCP interacts with the NAD+ dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) (Giorgio2018OSCP).
