# CCL4

## Overview
CCL4, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 4, is a gene that encodes a protein known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), which is a member of the chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the recruitment and activation of various immune cells, such as T cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes, through its interaction with the CCR5 receptor (Mukaida2020CCL4). As a chemokine, CCL4 is involved in chemotaxis, guiding immune cells to sites of inflammation or injury, and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune response modulation and disease progression (Lien2017Impact). The protein's ability to bind glycosaminoglycans and form high-molecular-weight aggregates further underscores its functional versatility (Ren2010Polymerization). CCL4's interaction with CCR5 is particularly significant in the context of HIV infection, as CCR5 serves as a co-receptor for viral entry, highlighting the gene's importance in both immune regulation and infectious disease contexts (Mukaida2020CCL4).

## Structure
The CCL4 protein, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), is secreted in its mature form consisting of 69 amino acids after the removal of a 23-amino acid signal peptide from its precursor form (Mukaida2020CCL4). The primary structure of CCL4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is characterized by a long loop extending from residues 12 to 20, a four-residue helical turn from residues 21 to 24, and a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet from residues 26 to 52, topped by an α-helix from residues 57 to 68 (Mukaida2020CCL4).

The tertiary structure of CCL4 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which facilitate the formation of a dimer. This dimer is elongated and cylindrical, contrasting with the globular structure of the CXCL8 dimer (Mukaida2020CCL4). CCL4 can form high-molecular-weight aggregates through a polymerization process, resulting in rod-shaped, double-helical polymers (Ren2010Polymerization). The protein can tightly bind glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, with specific residues like R46 being crucial for interaction under physiological conditions (Mukaida2020CCL4).

## Function
The CCL4 gene, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 or macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), plays a crucial role in immune responses by facilitating the recruitment and activation of various immune cells. In healthy human cells, CCL4 is involved in chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells towards sites of inflammation or injury. It achieves this by binding to the CCR5 receptor, which is expressed on a variety of immune cells, including T helper cells, dendritic cells, and neurons (Mukaida2020CCL4; Lien2017Impact).

CCL4 is produced by several cell types, such as monocytes, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, in response to stimuli like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and interleukin-7. This chemokine induces chemotaxis and adhesion of T cells and immature dendritic cells, and it activates natural killer cells and monocytes, thereby playing a significant role in the immune response (Mukaida2020CCL4). CCL4's interaction with CCR5 is also notable as CCR5 serves as a co-receptor for HIV entry, highlighting the chemokine's importance in both immune regulation and disease contexts (Mukaida2020CCL4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCL4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated serum levels of CCL4 are associated with the presence of the disease in cirrhotic patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection (Sadeghi2015Serum). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high CCL4 expression is linked to aggressive tumor proliferation, reduced survival, and advanced cancer stages, indicating its role as an oncogene and a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2021Identification). CCL4 is also involved in colorectal cancer, where its increased expression correlates with the presence of tumor-associated macrophages and poor prognosis (De2018The).

CCL4 gene polymorphisms, such as rs10491121, have been associated with a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and oral cancer, as well as reduced lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, although these findings require further validation (Mukaida2020CCL4). In oral squamous cell carcinoma, CCL4 polymorphisms have been studied for their potential role in disease susceptibility, though no significant risk association was found in an Iranian population (Kadeh2022The).

In the context of fibromyalgia, CCL4 is secreted by skeletal muscle cells and plays a significant role in the inflammatory response, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of the condition (Zhang2018SNPs).

## Interactions
CCL4, also known as macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β), is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the chemokine receptor CCR5. This interaction is significant in the context of immune cell trafficking and HIV infection, as CCR5 serves as a co-receptor for HIV entry into cells (Mukaida2020CCL4). CCL4 can also bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin, heparin sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, with specific residues (R18, K45, and R46) being crucial for these interactions (Mukaida2020CCL4).

In the tumor microenvironment, CCL4 interacts with CCR5-expressing fibroblasts, promoting metastasis, particularly in breast cancer and bone metastasis (Mukaida2020CCL4). CCL4 also plays a role in enhancing tumor immunity by attracting CCR5+ cytolytic lymphocytes, as observed in human esophageal cancer tissues (Mukaida2020CCL4).

CCL4, along with other chemokines like CCL3 and CCL5, can bind to receptor-like molecules on the surface of Leishmania promastigotes, leading to signal transduction and chemotaxis, which may facilitate parasite uptake by macrophages (Roychoudhury2006Evidence). These interactions suggest that CCL4 has diverse roles in immune response modulation and disease progression.
