# ZC2HC1C

## Overview
ZC2HC1C is a gene that encodes the zinc finger C2HC-type containing 1C protein, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes, playing a significant role in cellular functions such as maintaining genomic stability. The expression of ZC2HC1C is notably sensitive to the deletion of Nrf1, a transcription factor crucial for mitochondrial function and DNA repair, particularly in retinal neurons. This sensitivity suggests a potential involvement of the protein in DNA repair mechanisms within rod photoreceptors (Kiyama2022Differential). Additionally, ZC2HC1C is overexpressed in canine meningiomas, where it is located near the FOS gene, indicating a possible interaction or co-regulation in tumorigenesis (Grenier2017RNAseq). Despite its recognized roles, further research is necessary to fully understand the interactions and functional implications of ZC2HC1C in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ZC2HC1C gene has been implicated in various pathological conditions due to its altered expression levels. In canine meningiomas, ZC2HC1C is overexpressed, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. This overexpression is noted alongside the FOS gene, which is physically close to ZC2HC1C on canine chromosome 8 and human chromosome 14q24.3, indicating a possible interaction or co-regulation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors (Grenier2017RNAseq).

In the context of retinal neurons, ZC2HC1C expression is downregulated in Nrf1-deficient conditions, with a log2 fold change of -1.1341. This downregulation suggests that ZC2HC1C may be sensitive to changes in mitochondrial biogenesis factors, potentially leading to DNA damage in rod photoreceptors due to misregulation of genes involved in DNA repair and recombination processes (Kiyama2022Differential).

While these studies highlight the gene's involvement in specific conditions, the clinical significance of ZC2HC1C mutations or its role in human diseases remains under investigation. Further research is needed to elucidate its precise contributions to disease mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The ZC2HC1C gene encodes a zinc finger C2HC-type containing protein, which is implicated in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes. In the context of retinal neurons, ZC2HC1C is identified as one of the genes sensitive to the deletion of Nrf1, a transcription factor involved in mitochondrial function and DNA repair. The deletion of Nrf1 leads to altered expression of ZC2HC1C, suggesting its potential involvement in DNA repair mechanisms within rod photoreceptors (Kiyama2022Differential).

In canine meningiomas, ZC2HC1C is overexpressed and noted as a transcription factor located near the FOS gene on canine chromosome 8 and human chromosome 14q24.3. Both ZC2HC1C and FOS transcripts are overexpressed in these tumors compared to control tissues, indicating a possible interaction or co-regulation between these genes in the context of tumorigenesis (Grenier2017RNAseq).

While specific protein interactions involving ZC2HC1C are not detailed, its role as a transcription factor suggests it may interact with DNA and potentially other proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functional roles of ZC2HC1C in these processes.
