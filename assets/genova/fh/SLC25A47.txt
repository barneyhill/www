# SLC25A47

## Overview
SLC25A47 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 47, a liver-specific mitochondrial carrier protein. This protein is part of the SLC25 family, which is known for its role in transporting metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. SLC25A47 is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and is regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) (Yook2022A). The protein plays a critical role in gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis by facilitating mitochondrial pyruvate flux and the export of malate, especially during fasting conditions (Yook2022A). Its function is crucial for maintaining glucose production from lactate, and its absence can lead to metabolic alterations, including increased serum levels of the hormone FGF21, which is involved in energy expenditure (Yook2022A). The gene's involvement in metabolic processes makes it a significant focus in the study of metabolic disorders, including Type 2 diabetes.

## Function
SLC25A47 is a liver-specific mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis. It is part of the SLC25 family, which consists of mitochondrial inter-membrane metabolite carriers. SLC25A47 is selectively expressed in the liver, primarily in hepatocytes, and is regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) (Yook2022A). This protein is essential for mitochondrial pyruvate flux and the export of malate, particularly under fasting conditions when liver glycogen is depleted. The loss of SLC25A47 leads to an accumulation of mitochondrial malate and reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, indicating its role in mediating the export of mitochondria-derived malate into the cytosol (Yook2022A).

In SLC25A47 knockout mice, there is a reduction in pyruvate-derived gluconeogenesis, which affects glucose production from lactate. This suggests that SLC25A47 is necessary for efficient gluconeogenesis from lactate, but not from other substrates like glycerol or alanine (Yook2022A). The absence of SLC25A47 also results in increased serum levels of the hormone FGF21, which is known to enhance energy expenditure, indicating its role in regulating energy metabolism (Yook2022A).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC25A47 gene, encoding a liver-specific mitochondrial carrier protein, has been implicated in various metabolic disorders due to its role in gluconeogenesis and energy homeostasis. Alterations in the expression of SLC25A47 have been associated with metabolic parameters such as fasting glucose, HbA1c levels, and HDL cholesterol, suggesting its involvement in glucose and lipid homeostasis (Yook2022A). In liver-specific knockout mice, the deletion of SLC25A47 results in reduced body weight gain, lower plasma cholesterol levels, and increased whole-body energy expenditure, indicating its potential role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Yook2022A).

The gene's function is particularly relevant in the context of Type 2 diabetes, as excess hepatic gluconeogenesis is a common feature of the disease. Loss of SLC25A47 leads to impaired pyruvate flux and malate accumulation in mitochondria, restricting gluconeogenesis and providing protection against hyperglycemia (Yook2022A). This makes SLC25A47 an attractive therapeutic target for managing hyperglycemia and Type 2 diabetes. However, chronic deletion of SLC25A47 may lead to adverse effects such as mitochondrial stress and lipid accumulation, although acute partial depletion has shown beneficial effects without significant side effects (Yook2022A).
