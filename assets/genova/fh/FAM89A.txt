# FAM89A

## Overview
FAM89A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 89 member A. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in cell signaling pathways. It plays a crucial role in cellular growth and differentiation by interacting with other proteins, thereby influencing cellular functions and maintaining normal cellular physiology. The protein encoded by FAM89A is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it acts as a mediator or modulator of signaling cascades that dictate cellular responses to external stimuli. The gene has been studied in various clinical contexts, including its potential role in immune responses and glioma subtyping, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Li2022Pilot; Pan2019Screening).

## Function
FAM89A encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell signaling pathways. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to influence cellular functions. The interactions facilitated by FAM89A are crucial for cellular growth and differentiation, suggesting its involvement in maintaining normal cellular physiology. By participating in these signaling pathways, FAM89A may help regulate the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which is essential for healthy tissue development and maintenance. The precise molecular mechanisms through which FAM89A exerts its effects are not fully elucidated, but its cytoplasmic localization indicates it may act as a mediator or modulator of signaling cascades that dictate cellular responses to external stimuli. Understanding the function of FAM89A in healthy human cells is important for elucidating its potential roles in disease states where these processes are disrupted.

## Clinical Significance
FAM89A has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its precise role remains under investigation. In the context of immune responses, FAM89A has been associated with antibody levels following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The intronic SNP rs4543780 in the FAM89A gene is suggested to be a regulatory variant affecting gene expression, potentially influencing the immune response to vaccines (Li2022Pilot). Despite its association with viral infections, FAM89A is more prominently expressed in bacterial infections, which presents a discrepancy in its role as a biomarker for differentiating between bacterial and viral infections (Hjertner2021Development; Li2022Pilot).

In glioma research, FAM89A has been identified as a gene of interest in the subtyping of gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. Its abnormal expression has been noted in glioma gene expression profiling studies, suggesting a potential role in the IDH-dependent classification of glioma subtypes (Pan2019Screening).

FAM89A has also been evaluated in the context of differentiating between bacterial and viral infections in pigs, where it was identified as a bacterial marker gene. However, its expression varied significantly, indicating it may not be a reliable marker in all contexts (Hjertner2021Development).
