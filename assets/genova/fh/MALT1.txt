# MALT1

## Overview
MALT1 is a gene that encodes the MALT1 paracaspase, a crucial protein involved in immune signaling pathways. The MALT1 paracaspase is a protease that plays a significant role in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune cell activation and inflammation. Structurally, the protein is characterized by a death domain, two immunoglobulin-like domains, and a paracaspase domain, which together facilitate its function as both a scaffold and a protease (Yu2011Crystal). MALT1 is a key component of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is vital for transmitting signals from antigen receptors to activate NF-κB (Jaworski2015The). Dysregulation of MALT1 activity is associated with various lymphomas and immune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Liang2021MALT1; Frizinsky2019Novel).

## Structure
The MALT1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a death domain (DD), two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, and a caspase-like domain known as the paracaspase domain (Yu2011Crystal). The paracaspase domain adopts a fold similar to classic caspases, forming an active protease through homodimerization, although it remains a single uncleaved polypeptide (Yu2011Crystal). The Ig domain is a β-sandwich composed of seven β-strands, contributing to the protein's structural integrity and functional interactions (Yu2011Crystal).

The tertiary structure of MALT1 involves the formation of a single folding unit through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the paracaspase domain and the Ig fold (Yu2011Crystal). The quaternary structure is characterized by a symmetric homodimer, essential for its proteolytic activity, similar to initiator caspases (Yu2011Crystal).

MALT1 is involved in vesicular trafficking and protein recruitment, interacting with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ligases, such as Ubc13/Mms2 and TRAF6 (Yu2011Crystal). The protein's substrate specificity is distinct, cleaving proteins at Arg residues, unlike caspases that prefer Asp (Yu2011Crystal). These structural features underscore MALT1's role in immune signaling pathways.

## Function
MALT1 (MALT1 paracaspase) is a crucial regulator of immune responses, primarily through its role in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. It functions as both a scaffold and a protease, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes and the cleavage of specific substrates to modulate immune cell activation and inflammation (Jaworski2015The; Staal2010Regulation). MALT1 is activated by immunoreceptors containing ITAM sequences, such as B-cell and T-cell receptors, and forms part of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for NF-κB activation (Jaworski2015The; Staal2011Tcell).

In its proteolytic role, MALT1 cleaves negative regulators of NF-κB signaling, such as A20 and CYLD, enhancing the pathway's activation and promoting immune cell proliferation and survival (Jaworski2015The; Staal2010Regulation). MALT1 also influences other signaling pathways, including JNK/AP-1, by cleaving proteins like CYLD, which affects T-cell receptor-induced JNK activation (Staal2011Tcell). Its activity is crucial for the differentiation of T effector cells and the development of regulatory T cells, impacting overall immune response and homeostasis (Jaworski2015The). MALT1's proteolytic activity is regulated by monoubiquitination, which promotes its dimerization and activation (Jaworski2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MALT1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily affecting the immune system. MALT1 is crucial for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and its dysregulation can lead to lymphomas, such as MALT lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These lymphomas often involve chromosomal translocations, such as t(11;18)(q21;q21) and t(14;18)(q32;q21), resulting in fusion proteins like API2-MALT1, which enhance NF-κB activation and contribute to oncogenesis (Liang2021MALT1).

MALT1 mutations can also lead to immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation. A novel bi-allelic missense mutation in MALT1 has been linked to conditions such as lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, and impaired humoral immunity, characterized by poor T cell proliferation and reduced IL-2 production (Frizinsky2019Novel). MALT1 deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, particularly bacterial and fungal, due to impaired Th17 cell differentiation and function (Lu2021Human).

In some cases, MALT1 mutations result in combined immunodeficiency, as seen in patients with compound heterozygous mutations leading to severe infections and immune dysregulation, which can be treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (Punwani2015Combined). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MALT1 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MALT1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in immune signaling pathways. It is a key component of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex, which is essential for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. MALT1 binds directly to BCL10 through death domain (DD) and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) interactions, facilitating the assembly of the CBM complex. This interaction is critical for lymphocyte activation and the transmission of signals from antigen receptors (Liang2021MALT1; Juilland2018Holding).

MALT1 also interacts with TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which ubiquitinates substrates like IKKγ, BCL10, and MALT1 itself, further influencing NF-κB activation (Liang2021MALT1). The protein's interaction with UBC13-MMS2, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is also noted (Liang2021MALT1).

In addition to its role in the CBM complex, MALT1 forms a fusion protein, API2-MALT1, due to chromosomal translocation, which recruits TRAF2 and RIP1, triggering NF-κB signaling in MALT lymphoma (Liang2021MALT1; Lucas2001Bcl10). MALT1's interactions with proteins like A20 and CYLD, which are cleaved by MALT1, modulate NF-κB signaling and TCR-induced pathways (Liang2021MALT1).
