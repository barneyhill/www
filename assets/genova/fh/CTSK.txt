# CTSK

## Overview
The CTSK gene encodes cathepsin K, a cysteine protease belonging to the papain family, which is predominantly expressed in osteoclasts and plays a pivotal role in bone resorption. Cathepsin K is distinguished by its unique ability to degrade type I collagen, a major component of the bone matrix, by cleaving both the triple helix and telopeptides of collagen fibers (Novinec2013Cathepsin; Garnero1998The). This enzymatic activity is crucial for normal bone remodeling and maintenance. Beyond its role in bone, cathepsin K is also involved in the degradation of type II collagen in cartilage and participates in various cellular processes within the central nervous system (Dai2020Cathepsin). The regulation of cathepsin K activity is complex, involving interactions with glycosaminoglycans and other proteins, which modulate its stability and function (Zhang2024Heparan; Novinec2013Cathepsin). Mutations in the CTSK gene are linked to pycnodysostosis, a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density and fragility, while overexpression of cathepsin K is associated with osteoporosis and certain cancers (Johnson1996A; Ketterer2017Inherited). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CTSK and its encoded protein cathepsin K is essential for developing therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

## Structure
Cathepsin K (CTSK) is a cysteine protease with a polypeptide sequence of 329 amino acids, featuring a 15-amino acid signal sequence and a 99-residue pro piece, typical of cysteine proteases in the papain family (Hou1999Characterization). The enzyme is synthesized as a prepropeptide with a molecular mass of 37 kDa, and the mature form is a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 29 kDa (Hou1999Characterization). 

The secondary structure of cathepsin K includes a papain-like fold with two distinct domains connected by an interdomain beta sheet, forming a V-shaped catalytic cleft (Roy2018Not). The active site contains a catalytic diad of cysteine and histidine, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Novinec2013Cathepsin). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the pro-form of cathepsin K may exist as a dimer, with the dimer interface located at the pro-domain, characterized by a helical cluster involving four helices (Roy2018Not). 

Cathepsin K's activity is regulated by glycosaminoglycans, which interact with specific binding sites on the enzyme, influencing its stability and activity (Novinec2013Cathepsin). The enzyme's structure is sensitive, with little flexibility, as evidenced by the limited number of naturally occurring variants (Novinec2013Cathepsin).

## Function
Cathepsin K (CTSK) is a cysteine protease primarily expressed in osteoclasts, where it plays a critical role in bone resorption. It is involved in the degradation of type I collagen, which constitutes about 90% of the bone organic matrix, by cleaving both the triple helix and telopeptides of collagen fibers. This unique collagenolytic activity distinguishes cathepsin K from other mammalian proteinases, as it can cleave within the helical region of collagen, a property previously attributed only to certain bacterial collagenases and specific mammalian enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Novinec2013Cathepsin; Garnero1998The).

Cathepsin K is secreted into the extracellular compartment at the site of osteoclast attachment to the bone surface, where it degrades the organic matrix of the bone, facilitating bone resorption (TROEN2006The). Its expression is regulated by the RANKL-RANK signaling pathway, which is crucial for osteoclastogenesis, and is influenced by factors such as TNF-α, interleukins, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (Dai2020Cathepsin).

Beyond bone, cathepsin K is also expressed in other tissues, including cartilage, where it degrades type II collagen, and in the central nervous system, where it is involved in various cellular processes (Dai2020Cathepsin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTSK gene, which encodes the enzyme cathepsin K, are primarily associated with pycnodysostosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by osteosclerosis, short stature, bone fragility, and distinctive facial and dental abnormalities. Patients with pycnodysostosis exhibit increased bone density due to impaired bone resorption, as cathepsin K is crucial for degrading bone matrix proteins (Donnarumma2007Molecular; Ketterer2017Inherited; Xue2015Dental). 

The CTSK gene mutations include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations, which can lead to the loss of functional protein or improper enzyme activity (Donnarumma2007Molecular; Ketterer2017Inherited). Notably, a nonsense mutation resulting in premature termination of cathepsin K mRNA translation has been identified, which disrupts the enzyme's catalytic site (Johnson1996A).

Alterations in CTSK expression are also implicated in other conditions. Overexpression of cathepsin K is linked to osteoporosis, where it contributes to excessive bone resorption, and certain cancers, where it aids in tumor invasion and metastasis (Johnson1996A). Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of CTSK-related disorders is crucial for developing targeted therapies.

## Interactions
Cathepsin K (CTSK) interacts with several proteins and molecules, influencing its activity and stability. It forms a stable complex with Cystatin C (Cst3), a cysteine protease inhibitor, with a stoichiometry of 1:1. This interaction is not affected by the presence of heparan sulfate (HS), although HS can form a larger complex with CTSK and Cst3, suggesting a regulatory role (Zhang2024Heparan). CTSK also interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), where it cleaves and activates proMMP-9 under acidic conditions, relevant in tumor environments. This activation is significant in processes like tumor invasion and metastasis (Christensen2015Matrixmetalloproteinase9).

CTSK binds to heparan sulfate (HS) with high affinity, which can stabilize its active conformation and prolong its activity. This interaction is dependent on the sulfation pattern of HS oligosaccharides and can inhibit CTSK's collagenase activity, potentially regulating bone resorption (Zhang2024Heparan). The binding involves specific residues in CTSK, such as Arg108, Arg111, and Lys214, which are crucial for HS interaction (Zhang2024Heparan). These interactions highlight CTSK's role in bone remodeling and its potential as a therapeutic target.
