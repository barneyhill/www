# MYL5

## Overview
MYL5 is a gene that encodes the myosin light chain 5 protein, a regulatory component of the myosin complex involved in muscle contraction and cell division. The protein is categorized as a myosin regulatory light chain and is characterized by its ability to bind calcium through its EF-hand motifs, although only the N-terminal EF-hand is functional in this regard (Ramirez2021The). MYL5 plays a critical role in the regulation of the mitotic spindle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division, and is expressed predominantly in type 1/slow muscle fibers, where it contributes to muscle contraction (Murgia2021Protein; Ramirez2021The). The protein's interaction with MYO10, a myosin involved in spindle architecture, underscores its importance in cellular movement and structural organization (Ramirez2021The). Dysregulation of MYL5 has been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenesis and as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Ramirez2021The).

## Structure
The MYL5 protein, encoded by the MYL5 gene, is a myosin regulatory light chain of the MLC2 type, consisting of 173 amino acids (Ramirez2021The). The primary structure of MYL5 includes three EF-hand motifs, which are important for calcium binding, a characteristic feature of myosin regulatory light chains (Ramirez2021The). Among these, only the N-terminal EF-hand is capable of binding calcium (Ramirez2021The). 

MYL5 also contains conserved phosphorylation sites at serines 20 and 21, although mutations at these sites do not affect its localization to cytoskeletal structures, suggesting that these residues are not essential for its localization (Ramirez2021The). The protein interacts with MYO10, a myosin involved in spindle architecture, and colocalizes with it at spindle poles during mitosis (Ramirez2021The). 

The tertiary and quaternary structures of MYL5 are not detailed in the available context, nor are any specific splice variant isoforms mentioned. The protein's role in cell division and its interaction with cytoskeletal structures highlight its functional importance, particularly in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation (Ramirez2021The).

## Function
MYL5, or myosin light chain 5, plays a crucial role in cell division and muscle function. In healthy human cells, MYL5 is involved in the regulation of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It localizes to the mitotic spindle poles and microtubules during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome congression and segregation, which are vital for maintaining genomic stability (Ramirez2021The). MYL5 interacts with MYO10, a protein involved in filopodia formation, suggesting a role in cellular movement and structure organization (Ramirez2021The).

MYL5 is also expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in type 1/slow muscle fibers, where it is involved in muscle contraction and cellular movement (Murgia2021Protein). The protein's dynamic localization throughout the cell cycle, from the nucleus and cytoplasm during interphase to the spindle poles during mitosis, indicates its involvement in organizing the mitotic spindle and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Ramirez2021The). Despite its critical roles, MYL5 has not been linked to inherited diseases, although its dysregulation is observed in various cancers, correlating with poor survival outcomes (Ramirez2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The MYL5 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In cervical cancer, MYL5 expression is upregulated, particularly in late-stage patients, and is associated with poor survival outcomes and increased tumor metastasis in mouse models (Ramirez2021The). Conversely, MYL5 expression is downregulated in breast and brain cancers, as well as in glioblastoma multiforme, where its low expression correlates with poor overall survival (Ramirez2021The). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MYL5 expression is significantly lower in tumors with p53 transcriptional incompetence, suggesting a link between MYL5 expression and better survival outcomes in p53 competent tumors (Jinesh2020Regulation). 

MYL5 is also part of a protein-protein interaction network associated with skeletal muscle construction, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), a condition characterized by muscle weakness and necrosis (Shi2021Bioinformatics). These findings highlight the potential role of MYL5 in cancer progression and muscle-related disorders, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications.

## Interactions
MYL5 interacts with MYO10, a protein involved in mitotic spindle assembly and filopodia formation. This interaction is independent of MYL5's IQ motifs, which are typically involved in binding regulatory light chains, suggesting a unique binding mechanism. MYL5 co-localizes with MYO10 at the spindle poles during mitosis, indicating a role in mitotic spindle function (Ramirez2021The). 

MYL5 is also associated with the mitotic spindle poles and microtubules during cell division. Its depletion leads to defects in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation, which can be rescued by expressing a siRNA-resistant version of MYL5, highlighting its critical role in mitosis (Ramirez2021The). 

In addition to its role in the cytoskeleton, MYL5 may have functions beyond this, such as regulating gene expression by binding to promoter regions, including that of HIF-1alpha, a factor involved in tumorigenesis (Ramirez2021The). This suggests that MYL5 has both cytoskeleton-related and unrelated functions that may contribute to cancer development.
