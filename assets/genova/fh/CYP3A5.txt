# CYP3A5

## Overview
CYP3A5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 5, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in the metabolism of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. This enzyme, categorized as a monooxygenase, plays a significant role in the oxidation of hormones, steroids, and various drugs, contributing to detoxification processes primarily in the liver, kidneys, intestines, lungs, and prostate (Moilanen2006Characterization; Klyushova2022The). The CYP3A5 protein is structurally similar to CYP3A4 but exhibits distinct differences in its active site, influencing substrate specificity and metabolic activity (Hsu2017The). Genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 lead to variations in enzyme expression and activity, impacting drug metabolism and individual responses to pharmacotherapy (Knops2015The; Xie2004Genetic). These polymorphisms have significant clinical implications, affecting drug efficacy and disease susceptibility, and are important considerations in personalized medicine (Lamba2012Genetic; Xie2004Genetic).

## Structure
CYP3A5 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its role in drug metabolism. The primary structure of CYP3A5 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, which make up approximately 80% of the structure, with beta-sheets and loops comprising the remainder (Wright2019Structural). The tertiary structure of CYP3A5 features a compact, globular form with a heme-binding domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (Wright2019Structural).

CYP3A5 shares significant structural homology with CYP3A4, but notable differences exist in their active sites. The active site of CYP3A5 is taller and narrower compared to CYP3A4, influenced by variations in the lengths and conformations of helices F and F' and the connecting loops (Hsu2017The). These structural differences affect substrate binding and metabolism, contributing to the enzyme's ability to accommodate various substrates (Hsu2019Activesite).

CYP3A5 is subject to genetic polymorphisms that result in different splice variants, which can lead to truncated proteins with altered activity (Kuehl2001Sequence). These variants arise from single nucleotide polymorphisms creating cryptic splice sites, affecting the protein's structure and function.

## Function
The CYP3A5 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the cytochrome P450 family, which plays a significant role in the metabolism of various substances in the body. This enzyme is involved in the oxidation of both endogenous compounds, such as hormones and steroids, and exogenous compounds, including drugs and carcinogens. CYP3A5 is primarily active in the liver, intestines, kidneys, lungs, and prostate, contributing to drug metabolism and detoxification processes (Moilanen2006Characterization; Klyushova2022The).

In the kidneys, CYP3A5 is the predominant CYP3A enzyme and is involved in the metabolism of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, through 6β-hydroxylation. This activity is linked to sodium transport and retention, which can influence blood pressure regulation (Givens2003CYP3A5; Xie2004Genetic). In the prostate, CYP3A5 regulates local testosterone levels by converting it to its inactive 6β-hydroxylated metabolite, thereby controlling tissue-specific androgen effects (Moilanen2006Characterization).

CYP3A5 expression is highly polymorphic, with genetic variations affecting its expression levels and activity. These polymorphisms contribute to interindividual differences in drug metabolism and can impact the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications (Knops2015The; Xie2004Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in drug metabolism and disease susceptibility. The CYP3A5*3 allele, prevalent in Caucasians and Asians, results in low protein expression due to aberrant mRNA splicing, affecting the metabolism of drugs like tacrolimus and midazolam (Lamba2012Genetic; Lee2003Genetic). This allele is associated with reduced hepatic and intestinal CYP3A5 protein content, impacting drug clearance and efficacy (Lamba2012Genetic).

CYP3A5 expression levels also influence cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low CYP3A5 expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. Forced expression of CYP3A5 can suppress cancer cell migration and invasion, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Klyushova2022The).

In terms of cardiovascular health, CYP3A5 polymorphisms affect blood pressure regulation. The CYP3A5*1 allele, more common in African populations, is associated with salt-sensitive hypertension due to its role in cortisol metabolism and sodium retention (Lamba2012Genetic; Xie2004Genetic). These genetic variations underscore the importance of considering CYP3A5 genotypes in personalized medicine and disease risk assessment.

## Interactions
CYP3A5, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, engages in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in drug metabolism and synthesis of lipids. It interacts with cytochrome b5 (CYB5A), forming complexes that are enthalpy-driven, indicating significant electrostatic interactions and the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Yablokov2017Thermodynamics). These interactions are enhanced when CYB5A is integrated into a lipid bilayer, which mimics the natural environment of these proteins, resulting in higher affinity and stability of the complexes (Kaluzhskiy2020SPR).

CYP3A5 also interacts with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which serves as an electron donor. The interaction with CPR is characterized by a dissociation free energy of -8.4 kcal/mol, suggesting that the interaction is entropy-driven, likely due to hydrophobic interactions and conformational changes (Yablokov2019A). Additionally, CYP3A5 can interact with adrenodoxin (Adx), showing a slightly higher affinity for Adx compared to CPR, with Kd values of 0.55 μM and 0.70 μM, respectively (Yablokov2019A).

These interactions are essential for the electron transfer processes that enable CYP3A5 to perform its enzymatic functions, although direct electron transfer from cytochrome b5 to CYP3A5 is not possible despite complex formation (Gnedenko2014Proteinprotein).
