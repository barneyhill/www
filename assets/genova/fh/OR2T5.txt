# OR2T5

## Overview
The OR2T5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 5, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in detecting odorant molecules. The OR2T5 protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding to specific odorants. This receptor is involved in the complex process of olfactory perception, which is crucial for various behaviors and physiological responses. While the OR2T5 gene has been studied in the context of several diseases, including autism spectrum disorder and colorectal cancer, its specific contributions to these conditions remain to be fully understood (Peixoto2020TCox:; Elsheikha2019Labelfree; Kuo2015GenomeWide).

## Structure
The OR2T5 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of the OR2T5 protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, which span the cell membrane and are crucial for the receptor's ability to detect odorant molecules.

The tertiary structure of OR2T5 involves the folding of these alpha helices into a specific three-dimensional conformation, allowing the receptor to interact with G proteins and initiate signal transduction pathways. Olfactory receptors, including OR2T5, generally do not form quaternary structures, as they function as monomeric units.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur in OR2T5, influencing its stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are common in olfactory receptors and play a role in modulating receptor function and responsiveness to odorants. However, specific details about the molecular structure of OR2T5, including any unique domains or prominent folds, are not provided in the available context (Elsheikha2019Labelfree; Kuo2015GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR2T5 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been explored in various studies, although its specific role in disease remains not fully elucidated. In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the OR2T5 gene is part of a gene region that showed potential associations with ASD in a Taiwanese Han population. The study suggested that the olfactory receptor gene family, including OR2T5, might play a role in ASD pathogenesis due to the olfactory system's involvement in social behaviors, although OR2T5 itself was not specifically highlighted (Kuo2015GenomeWide).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), OR2T5 was identified as part of a molecular signature in tumor and normal tissue networks, suggesting a potential role in CRC development. However, the clinical significance of OR2T5 in CRC remains to be further investigated (Peixoto2020TCox:).

Additionally, OR2T5 was found to be enriched in patients with Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), indicating a potential association with the disease, although the clinical implications of this finding are not detailed (MosconaNissan2024Whole). Overall, while OR2T5 has been implicated in various conditions, its precise clinical significance requires further research.
