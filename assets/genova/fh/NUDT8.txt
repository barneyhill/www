# NUDT8

## Overview
NUDT8 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 8, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a significant role in coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism by hydrolyzing CoA and its acyl derivatives. Nudix hydrolase 8 is characterized by its preference for manganese ions, which enhance its enzymatic activity, and is notably expressed in mitochondria-rich tissues, excluding skeletal muscle. The protein's function is crucial for maintaining CoA homeostasis within the mitochondria, without significantly altering the overall CoA levels in the cell. NUDT8 has also been implicated in cancer biology, where it may interact with other NUDIX family members to influence cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis (Naquet2020Regulation; Kerr2024Characterization; Kulikova2020Role).

## Function
NUDT8, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in CoA metabolism within the mitochondria. It specifically hydrolyzes CoA and its acyl derivatives, producing 3′,5′ ADP and corresponding acyl derivatives of 4′ phosphopantetheine (Kulikova2020Role). NUDT8 is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it regulates the matrix CoA pool and potentially interacts with CoA synthase (Coasy), which is involved in CoA biosynthesis (Kerr2024Characterization). This localization is confirmed through various experimental techniques, including immunofluorescence and proximity tagging (Kerr2024Characterization).

The enzyme shows a preference for manganese ions, which enhances its activity, and is highly expressed in mitochondria-rich organs, except skeletal muscle (Kerr2024Characterization). Despite its role in CoA degradation, overexpression of NUDT8 does not significantly alter the total CoA pool in mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions, suggesting a specific function in maintaining CoA homeostasis without drastically impacting overall CoA levels (Kerr2024Characterization). NUDT8's activity does not change with nutritional state, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism distinct from other CoA-degrading enzymes (Kerr2024Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
NUDT8 has been implicated in cancer, particularly in the context of dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism, although its specific role is not well-defined (Naquet2020Regulation). Studies have shown that NUDT8 is part of a cluster of NUDIX genes that exhibit differential expression in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). In cancer cell lines, NUDT8 interacts with other NUDIX enzymes, such as NUDT5, where their combined knockdown in A549 cells leads to increased cell death, indicating a possible involvement in cell cycle regulation (CarrerasPuigvert2017A).

The expression of NUDT8 is context-dependent, influenced by the cellular environment and the presence of other NUDIX enzymes. For instance, the depletion of NUDT5 in A549 and MCF7 cells decreases the expression of NUDT8, among other NUDIX genes, highlighting its interaction with other family members (CarrerasPuigvert2017A). Despite these findings, specific diseases or conditions directly caused by NUDT8 mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented, and further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance fully.
