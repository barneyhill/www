# CRIPT

## Overview
CRIPT is a gene that encodes the CXXC repeat containing interactor of PDZ3 domain protein, which is a cysteine-rich protein involved in various cellular processes. The CRIPT protein is primarily recognized for its role in neuronal development, particularly in dendritic growth and synaptic organization, through its interaction with the PDZ3 domain of synaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 and SAP97 (Zhang2017SAP97; Niethammer1998CRIPT). Additionally, CRIPT functions as a cysteine-dependent tubulin binding protein, playing a significant role in mitotic spindle disassembly and cell cycle progression through redox-dependent mechanisms (Xu2022Mitotic). The protein's structure is characterized by four CXXC motifs, which are involved in redox regulation and potentially in disulfide bonding, although they lack the typical features for metal ion coordination (Xu2022Mitotic; Niethammer1998CRIPT). Mutations in the CRIPT gene have been linked to developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Leduc2016CRIPT).

## Structure
The CRIPT protein is characterized by its interaction with the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95, a postsynaptic density protein. Its molecular structure includes four CXXC motifs, which are reminiscent of zinc finger motifs found in transcription factors, although CRIPT lacks other critical elements such as histidine residues necessary for metal ion coordination (Niethammer1998CRIPT). These motifs are also similar to those found in copper-binding pockets of CPx-type ATPases, but CRIPT does not have the conserved features for ion binding. The possibility of these motifs being involved in disulfide bonding is suggested, but further study is needed to confirm this (Niethammer1998CRIPT).

CRIPT is a cysteine-rich protein, and its cysteine residues are organized into four CXXC pairs, a common motif for disulfide bonds. These cysteines are involved in redox regulation during the cell cycle, particularly mitosis (Xu2022Mitotic). The protein's cysteine thiols have higher reactivity to H2O2 compared to those in tubulin, allowing it to sense intracellular reactive oxygen species (Xu2022Mitotic). The presence of disulfide bonds within CXXC pairs is necessary for the formation of intermolecular disulfides, which are important for CRIPT's function during mitosis (Xu2022Mitotic).

## Function
The CRIPT protein plays a crucial role in dendritic growth and synaptic organization in neurons. It interacts with the PDZ3 domain of SAP97, a scaffolding protein associated with the postsynaptic density, to promote dendrite growth in mammalian motor neurons. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly of AMPA receptors containing the GluA1 subunit, which are important for excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic composition (Zhang2017SAP97). CRIPT is necessary for the dendritic growth-promoting activity of SAP97, as its knockdown blocks the effects of SAP97 overexpression on dendritic growth (Zhang2017SAP97).

In addition to its role in neurons, CRIPT is involved in mitotic spindle disassembly in human cells. It functions as a cysteine-dependent tubulin binding protein, interacting with α-tubulin and participating in redox-dependent mechanisms crucial for spindle dynamics during cell division. CRIPT's redox modifications, particularly within its CXXC pairs, facilitate microtubule depolymerization, a key step in spindle disassembly (Xu2022Mitotic). These processes are essential for proper cell cycle progression and are linked to cell proliferation and spindle organization (Xu2022Mitotic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CRIPT gene have been associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting growth and development. A notable case involves a female patient with biallelic mutations in the CRIPT gene, presenting with short stature, dysmorphic features, microcephaly, and pigmentary abnormalities. This patient was found to have a novel missense variant (c.8G>A, p.C3Y) and a deletion of exon 1, making her compound heterozygous. These genetic alterations are believed to be responsible for her clinical presentation, which includes postnatal growth retardation, global developmental delay, and specific dysmorphic features such as frontal bossing and sparse hair (Leduc2016CRIPT).

The missense variant affects a highly conserved cysteine residue, predicted to be deleterious by several computational algorithms, supporting its pathogenicity. The phenotypic overlap with previously reported cases of CRIPT mutations, including severe growth restriction characteristic of primordial dwarfism, underscores the gene's role in these conditions (Leduc2016CRIPT). While defects in the PIGF gene, also affected by the deletion, are not known to cause human disease, the CRIPT gene mutations are likely responsible for the observed clinical features (Leduc2016CRIPT).

## Interactions
CRIPT is a postsynaptic protein that specifically interacts with the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of PSD-95/SAP90, a synaptic scaffolding protein. This interaction is highly specific and is mediated by the C-terminal sequence of CRIPT, particularly the -QTSV motif, which is critical for binding to PDZ3 (Niethammer1998CRIPT). CRIPT also binds directly to microtubules, acting as a linker protein that anchors PSD-95 to the microtubule cytoskeleton. This binding is independent of its C-terminal sequence, suggesting distinct sites within CRIPT mediate this interaction (Passafaro1999Microtubule).

The interaction between CRIPT and PSD-95 is crucial for the synaptic clustering of PSD-95 and other associated proteins, such as chapsyn-110/PSD-93 and GKAP. Disruption of the CRIPT-PSD-95 interaction prevents the association of PSD-95 with microtubules and inhibits its synaptic clustering, although it does not affect the number of synapses or the synaptic localization of NMDA receptors (Passafaro1999Microtubule). CRIPT's role in linking PSD-95 to microtubules is essential for maintaining the structural organization of synaptic junctions (Passafaro1999Microtubule).
