# MYH7

## Overview
The MYH7 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 7 (β-MyHC), a crucial protein in the myosin family that functions as a molecular motor. This protein is predominantly expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, where it plays a vital role in muscle contraction by converting chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force. The β-MyHC is a key component of the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction, and is essential for maintaining normal cardiac function. Structurally, the protein consists of a globular head responsible for ATP binding and actin interaction, and a filamentous tail that facilitates dimerization. Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, modulate its structural and functional properties, impacting cardiac function and disease. Mutations in MYH7 are linked to various myopathies and cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Laing distal myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Kolokotronis2019Biallelic; LandimVieira2022Posttranslational; Sivaramakrishnan2009Insights).

## Structure
The MYH7 gene encodes the β-myosin heavy chain, a critical component of muscle sarcomeres, particularly in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibers. The protein is composed of 1935 amino acids and has a calculated mass of 223,111 Da (Jaenicke1990The). Its structure includes an N-terminal globular head (S1) and a filamentous C-terminal rod. The head region is responsible for ATP binding and actin interaction, featuring an active center around tryptophan 130 (Jaenicke1990The). The rod region forms a coiled-coil structure based on a 7-residue repeat, facilitating dimerization of two α-helical chains (Jaenicke1990The).

The β-myosin heavy chain contains specific domains such as the motor domain, which is crucial for its function as a molecular motor, and the SH3-like domain involved in protein-protein interactions (LandimVieira2022Posttranslational). Post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, play significant roles in modulating the protein's structural and functional properties. For instance, acetylation of lysine residues like K951 and K58 affects the myosin tail and motor domain, respectively, altering their structural integrity and interaction capabilities (LandimVieira2022Posttranslational). These modifications are particularly relevant in the context of cardiac function and disease (LandimVieira2022Posttranslational).

## Function
The MYH7 gene encodes the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC), a critical component of the type II myosin motor proteins involved in muscle contraction, particularly in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles. In healthy human cells, β-cardiac myosin functions as a mechanoenzyme that converts chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force, driving muscle contractility and maintaining normal cardiac function (Sivaramakrishnan2009Insights). This protein plays a vital role in the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction, ensuring effective force generation and muscle contraction (Sivaramakrishnan2009Insights).

In the human heart, β-cardiac myosin is predominantly expressed, comprising about 90% of cardiac myosin, with α-cardiac myosin making up the remaining 10%. Despite their high amino acid sequence similarity, these isoforms are functionally distinct, with β-cardiac myosin having a slower sliding velocity compared to α-cardiac myosin, which affects muscle contractility (Sivaramakrishnan2009Insights). The balance between these isoforms is crucial for proper cardiac function, as they have different enzymatic properties that influence muscle contractility (Broadwell2021Myosin). Understanding the function of MYH7 in healthy cells is essential for developing therapies for conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where mutations in MYH7 can disrupt normal myosin function (Sivaramakrishnan2009Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH7 gene are associated with a range of myopathies and cardiomyopathies. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) (Mattivi2020Clinical; Kolokotronis2019Biallelic). MYH7 mutations are often missense variants that can lead to myopathy through a dominant negative effect, where the mutant protein interferes with normal sarcomere function (Hershkovitz2018Clinical; Kolokotronis2019Biallelic). 

In skeletal muscle, MYH7 mutations can cause conditions such as Laing distal myopathy, myosin storage myopathy, and multi-minicore disease, characterized by muscle weakness and histopathological abnormalities (Cullup2012Mutations; Clarke2013A). These mutations can result in a spectrum of clinical presentations, from mild to severe, and may include both cardiac and skeletal muscle involvement (Fiorillo2016MYH7related; Muelas2010MYH7).

The clinical significance of MYH7 mutations is further complicated by variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, meaning that not all individuals with a mutation will exhibit symptoms (Hershkovitz2018Clinical). This variability underscores the importance of genotype-phenotype correlations in understanding the full impact of MYH7 mutations (Fiorillo2016MYH7related).

## Interactions
MYH7, or myosin heavy chain 7, is a critical component of the cardiac sarcomere, where it plays a vital role in muscle contraction. It interacts with actin filaments, forming part of the thick filament in muscle fibers, and is involved in the regulation of contraction velocity and energy conversion. MYH7 is encoded by the MYH7 gene, which includes a globular motor domain and an α-helical tail domain, allowing it to interact with actin filaments in the sarcomere (Burghardt2021Natural).

The interaction between MYH7 and myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3) is particularly significant. MYBPC3 regulates the function of MYH7 by modulating its interaction with actin, impacting force generation and energy transduction. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper cardiac muscle function and is influenced by single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that can lead to hereditary heart diseases (Burghardt2021Natural).

MYH7 is also involved in the assembly of Z-disks in cardiomyocytes, where it replaces non-muscle myosin isoforms during sarcomere assembly. This process is essential for the proper function of cardiac muscle cells and is enriched during Z-disk assembly in wild-type induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Ladha2020Identifying).
