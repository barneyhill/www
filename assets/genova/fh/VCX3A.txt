# VCX3A

## Overview
VCX3A is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein variable charge X-linked 3A, which is primarily expressed in male germ cells, particularly within the testes. This protein is characterized by its highly charged structure, with regions rich in both acidic and basic residues, suggesting a role in chromatin or nucleic acid interactions. VCX3A functions as a noncanonical cap-binding protein, potentially regulating mRNA stability and serving as a tissue-specific decapping regulator. While its precise molecular functions in chromatin remodeling and gene expression during sperm maturation are not fully understood, VCX3A is implicated in various cellular processes, including interactions with bacterial-type long-chain polyphosphates and involvement in pathways related to hepatocellular carcinoma progression. Clinically, alterations in the VCX3A gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as X-linked ichthyosis and intellectual disabilities, although its deletion alone does not necessarily result in cognitive deficits, indicating a complex interplay with other genetic factors (Ding2020Discovery; Lahn2000A; Krenzlin2022BacterialType; CuevasCovarrubias2007Analysis).

## Structure


## Function
The VCX3A gene, located on the X chromosome, is part of the VCX/Y gene family and is primarily expressed in male germ cells, particularly in the testes. The protein encoded by VCX3A is involved in spermatogenesis, contributing to sperm development and function (Lahn2000A). It is characterized by a highly charged structure, with regions rich in acidic residues like glutamic acid, and other regions enriched with basic residues such as arginine and lysine, suggesting a potential role in chromatin or nucleic acid interactions (Lahn2000A). 

VCX3A acts as a noncanonical cap-binding protein that binds specifically to capped RNA, indicating its involvement in regulating mRNA stability. This function suggests that VCX3A may serve as a tissue-specific decapping regulator, influencing the degradation or stability of mRNA in specific tissues (CuevasCovarrubias2007Analysis). Although the precise molecular function of VCX3A in chromatin remodeling or gene expression during sperm maturation is not fully elucidated, its expression pattern and structural characteristics imply a significant role in male germ cell biology (Lahn2000A). The presence of an intact VCX3A gene is associated with normal intelligence, although its deletion alone is not sufficient to cause mental retardation, indicating a complex interaction with other genetic factors (CuevasCovarrubias2007Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VCX3A gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. Deletions of VCX3A have been linked to X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) and mental retardation (MR), suggesting a role in neurocognitive phenotypes. Patients with XLI who also exhibit MR often have deletions that include VCX3A, while those with XLI alone typically retain this gene, indicating its potential involvement in cognitive function (Van2005Deletion; Ben2013Xp22.3). The deletion of VCX3A has been associated with abnormal neurocognitive phenotypes, and a deletion in its promoter region has been linked to borderline MR in XLI cases (Ben2013Xp22.3).

The VCX3A gene is also implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders. Some studies suggest that deletions or mutations in VCX3A may contribute to X-linked nonspecific mental retardation (Fukami2000A). However, the role of VCX3A in ID is debated, as some individuals with VCX3A deletions do not exhibit cognitive deficits, indicating that other factors may influence the clinical outcome (Li2010Interstitial).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of VCX3A is associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis, particularly in cases with vascular invasion (Ding2020Discovery).

## Interactions
VCX3A, a gene located on the X chromosome, is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific interactions with proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the literature. A study identified VCX3A as one of the top 10 proteins that bind to bacterial-type long-chain polyphosphates, suggesting a potential role in polyphosphate-related cellular processes. However, the exact function of VCX3A in this context remains unclear, and no direct connection to the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway was established (Krenzlin2022BacterialType).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), VCX3A is part of a molecular pathway involving hsa-miR-664a-3p and TUBA3C. This pathway is associated with aggressive progression and vascular invasion in HCC. The study suggests that VCX3A may interact with TUBA3C, as they exhibit a strong co-expression correlation, indicating a potential regulatory relationship (Ding2020Discovery).

While these findings suggest possible interactions, the precise mechanisms and partners involved in VCX3A's interactions remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify the role of VCX3A in these and other cellular contexts.
