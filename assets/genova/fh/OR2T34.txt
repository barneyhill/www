# OR2T34

## Overview
OR2T34 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 34, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorant molecules in the olfactory epithelium (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR2T34 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including leukocytes and the developing human brain, suggesting potential roles in immune response and brain development (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). The gene has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe tick-borne encephalitis, highlighting its clinical significance (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

## Function
The OR2T34 gene encodes an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in the detection of odorants. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). OR2T34 has been shown to respond to low concentrations of floralozone, an odorant with ozone, marine, and fresh characteristics, indicating its role in detecting specific odorants (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR2T34 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including leukocytes and the developing human brain, particularly in the choroid plexus, which is involved in cerebrospinal fluid production (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). This suggests that OR2T34 may have functions beyond odor detection, potentially influencing immune responses and brain development. The receptor is also implicated in processes such as cytokinesis, muscle regeneration, cell adhesion and migration, chemotaxis, chemokinesis, and odorant-mediated serotonin release (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). These diverse roles highlight the multifunctional nature of OR2T34 in human physiology.

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T34 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). A study conducted on a Russian population identified harmful genetic variants in OR2T34 that are associated with severe forms of TBE. These variants are not commonly found in non-Finnish Europeans, suggesting a potential role in the disease's severity (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). The gene is expressed in leukocytes and the developing human brain, particularly in the choroid plexus, which is involved in cerebrospinal fluid production. Mutations or alterations in the expression of OR2T34 may affect immune responses and brain function, potentially influencing the progression of TBE (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

The study also highlighted that OR2T34 is part of a set of genes enriched with those located in the plasma membrane and involved in the extracellular matrix proteoglycans pathway. This suggests that OR2T34 may be involved in similar biological processes or pathways related to TBEV infection (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from OR2T34 mutations or expression alterations beyond TBE are not explicitly mentioned in the available literature.
