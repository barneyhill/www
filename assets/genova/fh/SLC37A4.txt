# SLC37A4

## Overview
The SLC37A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 37 member 4, commonly referred to as glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). This protein is a transmembrane transporter integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, playing a pivotal role in glucose metabolism. As a member of the solute carrier family, G6PT is involved in the translocation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen, where it is hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase enzymes. This process is essential for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, particularly during fasting, by supporting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Beyond its metabolic functions, SLC37A4 is also implicated in energy homeostasis within immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, and in the regulation of autophagy through interactions with mTORC1. Mutations in the SLC37A4 gene are associated with Glycogen Storage Disease type Ib (GSD-Ib), highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic and immune health (Chou2014Type; Cappello2018The; Ng2021A).

## Structure
The SLC37A4 gene encodes a protein known as glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT), which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is part of the solute carrier family 37 and is characterized by its hydrophobic nature and multiple transmembrane domains, with models suggesting either 10 or 12 domains, though recent studies favor a 10-domain model (Cappello2018The). The protein's primary structure includes 429 amino acids (Han2005A).

The SLC37A4 protein is highly conserved across species, with significant sequence homology to its murine and rat counterparts (Cappello2018The). It shares sequence identity with bacterial proteins such as UhpT, GlpT, and UhpC, although it has limited homology with other members of the SLC37 family (Cappello2018The). The protein's C-terminal domain is crucial for its stability and localization, containing an ER retrieval signal and a potential Golgi retention sequence, which are essential for maintaining its proper localization within the ER (Wilson2021SLC37A4‐CDG:; Ng2021A).

Two human tissue-specific splicing isoforms, G6PT and vG6PT, have been identified, differing by the inclusion of a 66-bp exon 7 sequence in vG6PT (Cappello2018The). These isoforms may affect the protein's function and expression in different tissues.

## Function
The SLC37A4 gene encodes the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), a critical component of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) system in human cells. This transporter is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is responsible for translocating glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen (Chou2014Type; Cappello2018The). Within the ER, G6P is hydrolyzed by G6Pase enzymes into glucose and inorganic phosphate, which are then exported back into the cytoplasm and bloodstream, respectively (Chou2014Type; Ng2021A).

This process is essential for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, particularly during fasting, as it supports gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver, kidney, and intestine (Skakic2019CRISPR/Cas9; Cappello2018The). In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, SLC37A4 is involved in energy homeostasis in neutrophils and macrophages, where it regulates glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (Chou2014Type; Cappello2018The). The proper function of SLC37A4 is crucial for both metabolic and immune functions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Cappello2018The; Ng2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC37A4 gene are primarily associated with Glycogen Storage Disease type Ib (GSD-Ib), an autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT), leading to impaired glucose homeostasis and myeloid dysfunction. Patients with GSD-Ib often experience metabolic issues such as hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lactic acidemia, and hepatomegaly, as well as immune dysfunctions like neutropenia and recurrent infections due to neutrophil dysfunction (Chou2014Type; Cappello2018The).

The SLC37A4 gene has been found to have over 100 mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations, which affect the function and stability of the G6PT protein. These mutations are distributed throughout the gene and can lead to various clinical manifestations depending on their location and nature (Cappello2018The). For example, mutations in the N-terminal domain can abolish transport function, while those in the C-terminal domain may cause rapid protein degradation (Cappello2018The).

Additionally, a specific mutation, p.Arg423*, has been linked to a dominantly inherited congenital disorder of glycosylation, characterized by liver dysfunction and altered serum protein N-glycosylation (Ng2021A).

## Interactions
The SLC37A4 protein, also known as glucose-6-phosphate translocase, is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It forms a functional complex with glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α) and glucose-6-phosphatase-β (G6Pase-β) in the endoplasmic reticulum. This complex is essential for the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate, a process crucial for gluconeogenesis and glucose homeostasis (Cappello2018The). The interaction between SLC37A4 and G6Pase-α is particularly important for G6P uptake activity, as demonstrated in studies with hepatic microsomes from G6Pase-α-deficient mice (Cappello2018The).

SLC37A4 also plays a role in autophagy regulation by negatively regulating mTORC1 activity. It promotes the initiation of autophagy by increasing the interaction between ULK1 and ATG9, independent of its glucose-6-phosphate transport activity (Cappello2018The; Andjelkovic2022Crosstalk). This suggests that SLC37A4 may influence mTORC1 function through mechanisms such as calcium mobilization and AMPK modulation, affecting autophagy regulation (Cappello2018The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SLC37A4 in cellular metabolism and autophagy.
