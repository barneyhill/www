# MBL2

## Overview
The MBL2 gene encodes the mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) protein, a crucial component of the innate immune system. MBL2 is a member of the collectin family and functions as a C-type lectin, characterized by its calcium-dependent binding to specific carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses (Smolnikova2022Proteins). The protein is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream as multimeric complexes, which are essential for its role in opsonization and activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system (Heitzeneder2012Mannanbinding). MBL2's structure includes a cysteine-rich N-terminal region, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is pivotal for its interaction with microbial carbohydrates (Garred2008Mannosebinding). Genetic variations in the MBL2 gene can influence MBL2 protein levels and function, impacting susceptibility to various infectious and autoimmune diseases (Garred2009MBL2).

## Structure
The MBL2 gene encodes the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) protein, which is a crucial component of the innate immune system. The MBL protein is composed of four distinct domains: a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain, a collagen-like region characterized by Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Garred2008Mannosebinding). The CRD is responsible for recognizing microbial carbohydrates and certain host cell structures in a calcium-dependent manner (Garred2008Mannosebinding).

The primary structure of MBL includes three cysteine residues in the N-terminal part, which are encoded by exon 1, along with the initial part of the collagen-like domain (Seyfarth2005The). The collagen-like region is crucial for the protein's oligomerization, forming higher-order structures such as trimers and tetramers, which are essential for its function (Garred2008Mannosebinding; Seyfarth2005The).

The mature MBL protein typically forms oligomers consisting of two to six subunits, each made up of three identical 25 kDa polypeptide chains in a triple-helix structure (Seyfarth2005The). These oligomers are necessary for MBL's interaction with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and its role in complement activation (Seyfarth2005The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and hydroxylation, which are common in collectins (Garred2008Mannosebinding).

## Function
The MBL2 gene encodes mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing and binding to carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites. This binding facilitates opsonization, a process that marks pathogens for phagocytosis by immune cells, and activates the lectin pathway of the complement system, leading to pathogen clearance (Heitzeneder2012Mannanbinding; Bernig2004Sequence).

MBL is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream as high-molecular-weight multimeric complexes. It is a member of the collectin protein family and is classified as a C-type lectin due to its calcium-dependent binding to mannose and other sugar fragments (Smolnikova2022Proteins). The protein structure includes a cysteine-rich N-terminal region, a glycine-rich collagenous domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is essential for binding to carbohydrate ligands on pathogens (Heitzeneder2012Mannanbinding).

In addition to pathogen recognition, MBL binds to apoptotic and necrotic cells, aiding in their clearance. It forms complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), which are crucial for complement activation and subsequent immune responses (Heitzeneder2012Mannanbinding). MBL's activity is primarily extracellular, functioning in the bloodstream to enhance immune defense mechanisms (Smolnikova2022Proteins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions due to their impact on mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels and immune function. In the context of rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), the MBL2 polymorphism rs1800450 has been linked to increased MBL levels, which may contribute to undesirable complement activation and chronic inflammation, potentially leading to rheumatic cardiomyopathy. The AA genotype, associated with higher MBL production, is more prevalent in patients with RHD, suggesting a genetic predisposition to cardiac complications in RF (Gomaa2018MBL2).

In severe COVID-19 cases, MBL2 polymorphisms, particularly the OO genotype, are associated with lower plasma MBL levels and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. This reduction in MBL levels is thought to exacerbate the severity of the disease by impairing immune functions like complement activation and phagocytosis (Queiroz2023Polymorphisms).

MBL2 polymorphisms have also been linked to increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with certain alleles like B and genotypes such as AD and DD associated with higher SLE risk (Yuan2020Association). These genetic variations highlight the role of MBL2 in modulating immune responses and influencing disease severity.

## Interactions
The MBL2 gene encodes mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which is a key component of the lectin pathway of the complement system. MBL interacts with specific carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of various pathogens, including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses, facilitating opsonization and complement activation (Garred2016A; Thiel1997A). MBL forms complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs), including MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3, which are crucial for the activation of the complement system. MASP-2, in particular, is responsible for cleaving complement components C2 and C4, forming the C3 convertase necessary for the complement cascade (Dahl2001MASP3; Garred2009MBL2).

MBL also interacts with nucleic acids and carbohydrates in a calcium-dependent manner, which is essential for its role in immune response (Garred2016A). The protein's carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) is responsible for these interactions, recognizing microbial carbohydrates such as mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (Garred2009MBL2). Additionally, MBL can recruit other proteins like pentraxins, enhancing complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis (Garred2016A). These interactions highlight MBL's role in pathogen recognition and immune defense.
