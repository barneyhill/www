# ZNG1F

## Overview
ZNG1F is a gene that encodes the protein Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1F, which plays a crucial role in cellular zinc homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein synthesis. The activity of Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1F is essential for the regulation of metalloproteins, which are proteins that require metal ions to function properly. Dysregulation of this gene and its protein product has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in the context of metal ion metabolism and associated disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
