# METAP2

## Overview
The METAP2 gene encodes the enzyme methionyl aminopeptidase 2, which is a critical metalloprotease involved in the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme is responsible for the removal of the N-terminal methionine from nascent polypeptides, a process essential for subsequent protein maturation and function (Chiu2014Redox). Methionyl aminopeptidase 2 is categorized as a cytoplasmic enzyme and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and protein synthesis (Bernier2005Methionine). The enzyme's activity is regulated by a unique disulfide bond, which influences its substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (Chiu2014Redox). METAP2 is also a target for antiangiogenic compounds, underscoring its importance in vascular development and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases (Yeh2006Targeted).

## Function
Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (METAP2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins by removing the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins, a process essential for protein maturation and function (Chiu2014Redox). This enzymatic activity is crucial for subsequent N-terminal modifications, such as myristoylation and acetylation, which can affect protein stability and function (Yeh2006Targeted). METAP2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in several key cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and protein synthesis (Bernier2005Methionine).

In healthy human cells, METAP2 is essential for cell proliferation and viability. Its activity supports normal cellular processes by maintaining cellular homeostasis and enabling proper cell cycle progression (Bernier2005Methionine). METAP2 is also involved in endothelial cell proliferation and is a target for antiangiogenic compounds, highlighting its role in angiogenesis and vascular development (Yeh2006Targeted). The enzyme's function is regulated by a unique disulfide bond between Cys 228 and Cys 448, which acts as an allosteric regulator, influencing substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency (Chiu2014Redox).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the METAP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. METAP2 is overexpressed in several types of cancer, including mesothelioma, B-cell lymphomas, and colorectal adenocarcinoma, suggesting its role in tumorigenesis and making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ma2011Methionine; Selvakumar2006Methionine). In colorectal cancer, METAP2 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (Selvakumar2006Methionine). 

The enzyme is also involved in vasculogenic mimicry, a process where cancer cells form blood vessel-like structures, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibition of METAP2 has been shown to suppress vasculogenic mimicry in various cancer cell lines (Shimizu2021Methionine). Furthermore, METAP2 is associated with the calcium-binding protein S100A4, which regulates tumor metastasis (Selvakumar2006Methionine).

In addition to cancer, METAP2 has been linked to metabolic pathways associated with type-2 diabetes and acute myeloid leukemia. Genetic variants affecting METAP2 expression in adipose tissues have been identified, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Kyriakou2021Common). These findings highlight the clinical significance of METAP2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (METAP2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. METAP2 interacts with the calcium-binding protein S100A4, a relationship that is significant in angiogenesis. The interaction is mediated by a specific region of METAP2, known as the NBD peptide, which adopts a helix-turn-helix structure. This interaction is primarily driven by the C-terminal region of the NBD peptide, which is essential for its inhibitory activity against S100A4 (Katagiri2019Structural).

METAP2 also interacts with angiogenesis inhibitors such as fumagillin and ovalicin. These inhibitors bind covalently to METAP2, specifically modifying the His-231 residue, which is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity. This interaction inhibits METAP2's function, highlighting its role in angiogenesis (Griffith1998Molecular; Sin1997The).

In the context of cancer, METAP2 is overexpressed in various cancers, including colon cancer, where it interacts with Src family tyrosine kinases and other proteins involved in metastasis progression. This makes METAP2 a potential target for cancer treatment (Selvakumar2009NC2213:).
