# OR6Y1

## Overview
The OR6Y1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily Y member 1, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for their role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Mainland2015Human). The OR6Y1 protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. Genetic variations in OR6Y1 have been associated with differences in olfactory perception among individuals and populations (Trimmer2019Genetic). Additionally, the gene has been implicated in studies of olfactory function in schizophrenia, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Saeed2023Smell).

## Structure
The OR6Y1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, which are involved in signal transduction across cell membranes (Mainland2015Human). The primary structure of the OR6Y1 protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, which includes a noted variation where valine is replaced by isoleucine at position 252 (V252I) (Mainland2015Human). 

The secondary structure of OR6Y1 likely includes alpha helices, which are common in GPCRs and contribute to the formation of the transmembrane domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with odorant molecules and initiate a cellular response. While the quaternary structure is less common in olfactory receptors, the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its function and stability (Mainland2015Human).

The OR6Y1 gene has been studied in various contexts, including its role in odor perception and its genetic variation across different populations, which can influence olfactory phenotypes (Trimmer2019Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR6Y1 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been studied in the context of schizophrenia, particularly in Sudanese families. Research has identified rare variants of OR6Y1 with uncertain significance regarding their effect on protein function. These variants were found in multiple families affected by schizophrenia, suggesting a potential link between OR6Y1 gene variants and olfactory function in the disorder (Saeed2023Smell). The study highlighted a significant impairment in smell identification among schizophrenia cases and their family members compared to controls, indicating that alterations in OR6Y1 may contribute to the olfactory deficits observed in schizophrenia (Saeed2023Smell).

Additionally, the OR6Y1 gene has been involved in challenges related to multi-nucleotide variant (MNV) annotation in cancer genomics. Misannotation of MNVs can lead to incorrect amino acid predictions, which may affect protein function. A tool called MAC has been developed to correct these misannotations, specifically addressing issues in genes like OR6Y1, where multiple nucleotide changes within a single codon can lead to incorrect variant interpretation (Wei2015MAC:). However, the specific clinical implications of these findings for OR6Y1 remain to be fully elucidated.
