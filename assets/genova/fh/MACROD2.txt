# MACROD2

## Overview
MACROD2 is a gene that encodes the protein mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase 2, which is a member of the macrodomain family of proteins. This protein functions as a hydrolase, specifically involved in the removal of mono-ADP-ribose moieties from target proteins, a post-translational modification that plays a critical role in cellular processes such as DNA repair and signal transduction. The MACROD2 protein is characterized by its macrodomain structure, which facilitates its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. It is involved in regulating the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), thereby contributing to genomic stability and acting as a tumor suppressor. Additionally, MACROD2 influences cellular signaling pathways, including WNT signaling, through interactions with proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and metabolic diseases, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Feijs2020The; Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2).

## Structure
The MACROD2 protein is characterized by a macrodomain, which is crucial for its function as a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase. Structurally, macrodomains adopt a globular α/β/α sandwich fold, featuring a central six-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by five α-helices. This structure facilitates substrate binding via a deep cleft on the domain, where the adenosine moiety of ADP-ribose undergoes π-π stacking with a conserved aromatic residue, and the N6 nitrogen is coordinated by an aspartate residue, essential for ADP-ribose binding (Rack2016Macrodomains:).

The MacroD2 protein has a unique conformation that is ideal for ester hydrolysis at the 1′′-OH position of ADP-ribose, involving a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism. This mechanism includes a water molecule activated by the ADP-ribose α-phosphate, which performs a nucleophilic attack on the C1′′ atom of the distal ribose (Jankevicius2013A). Key residues such as Gly100, Ile189, and Tyr190 are critical for its catalytic activity (Jankevicius2013A).

The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions involving specific loops, with loop 1 acting as the catalytic loop and loop 2 as the diphosphate binding loop, contributing to substrate specificity and coordination (Rack2016Macrodomains:).

## Function
The MACROD2 gene encodes a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase involved in the removal of ADP-ribose moieties from proteins, a post-translational modification crucial for various cellular processes. This enzyme plays a significant role in DNA repair by regulating the activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a key sensor of DNA strand breaks. MACROD2's activity ensures proper DNA damage response and maintains genomic stability, acting as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor by preventing chromosome instability and aneuploidy (Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2).

MACROD2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cellular stress responses and signaling pathways. It is involved in the regulation of WNT signaling through its interaction with glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), although its impact on WNT signaling in the context of certain mutations is limited (Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2). The protein's diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution suggests it may have unique roles in different tissues, with elevated expression in neurons indicating a potential brain-specific function (Feijs2020The). MACROD2's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease progression.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MACROD2 gene have been linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. Intragenic deletions in MACROD2 are associated with complex phenotypes, including microcephaly, intellectual disability, polydactyly, and renal and pancreatic malformations. These deletions can lead to overexpression of a short isoform of MACROD2, potentially affecting embryonic development (Lombardo2019Intragenic). 

In cancer, MACROD2 plays a significant role, with its mutations and expression levels influencing clinical outcomes. In colorectal cancer, MACROD2 haploinsufficiency is linked to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, promoting tumor growth (Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2). In hepatocellular carcinoma, MACROD2 deficiency is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis through activation of the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhou2020MACROD2). 

MACROD2 is also implicated in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, with polymorphisms or deletions correlated with autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Feijs2020The). Additionally, variants in MACROD2 have been associated with conditions such as hypertension, Crohn's disease, and obesity (Kim2021Association). These findings highlight the gene's diverse clinical significance across various diseases.

## Interactions
MACROD2 is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in DNA repair and cellular signaling pathways. It regulates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) by removing the terminal autoinhibitory mono-ADP-ribose, which is crucial for reactivating PARP1 and facilitating DNA repair (Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2). MACROD2 also interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3β), influencing WNT signaling by reversing PARP10-catalyzed mono-ADP-ribose-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, modulating WNT target gene expression (Sakthianandeswaren2018MACROD2).

In response to DNA damage, MACROD2 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a process regulated by ATM kinase activity. This export is dependent on the phosphorylation of specific serine residues, indicating a direct interaction between ATM and MACROD2 (Golia2016ATM). The nuclear export of MACROD2 restricts its recruitment to DNA lesions, potentially reducing its ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity at these sites (Golia2016ATM). These interactions highlight MACROD2's role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in critical cellular processes.
