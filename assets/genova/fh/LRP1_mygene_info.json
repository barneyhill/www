The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed by furin to generate 515 kDa and 85 kDa subunits that form the mature receptor (PMID: 8546712). This receptor is involved in several cellular processes, including intracellular signaling, lipid homeostasis, and clearance of apoptotic cells. In addition, the encoded protein is necessary for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-mediated clearance of secreted amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid, the main component of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer patients. Expression of this gene decreases with age and has been found to be lower than controls in brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients.
