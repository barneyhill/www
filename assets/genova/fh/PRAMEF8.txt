# PRAMEF8

## Overview
PRAMEF8 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 8, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation. PRAME family member 8 is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which means it is typically expressed in a limited number of normal tissues, such as the testis, but is aberrantly expressed in various cancers. The expression pattern of PRAMEF8 suggests its potential involvement in oncogenic processes, making it a subject of interest in cancer research (Qiu2020aarFDC).
