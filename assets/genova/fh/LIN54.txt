# LIN54

## Overview
LIN54 is a gene that encodes the lin-54 DREAM MuvB core complex component, a protein integral to the regulation of cell cycle-dependent gene expression. The lin-54 protein is a DNA-binding component of the MuvB core complex, which is involved in both the repression and activation of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, particularly during the G2/M phase (Fischer2017Cell). Structurally, lin-54 contains two tandem cysteine-rich (CXC) domains that facilitate high-affinity DNA binding, crucial for the recruitment of the MuvB complex to target promoters (Marceau2016Structural). The protein's interaction with DNA is essential for the formation of the DREAM and MMB complexes, which are active in different phases of the cell cycle to regulate transcription (Litovchick2011DYRK1A). Alterations in LIN54 expression or function have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its significance in cancer biology (Wiseman2015Deregulation).

## Structure
The LIN54 protein is a component of the MuvB core complex, which plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation. Structurally, LIN54 contains a DNA-binding domain (DBD) composed of two tandem cysteine-rich (CXC) domains. These domains are essential for high-affinity DNA binding and share sequence similarity with tesmin, a testis-specific metallothionein-like protein (Marceau2016Structural). The CXC domains are independently folded into subdomains, DBD-N and DBD-C, each featuring a CXC fold similar to the CXC domain of MSL2. These subdomains bind to the minor groove of the DNA helix, stabilized by zinc ions coordinated by cysteines and backbone hydrogen bonds (Marceau2016Structural).

The LIN54 DBD is characterized by the insertion of tyrosine residues into the DNA minor groove, conferring sequence specificity necessary for MuvB recruitment to target promoters (Marceau2016Structural). The protein's structure is further stabilized by a flexible linker connecting the subdomains and a C-terminal alpha-helix interacting with hydrophobic sidechains (Marceau2016Structural). LIN54's organization is similar to other tesmin family proteins, indicating a shared DNA binding strategy (Marceau2016Structural). The presence of zinc in LIN54 was confirmed through X-ray fluorescence, with structural data collected at a resolution of 2.4 Å (Marceau2016Structural).

## Function
LIN54 is a core component of the MuvB complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle-dependent gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in both the repression and activation of cell cycle genes, particularly those expressed during the G2/M phase. LIN54 achieves this by binding to DNA in a sequence-specific manner through the cell cycle genes homology region (CHR), with the consensus sequence TTYRAA, which is enriched in the promoters of MuvB target genes (Marceau2016Structural; Fischer2017Cell).

The protein contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain with two tandem cysteine-rich (CXC) domains, which are essential for its interaction with the CHR promoter element and for its nuclear retention (Fischer2017Cell). LIN54's DNA-binding activity is crucial for the recruitment of the MuvB complex to promoters, facilitating the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression (Marceau2016Structural).

In proliferating cells, LIN54 acts as a transcriptional activator of cell division genes, while in quiescent cells, it functions as a repressor. Its depletion leads to downregulation of many cell cycle genes, particularly those required for cytokinesis, resulting in defects in cytokinesis and mitosis (Kittler2007Genome-scale). LIN54's role in directing the MuvB complex to CHR elements is critical for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and mitosis (Marceau2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the LIN54 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), LIN54 is critical for the sensitivity of cancer cells to CHK1 inhibitors. Knockout of LIN54 in cell lines results in increased resistance to these inhibitors, indicating its role in the replication stress response during CHK1 inhibition (Branigan2021MMBFOXM1driven). In oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), reduced expression of LIN54 is associated with late-stage disease and local metastases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Wiseman2015Deregulation). The deregulation of LIN54, along with other components of the FOXM1 target gene network, is predictive of OAC presence, although it does not provide prognostic power (Wiseman2015Deregulation).

In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), genetic alterations in LIN54, such as gene copy number losses, are observed. These alterations can affect the formation and function of the MuvB complexes, potentially impacting cancer progression and therapeutic responses (Iness2018MuvB:). Overall, LIN54's role in cell cycle regulation and its interactions with other proteins make it significant in the context of cancer biology.

## Interactions
LIN54 is a key component of the MuvB core complex, which also includes LIN9, LIN37, LIN52, and RBBP4. This core complex can associate with different proteins to form either the DREAM complex or the MMB complex, depending on the cell cycle phase. In the G0/G1 phase, the MuvB core binds with p130/E2F4/DP1 to form the DREAM complex, which is involved in transcriptional repression. During the S phase, it associates with B-Myb to form the MMB complex, which is involved in transcriptional activation (Litovchick2011DYRK1A).

LIN54 specifically interacts with DNA by recognizing cell cycle homology region (CHR) elements in promoters. It binds to the minor groove of DNA through its DNA-binding domain, which contains two subdomains, DBD-C and DBD-N. These subdomains interact with different halves of the CHR motif, with tyrosine residues Tyr536 and Tyr610 playing a crucial role in stabilizing the protein-DNA complex through hydrogen bonds (Marceau2016Structural).

The interaction of LIN54 with DNA is essential for recruiting the MuvB complex to promoters, facilitating the regulation of cell cycle-dependent gene expression. This interaction is part of a larger mechanism involving the DREAM complex, which binds to promoters with CHR and CDE sites to regulate transcription (Marceau2016Structural).
