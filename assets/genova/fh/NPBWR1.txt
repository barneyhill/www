# NPBWR1

## Overview
The NPBWR1 gene encodes the neuropeptides B and W receptor 1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in neuroendocrine and behavioral regulation. This receptor is activated by the endogenous ligands neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW), which are involved in various physiological processes, including stress response, feeding behavior, and pain modulation (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Hondo2024The). NPBWR1 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, suggesting its involvement in emotional regulation and energy homeostasis (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Hondo2024The). At the molecular level, NPBWR1 couples with the Gi subclass of G-proteins, leading to inhibitory signaling pathways that influence neuronal activity and hormonal regulation (Sakurai2013NPBWR1). The receptor's role in modulating emotional responses, energy balance, and pain perception underscores its potential clinical significance in conditions such as obesity, emotional disorders, and pain management (Wojciechowicz2021The; Sakurai2013NPBWR1).

## Function
The NPBWR1 gene encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that is primarily involved in neuroendocrine and behavioral regulation. This receptor is activated by the endogenous ligands neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW), which are involved in various physiological processes, including stress response, feeding behavior, and pain modulation (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Hondo2024The). NPBWR1 is expressed in several brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala, indicating its role in emotional regulation and energy homeostasis (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Hondo2024The).

At the molecular level, NPBWR1 primarily couples with the Gi subclass of G-proteins, leading to the inhibition of neuronal activity, which suggests its involvement in inhibitory signaling pathways (Sakurai2013NPBWR1). This receptor is also implicated in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, influencing hormone levels such as corticosterone and prolactin, which are critical for stress response (Sakurai2013NPBWR1). In terms of organismal outcomes, NPBWR1 is involved in modulating emotional responses, particularly fear and anxiety, and plays a role in energy balance, as evidenced by its influence on feeding behavior and energy expenditure (Wojciechowicz2021The; Sakurai2013NPBWR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NPBWR1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. NPBWR1 is implicated in the regulation of body weight and metabolism, with studies showing that male mice lacking the gene develop adult-onset obesity, characterized by increased body weight and lipid mass, particularly under a high-fat diet. This suggests a role for NPBWR1 in energy homeostasis and metabolic disorders (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Ishii2003Targeted).

The gene is also associated with emotional and social behaviors. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in NPBWR1, resulting in an amino acid substitution, has been shown to influence emotional responses to facial expressions, potentially affecting social interactions and emotional processing (Watanabe2012A). This SNP may alter receptor function, impacting behavior and emotional responses (Watanabe2012A).

NPBWR1 is involved in pain modulation, particularly in inflammatory pain. Knockout mice exhibit increased sensitivity to inflammatory pain, indicating a role in pain perception and management (Sakurai2013NPBWR1). The gene's expression is increased in certain neuropathic pain conditions, suggesting its involvement in pain modulation (Guerrero2013SAR). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of NPBWR1 in conditions such as obesity, emotional disorders, and pain management.

## Interactions
NPBWR1, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts primarily with its endogenous ligands, neuropeptide B (NPB) and neuropeptide W (NPW). These interactions are crucial for the receptor's role in various physiological processes. NPBWR1 is known to couple with the Gi-class of G-proteins, which suggests that it has inhibitory effects on neurons, likely through the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels (Sakurai2013NPBWR1; Hondo2024The). This coupling is facilitated by a conserved DRY motif, which is important for G-protein interaction (Sakurai2013NPBWR1).

NPBWR1 is expressed in GABAergic neurons in the central amygdala, where it acts as an inhibitory regulator. This interaction affects the function of these neurons, influencing fear-related behaviors and emotional responses (NagataKuroiwa2011Critical). The receptor's role in modulating amygdala output during stress and social interactions is significant, as evidenced by the altered behaviors observed in Npbwr1 knockout mice (NagataKuroiwa2011Critical).

No synthetic antagonists or agonists have been developed that are selective for NPBWR1, indicating a gap in the understanding of its broader interaction network (Hondo2024The).
