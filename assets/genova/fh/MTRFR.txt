# MTRFR

## Overview
The MTRFR gene encodes the mitochondrial translation release factor in rescue, a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein is involved in the termination phase of mitochondrial translation, ensuring the proper release of newly synthesized polypeptides from the ribosome. As a mitochondrial translation release factor, it is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. Mutations or dysregulation of the MTRFR gene can have significant implications for cellular metabolism and are associated with various mitochondrial disorders. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which MTRFR operates is critical for elucidating its role in mitochondrial biology and its potential impact on human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
