# MIS12

## Overview
The MIS12 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the kinetochore complex, specifically categorized as a structural protein within the KMN network, which is crucial for chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein product, known as the MIS12 kinetochore complex component, forms part of a tetrameric assembly with other subunits, including NNF1, DSN1, and NSL1, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the kinetochore (Petrovic2010The; Yatskevich2023Structure). This complex plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome alignment and segregation by facilitating the attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules, thereby maintaining genomic stability during mitosis (Petrovic2010The; Kline2006The). The MIS12 complex also serves as a protein interaction hub, engaging with other kinetochore components and regulatory proteins, which underscores its importance in cell cycle progression and its potential implications in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders (Petrovic2010The; Takeshita2019Antigendriven).

## Structure
The MIS12 kinetochore complex component is a crucial part of the KMN network, which is essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. The MIS12 complex (MIS12C) is composed of four subunits: NNF1, MIS12, DSN1, and NSL1, forming a rod-like structure with NNF1 and NSL1 at opposite ends (Petrovic2010The). The complex is characterized by a tetrameric coiled coil with two head domains, Head-1 and Head-2, which are closely aligned and stabilized by the N-terminal segment of Dsn1 (Yatskevich2023Structure).

The MIS12C structure includes rigid interfaces with the NDC80C and KNL1C complexes, forming a prong-shaped assembly crucial for kinetochore function (Yatskevich2023Structure). The Dsn1 subunit plays a key role in the auto-inhibition of MIS12C, with specific serine residues (Ser100 and Ser109) undergoing phosphorylation to regulate interactions with the inner kinetochore (Yatskevich2023Structure). The C-terminal regions of Dsn1 and Nsl1 are important for binding to other kinetochore components, such as the Spc24-Spc25 and Knl1 RWD domains (Yatskevich2023Structure). These structural features and interactions are critical for the assembly and function of the kinetochore.

## Function
The MIS12 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the kinetochore complex, which is essential for chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis in human cells. The MIS12 complex, composed of subunits including hDsn1, hNnf1, hNsl1, and hMis12, localizes to the inner kinetochores and is necessary for the proper attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules, facilitating chromosome biorientation and segregation (Petrovic2010The; Kline2006The).

MIS12 acts as a protein interaction hub within the kinetochore, interacting with other complexes such as NDC80 and KNL1, which are part of the KMN network. This network is crucial for forming load-bearing attachments between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation (Petrovic2010The). The stability and proper assembly of the MIS12 complex are supported by the chaperone activity of Hsp90-Sgt1, which is necessary for efficient kinetochore-microtubule binding site formation (Davies2010Hsp90–Sgt1).

The MIS12 complex also plays a role in recruiting other kinetochore proteins, such as SPC24-SPC25 and KNL1, and is involved in the localization of checkpoint components like BUB1, contributing to genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Petrovic2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MIS12 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cellular senescence. MIS12 is a component of the kinetochore complex, essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division. Dysregulation of MIS12 can lead to chromosomal instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. In cancer cells, such as human colon cancer HCT-116 cells, the down-regulation of MIS12 by benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) leads to cell cycle arrest and enhances apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (AbeKanoh2019Yeast).

In the context of cellular senescence, MIS12 plays a crucial role in maintaining cell proliferation. Studies have shown that depletion of MIS12 accelerates senescence in human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMPCs), leading to reduced cell proliferation and increased senescence markers (Zhang2022FTO). This suggests that MIS12 is important in counteracting premature aging and maintaining cellular function.

Additionally, MIS12 has been identified as a novel autoantigen in autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren's syndrome, where autoantibodies target the MIS12 complex in salivary glands (Takeshita2019Antigendriven). This highlights its potential involvement in autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
The MIS12 kinetochore complex component is involved in several critical interactions essential for kinetochore function and chromosome segregation. It is a part of the KMN network, which includes the KNL1 and NDC80 complexes, and plays a key role in connecting the kinetochore to the mitotic spindle by interacting with CENP-C, a component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) (Petrovic2016Structure). The interaction between MIS12 and CENP-C is crucial for proper chromosome segregation, and this interaction is regulated by Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates DSN1 to enhance the binding (Petrovic2016Structure).

MIS12 also interacts with the NDC80 complex, forming a tight binary complex even in the absence of KNL1, indicating that the KNL1-binding region of NSL1 is not necessary for high-affinity binding to NDC80C (Petrovic2010The). The MIS12 complex acts as a protein interaction hub, facilitating the assembly of the outer kinetochore by interacting with multiple components, including NDC80C (Petrovic2010The).

Additionally, MIS12 interacts with Hsp90 and Sgt1, which are crucial for the stability and assembly of the complex. Sgt1 enhances the association of the MIS12 complex with Hsp90, and their interaction is important for the efficient formation of kinetochore-microtubule binding sites (Davies2010Hsp90–Sgt1).
