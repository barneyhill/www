# POTEB

## Overview
The POTEB gene encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member B, which is part of the POTE family of proteins characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains. These proteins are typically involved in protein-protein interactions and are implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and structural organization. The POTEB gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with notable expression in reproductive tissues, suggesting a potential role in reproductive biology. The protein's ankyrin domains facilitate its interaction with other cellular components, potentially influencing cellular architecture and function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
