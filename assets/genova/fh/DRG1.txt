# DRG1

## Overview
The DRG1 gene encodes the developmentally regulated GTP binding protein 1, a member of the GTPase superfamily, which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as microtubule dynamics and cell division. The DRG1 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a GTP-binding domain, which is crucial for its GTPase activity, and a TGS domain involved in protein interactions. It forms a complex with the DRG family regulatory protein 1 (DFRP1), which enhances its stability and function. DRG1 is involved in stabilizing microtubules, influencing spindle dynamics during mitosis, and interacting with nucleic acids, suggesting a role in translation regulation. Clinically, mutations in the DRG1 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and its expression levels are associated with various cancers, where it can act as both a tumor promoter and suppressor depending on the context (Schellhaus2017Developmentally; Westrip2022Inactivation; Bandyopadhyay2006The).

## Structure
The human DRG1 protein is a member of the GTPase superfamily and is characterized by several conserved domains. It contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, a canonical GTP-binding domain (G-domain) with five characteristic motifs (G1-G5), an S5D2L insertion domain, and a C-terminal TGS domain (Westrip2021Developmentally; Beljan2022Structure). The G-domain is responsible for its intrinsic GTPase activity, which is enhanced by potassium ions and its binding partner, DFRP1 (Westrip2021Developmentally; Beljan2022Structure).

The HTH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and contains a conserved lysine residue that is hydroxylated by the enzyme JMJD7, a post-translational modification important for DRG1's function (Westrip2021Developmentally). The S5D2L domain is typically found in RNA/DNA binding proteins, and the TGS domain is involved in interactions with other proteins and may play a role in binding double-stranded DNA (Westrip2021Developmentally).

DRG1 forms a complex with DFRP1, which stabilizes the protein and prevents its degradation (Westrip2021Developmentally; Beljan2022Structure). The protein is predominantly monomeric and primarily localized in the cytosol (Beljan2022Structure). The human DRG1 gene contains eight introns, with six conserved from sponges to humans, indicating structural conservation (Beljan2022Structure).

## Function
The DRG1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics, which are essential for cell division and chromosome segregation in healthy human cells. DRG1 stabilizes microtubules by promoting their polymerization and bundling, a process that does not require GTP hydrolysis but does require the full-length protein (Schellhaus2017Developmentally). It binds directly to microtubules, interacting with them through multiple regions, including the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, the GTPase domain, and the C-terminal TGS domain (Schellhaus2017Developmentally). DRG1's binding to microtubules is facilitated by its positively charged surface, which interacts with the negatively charged C-terminus of tubulin (Schellhaus2017Developmentally).

In HeLa cells, DRG1 influences spindle dynamics, and its downregulation extends the time from prophase to anaphase onset, resulting in asymmetric spindle formations during mitosis (Schellhaus2017Developmentally). DRG1 is also involved in microtubule stabilization, preventing their disassembly even under cold conditions, which typically cause microtubules to disassemble (Schellhaus2017Developmentally). The protein is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it interacts with its binding partner DFRP1, which stabilizes DRG1 and prevents its degradation (Westrip2021Developmentally; Dominko2023Transfection).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DRG1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. DRG1 mutations, particularly rare germline variants such as stop-gained mutations (p.Gly54*, p.Arg140*, p.Lys263*) and a missense variant (p.Asn248Phe), have been linked to a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. This disorder is characterized by global developmental delay, microcephaly, short stature, and craniofacial anomalies. These mutations disrupt DRG1 mRNA/protein stability, impair its GTPase activity, and compromise its binding to the partner protein ZC3H15, which is crucial for normal development (Westrip2022Inactivation).

In cancer, DRG1 is implicated in various types, including lung adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and melanoma. Overexpression of DRG1 in lung adenocarcinoma is associated with increased cell proliferation, while its knockdown results in decreased proliferation and increased cell cycle arrest. In osteosarcoma, DRG1 expression correlates with tumor size and progression, and its knockdown reduces cell viability and increases apoptosis. In melanoma, DRG1 knockdown reduces cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting its role in oncogenesis (Westrip2021Developmentally).

DRG1 also acts as a tumor metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer by downregulating the expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which is associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis (Bandyopadhyay2006The).

## Interactions
DRG1 interacts with the DRG family regulatory protein 1 (DFRP1) to form a complex that stabilizes DRG1 and prevents its degradation. This interaction is crucial for DRG1's function and is conserved across species, including sponges and humans. The DRG1:DFRP1 complex typically assembles in a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4, differing from previous assumptions of a 1:1 ratio (Beljan2022Structure). DFRP1 enhances the intrinsic GTPase activity of DRG1 and increases its thermal stability and affinity for potassium ions, although it does not act as a classical GTPase activating protein (GAP) (Westrip2021Developmentally).

DRG1 also binds nonspecifically to RNA and DNA, forming complexes with both single-stranded and double-stranded circular DNA. A potential nucleic acid binding site has been identified at the interface of the HTH and S5D2L domains, forming an electropositive groove typical of RNA/DNA binding proteins (Beljan2022Structure). This binding capability suggests a role in nucleic acid interactions, which may be relevant to its function in cellular processes such as translation regulation and microtubule dynamics (Beljan2022Structure).
