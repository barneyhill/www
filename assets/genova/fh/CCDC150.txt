# CCDC150

## Overview
CCDC150 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 150 protein, which is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the mitotic cell cycle. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its co-localization with ɣ-tubulin, a key centrosomal marker, during mitosis. This suggests a role in centrosome organization and function, which is critical for accurate cell division (Giotti2018Assembly). The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with several diseases, including gastric and prostate cancers, as well as Huntington's disease, indicating its potential significance in both oncogenic processes and neurodegenerative conditions (Yoon2013Comprehensive; Mitchell2020Longitudinal; Chen2022CCNB1). Despite its recognized importance, the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving CCDC150 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research to clarify its role in health and disease.

## Function
CCDC150 is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in the human mitotic cell cycle, particularly during the S/G2-M phase. The protein is suggested to play a role in centrosomal function, as it co-localizes with ɣ-tubulin, a centrosomal marker, during different stages of mitosis. This localization indicates that CCDC150 may be involved in the organization or function of centrosomes, which are crucial for proper cell division (Giotti2018Assembly).

RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown assays have shown that reducing CCDC150 expression can lead to abnormalities in the size and shape of nuclei, suggesting a role in maintaining nuclear structure during cell division. These findings imply that CCDC150 might have non-redundant functions in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, although its exact role in healthy human cells requires further validation (Giotti2018Assembly).

The protein's involvement in centrosomal activities and its potential impact on cell proliferation highlight its importance in cellular processes, although the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways remain to be fully elucidated (Giotti2018Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC150 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression. In Korean gastric cancers, CCDC150 exhibits a high mutational frequency, particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gastric cancer tissues, where it is associated with frameshift mutations. These mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis by inactivating or causing dysfunction in target genes, highlighting the gene's potential role in gastric carcinogenesis (Yoon2013Comprehensive).

In prostate cancer, CCDC150 is identified as a hub gene associated with resistance to vinblastine, a chemotherapy drug. The gene is upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) samples, influencing distant metastasis and affecting overall survival in prostate cancer patients. Alterations in CCDC150 expression are linked to prostate cancer progression and resistance to treatment, although its specific role in these processes requires further investigation (Chen2022CCNB1).

In Huntington's disease, CCDC150 is listed among the top probesets with a strong correlation to disease progression, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's pathophysiology, although specific mutations or conditions associated with CCDC150 in this context are not detailed (Mitchell2020Longitudinal).
