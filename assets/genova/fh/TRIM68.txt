# TRIM68

## Overview
TRIM68 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 68, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This family is characterized by a conserved domain architecture that includes a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, collectively known as the RBCC motif. TRIM68 functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, which is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including immune responses and protein homeostasis (Wynne2014TRIM68; Esposito2017Structural). The protein is involved in the negative regulation of type I interferon production and modulates the NF-kB signaling pathway, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining immune balance (Wynne2014TRIM68). Additionally, TRIM68 has been implicated in several cancers, acting as an oncogene in prostate cancer and serving as a potential biomarker in osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer (Nie2023RNA; Jiang2021TRIM68; Tan2017Lentivirusmediated).

## Structure
TRIM68 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes an N-terminal RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, collectively known as the RBCC motif. These domains are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins (Wynne2014TRIM68; Esposito2017Structural). The C-terminal region of TRIM68 contains a PRY/SPRY domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions and immune regulation (Wynne2014TRIM68).

The RING domain of TRIM68 is essential for its catalytic activity, enabling the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins. This domain's activity is often dependent on dimerization, which is mediated by the coiled-coil region (Esposito2017Structural). TRIM68 shares structural similarities with TRIM21, including a high sequence similarity score, suggesting a possible gene duplication event (Wynne2014TRIM68).

TRIM68 is involved in the negative regulation of IFN-β production by targeting the TRK-fused gene (TFG) for lysosomal degradation, a process that is enhanced by polyubiquitination (Wynne2014TRIM68). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of TRIM68 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
TRIM68 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which plays a crucial role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. In healthy human cells, TRIM68 is involved in regulating immune responses, particularly through its interaction with the TRK fused gene (TFG). TRIM68 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal degradation of TFG, a positive regulator of type I interferon (IFN) production, thereby negatively regulating IFN-β production. This activity is crucial for maintaining a balanced immune response, preventing excessive inflammation that could lead to autoimmune conditions (Wynne2014TRIM68).

TRIM68 also influences the NF-kB signaling pathway, acting at a crosstalk point between pathways controlling type I IFN production and NF-kB activation. By modulating these pathways, TRIM68 helps regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to the immune system's ability to respond to viral infections without triggering excessive inflammatory responses (Wynne2014TRIM68).

TRIM68 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences transcriptional regulation and cellular stress responses. Its activity is largely dependent on its RING domain, which is essential for its E3 ligase function (Wynne2014TRIM68).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM68 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, TRIM68 acts as an oncogene, promoting cancer progression through its interaction with the RNA-binding protein YTHDF1. Knockdown of TRIM68 leads to decreased androgen receptor levels and reduced tumor growth, while its overexpression can reverse these effects, suggesting its critical role in prostate cancer progression (Nie2023RNA).

In osteosarcoma, TRIM68 is significantly overexpressed compared to normal tissues, and its high expression is associated with poorer prognosis. It is considered a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma prognosis, possibly influencing autophagy and immune response pathways (Jiang2021TRIM68).

TRIM68 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its knockdown inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tan2017Lentivirusmediated). Additionally, TRIM68 is involved in immune regulation, acting as a negative regulator of type I interferon production by targeting the TRK-fused gene for degradation, which may have implications in autoimmune diseases (Wynne2014TRIM68).

## Interactions
TRIM68 is known to interact with the TRK fused gene (TFG), a novel regulator of IFN-β production. This interaction is enhanced following poly(I:C) stimulation, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of TFG. TRIM68 targets TFG for degradation via lysosomal pathways, a process that is not entirely dependent on K48- or K63-linked ubiquitin chains, suggesting the involvement of mixed or alternative linkages (Wynne2014TRIM68). The degradation of TFG by TRIM68 is confirmed by the accumulation of TFG when lysosomal degradation is inhibited, but not when proteasomal degradation is inhibited (Wynne2014TRIM68).

TRIM68's interaction with TFG plays a significant role in negatively regulating IFN-β production. TFG acts as a positive regulator of IFN-β, and its overexpression in HeLa cells increases RANTES release, supporting its role in the type I IFN response. TRIM68's negative effect on IFN-β production is partly dependent on its RING domain, which is crucial for its E3 ligase activity (Wynne2014TRIM68). Knockdown of TRIM68 in human monocytes leads to increased levels of both IFN-β mRNA and TFG protein, indicating that TRIM68 limits type I IFN production by targeting TFG for degradation (Wynne2014TRIM68).
