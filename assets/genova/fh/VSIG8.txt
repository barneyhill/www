# VSIG8

## Overview
VSIG8 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 8, which is a type I transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation and cellular adhesion. The protein is characterized by its two Ig-like V-type domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, and is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the spleen, CD3+ T cells, and various epithelial structures (Zhou2022VSet; Shekari2023VISTA). Functionally, VSIG8 acts as a co-inhibitory ligand, interacting with the immune regulatory protein VISTA to modulate T cell activity by inhibiting T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production (Zhou2022VSet; Shekari2023VISTA). This interaction positions VSIG8 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and autoimmune diseases, although some studies have reported conflicting results regarding its binding with VISTA (SmorodinskyAtias2024On; Wang2018VSIG‐3). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance and therapeutic potential of VSIG8 in immune regulation and disease contexts (Zhou2022VSet).

## Function
VSIG8 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune regulation and cellular adhesion processes. The protein is a type I transmembrane protein with two Ig-like V-type domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. It is predominantly expressed in the spleen, CD3+ T cells of peripheral blood, hair follicles, oral epithelium, and nail matrix (Zhou2022VSet; Shekari2023VISTA). In stratified epithelial cells, VSIG8 plays a role in maintaining tight junctions, which are crucial for the integrity and function of epithelial barriers (Shekari2023VISTA).

VSIG8 functions as a co-inhibitory ligand in regulating T cell activity. It interacts with VISTA, a protein involved in immune checkpoint pathways, to inhibit T cell activation and proliferation, as well as cytokine and chemokine production. This interaction suppresses the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, indicating its role as a negative regulator of T-cell responses (Zhou2022VSet; Shekari2023VISTA). The expression of VSIG8 in healthy tissues like the hair shaft and oral epithelium suggests it may contribute to maintaining tissue homeostasis, although specific functions in these tissues are not fully detailed (Zhou2022VSet).

## Clinical Significance
VSIG8 is a member of the VSIG family of proteins, which are involved in immune regulation and have potential roles in cancer immunotherapy. Alterations in VSIG8 expression have been associated with certain cancers, including head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer (Zhou2022VSet). The protein is characterized by its ability to suppress T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, acting as a negative regulator of T-cell responses. This function suggests that changes in VSIG8 expression could impact immune responses in cancer (Zhou2022VSet).

VSIG8 is also a putative binding partner of VISTA, another immune regulatory protein. While some studies have reported suppressive effects on T cells through this interaction, other studies have suggested no interaction between human VSIG8 and VISTA (Zhou2022VSet). The potential role of VSIG8 in cancer immunotherapy is highlighted by findings that a fusion protein containing VSIG8 can stimulate T-cell activation and antitumor activity, indicating its possible use as a target for immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Zhou2022VSet). However, the full clinical significance of VSIG8, including specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from its gene mutations or expression alterations, remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
VSIG8, a member of the VSIG family, is known to interact with the immune regulatory protein VISTA. This interaction has been shown to have inhibitory effects on T cell activation and function. Specifically, VSIG8 acts as a co-inhibitory ligand, binding to activated T cells and significantly inhibiting T cell proliferation and cytokine production. This interaction also suppresses the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, which are crucial for immune responses (Zhou2022VSet; Shekari2023VISTA).

The interaction between VSIG8 and VISTA has been confirmed by multiple studies, although some research has reported conflicting results. For instance, some studies using different methodologies did not observe binding between VSIG8 and VISTA, suggesting variability in experimental outcomes (SmorodinskyAtias2024On; Wang2018VSIG‐3). Despite these discrepancies, the potential of targeting the VSIG8/VISTA pathway for therapeutic purposes in cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases has been suggested (Shekari2023VISTA).

VSIG8's role as an immune checkpoint molecule is still under investigation, with further research needed to fully understand its interactions and functions in immune regulation (Zhou2022VSet).
