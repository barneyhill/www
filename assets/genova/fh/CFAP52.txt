# CFAP52

## Overview
CFAP52 is a gene that encodes the protein cilia and flagella associated protein 52, also known as WDR16, which is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its WD-repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the assembly and stabilization of protein complexes within cellular structures such as cilia and flagella (Tapia2020The). CFAP52 is primarily localized to the centrosome, basal body, and spindle poles in somatic cells, and it plays a significant role in the formation and stability of sperm tail structures, which is essential for male fertility (Tapia2020The). Additionally, CFAP52 is involved in ciliary function, particularly in the organization of outer dynein arms, which are vital for ciliary motility (Dougherty2020CFAP45). Mutations in the CFAP52 gene have been linked to male infertility and other clinical conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper cellular and organismal function (Jin2023Identification).

## Structure
The CFAP52 protein, also known as WDR16, is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family, characterized by its WD-repeat domains. These domains are repetitive motifs that form a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Tapia2020The). The full-length isoform of CFAP52 consists of 620 amino acids, while alternative splicing produces two other isoforms: CFAP52-X1 with 577 amino acids and CFAP52-203 with 342 amino acids (Tapia2020The). The WD-repeat regions are located between amino acids 60 to 195 and 328 to 620 in the full-length isoform (Tapia2020The).

The protein's structure includes two WD-repeat regions, which are important for its function and localization to cellular structures such as the centrosome and basal body (Tapia2020The). These regions are involved in the assembly and stabilization of protein complexes, particularly in the sperm tail and centrosomal matrix (Tapia2020The). The N-terminal end of the CFAP52-X1 isoform, consisting of 309 amino acids, was artificially cloned, suggesting its potential role in centrosomal recruitment (Tapia2020The). The protein's interaction with other axonemal components, such as SPATA6, further indicates its role in maintaining the stability of sperm structures (Jin2023Identification).

## Function
CFAP52, also known as WDR16, is a protein that plays a significant role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. It is a member of the WD40-protein family, characterized by WD-repeat domains, which are involved in various biological functions such as RNA synthesis, signal transduction, and cytoskeleton assembly (Tapia2020The). CFAP52 is primarily localized to the centrosome, basal body, and spindle poles in somatic cells, and it is highly expressed in testis, where it localizes to the manchette and flagellum in male germ cells (Tapia2020The). This localization suggests its involvement in sperm tail formation and stability, which is crucial for male fertility (Tapia2020The).

In respiratory cells, CFAP52 is associated with ciliary function, particularly in the organization of outer dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility (Dougherty2020CFAP45). The protein interacts with other ciliary proteins, such as CFAP45, and is involved in energy metabolism processes, including nucleotide binding, which is vital for maintaining nucleotide balance in ciliary and flagellar structures (Dougherty2020CFAP45). CFAP52's role in these cellular structures underscores its importance in maintaining proper cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP52 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly conditions such as asthenoteratospermia, which is characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology. These mutations lead to defects in the sperm head-tail connection and flagella development, resulting in structural abnormalities like acephalic spermatozoa and multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) (Jin2023Identification). In a study involving a Chinese infertile man, compound heterozygous variants of CFAP52 were identified, linking these mutations to male infertility (Jin2023Identification).

CFAP52 mutations have also been implicated in situs anomalies, such as situs inversus totalis, and mild chronic upper respiratory symptoms, although these individuals did not meet the full criteria for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) (Dougherty2020CFAP45). In Cfap52-knockout mice, the absence of CFAP52 resulted in hydrocephalus and male infertility, supporting its role in sperm development and ciliary function (Jin2023Identification). The gene's interaction with SPATA6 is crucial for the stability of sperm structures, and its deficiency leads to reduced expression of proteins involved in sperm flagella structure (Jin2023Identification).

## Interactions
CFAP52 is known to interact with a variety of proteins, particularly those involved in ciliary and flagellar functions. It has been shown to interact with SPATA6, a protein essential for the formation of major sperm structures, and this interaction is crucial for the stability of SPATA6. This was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells and mouse testis lysates (Jin2023Identification). CFAP52 also interacts with components of the axoneme, including microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) such as CFAP45, and outer dynein arms like DNAI1 and DNAH11. These interactions are important for the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella (Dougherty2020CFAP45; Jin2023Identification).

CFAP52 is associated with the dynein regulatory complex, specifically interacting with DRC10 (also known as CFAP84), and shares interactions with CFAP45, including intermediate chain dynein DNAI1 and AK8. Recombinant CFAP52 has been shown to immunoprecipitate both AK8 and DNAI1 following co-expression in HEK293 cells (Dougherty2020CFAP45). High-resolution imaging has demonstrated the colocalization of CFAP52 with DNAH11 in the proximal region of respiratory cilia, indicating a close functional relationship (Dougherty2020CFAP45). These interactions highlight CFAP52's role in the assembly and function of ciliary structures.
