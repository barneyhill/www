# CNPY2

## Overview
CNPY2, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cellular stress management. The protein, categorized as a signaling regulator, plays a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by modulating the PERK-CHOP pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Hong2017CNPY2). Beyond its role in stress response, CNPY2 is implicated in promoting neurite outgrowth, angiogenesis, and preventing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, highlighting its significance in cellular differentiation and survival (Hong2017CNPY2). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are also linked to various cancers, where they influence tumor progression and chemoresistance, making CNPY2 a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Yu2018CNPY2; Wang2019miR‑30a‑3p).

## Function
CNPY2, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical cellular mechanism for managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In healthy human cells, CNPY2 is involved in the PERK-CHOP pathway, a component of the UPR. Under non-stress conditions, CNPY2 is bound to grp78, but during ER stress, it dissociates and binds to protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), facilitating its activation. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of eIF2α, a downstream target in the UPR, which leads to the induction of the transcription factor CHOP (Hong2017CNPY2).

CNPY2 is transcriptionally upregulated by CHOP, enhancing UPR signaling and helping cells manage protein stress. This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress conditions (Hong2017CNPY2). CNPY2 is also involved in other cellular processes, such as promoting neurite outgrowth and angiogenesis, and preventing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, indicating its broader role in cellular differentiation and survival (Hong2017CNPY2). The protein is active in the ER, where it influences the activity of the PERK pathway, contributing to the cellular response to unfolded proteins (Hong2017CNPY2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CNPY2 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CNPY2 isoform 2 has been identified as a potential biomarker for early detection. Serum levels of this isoform are significantly higher in CRC patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting its utility in diagnosis, particularly when combined with other markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (Peng2018Serum).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CNPY2 is associated with tumor progression. It promotes RCC cell proliferation by upregulating the TP53 gene, which, contrary to its typical tumor-suppressing role, appears to enhance tumor growth in this context (Taniguchi2017CNPY2).

CNPY2 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to chemoresistance against cisplatin by inhibiting apoptosis through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This overexpression is linked to poor survival outcomes, making CNPY2 a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Yu2018CNPY2).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), CNPY2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis, and is regulated by miR-30a-3p, which suppresses its expression (Wang2019miR‑30a‑3p).

## Interactions
CNPY2 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cellular pathways. It is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by interacting with the UPR sensor PERK. CNPY2 binds directly to the luminal domain of PERK, initiating the PERK-CHOP pathway, which is crucial for managing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This interaction is facilitated by conserved cysteine residues in CNPY2, and it enhances the phosphorylation activity of PERK on its substrate eIF2α (Hong2017CNPY2).

Under non-stress conditions, CNPY2 interacts with the chaperone grp78, but this interaction diminishes upon ER stress induction. CNPY2 competes with grp78 for binding to PERK, suggesting that these proteins do not form a trimeric complex (Hong2017CNPY2).

In prostate cancer cells, CNPY2 inhibits the ubiquitination activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MYLIP, which targets the androgen receptor (AR) for degradation. CNPY2 prevents the interaction between MYLIP and the E2 enzyme UBE2D1, thereby stabilizing AR protein levels and promoting the expression of AR target genes (Ito2018CNPY2).

CNPY2 also interacts with MYLIP/IDOL, counteracting its effects on low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation, thereby influencing cholesterol metabolism (Do2012Fibroblast).
