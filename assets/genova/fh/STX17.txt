# STX17

## Overview
STX17 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 17, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family, which is integral to membrane fusion processes within cells. Syntaxin 17 is characterized by its unique structural features, including two tandem transmembrane domains that form a hairpin-like structure, distinguishing it from other SNARE proteins (Itakura2012The). This protein plays a pivotal role in autophagy, particularly in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and stress response (Itakura2012The). Syntaxin 17 also participates in mitochondrial quality control by mediating the fusion of mitochondrial-derived vesicles with endolysosomes (McLelland2016Syntaxin-17). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sundström2012Copy; he2022Integrated).

## Structure
Syntaxin 17 (STX17) is a SNARE protein characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes two tandem transmembrane domains (TMDs) forming a hairpin-like structure. This configuration is distinct from conventional SNARE proteins, which typically have a single TMD (Itakura2012The). The TMDs of STX17 contain glycine zipper-like motifs, characterized by repeated GXXXG sequences, which facilitate the close packing of transmembrane helices and contribute to the protein's hairpin structure (Itakura2012The; Hegedűs2013Evolutionarily).

STX17 also features an N-terminal Habc domain and a SNARE domain, with both the N- and C-terminal ends facing the cytosol (Shinoda2024Syntaxin). The C-terminal region contains positively charged residues, such as lysine and arginine, which are crucial for its localization to autophagosomes through electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membranes (Shinoda2024Syntaxin).

In terms of quaternary structure, STX17 interacts with other SNARE proteins, forming complexes with SNAP29 and VAMP8, which are essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jiang2014The; Itakura2012The). The interaction with these proteins is mediated by the SNARE domain, which is critical for the formation of the SNARE complex (Saleeb2019A).

## Function
Syntaxin 17 (STX17) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in the autophagic process, particularly in the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes and lysosomes. This fusion is essential for the degradation of autophagosomal contents, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Itakura2012The). STX17 is specifically recruited to the outer membrane of completed autophagosomes, where it interacts with SNAP-29 and VAMP8 to form a SNARE complex necessary for membrane fusion (Itakura2012The).

STX17 is also involved in the turnover of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), where it forms a ternary SNARE complex with SNAP29 and VAMP7. This complex is crucial for the fusion of MDVs with endolysosomes, a process important for mitochondrial quality control (McLelland2016Syntaxin-17). The protein's localization to the autophagosome is facilitated by its unique hairpin-like structure formed by its tandem transmembrane domains (Itakura2012The).

STX17's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and deacetylation, which are crucial for its recruitment to membranes and interaction with other proteins involved in autophagosome maturation (Shen2020Acetylation). These processes underscore STX17's essential role in autophagy and cellular quality control.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the STX17 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), STX17 expression is significantly reduced, which may contribute to the disease's progression by impairing autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical process for autophagic flux and amyloid-beta clearance (he2022Integrated). This downregulation highlights STX17 as a potential therapeutic target in AD (he2022Integrated).

In the context of retinal health, STX17 is upregulated in response to oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, suggesting its role in preventing age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Dysregulation of STX17 expression is also linked to retinoblastoma formation, with upregulation observed in retinoblastoma cell lines (Tebbe2024The).

STX17 is also associated with congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED), where its upregulation is observed in corneal endothelial cells depleted of SLC4A11, indicating its role in mitigating cellular stress by mediating the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria (Tebbe2024The).

In Grey horses, a duplication in the STX17 gene is linked to melanoma, with higher copy numbers observed in aggressive tumors, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Sundström2012Copy).

## Interactions
Syntaxin 17 (STX17) is a SNARE protein that plays a crucial role in autophagy by facilitating the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. STX17 interacts with several proteins to form a functional SNARE complex. It binds with SNAP29 and VAMP8, which are essential for the fusion process between autophagosomes and lysosomes (Itakura2012The; Hegedűs2013Evolutionarily). The interaction with VAMP8 is particularly enhanced under starvation conditions, indicating its role in stress-induced autophagy (Itakura2012The).

STX17 also interacts with components of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, such as VPS33A and VPS16, which are necessary for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Jiang2014The). The interaction with VPS33A is mediated by a specific binding motif on STX17, which is crucial for autophagy completion (Saleeb2019A).

In the context of mitophagy, STX17 interacts with Fis1, a mitochondrial protein, to regulate the degradation of mitochondria. This interaction is independent of the PINK1/Parkin pathway and involves the recruitment of ATG14 to mitochondria-associated membranes (Xian2019STX17). The N-terminal domain of STX17 is essential for its interaction with Fis1 and the initiation of mitophagy (Xian2019STX17).
