# PRRC1

## Overview
The PRRC1 gene encodes the proline-rich coiled-coil 1 protein, which is characterized by its structural domains that suggest a role in protein-protein interactions. While the precise biological functions of the PRRC1 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in cellular processes that may involve the regulation of gene expression and cellular signaling pathways. Notably, PRRC1 has been identified in chromosomal translocations with the MLL gene, particularly in cases of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL), indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic processes (DouetGuilbert2014MLL). The fusion of PRRC1 with MLL in these translocations suggests a disruption of normal cellular functions, contributing to leukemogenesis and highlighting the gene's clinical significance in cancer biology (DouetGuilbert2014MLL). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional roles of PRRC1 and its encoded protein in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
The PRRC1 gene has been identified as a novel partner in chromosomal translocations involving the MLL gene, particularly in cases of secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL). This translocation, specifically t(5;11)(q23-31;q23), results in the fusion of the MLL and PRRC1 genes, which has been observed in patients who developed sALL following chemotherapy for other cancers, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The presence of the MLL-PRRC1 fusion gene is associated with the disruption of normal MLL gene function, which plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (DouetGuilbert2014MLL).

The clinical significance of PRRC1 in these translocations is underscored by its potential role in the molecular mechanisms underlying therapy-induced leukemias. The majority of patients with sALL and MLL rearrangements had previously received topoisomerase II inhibitors, which are known to induce such genetic alterations (DouetGuilbert2014MLL). While the specific clinical outcomes related to PRRC1 interactions are not extensively detailed, its involvement in MLL rearrangements suggests a contribution to the pathogenesis of certain leukemias, highlighting the need for further research into its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
