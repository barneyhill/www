# KLHL42

## Overview
KLHL42 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 42, which is part of the kelch-like family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs, which facilitate its role as a ubiquitin E3 ligase. As a ubiquitin E3 ligase, kelch-like family member 42 is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular regulation and protein turnover. It functions as a substrate adaptor within the Cullin-3 E3 ligase complex, impacting various cellular processes such as fibrotic signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit epsilon (PPP2R5e). This interaction is significant in the context of systemic sclerosis, where the protein's activity contributes to pro-fibrotic signaling. Additionally, kelch-like family member 42 is implicated in other cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation and microtubule formation, through its interactions with proteins like retinoblastoma protein (pRB1) and KATNA1 (Lear2020Kelchlike).

## Structure
KLHL42 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, a BACK domain, and five to six Kelch motifs. These domains are integral to the protein's function, facilitating dimerization, substrate recognition, and protein-protein interactions through the formation of a β-propeller structure (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Dhanoa2013Update).

The BTB domain of KLHL42 is involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins, although it has been noted to have a poor e-value compared to Keap1, indicating a weaker match (Shilovsky2023Regulation). The Kelch motifs contribute to the protein's tertiary structure by forming a β-propeller, which is a common feature in the KLHL family (Shilovsky2023Regulation).

KLHL42 has been identified as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, playing a role in the ubiquitination process, which is a post-translational modification critical for protein degradation and cellular regulation (Lear2020Kelchlike). This function is particularly relevant in the context of systemic sclerosis, where KLHL42 is involved in pro-fibrotic signaling pathways (Lear2020Kelchlike). The protein's role in ubiquitination suggests it may interact with the Cullin-3 E3 ligase complex, engaging substrates for ubiquitination (Lear2020Kelchlike).

## Function
KLHL42, a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, functions as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-3 E3 ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In particular, KLHL42 is involved in the regulation of fibrotic signaling pathways, notably through its interaction with the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit epsilon (PPP2R5e). KLHL42 facilitates the poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PPP2R5e, which is a critical component in the regulation of fibrotic signaling. This interaction affects the TGF-β signaling pathway, a key pathway in fibrotic processes, by modulating the stability of PPP2R5e and thereby influencing the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Lear2020Kelchlike).

In healthy human cells, KLHL42's activity is significant in controlling fibrotic signaling through the targeted degradation of key proteins, which can impact cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The protein's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing pathological fibrosis (Lear2020Kelchlike; Dhanoa2013Update).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL42 is implicated in systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of connective tissues, particularly affecting the lungs. The protein encoded by KLHL42 acts as a profibrotic ubiquitin E3 ligase, which is involved in the regulation of fibrotic signaling pathways, notably the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway. In SSc, KLHL42 facilitates the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit epsilon (PPP2R5e), a critical component in fibrotic signaling regulation. This degradation leads to increased fibrotic signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis, particularly in the context of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (Lear2020Kelchlike).

Research suggests that knockdown of KLHL42 in SSc lung fibroblasts impairs TGF-β-dependent pro-fibrotic signaling, reduces fibrotic tissue production, and decreases SMAD activation, indicating its role as a profibrotic mediator (Lear2020Kelchlike). The findings propose that KLHL42 could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in fibrotic diseases, as targeting ubiquitin E3 ligases like KLHL42 may ameliorate pro-fibrotic signaling in SSc (Lear2020Kelchlike).

## Interactions
KLHL42, a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It functions as a substrate adaptor in the Cullin-3 E3 ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins. One of its key interactions is with the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit epsilon (PPP2R5e), where KLHL42 mediates the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of PPP2R5e, impacting fibrotic signaling pathways in systemic sclerosis (SSc) (Lear2020Kelchlike). KLHL42 also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRB1), leading to its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is enhanced by MYC overexpression, suggesting a role in regulating cell cycle progression and cancer development (Ma2024MYC).

KLHL42 is also involved in regulating cellular microtubule formation through its interaction with the neuronal migration and microtubule-severing protein KATNA1, as part of the Cul3 complex (Reitter2024A). Additionally, KLHL42 has been identified in interactions with several other proteins, including FAZF, ADSS1, TRAP1, A1U, and importin 4, which are involved in various cellular functions such as transcriptional repression, AMP synthesis, tumorigenesis, protein degradation, and nuclear transport (Reitter2024A).
