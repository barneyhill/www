# ACY1

## Overview
The ACY1 gene encodes the enzyme aminoacylase 1, a member of the M20 family of metalloenzymes, which plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of N-acylated amino acids into free amino acids and acyl groups. This zinc-binding enzyme is crucial for nitrogen metabolism and amino acid homeostasis, primarily expressed in the kidney's tubular epithelium (Lindner2008Nacetylamino; Cook1993Human). Structurally, aminoacylase 1 functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing a zinc ion essential for its catalytic activity (Lindner2000Mutational). The enzyme's activity is significant in cellular protein catabolism, preventing the accumulation of N-acetylated amino acids that could inhibit other enzymatic processes (Lindner2008Nacetylamino). Mutations in the ACY1 gene can lead to aminoacylase 1 deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder with variable clinical manifestations, including neurological symptoms (Mauri2023Menkes; Sass2006Mutations).

## Structure
The human aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) protein is a member of the M20 family of metalloenzymes and functions as a homodimer, with each subunit containing a single zinc ion essential for its activity (Lindner2000Mutational). The primary structure of ACY1 includes specific sequence motifs, such as PWW1 and PWW2, which are crucial for maintaining the enzyme's native conformation and stability (Lindner2000Mutational). The secondary structure of ACY1 is characterized by a typical carboxypeptidase A fold, consisting of an eight-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Lindner2003Essential).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional conformation, with the zinc-binding domain playing a critical role in catalysis. The quaternary structure of ACY1 is a homodimer, with dimerization being essential for its catalytic function (Lindner2003Essential). The enzyme contains a dinuclear zinc center, coordinated by specific residues such as His 80, Asp 113, Glu 148, Glu 175, and His 373, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lindner2003Essential).

The ACY1 protein also features a dimerization domain, which is essential for forming the homodimer and maintaining the enzyme's quaternary structure (Sommer2011The). The zinc-binding site is located within this domain, highlighting its importance in the enzyme's structural integrity and function (Sommer2011The).

## Function
Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is a zinc-binding enzyme that plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of N-acylated amino acids, converting them into free amino acids and acyl groups. This enzymatic activity is essential for the catabolism of intracellular proteins and peptides, contributing to nitrogen metabolism and maintaining amino acid homeostasis within cells (Lindner2008Nacetylamino; Cook1993Human). ACY1 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly in the tubular epithelium, where it is involved in the salvage of amino acids from N-acetylated proteins that have been reabsorbed (Lindner2008Nacetylamino).

The enzyme exhibits a preference for substrates with unbranched aliphatic side chains and short-chain N-acyl moieties, with high catalytic efficiency for N-acetylmethionine and N-acetylleucine (Lindner2008Nacetylamino). ACY1 activity is particularly significant in conditions of cellular protein catabolism, such as serum withdrawal, where it prevents the accumulation of N-acetylated amino acids that could inhibit other enzymatic activities (Lindner2008Nacetylamino). In healthy human cells, ACY1 is primarily cytosolic, and its activity is crucial for maintaining amino acid balance and supporting protein turnover (Cook1993Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACY1 gene, which encodes the enzyme aminoacylase 1, lead to aminoacylase 1 deficiency (ACY1D), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of N-acetylated amino acids in the urine, known as N-acetylamino aciduria (Sass2006Mutations). Clinical manifestations of ACY1D are highly variable, ranging from mild to severe neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability, motor delay, seizures, and autism-like features (Mauri2023Menkes; Alessandrì2018Four). Some patients may also exhibit dystonia, as seen in a 63-year-old woman with generalized dystonia linked to ACY1 mutations (Sass2015Expanding).

The disorder is diagnosed through the detection of elevated levels of N-acetylated amino acids in urine using techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Smolka2024Aminoacylase). Specific mutations, such as c.1057C>T (p.Arg353Cys), have been identified as causative of ACY1D (Mauri2023Menkes). Despite the biochemical abnormalities, the clinical presentation can be heterogeneous, with some individuals remaining asymptomatic (Sass2006Mutations). The variability in phenotypes suggests that ACY1D may not always manifest as a distinct disease but rather as a biochemical abnormality (Sass2006Mutations).

## Interactions
Aminoacylase 1 (ACY1) is known to interact with sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), a key enzyme involved in sphingolipid metabolism. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen, which revealed that the C-terminal fragment of ACY1 (CT-Acy1) interacts with SphK1. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro transcription-translation and GST pull-down assays, where [3H]-labeled CT-Acy1 specifically interacted with GST-SphK1 but not with GST alone. In HEK 293 cells, both CT-Acy1 and full-length ACY1 co-immunoprecipitated with SphK1, indicating a physical interaction in vivo. This suggests that ACY1 may influence SphK1's activity or its translocation to the plasma membrane (Maceyka2004Aminoacylase).

In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ACY1 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA MAGI2-AS3, which interacts with the transcription factor HEY1. MAGI2-AS3 binds to HEY1, reducing its enrichment at the ACY1 promoter region, thereby modulating ACY1 expression. This regulatory mechanism highlights the role of ACY1 in tumor progression and angiogenesis in ccRCC (Wang2021LncRNA).
