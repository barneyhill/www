# MACO1

## Overview
The MACO1 gene encodes the macoilin 1 protein, a transmembrane protein characterized by its multiple transmembrane and coiled-coil domains. These structural features suggest that macoilin 1 plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the integration and function within the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin; Miyara2011Novel). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance and potential involvement in fundamental biological functions (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin). Macoilin 1 is implicated in protein-protein interactions, likely facilitating the assembly or trafficking of other proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin). The gene produces different splice variant isoforms, MACO-1a and MACO-1b, which may have distinct roles or localization patterns, further underscoring the complexity and versatility of its function (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin).

## Structure
The MACO1 gene encodes the macoilin 1 protein, which is characterized by several structural features. The primary structure of MACO1 includes a sequence that forms multiple transmembrane domains towards the N-terminus and coiled-coil domains towards the C-terminus (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin; Miyara2011Novel). These domains are highly conserved across species, indicating their importance in the protein's function (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin).

The secondary structure of MACO1 is predicted to include five transmembrane domains and four coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its localization and function within the cell (Miyara2011Novel). The transmembrane domains are particularly important for the protein's integration into the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it is primarily localized (Miyara2011Novel).

The tertiary structure of MACO1 is not explicitly detailed in the context, but the presence of coiled-coil domains suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially facilitating the assembly or trafficking of other proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin).

MACO1 can exist in different splice variant isoforms, specifically MACO-1a and MACO-1b, which are 908 and 897 amino acids long, respectively (ArellanoCarbajal2011Macoilin). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles or localization patterns within the cell.
