# OR4K17

## Overview
The OR4K17 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily K member 17, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and discrimination of odor molecules. These receptors are predominantly located in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind to specific odorants and initiate a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The OR4K17 gene has been implicated in influencing dietary preferences, such as the consumption of raw vegetables, and has been associated with a preference for onions, highlighting its potential role in food preference traits (MayWilson2021Largescale; Cole2020Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
The OR4K17 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The OR4K17 gene has been associated with dietary habits, particularly the intake of raw vegetables, suggesting a genetic link between olfactory receptors and food preferences (Cole2020Comprehensive). Additionally, the OR4K17 gene has been identified as having a novel association with the liking of onions, indicating its role in food preference traits (MayWilson2021Largescale).

In terms of molecular function, olfactory receptors like OR4K17 are involved in the detection of chemical stimuli related to the sense of smell. They are part of a complex system that allows for the discrimination of a wide range of odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory perception (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The activation of these receptors by specific odorants leads to the accumulation of cAMP, which is a key step in the olfactory signal transduction pathway (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).
