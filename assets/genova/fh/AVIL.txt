# AVIL

## Overview
The AVIL gene encodes the protein advillin, a member of the gelsolin/villin family, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Advillin is characterized by its six gelsolin-like domains, which facilitate its role in actin filament binding, severing, and capping. This protein is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons and specific epithelial cells, where it contributes to the morphogenesis of microvilli and neuronal development. Advillin's interactions with actin and other proteins are crucial for cellular processes such as migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis. Clinically, alterations in the AVIL gene are associated with diseases like glioblastoma and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, underscoring its importance in both oncogenic pathways and kidney function (Rao2017Advillin; Cornelison2023The; Xie2020A).

## Structure
The AVIL protein, encoded by the AVIL gene, is a member of the gelsolin superfamily and plays a role in actin filament regulation. It contains six homologous domains known as gelsolin-like domains (G1-G6), which are conserved among gelsolin family members. These domains are crucial for its function in actin binding and regulation. The G1 and G2 domains bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and regulate monomeric actin (G-actin), while the G1, G2, and G3 domains are involved in severing and capping actin filaments. The G1 and G4 domains specifically bind actin monomers, and the G2 domain is responsible for binding filamentous actin (F-actin) and tropomyosin. The carboxy-terminus headpiece domain of AVIL is similar in sequence and structure to the villin headpiece, which is important for F-actin binding and bundling (Cornelison2023The; Xie2020A).

In the absence of calcium ions, the G6 and headpiece domains inhibit the function of the G1-G3 domains, affecting the protein's activity. AVIL's structure and function are critical in processes such as neurite outgrowth and neuronal cell development, and its overexpression is linked to glioblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (Cornelison2023The).

## Function
The AVIL gene encodes advillin, a protein that is part of the gelsolin/villin family, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Advillin plays a crucial role in the organization of actin filaments, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling cellular movement, and facilitating intracellular transport (Cornelison2023The). In healthy human cells, advillin is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons during development and in specific cell types such as non-peptidergic nociceptors in dorsal root ganglia, Merkel cells in the skin, and tuft cells in the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts in adulthood (Cornelison2023The).

Advillin is involved in the morphogenesis of microvilli, which are small projections on the surface of epithelial cells, particularly in the small intestine and colonic lining. These structures are crucial for nutrient absorption and other cellular processes (Tümer2002Genomic). The protein's actin-binding capability is vital for actin filament bundling within the core of microvilli, ensuring their proper function (Tümer2002Genomic). Additionally, advillin is implicated in neurite outgrowth and the development of neuronal cells that form ganglia, contributing to growth cone formation and axonal regeneration (Cornelison2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AVIL gene are implicated in several diseases, notably glioblastoma and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). In glioblastoma, AVIL is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients, as AVIL regulates key oncogenic pathways, including the stability of the transcription factor FOXM1 and the expression of LIN28B, both of which are involved in cancer progression (Xie2020A).

In SRNS, recessive mutations in the AVIL gene disrupt its actin-bundling function, leading to defects in podocyte structure and function. These mutations, such as Arg135Gln, Leu425Met, and Phe656Valfs*7, impair the interaction of AVIL with phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) and the ARP2/3 complex, crucial for podocyte migration and lamellipodia formation. The loss of AVIL function in SRNS is linked to impaired actin dynamics and podocyte morphology, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Rao2017Advillin). These findings highlight AVIL's significant role in both cancer and kidney disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The AVIL (advillin) protein is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton regulation. AVIL directly binds to F-actin, a key component of the cytoskeleton, and this interaction is essential for its function in cell migration and proliferation, particularly in glioblastoma cells (Xie2020A). The headpiece domain of AVIL, located at the C-terminus, is critical for its binding to actin filaments, and mutations in this domain can significantly reduce its binding affinity (Xie2020A).

In the context of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), AVIL interacts with phospholipase C epsilon 1 (PLCE1) and the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex. These interactions are important for podocyte function, particularly in lamellipodia formation and actin dynamics (Rao2017Advillin). Co-immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed that AVIL forms a protein complex with PLCE1 and ARP2/3, and mutations in AVIL can weaken its interaction with PLCE1, affecting podocyte migration and function (Rao2017Advillin).

AVIL's interaction with the ARP2/3 complex is also significant in the context of cancer, where it is involved in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, structures crucial for cell movement and invasion (Cornelison2021Targeting). These interactions highlight AVIL's role in modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics across different cellular contexts.
