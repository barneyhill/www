# SNX10

## Overview
SNX10 is a gene that encodes the protein sorting nexin 10, a member of the sorting nexin family characterized by the presence of a Phox-homology (PX) domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, trafficking, and autophagy. Sorting nexin 10 plays a crucial role in the regulation of endosome maturation and the trafficking of proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (TrachselMoncho2024SNX10). It is also essential for ciliogenesis, interacting with the V-ATPase complex to facilitate ciliary membrane extension (Chen2011A). Additionally, SNX10 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, influencing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species levels (TrachselMoncho2024SNX10). Mutations in the SNX10 gene are linked to autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, highlighting its significance in bone resorption and broader physiological and pathological contexts (Huybrechts2022Osteopetrosis; Elson2021Sorting).

## Structure
The SNX10 protein is composed of 210 amino acid residues and is a member of the sorting nexin family characterized by the presence of a Phox-homology (PX) domain. This PX domain, spanning amino acid residues 10-127, is essential for binding to membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)) and is involved in interactions with the ATP6V1D subunit of the vacuolar-ATPase proton pump (Xu2020The). The PX domain also facilitates dimerization or polymerization, suggesting a quaternary structure involving dimerization (Zhang2019SNX10).

The C-terminal region of SNX10 contains specific amino acids, such as His124, Met152, Arg155, Phe156, Glu158, and Glu159, which form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges necessary for interactions with proteins like ATG5 and LAMP1, crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Zhang2019SNX10). The protein's structure has been studied using X-ray crystallography, revealing specific residues involved in lipid binding, such as R53, Y54, K79, and R95 (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX10 lacks coiled-coil regions, which are common in other sorting nexins, and is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm rather than being membrane-associated (TEASDALE2001A).

## Function
SNX10 (sorting nexin 10) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its role in endosomal sorting and trafficking. It localizes to early and late endocytic compartments in a PtdIns3P-dependent manner, where it regulates the trafficking of proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is involved in endosome maturation (TrachselMoncho2024SNX10). SNX10 is also implicated in the formation of primary cilia, essential for various cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the V-ATPase complex, targeting it to the centrosome, which is crucial for ciliogenesis and the ciliary trafficking of Rab8a, a regulator of ciliary membrane extension (Chen2011A).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, SNX10 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis and bioenergetics. It participates in the clearance of mitochondrial proteins and affects mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species levels, indicating its role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (TrachselMoncho2024SNX10). SNX10's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various physiological and pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNX10 gene are associated with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), a condition characterized by increased bone density due to defective osteoclast function. Approximately 4-5% of ARO cases are attributed to pathogenic variants in SNX10, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations (Huybrechts2022Osteopetrosis; Elson2021Sorting). The R51Q mutation, identified in Palestinian families, is a notable missense variant that leads to osteoclast dysfunction, resulting in symptoms such as increased bone density, fractures, and vision problems (Elson2021Sorting; Aker2012AnSNX10mutation). 

SNX10 mutations disrupt osteoclast vesicular trafficking, impairing the formation of the ruffled border and acidification of the resorption lacunae, which are essential for bone resorption (Huybrechts2022Osteopetrosis). Mouse models with SNX10 mutations exhibit severe osteopetrosis phenotypes, providing insights into the gene's role in bone resorption (Elson2021Sorting).

Beyond skeletal disorders, SNX10 is implicated in cancer development, particularly colorectal cancer, by affecting autophagic degradation pathways. Loss of SNX10 leads to the accumulation of proteins like SRC, promoting cancer progression (Zhang2019SNX10). These findings highlight SNX10's critical role in both bone health and broader pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SNX10 (sorting nexin 10) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), specifically the V1D subunit, which is essential for processes like ciliogenesis and osteoclast function. This interaction is mediated by the PX domain of SNX10 and is critical for the acidification of the resorption lacuna in osteoclasts, facilitating bone resorption (Huybrechts2022Osteopetrosis; Chen2011A).

SNX10 also plays a role in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway by interacting with the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate and LAMP1, which are involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This interaction is crucial for the autophagic degradation of SRC, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, thereby regulating SRC-mediated signaling pathways that are implicated in colorectal cancer progression (Zhang2019SNX10).

Additionally, SNX10 is involved in the trafficking of Rab8a, a small GTPase important for ciliogenesis, by regulating its ciliary trafficking. SNX10 partially co-localizes with Rab11, a recycling endosome marker, suggesting a role in the trafficking of Rab8a vesicles into the ciliary membrane (Chen2011A). These interactions highlight SNX10's multifaceted role in cellular trafficking and signaling.
