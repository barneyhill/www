# NAA20

## Overview
NAA20 is a gene that encodes the protein N-alpha-acetyltransferase 20, which serves as the catalytic subunit of the NatB complex. This protein is a member of the N-acetyltransferase family, characterized by its GNAT fold, and plays a pivotal role in the N-terminal acetylation of proteins, a common co-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. The acetylation process mediated by NAA20 is crucial for regulating protein stability, localization, and interactions, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as growth, autophagy, and stress response (Jung2020Naa20; Aksnes2019Cotranslational). NAA20 forms a heterodimer with NAA25, enhancing its substrate affinity and acetylation efficiency, and is involved in key signaling pathways, including the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway, which is significant for cellular energy homeostasis (Jung2020Naa20; Layer2021Structural). Alterations in NAA20 expression or function have been linked to diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma, where it acts as an oncogenic factor by modulating cell proliferation and autophagy (Jung2020Naa20; Elurbide2023NatB).

## Structure
NAA20, the catalytic subunit of the NatB complex, exhibits a well-defined molecular structure that is crucial for its function in N-terminal acetylation. The primary structure of NAA20 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of NAA20 includes the canonical Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold, characterized by four α-helices and eight β-strands, which is typical for N-acetyltransferases (Layer2021Structural). This GNAT fold forms a V-shaped binding groove that accommodates substrate peptides (Layer2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of NAA20 is defined by its ability to bind substrates in the absence of its auxiliary subunit, Naa25, although the presence of Naa25 enhances substrate affinity and acetylation efficiency (Layer2021Structural). Specific residues, such as H80 and F118, play critical roles in substrate specificity and catalytic activity, with H80 being particularly important for binding acidic residues in the substrate (Layer2021Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, NAA20 forms a complex with Naa25 in a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is essential for its association with the ribosome and efficient substrate acetylation (Layer2021Structural). The NatB complex is conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its evolutionary significance (Layer2021Structural).

## Function
NAA20, also known as N-alpha-acetyltransferase 20, is a catalytic subunit of the NatB complex, which plays a crucial role in the N-terminal acetylation (Nt-acetylation) of proteins. This process is one of the most common co-translational modifications in eukaryotic cells, affecting protein stability, localization, and interactions (Jung2020Naa20). NAA20 specifically acetylates proteins with a methionine-acidic/hydrophilic amino acid motif at their N-termini, which is vital for the proper functioning of proteins in healthy human cells (Aksnes2019Cotranslational).

In healthy cells, NAA20 is involved in maintaining cellular processes such as growth, autophagy, and response to stress. It is implicated in the regulation of the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and autophagy (Jung2020Naa20). The NatB complex, through NAA20, acetylates a significant portion of human proteins, contributing to normal cellular functions by altering cell cycle-related genes and signaling pathways like mTORC2 and ERK1/2 (Jung2020Naa20).

NAA20 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with ribosomes, where it facilitates the co-translational acetylation of proteins, ensuring their stability and proper function (Aksnes2019Cotranslational).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NAA20 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAA20 is upregulated in HCC tumors, where it acts as an oncogenic factor by promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. This is achieved through its regulation of the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and autophagy. NAA20 negatively regulates the LKB1-AMPK axis, thereby promoting mTOR signaling, which contributes to tumor progression (Jung2020Naa20).

In HCC cell lines, NAA20 depletion leads to increased autophagy and reduced mTOR signaling, highlighting its role as an autophagy suppressor. The catalytic activity of NAA20 is essential for these effects, as a catalytically inactive mutant cannot rescue the phenotypes caused by NAA20 silencing (Jung2020Naa20).

Beyond cancer, NAA20 depletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts has been linked to cellular senescence, characterized by decreased cell proliferation, replication stress, and DNA damage response activation. This suggests that NAA20 is critical for maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing senescence, with potential implications for understanding the clinical significance of NAA20 gene mutations or expression alterations (Elurbide2023NatB).

## Interactions
NAA20, the catalytic subunit of the NatB complex, interacts with NAA25 to form a stable heterodimer essential for N-terminal acetylation of proteins. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K_d) of 17.8 ± 11.9 nM, indicating a strong and stable complex formation (Layer2021Structural). The NatB complex, consisting of NAA20 and NAA25, exhibits a 1:1 stoichiometry and is involved in the acetylation of specific substrates, such as the MDEL peptide, which is a conserved function across species (Layer2021Structural).

NAA20 can acetylate substrates independently, although with lower efficiency compared to when it is part of the NatB complex, due to the stabilizing effect of NAA25, which enhances substrate affinity (Layer2021Structural). NAA20 does not bind RNA and lacks positive patches for ribosome interaction, which may explain its inactivity in vivo when not part of the NatB complex (Layer2021Structural).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NAA20 is implicated in the regulation of the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. It interacts with LKB1, affecting its activity towards AMPK, and plays a role in modulating cell growth and autophagy through this pathway (Jung2020Naa20).
