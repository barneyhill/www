# JMJD1C

## Overview
The JMJD1C gene encodes the protein jumonji domain containing 1C, which is a member of the Jumonji domain-containing family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as a histone demethylase, specifically targeting histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) to remove mono- and di-methyl groups, thereby playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Kim2010Regulation). The JMJD1C protein is characterized by its JmjC domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, and includes other structural features such as zinc finger-like domains and nuclear localization signals (Kim2010Regulation; Katoh2007Comparative). It is involved in various biological processes, including megakaryopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, and spermatogenesis, through its interactions with other proteins and complexes (Sui2021Crucial; Nakajima2016JMJD1C; Wang2022JMJD1C). Clinically, mutations in JMJD1C have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and certain types of leukemia, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Sroczynska2014shRNA; Sáez2016Mutations).

## Structure
The JMJD1C protein is a member of the Jumonji domain-containing family, characterized by its histone demethylase activity. It contains several specific domains crucial for its function. The primary structure includes a JmjC domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, specifically targeting H3K9 mono- and di-methylation (Kim2010Regulation). This domain features conserved Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate-binding sites necessary for its catalytic function (Kim2010Regulation). The protein also includes a zinc finger-like domain, which is important for its structural integrity and function (Kim2010Regulation).

JMJD1C has two splicing variants, with variant 2 being the major transcript. This variant is transcribed from a novel exon 1B and is evolutionarily conserved (Katoh2007Comparative). The protein structure includes conserved domains such as the TRI8H1 domain with a C2HC4-type zinc finger-like motif and the TRI8H2 domain with a thyroid hormone receptor ß-binding region (Katoh2007Comparative). Additionally, JMJD1C contains two bipartite nuclear localization signals, which are important for its localization within the cell (Katoh2007Comparative).

The JMJD1C protein is involved in histone demethylation, specifically targeting histone H3K9, which is associated with transcriptional regulation (Katoh2007Comparative). The protein's activity is regulated by its interaction with cofactors and other proteins, such as WHISTLE and HSP90a (Kim2010Regulation).

## Function
The JMJD1C gene encodes a protein that functions as a histone demethylase, primarily involved in the removal of methyl groups from histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), specifically targeting mono- and di-methylated forms (Kim2010Regulation). This activity is crucial for regulating gene expression through chromatin remodeling, influencing various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, JMJD1C plays a significant role in megakaryopoiesis, the process of platelet formation, by regulating the actin network, which is essential for cytoskeletal dynamics and platelet aggregation (Wang2022JMJD1C). It interacts with Ran GTPase, a key regulator of the cytoskeleton, suggesting its involvement in platelet traits (Wang2022JMJD1C).

JMJD1C is also implicated in stem cell maintenance and reprogramming. It is recruited by the transcription factor OCT4 to oppose dimethylation of H3K9, which is vital for the expression of stem cell factors like OCT4 and KLF4, thereby supporting embryonic stem cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming (Sui2021Crucial). Additionally, JMJD1C regulates the expression of specific microRNAs, such as the miR-200 family and miR-290/295 cluster, which are important for maintaining the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells (Xiao2017JMJD1C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JMJD1C gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, and Rett syndrome. Studies have identified de novo mutations in JMJD1C in patients with Rett syndrome and intellectual disability, which result in abnormal protein localization and reduced demethylation activity, affecting neuronal development and dendritic branching (Sáez2016Mutations). In particular, the JMJD1C-Pro163Leu mutation has been shown to impair the protein's ability to demethylate MDC1 and reduce its interaction with MECP2, a protein associated with Rett syndrome (Sáez2016Mutations).

JMJD1C variants have also been associated with learning disabilities and myoclonic epilepsy. A splice-disrupting variant in JMJD1C led to a 21 bp deletion in the transcript, resulting in learning disabilities and epilepsy in an 11-year-old patient (Yamada2020Learning). Additionally, JMJD1C is crucial for leukemia maintenance, particularly in MLL-rearranged leukemias. Depletion of JMJD1C in leukemic cells leads to increased apoptosis and altered gene expression, suggesting its role in leukemic transformation and maintenance (Sroczynska2014shRNA). These findings highlight the clinical significance of JMJD1C in various disorders, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
JMJD1C is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in epigenetic regulation. It interacts with the AETFC complex in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors such as RUNX1-RUNX1T1, HEB, and LYL1. These interactions are essential for maintaining low levels of H3K9 dimethylation at target genes, which is important for transcriptional activation (Chen2015JMJD1C).

In the context of spermatogenesis, JMJD1C interacts with non-histone proteins like MDC1, facilitating DNA repair processes by demethylating MDC1 at K45. It also associates with HSP90α, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and spermatogenesis (Nakajima2016JMJD1C).

JMJD1C is part of a protein complex with WHISTLE and SF-1, where it reverses WHISTLE-mediated transcriptional repression by demethylating H3K9, thus activating transcription during steroidogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in steroidogenesis (Kim2010Regulation).

These interactions highlight JMJD1C's role in various biological processes through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and its ability to modulate gene expression by altering histone methylation states.
