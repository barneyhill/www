# PDP2

## Overview
The PDP2 gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 2, a phosphatase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by regulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This enzyme is crucial for the dephosphorylation and activation of the PDC, facilitating the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, thereby linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle and promoting energy production in mitochondria (Patel2014The; Kato2010Crystallization). Unlike its isoform PDP1, PDP2 does not require calcium ions for its activity and is primarily expressed in liver and adipose tissues, indicating its involvement in metabolic processes related to fat synthesis and insulin response (Patel2003The; Roche2001Distinct). Additionally, PDP2 has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses and metabolic diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Piccinini2005Down‐regulation; Kono2018Pyruvate).

## Function
Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 2 (PDP2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) in mammalian cells. PDP2 is responsible for dephosphorylating the E1 component of PDC, thereby activating the complex and facilitating the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. This process is essential for linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, which is crucial for energy production in mitochondria (Patel2014The; Kato2010Crystallization).

PDP2 is primarily found in liver and adipose tissues, suggesting its involvement in fat-synthesizing tissues and its potential role in insulin-mediated activation of PDC in these tissues (Roche2001Distinct). Unlike PDP1, PDP2 does not require Ca2+ for its activity and is characterized by a high Km for Mg2+, which is reduced in the presence of polyamines like spermine (Patel2003The; Roche2001Distinct). This regulation is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly during metabolic transitions such as from a fed to a fasting state (Patel2003The).

In Th17 cells, PDP2 negatively regulates glycolysis and lactate production, influencing Th17 cell differentiation and potentially impacting immune responses (Kono2018Pyruvate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving metabolic and immune dysfunctions. In obesity, down-regulation of PDP2 is associated with insulin resistance. This is linked to impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, which is crucial for glucose metabolism. The study by Piccinini et al. suggests that reduced PDP2 expression may contribute to the metabolic dysfunction observed in obesity, highlighting its role in insulin resistance (Piccinini2005Down‐regulation).

In the context of autoimmune diseases, PDP2 plays a significant role in the differentiation of Th17 cells, which are involved in inflammatory responses. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a decrease in PDP2 expression is associated with increased Th17 differentiation and inflammation. This suggests that PDP2 may act as a regulatory factor in immune responses, and its modulation could serve as a therapeutic strategy in autoimmune conditions like SLE (Kono2018Pyruvate).

In prostate cancer, although PDP2 expression was evaluated, it did not show significant correlation with clinical or pathological variables, indicating that its role in this context may not be as impactful (NunesXavier2022Heterogeneous).

## Interactions
Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit 2 (PDP2) is involved in the regulation of ferroptosis in Luminal A breast cancer (LumABC) by interacting with long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4). PDP2 dephosphorylates ACSL4, reducing its activity and thereby inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by iron dependency and lipid peroxide accumulation. This interaction was confirmed through Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments, which showed a significant decrease in the phosphorylation level of ACSL4 in cells transfected with PDP2, indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins (Zhu2024Autocrine).

PDP2 does not bind to the L2-domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, unlike its isoform PDP1c, which requires Ca2+ for stable complex formation with the L2-domain. This lack of binding is attributed to subtle sequence differences between PDP1 and PDP2, which affect their affinities for the L2-domain (Vassylyev2007Crystal). Additionally, PDP2 does not bind to Ca2+ ions or the lipoyl domain, which distinguishes it from PDP1c (Kato2010Crystallization). These interactions suggest that PDP2 has a unique role in cellular processes distinct from its isoform PDP1c.
