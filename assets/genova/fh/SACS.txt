# SACS

## Overview
The SACS gene encodes the sacsin molecular chaperone, a large multidomain protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly within neuronal cells. Sacsin is categorized as a molecular chaperone due to its involvement in protein folding and quality control, facilitated by its interaction with heat shock proteins such as Hsp70. The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a ubiquitin-like domain, sacsin internal repeat domains, a xeroderma pigmentosum C-binding domain, a J-domain, and a higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding domain, which collectively contribute to its diverse cellular functions. These functions include the regulation of intermediate filament networks, mitochondrial dynamics, and participation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mutations in the SACS gene are linked to autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Dabbaghizadeh2022The; Narayanan2011Autosomal; Bagaria2022Genetics).

## Structure
The sacsin protein, encoded by the SACS gene, is a large multidomain protein with a molecular weight of approximately 520 kDa, consisting of 4579 amino acids (Anderson2010The; Bagaria2022Genetics). It features several distinct domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, three sacsin internal repeat (SIRPT or SRR) domains, a xeroderma pigmentosum C-binding (XPCB) domain, a J-domain, and a higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain (Perna2023AlphaFold; Bagaria2022Genetics). The SRR domains are homologous to the ATP-binding domain of Hsp90 and are crucial for ATPase activity (Anderson2010The; Perna2023AlphaFold).

The sacsin protein's secondary structure includes α-helices and β-strands, as predicted by sequence alignment and secondary-structure prediction tools (Anderson2010The). The SRR domain, in particular, contains nine β-strands and three α-helices, forming a structural core (Anderson2010The). Sacsin's tertiary structure is complex, with the SRR domains potentially forming a higher-ordered structure (Anderson2010The).

Sacsin's quaternary structure involves interactions with intermediate filaments, suggesting a role in their assembly or disassembly (Perna2023AlphaFold). The protein's ATPase activity is influenced by its C-terminal HEPN domain, which may form a dimer (Perna2023AlphaFold). The sacsin protein is involved in various cellular functions, including chaperone activities, microtubule organization, and mitochondrial function regulation (Bagaria2022Genetics).

## Function
The SACS gene encodes sacsin, a large multidomain protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons. Sacsin is involved in the regulation of intermediate filament (IF) networks, including neurofilaments (NFs) and vimentin, by preventing their abnormal bundling, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton (Dabbaghizadeh2022The; Gentil2018Sacsin). The protein contains several functional domains, such as a J-domain that interacts with Hsp70 chaperones, acting as a co-chaperone in protein folding and quality control (Dabbaghizadeh2022The; Parfitt2009The).

Sacsin is also involved in mitochondrial dynamics and function, playing a role in oxidative phosphorylation and energy production, which are critical for neuronal health (Morani2022Integrative; Bagaria2022Genetics). It is localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it helps prevent protein aggregation and supports mitochondrial morphology and positioning (Parfitt2009The; Larivière2014Sacs). Sacsin's interaction with the proteasome system through its ubiquitin-like domain suggests a role in protein degradation pathways, further contributing to cellular proteostasis (Parfitt2009The). The absence of sacsin leads to neurodegenerative symptoms, highlighting its essential function in healthy human cells (Dabbaghizadeh2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SACS gene, which encodes the sacsin protein, are primarily associated with autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), a neurodegenerative disorder. ARSACS is characterized by early-onset cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and peripheral neuropathy, often accompanied by retinal nerve fiber hypermyelination and cerebellar atrophy (Baets2010Mutations; Narayanan2011Autosomal). The disease is caused by biallelic mutations in the SACS gene, leading to a loss of sacsin function, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health and protein quality control (Bradshaw2016A; Larivière2014Sacs).

The clinical presentation of ARSACS can vary, with some patients exhibiting atypical symptoms such as late-onset ataxia or unique neurological changes (Bagaria2022Genetics). In some cases, mutations in the SACS gene result in severe phenotypes due to the loss of critical functional domains of sacsin, affecting its chaperone functions (Ekenstedt2023A). The variability in symptoms and onset age across different populations highlights the genetic complexity of ARSACS and the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis (Ricca2019Clinical; Bagaria2022Genetics).

## Interactions
Sacsin, encoded by the SACS gene, is a large multidomain protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular function. It contains several domains, including a ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain, sacsin internal repeats (SIRPT), a xeroderma pigmentosum C-binding domain (XPCB), a J-domain, and a higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domain, which facilitate its interactions with different proteins and pathways (Bagaria2022Genetics).

The UbL domain of sacsin interacts with the proteasome, similar to other proteins like Rad23, indicating a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Parfitt2009The). Sacsin's J-domain interacts with heat shock proteins, particularly Hsp70, enhancing its chaperone activity and playing a protective role against aggregation-prone proteins such as polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 (Parfitt2009The). Sacsin also interacts with Drp1, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function (Bagaria2022Genetics).

Sacsin's involvement in intermediate filament dynamics is mediated through its SIRPT and J-domains, which have opposing effects on neurofilament assembly (Gentil2018Sacsin). These interactions highlight sacsin's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing neurodegeneration.
