# FBXL8

## Overview
FBXL8 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 8, a member of the F-box protein family. This protein functions as a specificity subunit of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a critical mechanism for protein degradation in cells. The FBXL8 protein plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis by targeting specific proteins, such as cyclin D3 and c-myc, for degradation. These actions underscore its function as a tumor suppressor, as it helps prevent excessive cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (Bajpai2022Ubiquitylation; Yoshida2020Fbxl8). Additionally, FBXL8 is implicated in various cellular processes, including breast cancer progression and cardiac fibrosis, through its interactions with other proteins (Chang2020Global; Li2024FBXL8).

## Function
FBXL8 is an F-box protein that functions as a specificity subunit of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In healthy human cells, FBXL8 plays a critical role in regulating cell cycle progression by targeting specific proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. One of its primary targets is cyclin D3, a protein involved in the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. FBXL8 specifically recognizes and polyubiquitylates phosphorylated cyclin D3 at threonine 283, leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation. This process is essential for controlling cell cycle progression and preventing excessive cell proliferation (Bajpai2022Ubiquitylation; Yoshida2020Fbxl8).

FBXL8 also regulates the stability of the oncogenic transcription factor c-myc. It can polyubiquitylate c-myc independently of its phosphorylation at canonical sites, thereby maintaining homeostatic levels of c-myc and preventing its overexpression, which is associated with tumorigenesis (Bajpai2022Ubiquitylation). The activity of FBXL8 in these pathways underscores its role as a tumor suppressor, as it helps maintain normal cell cycle control and cellular homeostasis by targeting oncogenes for degradation (Bajpai2022Ubiquitylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FBXL8 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high FBXL8 expression is associated with reduced overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. The study by Devall et al. highlights the upregulation of FBXL8 in CRC and its role as an anti-apoptosis factor, indicating its possible involvement in cancer progression (Devall2022DNA).

In the context of lymphoma, FBXL8 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting cyclin D3 for degradation. Low expression of FBXL8 correlates with poor survival in lymphoma patients, and its overexpression suppresses oncogene-induced transformation and lymphoma progression. This suggests that FBXL8 could serve as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in lymphomas (Yoshida2020Fbxl8).

FBXL8 also plays a role in cardiac fibrosis post-myocardial infarction. It inhibits myofibroblast differentiation by targeting Snail1 for degradation, thereby reducing fibrosis. Downregulation of FBXL8 in cardiac fibroblasts is associated with increased fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for heart failure (Li2024FBXL8).

## Interactions
FBXL8, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. FBXL8 interacts with several proteins, including tumor suppressors such as Cyclin D2 (CCND2) and Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5). These interactions suggest that FBXL8 targets these proteins for degradation, thereby modulating their levels and influencing breast cancer progression (Chang2020Global).

FBXL8 also interacts with Snail1, a transcription factor involved in TGFβ signaling and myofibroblast differentiation. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of Snail1, which is crucial for regulating myofibroblast differentiation and cardiac fibrosis post-myocardial infarction (Li2024FBXL8).

In the context of lymphoma, FBXL8 specifically interacts with Cyclin D3, targeting it for degradation. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, requiring Thr-283 on Cyclin D3, and is essential for suppressing lymphoma growth and hematopoietic transformation (Yoshida2020Fbxl8). These interactions highlight FBXL8's role in regulating cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis.
