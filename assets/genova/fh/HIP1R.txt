# HIP1R

## Overview
HIP1R (huntingtin interacting protein 1 related) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical cellular process for nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and membrane maintenance. The HIP1R protein is characterized by its ANTH domain, which binds phosphoinositides, a central coiled-coil domain that facilitates dimerization and interaction with clathrin light chains, and a C-terminal talin-like domain that binds F-actin, linking the actin cytoskeleton to cellular compartments (Gottfried2010The; Wilbur2008Actin). As a scaffolding protein, HIP1R plays a pivotal role in the assembly of clathrin and actin into higher-order structures, essential for endocytosis and actin dynamics (EngqvistGoldstein2001The). Additionally, HIP1R is involved in stabilizing receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, thereby influencing cell growth and survival (Hyun2004HIP1). Alterations in HIP1R expression have been linked to various diseases, including gastric disorders, non-small cell lung cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Jain2008Hip1r; Qu2018Proteomic; Koh2020HIP1R).

## Structure
The HIP1R protein is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes an N-terminal ANTH (AP180 N-terminal homology) domain, a central coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal talin-like actin-binding domain. The ANTH domain in HIP1R binds phosphoinositides, specifically PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which suggests interactions with membranes of varying lipid compositions (Gottfried2010The). The central coiled-coil domain facilitates dimerization and contains sequences for protein-protein interactions, including binding with clathrin light chains, which is crucial for its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Wilbur2008Actin; EngqvistGoldstein2001The). The talin-like domain at the C-terminus binds F-actin, linking the actin cytoskeleton to cellular compartments (Gottfried2010The).

HIP1R forms stable homodimers, with its coiled-coil domains contributing to this dimerization. These domains exhibit flexibility, which influences their binding affinity for clathrin light chains and actin (Wilbur2008Actin). The protein's structure is rod-shaped, approximately 60 nm in length, with globular heads at each end, indicating a parallel dimer configuration (EngqvistGoldstein2001The). The interaction with clathrin is regulated by clathrin light chains, which modulate the protein's conformation and its affinity for actin (Wilbur2008Actin).

## Function
HIP1R (huntingtin interacting protein 1 related) is a crucial component in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process essential for nutrient uptake, signal transduction, and membrane maintenance in cells. It binds directly to clathrin through its coiled-coil domain, promoting clathrin assembly and influencing the dynamics of clathrin-coated pit formation and vesicle trafficking (EngqvistGoldstein2001The). HIP1R also interacts with actin, linking the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for the structural organization and movement of vesicles within the cell (Chen2005Huntingtininteracting; EngqvistGoldstein2001The).

HIP1R stabilizes receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by prolonging their half-life after endocytosis, which may contribute to cell growth and survival (Hyun2004HIP1). The protein's ENTH domain is critical for binding specific phosphoinositides, which is necessary for its role in receptor stabilization and signaling (Hyun2004HIP1). HIP1R is active in the cytoplasm, particularly near the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the assembly of clathrin and actin into higher-order structures, supporting its function in endocytosis and actin dynamics (Wilbur2008Actin; EngqvistGoldstein2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in HIP1R expression or mutations in the gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of gastric physiology, HIP1R is crucial for maintaining normal gastric gland structure and function. Deficiency in HIP1R leads to significant gastric changes, including glandular hypertrophy, loss of chief cells, and expansion of aberrant mucous neck cells. These changes are associated with hypergastrinemia, which is a compensatory response to low gastric acid levels due to reduced parietal cell numbers and increased apoptosis (Jain2008Hip1r).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HIP1R expression levels have been associated with the response to PD-1 pathway blockade. Low HIP1R mRNA expression is linked to better progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. This suggests that HIP1R expression could serve as a predictive factor for treatment response in NSCLC (Koh2020HIP1R).

HIP1R is also implicated in neurodegenerative processes. It is involved in the regulation of neuronal death and is thought to interact with the pro-apoptotic BCL2 protein, BAK. Altered expression of HIP1R is associated with neurodegeneration, and mutations in HIP1R have been linked to Parkinson's disease (Qu2018Proteomic).

## Interactions
HIP1R (huntingtin interacting protein 1 related) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and cytoskeletal organization. HIP1R interacts with clathrin light chains (LCs), binding to a conserved sequence that is essential for clathrin assembly and actin distribution. This interaction is particularly robust with both clathrin light chain a (LCa) and b (LCb), and mutations in critical residues of LCb can disrupt this binding (Chen2005Huntingtininteracting; Wilbur2008Actin).

HIP1R also interacts with F-actin, linking it to clathrin cages in vitro. The talin-like domain of HIP1R binds to F-actin, allowing it to cross-link clathrin and actin filaments (EngqvistGoldstein2001The). This interaction is significant for the assembly of clathrin and actin into higher-order structures (EngqvistGoldstein2001The).

Additionally, HIP1R forms a complex with cortactin, a protein involved in actin polymerization. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) of HIP1R binding to the SH3 domain of cortactin, which is crucial for regulating actin assembly at endocytic sites (Le2007A). HIP1R's interactions with clathrin, actin, and cortactin highlight its role as a scaffolding protein at the interface of these components during endocytosis (EngqvistGoldstein2001The).
