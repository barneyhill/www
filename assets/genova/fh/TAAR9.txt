# TAAR9

## Overview
TAAR9, or trace amine-associated receptor 9, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in various physiological processes. The TAAR9 protein is characterized by its typical class A GPCR structure, which includes seven transmembrane alpha-helices and distinct ligand-binding tunnels. This receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting its involvement in olfactory signaling and systemic functions (Gainetdinov2018Trace; Berry2017Pharmacology). TAAR9 plays a role in maintaining intestinal health and cholesterol homeostasis, with its activation influenced by amines and polyamines produced by gut microbiota (Murtazina2021Genetic; Zhukov2022Gut). Despite its widespread expression, the precise physiological functions of TAAR9 in humans remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The TAAR9 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a typical class A GPCR structure, which includes seven transmembrane alpha-helices, three extracellular loops, and three intracellular loops (Xu2022Two). The molecular structure of TAAR9 features two entry tunnels that are crucial for ligand binding, with Tunnel 1 being more hydrophilic than Tunnel 2 (Xu2022Two). These tunnels are formed by specific residues and contain vestibular binding pockets, which play a significant role in ligand recognition and binding (Xu2022Two).

The orthosteric binding pocket of TAAR9 is defined by residues in transmembrane domains TM2, TM3, TM6, and TM7, with key residues like D112 and E294 involved in binding through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and pi-cation interactions (Xu2022Two). The vestibular binding pockets are characterized by negatively charged residues that attract ligands from extracellular regions (Xu2022Two). The presence of two entry tunnels in TAAR9, as opposed to a single tunnel in other receptors like TAAR13c, is attributed to a critical residue difference, where TAAR9 has E instead of D, forming a salt bridge with R2.64 (Xu2022Two).

## Function
TAAR9 (trace amine-associated receptor 9) is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely unclear. TAAR9 is expressed in several tissues, including the olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, intestines, spleen, skeletal muscle, pituitary gland, and leukocytes, suggesting a potential role in olfactory signaling and other systemic functions (Gainetdinov2018Trace; Berry2017Pharmacology).

In the gastrointestinal tract, TAAR9 is implicated in maintaining tissue integrity and homeostasis. It is co-expressed with genes involved in cell adhesion, differentiation, and death, indicating a role in intestinal health (Moiseenko2024Trace; Zhukov2022Gut). TAAR9 may also influence dopaminergic signaling in the gut, although its exact role in this process is not well understood (Zhukov2022Gut).

TAAR9 is involved in cholesterol homeostasis, as studies in TAAR9 knockout rats have shown decreased blood cholesterol levels, suggesting a potential role in lipid metabolism (Murtazina2021Genetic; Vaganova2023Trace). The receptor's activation by various amines and polyamines, primarily produced by gut microbiota, further indicates its involvement in intestinal health and microbial community stability (Zhukov2022Gut).
