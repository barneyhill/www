# SAC3D1

## Overview
SAC3D1 is a gene that encodes the SAC3 domain containing 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein, essential for the formation and function of the centrosome and spindle apparatus during cell division. It is localized to the centrosome during interphase and to the spindle during mitosis, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Zhang2024Conduction; Han2018SAC3D1:). SAC3D1 is also involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, which are crucial for cell growth, survival, and proliferation (Zhang2024Conduction; Wang2022SAC3D1). The gene's expression and interactions have significant implications in cancer biology, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2022SAC3D1).

## Function
SAC3D1, also known as SAC3 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression. In healthy human cells, SAC3D1 is associated with the formation of the centrosome and spindle apparatus, which are essential for proper cell division and maintenance of genomic stability. The protein is localized to the centrosome during interphase and to the spindle and mitotic spindle during the M phase of the cell cycle (Zhang2024Conduction; Han2018SAC3D1:).

SAC3D1 plays a significant role in centrosome assembly and spindle formation, impacting the number of centrosomes and spindle poles during mitosis. Its expression is crucial for maintaining the correct number of centrosomes, as evidenced by experiments showing that siRNA-transfected SAC3D1 cells exhibit a single centrosome and an increased number of micronuclei, while SAC3D1-GFP transfected cells show centrosome amplification and multiple spindle poles (Han2018SAC3D1:).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is important for cell growth and survival. This pathway's regulation by SAC3D1 underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing genomic instability (Zhang2024Conduction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SAC3D1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SAC3D1 is upregulated, promoting tumor progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This activation occurs through the inhibition of β-catenin degradation, leading to increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis in HCC patients (Wang2022SAC3D1). SAC3D1 is also part of a seven-gene signature associated with poor survival outcomes in HCC, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Li2019&lt; Identification; p&gt).

In osteosarcoma, SAC3D1 expression is significantly upregulated and associated with T-cell exhaustion, which may contribute to disease progression (Fan2024Singlecell). Additionally, SAC3D1 has been identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary hypertension with metabolic syndrome, suggesting its involvement in immune and metabolic pathways (Lu2023Identification).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, SAC3D1 is linked to the histological stage of the disease, indicating its role in tumor progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2021Candidate). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SAC3D1 in various cancers and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
SAC3D1 is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular processes and cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SAC3D1 interacts with axin, a component of the β-catenin degradation complex. This interaction inhibits the ubiquitination of β-catenin, leading to increased levels of β-catenin protein and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration (Wang2022SAC3D1).

SAC3D1 is also associated with the mitotic spindle assembly (MSA) process. It localizes to the centrosome during interphase and to the spindle during mitosis. Suppressing SAC3D1 expression can lead to defects in centrosome duplication and spindle formation, resulting in polyploidy and tumorigenesis (Zhang2024Conduction). Additionally, SAC3D1 knockdown reduces the expression of proteins involved in mitosis, such as Aurora B and TTK, suggesting its role in regulating mitotic processes (Zhang2024Conduction).

These interactions highlight SAC3D1's involvement in critical signaling pathways and cellular structures, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancers like HCC.
