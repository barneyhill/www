# CMSS1

## Overview
The CMSS1 gene encodes the cms1 ribosomal small subunit homolog, a protein that plays a crucial role in ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and RNA processing. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal protein, which is integral to the structure and function of ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis. CMSS1 is particularly significant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where its expression is elevated and associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor patient prognosis. The gene's expression is linked to key cellular pathways, including those involving ribosome and spliceosome structures, and it has been shown to interact with various immune cells, suggesting a role in modulating the immune microenvironment in cancer (Chen2024Prognostic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The CMSS1 gene is significantly implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where its expression is markedly higher in carcinoma tissues compared to normal liver tissues (Chen2024Prognostic). Elevated CMSS1 expression is associated with aggressive clinicopathological features, including higher cancer stages and histological grades, particularly in male patients (Chen2024Prognostic). It is also notably higher in tumors with TP53 mutations, which are linked to poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in LIHC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Chen2024Prognostic).

CMSS1 is involved in a complex regulatory network, influencing ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, rRNA metabolism, and RNA processing. Its expression correlates with genes involved in ribosome and spliceosome structures, and it is enriched in pathways related to these cellular components (Chen2024Prognostic). The gene's expression also correlates with various immune cells, such as B cells and CD8+ T cells, indicating a role in modulating the immune microenvironment of LIHC (Chen2024Prognostic). These interactions highlight CMSS1's significance in tumor biology and its potential impact on immune cell infiltration in cancerous tissues (Chen2024Prognostic).
