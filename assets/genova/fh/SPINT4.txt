# SPINT4

## Overview
SPINT4 is a gene that encodes the protein serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 4, which is categorized as a protease inhibitor. This gene is predominantly expressed in the human epididymis, indicating a specialized function in male reproductive biology. The protein features a Kunitz domain, a structural motif commonly associated with protease inhibition, although SPINT4 exhibits limited inhibitory activity against proteases such as PSA and chymotrypsin. This suggests that SPINT4 may not act as a conventional broad-spectrum protease inhibitor but could have specific roles in sperm maturation and innate immunity, akin to other members of the WFDC family. The unique structural characteristics of the SPINT4 protein, including a Kunitz motif with an atypical cysteine arrangement, may influence its specific biological interactions and functions within the epididymis (Clauss2011Three; Penttinen2003Discovery).

## Structure


## Function
SPINT4, or serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 4, is primarily expressed in the human epididymis, suggesting a specialized role in male reproductive biology. The protein encoded by SPINT4 contains a Kunitz domain, which is typically involved in protease inhibition. However, SPINT4's ability to inhibit proteases like PSA or chymotrypsin is limited, indicating it may not function as a traditional broad-spectrum protease inhibitor (Clauss2011Three). Despite this, SPINT4 is thought to contribute to sperm maturation and potentially to innate immunity, similar to other genes in the WFDC family (Clauss2011Three).

The expression of SPINT4 is highly specific to the epididymis, with levels significantly higher than in other tissues, suggesting its primary role is localized to this organ (Clauss2011Three). The protein's structure includes a Kunitz motif that lacks one of the typical cysteines, which minimally affects its folding and protease-binding loop (Clauss2011Three). This structural feature may influence its specific interactions and functions within the epididymis, potentially playing a role in processes like sperm capacitation and fertilization (Penttinen2003Discovery).
