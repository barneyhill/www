# CEP20

## Overview
CEP20, or centrosomal protein 20, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function of the centrosome, a critical cellular structure involved in organizing microtubules and ensuring proper cell division. The protein encoded by CEP20 is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Zhao2021Centrosome). Additionally, CEP20 is involved in the regulation of protein composition within the primary cilium, acting as a gatekeeper to control protein entry and maintain ciliary function (Hsiao2012Trafficking). The gene's expression levels have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Feng2023CEP20). As such, CEP20 is not only crucial for normal cellular processes but also represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Function
CEP20, also known as centrosomal protein 20, plays a crucial role in centrosome function and microtubule organization, which are essential for proper cell division. It is involved in ensuring accurate spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Zhao2021Centrosome). CEP20 is active at the centrosome, a key cellular structure responsible for organizing microtubules, and contributes to the regulation of centriole elongation. It acts as a centriole elongation inhibitor, with elevated mRNA levels associated with poor survival in multiple myeloma patients, suggesting its role in pathological conditions (Köhrer2023Highthroughput).

In addition to its role in centrosome function, CEP20 is implicated in the regulation of protein composition within the primary cilium. It acts as a gatekeeper, controlling the entry of proteins into the cilium and maintaining the specific protein environment necessary for ciliary function (Hsiao2012Trafficking). This regulation is crucial for the proper functioning of the primary cilium, which is involved in various signaling pathways and cellular processes. Overall, CEP20 is integral to both centrosome and ciliary functions, impacting cell division and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
CEP20 (centrosomal protein 20) has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to its overexpression in cancerous tissues. Studies have shown that CEP20 is significantly upregulated in NSCLC cells, correlating with increased tumor invasion, lymphatic metastasis, and distant metastasis, which suggests a poor prognosis for patients with high CEP20 expression levels (Feng2023CEP20). The gene plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is essential for cell proliferation and motility. Its overexpression leads to microtubule depolymerization, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Feng2023CEP20).

Downregulation of CEP20 in NSCLC cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. The depletion of CEP20 results in increased polymerized tubulin, suggesting that its overexpression inhibits microtubule formation, which is crucial for cancer progression (Feng2023CEP20). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CEP20 in NSCLC and its potential utility in targeted cancer therapies (Feng2023CEP20).

## Interactions
CEP20 (centrosomal protein 20) is known to participate in crucial interactions that are essential for centrosome function and cell cycle regulation. It interacts with CEP250, a protein that plays a significant role in centrosome cohesion. This interaction is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome, which is necessary for proper cell division. CEP20 also interacts with C-Nap1, another protein involved in centrosome cohesion. These interactions ensure that the centrosomes remain properly connected and function effectively during the cell cycle. The interactions between CEP20, CEP250, and C-Nap1 highlight the importance of CEP20 in maintaining centrosome integrity and facilitating accurate cell division processes. These protein-protein interactions are critical for the proper functioning of the centrosome, underscoring the role of CEP20 in cellular homeostasis and division.
