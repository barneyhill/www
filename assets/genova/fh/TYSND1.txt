# TYSND1

## Overview
The TYSND1 gene encodes the trypsin-like peroxisomal matrix peptidase 1, a crucial enzyme involved in the processing of peroxisomal proteins. This enzyme is classified as a cysteine endopeptidase and plays a significant role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids within peroxisomes, which are essential organelles for lipid metabolism and detoxification (Kurochkin2007Novel). The TYSND1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications to become active, ensuring that it processes enzymes with peroxisomal targeting signals, such as PTS1 and PTS2, into their functional forms (Kurochkin2007Novel). This activity is vital for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and is regulated by factors such as the proliferator-activated receptor α agonist bezafibrate (Kurochkin2007Novel). TYSND1's interactions with other peroxisomal proteins, including Pex5 and Pex7, underscore its role in the assembly and regulation of peroxisomal enzyme complexes (Okumoto2018Identification).

## Structure
The TYSND1 protein is synthesized as a 59-kDa precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to produce a 49-kDa form, which is considered the active version, and a 27-kDa form containing a C-terminal protease-like domain (Kurochkin2007Novel). The protein contains two protease-related domains: a trypsin-like serine domain located at residues 187-294 and a cysteine peptidase domain at residues 308-531 (Kurochkin2007Novel). The N-terminal segment (amino acids 1-110) may function as an inhibitory peptide, preventing premature activity until the protein reaches the peroxisomes (Kurochkin2007Novel).

TYSND1 is classified as a cysteine endopeptidase, and its activity can be inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (Kurochkin2007Novel). The protein is synthesized in the cytosol and undergoes post-translational processing, including the removal of a 10-kDa N-terminal fragment, to become active within peroxisomes (Kurochkin2007Novel). The processing of TYSND1 may involve self-catalysis or the action of another protease (Kurochkin2007Novel). The presence of an Ala-Ala-Pro motif is crucial for its cleavage activity, suggesting a specific substrate recognition mechanism (Kurochkin2007Novel).

## Function
The TYSND1 gene encodes a peroxisomal protease that plays a critical role in the β-oxidation of fatty acids within peroxisomes, cellular organelles involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification processes. TYSND1 is responsible for processing enzymes that contain peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, which are essential for the proper functioning of peroxisomal enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (Kurochkin2007Novel). 

TYSND1 processes PTS2-containing prethiolase and PTS1-containing enzymes such as Acox1, Hsd17b4, and Scp2, converting them into their active forms necessary for efficient lipid metabolism (Kurochkin2007Novel). This proteolytic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and is regulated by the proliferator-activated receptor α agonist bezafibrate, which induces TYSND1 expression and increases the levels of its substrates (Kurochkin2007Novel).

TYSND1 is synthesized in the cytosol and becomes active upon reaching the peroxisomes, where it undergoes post-translational processing. This involves the removal of an inhibitory N-terminal fragment, ensuring that TYSND1 remains inactive until it reaches its destination (Kurochkin2007Novel). The enzyme's activity is not inhibited by conventional protease inhibitors, suggesting it may belong to a new family of proteolytic enzymes (Kurochkin2007Novel).

## Interactions
TYSND1, a trypsin-like peroxisomal matrix peptidase, is involved in the processing of peroxisomal proteins and interacts with several other proteins within the peroxisome. It processes PTS1- and PTS2-containing enzymes, such as acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1), sterol carrier protein 2 (Scp2), and D-bifunctional enzyme (Hsd17b4), which are crucial for the β-oxidation of fatty acids (Kurochkin2007Novel; Kunze2020The). TYSND1 is part of a protein network that includes interactions with Pex5 and Pex7, receptors for peroxisome targeting signals, which are essential for importing peroxisomal matrix proteins (Okumoto2018Identification).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by its interaction with inhibitors such as N-ethylmaleimide, which suggests a role for cysteine residues in its proteolytic function (Kurochkin2007Novel; Kunze2020The). TYSND1 can also process itself, making it more susceptible to degradation by LonP2, a peroxisomal protease (Kunze2020The). These interactions highlight TYSND1's role in the regulation and assembly of peroxisomal enzyme complexes, facilitating efficient metabolic processes within the peroxisome.
