# CTSE

## Overview
Cathepsin E (CTSE) is a gene that encodes the protein cathepsin E, an intracellular aspartic protease belonging to the peptidase A1 family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the processing and presentation of antigens within the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) pathway, playing a crucial role in immune system function. Cathepsin E is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, as well as in epithelial cells of the stomach and lungs. The protein functions optimally in acidic environments, such as those found in endosomes and lysosomes, where it contributes to the breakdown of proteins into peptides. Structurally, cathepsin E forms a homodimer and undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can influence its stability and activity. The gene's expression and regulation have been implicated in various diseases, including transthyretin amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Pilzner2012Allergic; Pontious2019Cathepsin; Gonçalves2017Differential).

## Structure
Cathepsin E (CTSE) is an intracellular aspartic protease that is part of the peptidase A1 family, which includes pepsin A and cathepsin D (Pontious2019Cathepsin). The primary structure of CTSE consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide and a propeptide region. Its secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The tertiary structure of CTSE forms a bilobed shape typical of aspartic proteases, featuring an active site cleft. CTSE functions as a homodimer, which represents its quaternary structure (Pontious2019Cathepsin).

CTSE undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked high-mannose type glycosylation, as evidenced by endoglycosidase-H digestion and Western blot analysis (Yamada1994Secretion). This glycosylation is a common modification that can affect the enzyme's stability and activity. The enzyme is secreted as a mature dimeric form, starting with Ile37, and has a molecular mass of 82 kDa (Yamada1994Secretion). The specific domains and prominent folds of CTSE are not detailed in the provided context, nor are any splice variant isoforms mentioned.

## Function
Cathepsin E (CTSE) is an intracellular aspartic protease primarily involved in antigen processing and presentation within the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) pathway. It is predominantly expressed in immune system cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes, as well as in gastric and lung epithelial cells (Pilzner2012Allergic). CTSE functions as a disulfide-linked homodimer or monomer and is active in acidic environments such as endosomes and lysosomes, where it contributes to the breakdown of proteins into peptides (Pilzner2012Allergic).

In dendritic cells, CTSE is located in early endosomes and is essential for processing exogenous antigens, which is crucial for sensitization to allergens and the promotion of Th2 responses, such as those seen in allergic asthma (Pilzner2012Allergic). CTSE deficiency in mice has been shown to lead to reduced antigen presentation and lymphocyte influx in models of allergic airway inflammation, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Pilzner2012Allergic). Additionally, CTSE is involved in regulating dendritic cell motility, which may influence immune cell behavior and inflammation (Mengwasser2017Cathepsin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CTSE gene have been implicated in several diseases. In transthyretin amyloidosis, particularly with the V30M mutation, there is a significant downregulation of CTSE in injured sciatic nerves of transgenic mice, as well as in sensory neurons and Schwann cells. This downregulation is also observed in the stomach, specifically in parietal cells, and correlates with TTR V30M deposition. Inhibition of TTR deposition can restore CTSE mRNA levels, suggesting a link between CTSE expression and the pathology of transthyretin amyloidosis (Gonçalves2017Differential).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), CTSE expression is upregulated in CD4+ T cells due to hypomethylation and mutations affecting the binding of the transcription factor Kaiso. This upregulation is associated with increased IL-10 secretion, which may exacerbate lupus by affecting T cell dynamics (Hiramatsu2019Regulation).

CTSE deficiency has been shown to ameliorate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by reducing dendritic cell motility and tissue infiltration, suggesting a role in immune regulation during allo-SCT (Mengwasser2017Cathepsin).

In cancer, CTSE is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other malignancies, making it a potential early biomarker for these diseases (Pontious2019Cathepsin).
