# TOP1MT

## Overview
The TOP1MT gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme DNA topoisomerase I mitochondrial, which is a type IB topoisomerase. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining the integrity and proper function of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by alleviating torsional stress during replication, transcription, and translation processes. Unlike other human topoisomerases, TOP1MT is exclusively localized in mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in preventing excessive negative supercoiling and ensuring the smooth progression of mtDNA transactions. The protein's activity is essential for mitochondrial health, impacting cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and the synthesis of proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation. Dysregulation of TOP1MT has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Douarre2012Mitochondrial; Baechler2019Beyond; Baechler2019The).

## Structure
The human TOP1MT protein, encoded by the TOP1MT gene, is a type IB topoisomerase that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA topology. The primary structure of TOP1MT includes a mitochondrial targeting signal at its N-terminus, which facilitates its localization to the mitochondria (Zhang2017Distribution). The protein's secondary structure comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, with amino acid 256 located at the junction of two β-sheets, exposed on the protein's surface (Zhang2017Distribution).

TOP1MT's tertiary structure is characterized by a core domain, a linker domain, and a C-terminal domain containing the catalytic tyrosine, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Zhang2017Distribution). The protein's structure allows it to relax both positive and negative DNA supercoils, a function critical for mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (Pommier2022Human).

The protein also contains specific domains, such as the catalytic core domain, which is highly conserved and crucial for its function (Zhang2017Distribution). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence its activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. There is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the context provided.

## Function
TOP1MT (DNA topoisomerase I mitochondrial) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and function. It is involved in the regulation of mtDNA replication, transcription, and translation by alleviating torsional stress through the relaxation of supercoiled DNA. This process is essential for proper mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Douarre2012Mitochondrial; Baechler2019Beyond).

TOP1MT is unique among human topoisomerases as it is exclusively localized in mitochondria, where it prevents excessive negative supercoiling and releases topological stress during mtDNA replication and transcription (Baechler2019Beyond). In healthy cells, TOP1MT helps maintain mtDNA topology, which is crucial for normal gene transactions and cellular functions (Dang2022Mitochondrial). It also supports mitochondrial protein synthesis by participating in the assembly and function of mitoribosomes, which are essential for translating the 13 proteins encoded by mtDNA that are part of the oxidative phosphorylation enzyme complexes (Baechler2019Beyond).

The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial health, impacting cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and the supply of macromolecules necessary for cell proliferation (Baechler2019The). In the absence of TOP1MT, cells experience mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by increased reactive oxygen species production and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Douarre2012Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TOP1MT gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, TOP1MT is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth by maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and supporting mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation. Its deficiency has been shown to attenuate tumor growth in colon and liver cancer models, suggesting its potential as a target for anticancer therapies (Baechler2019The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, low TOP1MT expression correlates with better prognosis, indicating its role in promoting tumor growth (Baechler2019The).

In gastric cancer, TOP1MT expression is negatively correlated with glycolysis, and its deficiency enhances glycolysis through the stimulation of PDK4 expression, affecting cancer cell metabolism (Wang2024Deficiency). Variants of TOP1MT, such as P193L, have been associated with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), potentially through the activation of the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway due to mitochondrial DNA release (Khatib2022Activation).

TOP1MT also plays a role in preventing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) by maintaining mitochondrial function and limiting inflammation in the liver (Baechler2024Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TOP1MT in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
TOP1MT, a mitochondrial topoisomerase, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial DNA maintenance. It localizes to mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein granules and associates with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, suggesting a role in mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation (Baechler2019Beyond). TOP1MT interacts specifically with MRPS22, a component of the small mitoribosomal subunit, impacting mitochondrial translation (Baechler2019The). 

Pulldown experiments followed by mass spectrometry have shown that nearly half of the proteins associated with TOP1MT are involved in mitochondrial translation and are constituents of the mitoribosome (Baechler2019The). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding of TOP1MT to MRPS22, further supporting its role in mitochondrial translation processes (Baechler2019The). 

TOP1MT also interacts with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT, suggesting its involvement in regulating supercoiling during mitochondrial transcription (Menger2022Two). Its activity is stimulated by the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), which enhances its ability to relieve supercoiling during transcription and replication (Menger2022Two). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TOP1MT in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity.
