# GABRR1

## Overview
The GABRR1 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit rho1, a component of the GABA_A receptor family, which functions as a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is primarily involved in inhibitory neurotransmission within the central nervous system, particularly influencing visual processing and neural inhibition through modulation of chloride ion flow (GarcíaMartín2010Gammaaminobutyric). Unlike classical GABA_A receptors, the rho1 subunit forms GABA_A-r (or GABA_C) receptors through homo-oligomerization with other rho subunits, such as GABRR2 and GABRR3, and does not associate with typical GABA_A subunits (Mullins2010Fine). Beyond its neurological roles, GABRR1 is also expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitors, where it plays a regulatory role in hematopoiesis, linking neural and hematopoietic systems (Zhu2019The). This dual functionality underscores the gene's significance in both neural and blood cell development, with potential implications for clinical applications.

## Function
The GABRR1 gene encodes the rho1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor modulates chloride ion flow, contributing to neuronal hyperpolarization and reducing neuronal excitability. GABRR1 is primarily active in the retina and other brain regions, influencing visual processing and overall neural inhibition (GarcíaMartín2010Gammaaminobutyric).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, GABRR1 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), where it influences hematopoiesis. GABRR1-positive HSCs and MkPs respond to GABA, and its expression affects the differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocyte and erythrocyte progenitors. Knockout of GABRR1 reduces MkP differentiation and platelet numbers, while overexpression promotes MkP generation and megakaryocyte colonies (Zhu2019The). This suggests a regulatory role for GABRR1 in linking neural and hematopoietic systems, with potential implications for clinical applications requiring platelet generation (Zhu2019The).

## Interactions
The GABRR1 gene encodes the rho1 subunit of the GABA_A receptor, which is involved in forming GABA_A-r (or GABA_C) receptors through homo-oligomerization with other rho subunits, such as GABRR2 and GABRR3. These receptors are distinct from the classical GABA_A receptors, as they do not oligomerize with the typical GABA_A subunits (Mullins2010Fine).

In the context of psychiatric disorders, the cytoplasmic domains of GABRR1 and GABRR2 have been shown to interact with microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B). This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper GABAergic transmission, as disruptions can affect the inward current of GABA_C receptors in retinal slices. The regulation of MAP1B is linked to the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and its abnormal expression has been observed in FMR1-knockout mice, suggesting a potential mechanism for altered GABAergic signaling in schizophrenia and mood disorders (Fatemi2013mRNA).

These interactions highlight the role of GABRR1 in synaptic scaffolding and signaling, influencing receptor localization and function, which may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of certain psychiatric conditions.
