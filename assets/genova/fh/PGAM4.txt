# PGAM4

## Overview
Phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4 (PGAM4) is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the phosphoglycerate mutase family, which plays a pivotal role in the glycolytic pathway. The protein encoded by PGAM4 functions as an isomerase, facilitating the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate, a critical step in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (Jin2013ThePGAM4gene). This enzymatic activity is crucial for cellular energy production, particularly in cells with high energy demands. PGAM4 is predominantly expressed in the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, specifically in spermatids and spermatozoa, where it is localized to the principal piece of the flagellum and the acrosome, suggesting a role in sperm motility and the acrosome reaction (Jin2013ThePGAM4gene; Okuda2012A). Additionally, PGAM4 has been implicated in male infertility and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both reproductive biology and oncology (Okuda2012A; Yang2023Comprehensive).

## Function
PGAM4 (phosphoglycerate mutase family member 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the glycolytic pathway, a critical process for energy production in cells. The protein functions as an isomerase, facilitating the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate, a key step in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis (Jin2013ThePGAM4gene). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, particularly in cells with high energy demands.

PGAM4 is specifically expressed in the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, predominantly in spermatids and spermatozoa, and is located in the principal piece of the flagellum and the acrosome of ejaculated spermatozoa (Jin2013ThePGAM4gene; Okuda2012A). This localization suggests a role in sperm motility and the acrosome reaction, both of which are crucial for successful fertilization (Okuda2012A). The gene's expression in these specific cell types indicates its potential involvement in enhancing the function of male spermatogenic cells, possibly by supporting the energy requirements necessary for sperm motility and fertilization processes (Okuda2012A). PGAM4's activity is lower compared to its homolog PGAM1, but it may have been recruited during primate evolution to fulfill specialized roles in male fertility (Okuda2012A).

## Clinical Significance
The PGAM4 gene has been implicated in male infertility, particularly through the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) known as G75C. This SNP results in a Trp25Cys substitution, which significantly decreases the enzymatic activity of PGAM4, potentially impairing glycolytic capacity and reducing sperm motility. The G75C SNP was found in a higher percentage of infertile men compared to fertile controls, suggesting a link between this genetic variation and male infertility (Okuda2012A). However, the presence of this SNP in some fertile individuals indicates a complex relationship, possibly involving compensatory mechanisms by other enzymes (Okuda2012A).

In the context of cancer, PGAM4 has been studied for its role in pancreatic cancer, where it is one of the most mutated genes among mitochondrial energy metabolism pathway-related genes. These mutations, primarily missense, are associated with differences in expression and survival outcomes, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and immune invasion (Yang2023Comprehensive). In colorectal carcinoma, PGAM4 is downregulated in samples without KRAS mutations, indicating its involvement in carbohydrate metabolism and potential as a candidate for further investigation in cancer development (Pira2020Landscape).
