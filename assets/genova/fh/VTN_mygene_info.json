Differential expression of this protein can promote either cell adhesion or migration as it links cells to the extracellular matrix through a variety of ligands. These ligands include integrins, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor. This secreted protein can be present in the plasma as a monomer or dimer and forms a multimer in the extracellular matrix of several tissues. This protein also inhibits the membrane-damaging effect of the terminal cytolytic complement pathway and binds to several serpin serine protease inhibitors. This protein can also promote extracellular matrix degradation and thus plays a role in tumorigenesis. It is involved in a variety of other biological processes such as the regulation of the coagulation pathway, wound healing, and tissue remodeling. The heparin-binding domain of this protein give it anti-microbial properties. It is also a lipid binding protein that forms a principal component of high density lipoprotein.
