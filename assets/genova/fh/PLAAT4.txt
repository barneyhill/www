# PLAAT4

## Overview
PLAAT4, or phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of PLAAT4 is categorized as a phospholipase and acyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis and transfer of acyl groups in glycerophospholipids. This enzyme is integral to the production of bioactive lipids, such as N-acylethanolamines, which are involved in various physiological processes including anti-inflammatory responses and fat metabolism (Zhao2023Phospholipase; Mardian2015The). PLAAT4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is implicated in cellular processes such as differentiation, apoptosis, and immune response regulation. The protein is characterized by a catalytic domain with a conserved cysteine-histidine-histidine triad and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain that targets it to cellular membranes, facilitating its diverse biological functions (Chatterjee2021Protein; Zhao2023Phospholipase). Its expression is modulated by factors such as retinoic acids and interferons, linking it to both normal physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Zeng2023Identification; Zhao2023Phospholipase).

## Structure
PLAAT4, also known as phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4, is a protein characterized by a catalytic domain that includes a highly conserved 'NCEHFV' motif. This motif contains a cysteine active site, which is part of a cysteine-histidine-histidine catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic function, similar to those found in the NlpC/P60 superfamily (Zhao2023Phospholipase). The protein's structure is less compact and more flexible compared to its homolog PLAAT3, with a lower melting temperature of 62.5 °C, indicating a less rigid structure (Chatterjee2021Protein). PLAAT4's secondary structure includes three or four α-helices and an antiparallel β-sheet, akin to papain-like proteases (Chatterjee2021Protein).

PLAAT4 also features a 30 amino-acid hydrophobic transmembrane domain following the catalytic domain, which targets it to cell membranes such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus. This domain is crucial for its biological functions, including pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activities (Zhao2023Phospholipase). The protein's dynamics are influenced by a flexible loop region, which affects its enzymatic activity (Chatterjee2021Protein). PLAAT4 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, and its transcription is regulated by retinoic acids, DNA-damaging stimuli, and interferons (Zhao2023Phospholipase).

## Function
Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4 (PLAAT4) is a multifunctional enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, primarily through its phospholipase A1/A2 and acyltransferase activities. It catalyzes the transfer of acyl chains from glycerophospholipids to phosphatidylethanolamine, producing N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), which are precursors to bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (Zhao2023Phospholipase; Mardian2015The). These bioactive lipids are involved in anti-inflammatory processes, fat catabolism, and act as ligands for cannabinoid receptors (Chatterjee2021Protein).

PLAAT4 is expressed ubiquitously in human cells and plays a protective role across various tissues. It is involved in promoting differentiation and apoptosis while inhibiting cell proliferation, particularly in keratinocytes, where it interacts with transglutaminase I to produce a cornified envelope essential for skin barrier function (Zhao2023Phospholipase; Mardian2015The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by transcription factors such as p53 and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), which bind to its promoter, and its expression can be induced by retinoic acids and DNA-damaging stimuli (Zhao2023Phospholipase).

PLAAT4 also localizes to various cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus, where it exerts its biological functions, such as pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activities (Zhao2023Phospholipase).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLAAT4 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In cancer, PLAAT4 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression being reduced in several types of tumors, such as breast, colorectal, and testicular cancers. This reduction is associated with increased tumor metastasis and progression (Zhao2023Phospholipase). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), however, PLAAT4 is paradoxically overexpressed and correlates with a worse prognosis, suggesting a complex role in this cancer type (Ouyang2024Combining).

In Alzheimer's disease, PLAAT4 is up-regulated in the cerebral cortex, and its expression is associated with lipid metabolism and immune response pathways. This suggests a potential role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (Zeng2023Identification). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and immune regulation highlights its significance in both cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where its altered expression may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Zeng2023Identification).

PLAAT4 also plays a role in pathogen restriction, acting as a restriction factor for certain viruses and parasites. Its expression is regulated by interferons and retinoic acids, linking it to immune responses and stress conditions (Zhao2023Phospholipase).

## Interactions
PLAAT4, also known as phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4, engages in various interactions with other proteins that influence its role in tumor suppression and pathogen restriction. In normal keratinocytes, PLAAT4 interacts with type I transglutaminase, promoting differentiation and apoptosis while inhibiting cell proliferation (Zhao2023Phospholipase). In cancer cells, PLAAT4 localizes near the centrosome, where it inhibits centrosome separation during mitosis and induces apoptosis (Zhao2023Phospholipase). In HtTA cervical cancer cells, PLAAT4 forms a complex with ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0), which reduces cell-cycle regulatory proteins and enhances the pro-apoptotic protein BAX (Zhao2023Phospholipase). PLAAT4 also interacts with the RAS protein, altering its subcellular distribution and facilitating its degradation, leading to decreased RAS activation (Zhao2023Phospholipase).

PLAAT4 is involved in the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes and is a downstream target of IRF1 and IFN signals, playing a role in IFN-dependent innate immunity (Zhao2023Phospholipase). It also interacts with prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), promoting prostaglandin D2 production and activating the DP1 receptor/cAMP/SOX9 signaling pathway, which suppresses metastasis (Zhao2023Phospholipase).
