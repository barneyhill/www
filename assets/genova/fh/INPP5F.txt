# INPP5F

## Overview
INPP5F is a gene that encodes the enzyme inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F, which is a critical component of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. This enzyme is classified as a phosphatase and is involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), thereby modulating key cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and migration (Zhu2009Inpp5f). The protein plays a significant role in regulating the Akt and Gsk3β signaling pathways, particularly in cardiac tissues, where it helps maintain normal cardiac function and structure by modulating responses to stress-induced hypertrophic stimuli (Zhu2009Inpp5f). INPP5F is also involved in neuronal development and cardiovascular function, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Zhu2009Inpp5f). Its interactions with various proteins, such as STAT3 and ASPH, further underscore its involvement in complex cellular signaling networks, influencing both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions like cancer and diabetic cardiomyopathy (Zhou2022INPP5F; Kim2014Inositol).

## Function
INPP5F encodes inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide signaling pathways. It primarily functions by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a key signaling molecule involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth, survival, and migration (Zhu2009Inpp5f). By reducing PIP3 levels, INPP5F modulates the activity of the Akt and Gsk3β signaling pathways, which are critical in regulating cardiac hypertrophic responses (Zhu2009Inpp5f).

In healthy cells, INPP5F is active in the cytoplasm and membrane, where it influences neuronal development and cardiovascular function, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Zhu2009Inpp5f). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the heart, where it helps modulate the heart's response to stress-induced hypertrophic stimuli, maintaining normal cardiac structure and function under unstressed conditions (Zhu2009Inpp5f). INPP5F's ability to degrade both PIP2 and PIP3 by removing the 5' phosphate from the inositol ring highlights its role in regulating phosphoinositide signaling and downstream cellular processes (Zhu2009Inpp5f).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the INPP5F gene have been implicated in several diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In diabetic cardiomyopathy, INPP5F acts as a negative regulator of the Akt signaling pathway. Its increased expression, driven by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, disrupts the protective insulin-INPP5F-Akt feedback loop, leading to worsened cardiac function (Bai2016Hyperglycemia).

In glioblastoma, INPP5F is frequently deleted or suppressed, correlating with enhanced tumorigenicity. It functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is crucial for glioma cell proliferation and survival. Loss of INPP5F expression is associated with decreased patient survival, highlighting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Kim2014Inositol).

In HCC, INPP5F is upregulated and promotes tumor growth by enhancing cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis. It interacts with aspartate-β-hydroxylase to activate the Notch signaling pathway, contributing to its oncogenic role. High INPP5F expression is linked to poor prognosis in HCC patients (Zhou2022INPP5F).

## Interactions
INPP5F, or inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F, participates in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular signaling pathways. In glioblastoma, INPP5F directly interacts with the STAT3 protein, inhibiting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. This interaction occurs with both wild-type and mutant forms of STAT3, indicating that it is independent of phosphorylation at the transactivation domain. INPP5F specifically interacts with the coiled-coil domain of STAT3, which is crucial for STAT3's activation and interaction with other proteins (Kim2014Inositol).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), INPP5F translocates to the cytoplasm and interacts with aspartate-β-hydroxylase (ASPH), activating the Notch signaling pathway. This interaction promotes the expression of genes such as HES1, HEY1, cyclin E1, and c-MYC, which are associated with cell proliferation and the G1/S phase transition (Zhou2022INPP5F). INPP5F also interacts with CRM1, a nuclear export protein, facilitating its cytoplasmic translocation, and with importin-α, which regulates its nuclear import (Zhou2022INPP5F).

In the endocytic pathway, INPP5F, also known as Sac2, colocalizes with OCRL on endocytic membranes and interacts with Rab5, a small GTPase, which is essential for its recruitment to endosomes (Nakatsu2015Sac2INPP5F). These interactions suggest that INPP5F is part of a complex network of proteins involved in cellular signaling and endocytosis.
