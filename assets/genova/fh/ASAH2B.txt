# ASAH2B

## Overview
ASAH2B is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2B, which plays a role in the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids, a critical process in sphingolipid metabolism. This enzyme is typically active in lysosomes and is involved in regulating cell signaling, apoptosis, and membrane structure. However, there is evidence suggesting that ASAH2B may be an enzymatically inactive protein due to gene duplication and truncation (Alexander2015The). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, including breast and oral cancer, where it influences cell growth and drug resistance through pathways such as mTOR (LI2018SilencinglncASAH2B2Inhibits; Shekari2023Investigation). Despite its significance in disease contexts, the precise role of ASAH2B in normal physiological conditions remains underexplored (Tang2013Cancer).

## Function
ASAH2B encodes the enzyme N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2B, which is involved in the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids. This process is crucial for sphingolipid metabolism, impacting cell signaling, apoptosis, and membrane structure. The enzyme is typically active in lysosomes, influencing cellular homeostasis and stress responses. However, some studies suggest that ASAH2B may be an enzymatically inactive protein, potentially due to gene duplication and truncation (Alexander2015The).

In the context of cancer, ASAH2B has been implicated in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth through the mTOR signaling pathway (Shekari2023Investigation). It is also identified as one of the key genes related to oral cancer, with significant potential in cancer risk assessment and prognosis (Shekari2023Investigation). Despite its involvement in cancer, specific details about the function of ASAH2B in healthy human cells remain limited. The gene's role in cell proliferation and death regulation has been noted, but its precise molecular activities in normal physiological conditions are not well-documented (Tang2013Cancer).

## Clinical Significance
The ASAH2B gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of oral cancer, increased expression of ASAH2B is associated with a higher risk of the disease. The gene was identified as a key factor in oral cancer prognosis using machine learning approaches, with a high area under the curve (AUC) value indicating its potential significance in risk assessment (Shekari2023Investigation).

In breast cancer, ASAH2B is involved in drug resistance. Specifically, the A1CF/ASAH2B copy number variant (CNV) status is predictive of resistance to lapatinib, a drug used in breast cancer treatment. Cell lines with amplification in A1CF/ASAH2B tend to be more resistant to this drug, suggesting a link between ASAH2B gene alterations and drug resistance (Tognetti2020Deciphering).

Additionally, the long non-coding RNA lnc-ASAH2B-2, related to ASAH2B, plays a role in breast cancer cell growth through the mTOR pathway. Up-regulation of lnc-ASAH2B-2 by everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, contributes to drug resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (LI2018SilencinglncASAH2B2Inhibits).
