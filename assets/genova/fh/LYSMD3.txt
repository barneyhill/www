# LYSMD3

## Overview
LYSMD3 is a gene that encodes the protein LysM domain containing 3, which functions as a pattern recognition receptor primarily in human lung epithelial cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor due to its localization on the plasma membrane, where it plays a crucial role in host-pathogen interactions by recognizing chitin, a key component of fungal cell walls (He2021LYSMD3:). The interaction of LYSMD3 with chitin oligosaccharides triggers immune responses, including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to the body's defense mechanisms against fungal infections (He2021LYSMD3:). Additionally, LYSMD3 is involved in the recognition of β-glucan structures, further highlighting its role in modulating immune responses through specific carbohydrate interactions (He2021LYSMD3:).

## Function
The LYSMD3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a pattern recognition receptor in human lung epithelial cells, specifically recognizing chitin, a component found in fungal cell walls. This protein is localized to the plasma membrane of human airway epithelial cells and is not found in the cytosolic fraction, indicating its role in host-pathogen interactions at the cell surface (He2021LYSMD3:). LYSMD3 binds directly to chitin oligosaccharides, facilitating the immune response by mediating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 upon stimulation with chitin oligomers or chitin-containing fungi (He2021LYSMD3:). This binding is specific to chitin and does not occur with other substances like bovine serum albumin or E. coli peptidoglycan (He2021LYSMD3:).

The activation of LYSMD3 is linked to the release of cytokines such as IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which are involved in type 2 immunity and allergic responses (He2021LYSMD3:). LYSMD3's role in immune signaling is specific to chitin recognition, as knockdown experiments showed that reducing LYSMD3 expression decreases cytokine production in response to chitin but not to other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (He2021LYSMD3:).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
LYSMD3, a mammalian pattern recognition receptor, is involved in specific interactions with chitin and β-glucan, components of fungal cell walls. The protein binds to chitin oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization of 5-7, as demonstrated by ELISA assays, and interacts with large, insoluble chitin particles. This interaction is specific, as chitin oligomers can inhibit the binding, indicating a competitive binding mechanism (He2021LYSMD3:). LYSMD3 also binds to β-glucan, specifically curdlan and laminarin, but not to soluble whole-glucan particles (WGP), suggesting a selective recognition of certain β-glucan structures (He2021LYSMD3:).

The binding of LYSMD3 to these carbohydrates is significant in mediating immune responses, as it can influence cytokine production. Knockdown of LYSMD3 in human bronchial epithelial cells reduces IL-8 release in response to fungal stimuli, indicating its role in signaling pathways that activate pro-inflammatory cytokines (He2021LYSMD3:). The study also highlights that LYSMD3's interaction with chitin and β-glucan can modulate NF-kB activation, a key pathway in immune response, by blocking chitin binding through preincubation with curdlan, laminarin, or chitin DP5 (He2021LYSMD3:).
