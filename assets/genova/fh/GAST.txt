# GAST

## Overview
The GAST gene is responsible for encoding the gastrin protein, a peptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in the digestive system. Gastrin is primarily involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, a critical process for effective digestion and nutrient absorption. It is categorized as a hormone and functions by stimulating enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, which in turn promote acid release from parietal cells in the stomach. Beyond its digestive functions, gastrin is also involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis, particularly within the gastric mucosa. The hormone exists in several biologically active forms, including progastrin and amidated gastrin, which are characterized by a conserved COOH-terminal pentapeptide motif essential for their activity (Zeng2020Gastrin).

## Function
The GAST gene encodes the gastrin protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. Gastrin is synthesized and released by mucosal G cells in the stomach in response to food intake. It primarily functions by stimulating enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells to secrete histamine, which subsequently induces acid release from parietal cells in the stomach lining. This process is essential for digestion and nutrient absorption, as it aids in breaking down food and maintaining an acidic environment in the stomach (Zeng2020Gastrin).

Gastrin also has roles beyond digestion, including involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is implicated in the regulation of mucosal cell growth, promoting the proliferation of gastric mucosal cells and DNA synthesis. This trophic action is particularly evident in the gastric mucosa, where gastrin administration can lead to increased parietal cell numbers and mucosal hyperplasia (Zeng2020Gastrin). Additionally, gastrin signaling through the CCK2 receptor (CCK2R) can stimulate apoptosis in certain gastric cells, highlighting its complex role in cellular processes (Zeng2020Gastrin). The biologically active forms of gastrin include progastrin, Gly-extended gastrin-17 or -34, and amidated gastrin-17 or -34, all of which share a conserved COOH-terminal pentapeptide motif essential for their biological activity (Zeng2020Gastrin).
