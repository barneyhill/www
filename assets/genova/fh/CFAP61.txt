# CFAP61

## Overview
CFAP61 is a gene that encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 61, which is integral to the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a component of the calmodulin-and spoke-associated complex (CSC), playing a pivotal role in the assembly and function of radial spokes, particularly radial spoke 3 (RS3), in motile cilia and flagella. CFAP61 is highly expressed in the testis and is crucial for the proper motility and morphology of sperm cells, contributing to male fertility by maintaining the organization of axonemal ultrastructures. Mutations in CFAP61 are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), conditions that underscore its clinical significance in reproductive health and ciliary function (Ma2022Biallelic; Urbanska2015The; Graziani2024Genetic).

## Function
The CFAP61 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of sperm flagella in humans. It is a mammalian ortholog of the calmodulin-and spoke-associated complex (CSC) subunits, which are essential for radial spoke assembly and ciliary motility. In healthy human cells, CFAP61 is highly expressed in the testis, indicating its importance in maintaining the normal structure of sperm flagella. This protein is crucial for proper sperm motility and morphology, as evidenced by its involvement in the organization of axonemal ultrastructures, which are vital for the motility of sperm cells (Ma2022Biallelic).

CFAP61 is active in the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it contributes to their stability and function. The absence of CFAP61 leads to disorganized axonemal structures, resulting in multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) and male infertility. This disruption is characterized by the loss of key axonemal proteins and the typical '9 + 2' axoneme arrangement, which is essential for the proper function of motile cilia and flagella (Ma2022Biallelic). The gene's role in maintaining the structural integrity of sperm flagella underscores its critical function in male fertility (Ma2022Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP61 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility due to aberrant flagellar phenotypes. This condition is linked to mutations in over 30 genes, including CFAP61, which is considered a novel gene associated with MMAF. The phenotypic manifestations of MMAF include reduced sperm motility, which can lead to male infertility (Graziani2024Genetic).

CFAP61 is also implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), an autosomal recessive disorder that results in immotile sperm with normal morphology. PCD is often linked to dynein arm defects, and genes causing MMAF can also result in PCD or PCD-like symptoms, suggesting a phenotypic continuum between these conditions (Graziani2024Genetic).

While the Urbanska study does not directly link FAP61 mutations to specific diseases, it emphasizes the importance of FAP61 in ciliary function. Defects in ciliary motility due to the absence of FAP61 can lead to conditions like PCD, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper ciliary function (Urbanska2015The).

## Interactions
CFAP61 is a component of the calmodulin and spoke-associated complex (CSC), which includes FAP61, FAP91, and FAP251. This complex is crucial for the assembly and function of radial spoke 3 (RS3) in cilia, particularly in organisms like Tetrahymena and Chlamydomonas (Urbanska2015The; Bicka2022Cfap91Dependent). CFAP61 interacts with other CSC subunits, such as FAP251 and FAP91, and is involved in the assembly of the RS3 structure (Urbanska2015The). The interaction between CFAP61 and the CSC is essential for maintaining the stability of inner dynein arms and radial spokes, which are critical for ciliary motility (Urbanska2015The).

In Tetrahymena, CFAP61 is part of the RS3 stalk and is transported to cilia independently of other proteins like Cfap91, Cfap206, and Cfap251. However, Cfap91 is required for the stable localization of CFAP61 in cilia, suggesting a sequential interaction where Cfap91 may act as an adaptor protein for the stable assembly of RS2 and RS3 base proteins (Bicka2022Cfap91Dependent). Despite potential calmodulin binding sites in CFAP61, no direct interaction with calmodulin was confirmed in experiments (Bicka2022Cfap91Dependent). The study of CFAP61 in human spermatozoa has shown that its absence leads to disorganization of axonemal structures, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity of flagella (Ma2022Biallelic).
