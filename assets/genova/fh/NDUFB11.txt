# NDUFB11

## Overview
NDUFB11 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B11, a small accessory protein integral to the mitochondrial respiratory chain's Complex I. This protein is a crucial component of the oxidative phosphorylation system, facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, which is essential for ATP synthesis. NDUFB11 is characterized as an integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane helix, contributing to the assembly and stability of Complex I by interacting with other subunits and maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (AmateGarcía2023A; Padavannil2022The). The gene produces two isoforms through alternative splicing, with the shorter isoform being the canonical form necessary for the protein's stability and function (AmateGarcía2023A). Mutations in NDUFB11 are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction (Rea2016Histiocytoid; Torraco2016A).

## Structure
The NDUFB11 protein is a small integral membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I (CI). It consists of a single transmembrane helix (TMH) and is part of the membrane arm of CI. The protein has a long N-terminal coil located in the mitochondrial matrix and a C-terminal α-helix and coil in the intermembrane space (IMS) (Padavannil2022The). The N-terminal 50 amino acids are disordered, but the resolved residues interact with several other subunits, including NDUFA10, NDUFS2, NDUFB4, and NDUFB9, and bind across the matrix side of the membrane arm (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFB11 has two isoforms produced by alternative splicing: a short 153 amino acid isoform and a longer 163 amino acid isoform. The longer isoform includes an additional 10 amino acids, which may regulate CI assembly by sequestering interaction partners and blocking ND4 association (Padavannil2022The). The TMH of NDUFB11 predominantly binds to the ND4 subunit and also pins a lipid molecule to the surface of ND4, contributing to the formation of a lipid-filled cavity between ND4 and ND5 (Padavannil2022The). This structural arrangement is essential for the stability and function of complex I.

## Function
The NDUFB11 gene encodes a small accessory subunit of mitochondrial Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (AmateGarcía2023A). Complex I is the largest multimeric enzyme complex in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, consisting of 44 different structural subunits, and serves as the entry point for electrons from NADH (AmateGarcía2023A). These electrons are transferred to ubiquinone, a process that drives proton pumping across the mitochondrial membrane, generating a membrane potential used for ATP synthesis (AmateGarcía2023A; Liu2024SSR4).

NDUFB11 is located on the X chromosome and is expressed as two mRNA transcript isoforms, with the short transcript being the canonical form essential for the synthesis of a stable NDUFB11 protein (AmateGarcía2023A). This protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism by contributing to the stability and proper assembly of Complex I, ensuring efficient electron transport and energy production (AmateGarcía2023A; Liu2024SSR4). Proper function of NDUFB11 is critical for maintaining the efficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can modulate various signaling pathways (AmateGarcía2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFB11 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders due to its role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. These mutations can lead to complex I deficiencies, which are significant causes of mitochondrial diseases. Clinical manifestations of NDUFB11 mutations include lactic acidosis, sideroblastic anemia, and neonatal lethal cardiomyopathy (AmateGarcía2023A; Torraco2016A). 

A novel mutation in NDUFB11 has been linked to a new clinical phenotype characterized by lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia, with a significant defect in complex I activity observed in muscle biopsy and fibroblasts (Torraco2016A). Another mutation, c.338G>A, causes neonatal lethal cardiomyopathy by affecting mRNA splicing, leading to the expression of a non-functional alternative transcript and severe complex I assembly defects, particularly in the heart (AmateGarcía2023A).

NDUFB11 mutations also contribute to conditions such as histiocytoid cardiomyopathy and microphthalmia with linear skin defects syndrome (MLS), characterized by neurodevelopmental and skin defects (van2015Mutations; Rea2016Histiocytoid). The phenotypic variability in patients with NDUFB11 mutations may be influenced by factors such as somatic mosaicism and X-inactivation (Reinson2019Diverse).

## Interactions
NDUFB11 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This subunit is essential for the assembly and function of complex I, interacting with other subunits to facilitate electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone. NDUFB11 is part of the distal P-module subassemblies, which accumulate in the absence of functional assembly factors like NDUFAF4, indicating its involvement in complex I assembly (Baertling2017NDUFAF4).

NDUFB11 is also associated with the MWFE subunit, encoded by the NDUFA1 gene, and both are essential for the assembly of an active complex I (Scheffler2014Mitochondrial). In the context of diabetic cardiomyopathy, NDUFB11 expression is downregulated, suggesting its potential role in altered mitochondrial metabolic profiles (Gomes2022Proteomic).

The import and maturation of the NDUFB11 subunit, also known as the ESSS subunit, are not affected by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or alkaline phosphatase, unlike other subunits such as NDUFS4, which require phosphorylation for mitochondrial import (De2008cAMPdependent).
