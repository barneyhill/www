# ANTXRL

## Overview
The ANTXRL gene encodes a protein known as ANTXR-like, which is a member of the anthrax toxin receptor family. This protein is categorized as a receptor and is involved in various cellular processes, including mediating interactions with extracellular matrix components and potentially playing a role in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways. ANTXR-like proteins are structurally characterized by their von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domains, which are crucial for ligand binding and receptor function. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in pathological conditions and their involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
