# ERFL

## Overview
The ERFL gene encodes the ETS repressor factor-like protein, which is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. The ETS repressor factor-like protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, modulating the expression of genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Its role in these pathways suggests that it may have implications in oncogenesis and other diseases where dysregulation of gene expression is a factor (Qiu2020aarFDC).
