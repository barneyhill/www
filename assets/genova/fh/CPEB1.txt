# CPEB1

## Overview
CPEB1, or cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation. The protein, characterized by its RNA recognition motifs and zinc finger domain, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. As a regulatory protein, CPEB1 influences the polyadenylation and translation of target mRNAs by binding to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements in their 3' untranslated regions. Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which allows it to switch between roles as a translational repressor and activator, thereby responding to cellular signals. CPEB1 is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and reproductive health disorders, due to its involvement in mRNA translation and stability (Shao2021DNA; Pascual2020mRNA; Kozlov2021The).

## Structure
CPEB1 is a protein characterized by its RNA binding capabilities, facilitated by two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc finger domain. The RRMs are crucial for binding to specific mRNA sequences, with the first RRM (RRM1) being particularly important for enhancing RNA binding affinity (Hake1998Specificity). The zinc finger domain, which requires a Zn2+ cofactor, is essential for maintaining the structure necessary for RNA interaction. This domain includes a metal coordination region where zinc ions are coordinated by cysteine and histidine residues (Hake1998Specificity).

CPEB1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which influences its activity and enhances its RNA binding ability during oocyte maturation (Hake1998Specificity). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including a long form and a short form, with the latter being a 68 amino acid N-terminal truncation of the long form. A novel variant, CPEB1-∆5, includes a five amino acid deletion in RRM1, potentially affecting RNA binding properties (Wilczynska2005The). These isoforms exhibit tissue-specific expression, suggesting distinct functional roles in different cellular contexts (Wilczynska2005The).

## Function
CPEB1 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 1) is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation in human cells. It binds to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in the 3' untranslated regions of target mRNAs, influencing their polyadenylation and translation efficiency (Kozlov2021The). CPEB1 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression by regulating the localization and translation of mRNAs associated with the mitotic spindle, such as CCNB1 and BUB3, which are essential for proper chromosome segregation and mitotic progression (Pascual2020mRNA).

In the nervous system, CPEB1 is involved in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. It regulates the transport and localization of mRNAs related to neuronal growth and branching, such as β-catenin mRNAs, and is crucial for long-term potentiation and memory formation (Kozlov2021The). CPEB1 also influences energy metabolism by regulating the translation of mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function, such as NDUFV2, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I (Kozlov2021The).

CPEB1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which switches its role from a translational repressor to an activator, allowing it to respond dynamically to cellular signals and maintain proper cellular functions (Pascual2020mRNA; Kozlov2021The).

## Clinical Significance
CPEB1 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In cancer, CPEB1 acts as a tumor suppressor, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). Hypermethylation of the CPEB1 promoter leads to decreased expression, which is associated with increased tumor growth, migration, invasion, and reduced apoptosis in CRC. This epigenetic modification affects the binding of transcription factors CEBPB and TFCP2, contributing to cancer metastasis (Shao2021DNA). CPEB1 is also linked to other cancers, including those of the reproductive system, brain, digestive system, and blood cells, where it is generally downregulated, increasing susceptibility to tumorigenesis (Ivshina2014Cytoplasmic).

In reproductive health, CPEB1 is crucial for gametogenesis, and its knockout in mice results in sterility due to halted gametogenesis at the pachytene stage (Ivshina2014Cytoplasmic). In humans, deletions in the CPEB1 gene have been associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), although such deletions are rare (Hyon2016Deletion; Jiao2020CPEB1). These deletions may lead to haploinsufficiency, contributing to POI by disrupting meiosis and oogenesis (Hyon2016Deletion).

## Interactions
CPEB1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA translation and stability. It forms complexes with components of the translational machinery, such as the CCR4-NOT complex, CPSF2, DDX6, eIF4ENIF, and eIF4E1b, but does not interact with Maskin or PARN in Xenopus oocyte cytoplasmic extracts (DuranArqué2022Comparative). CPEB1 also associates with the polyadenylation machinery, including CPSF and symplekin, which are crucial for its role in controlling polyadenylation (DuranArqué2022Comparative).

CPEB1's interaction with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is essential for its degradation. This interaction can occur in both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners, with the phosphorylation of Ser210 being crucial for recognition by the SCF β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase (Schelhorn2015Structural). In the context of mitosis, CPEB1 is localized at the mitotic spindle, where it interacts with components of the translational machinery, suggesting its involvement in the localization and local translation of CPE-containing mRNAs (Pascual2020mRNA).

CPEB1 also binds to specific RNA sequences, influencing mRNA localization and translation. It is involved in the translational regulation of mRNAs such as CCNB1, NEK9, and PLK1, which are crucial for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Pascual2020mRNA).
