# CXorf65

## Overview
The CXorf65 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 65. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. While the specific biological functions of CXorf65 remain to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern and potential interactions with other cellular components indicate a role in various physiological pathways. Research into the gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its contributions to cellular homeostasis and its implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
