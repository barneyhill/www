# METTL8

## Overview
The METTL8 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 8, tRNA N3-cytidine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs, specifically catalyzing the formation of 3-methylcytosine (m3C) at position 32 in mitochondrial tRNA Thr and mt-tRNA Ser(UCN) (Lentini2021METTL8; Kleiber2022The). The METTL8 protein is characterized by a methyltransferase domain and a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which facilitates its localization to the mitochondrial matrix, where it performs its essential functions in RNA modification (He2024METTL; Kleiber2022The). Beyond its role in mitochondrial RNA processing, METTL8 is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing and maturation, through its interactions with multiple protein complexes (Zhang2020The). Alterations in METTL8 expression have been associated with several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020The; Lee2024METTL8).

## Structure
The METTL8 protein is a mitochondrial RNA methyltransferase involved in the modification of mitochondrial tRNAs, specifically introducing m3C32 modifications into tRNAsThr/Ser(UCN) (Kleiber2022The). The full-length METTL8 protein consists of 407 amino acids and contains a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at its N-terminus, which is crucial for its localization to the mitochondrial matrix (Lentini2021METTL8; Kleiber2022The). This MTS is essential for METTL8's function in m3C modification, as demonstrated by the inability of METTL8 lacking the MTS to restore m3C formation in knockout cells (Lentini2021METTL8).

METTL8 possesses a methyltransferase domain, which is a characteristic feature of the METTL protein family, known for their roles in RNA methylation (He2024METTL). The protein's structure includes an Ado-MTase domain, which is involved in methylation modifications (He2024METTL). METTL8 also forms complexes with other proteins, such as mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (SARS2), indicating its involvement in modifying mitochondrial RNAs (Lentini2021METTL8). The protein's localization and function are influenced by alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including METTL8-iso1, which is localized in mitochondria (He2024METTL).

## Function
METTL8 is a methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the modification of mitochondrial tRNAs in human cells. It is responsible for catalyzing the formation of 3-methylcytosine (m3C) at position 32 in mitochondrial tRNA Thr and mt-tRNA Ser(UCN) (Lentini2021METTL8; Kleiber2022The). This modification is essential for optimizing the structure and function of these tRNAs, which in turn influences mitochondrial translation (Kleiber2022The). METTL8 interacts with the anticodon stem loops of these tRNAs, recognizing specific nucleotide sequences necessary for its methylation activity (Kleiber2022The).

The presence of m3C32 contributes to the correct folding and stability of mt-tRNA Thr and mt-tRNA Ser(UCN), which is vital for their function in mitochondrial translation (Kleiber2022The). Although the absence of METTL8 does not affect the aminoacylation of these tRNAs, it does lead to structural impairments that can compromise their functional capacity, as evidenced by slower growth rates in METTL8 knockout cells (Kleiber2022The). METTL8's activity is localized to the mitochondria, facilitated by its N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal, which is crucial for its import and function within the organelle (Lentini2021METTL8).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the METTL8 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and breast cancer. In GBM, METTL8 is overexpressed and associated with poor patient outcomes. It plays a critical role in maintaining glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and resistance to therapies. The overexpression of METTL8 in GSCs is linked to H2AZ-mediated chromatin accessibility and HIF1α regulation, contributing to the maintenance of stemness and tumorigenicity (Lee2024METTL8). METTL8 depletion in GSCs impairs self-renewal and increases sensitivity to Akt inhibitors, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lee2024METTL8).

In breast cancer, METTL8 is upregulated and enhances cancer cell migration by modulating ARID1A protein levels through mRNA modification. This upregulation is influenced by the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which is highly expressed in breast cancer (Lee2021METTL8). METTL8's role in cancer progression is further supported by its involvement in R-loop stabilization, which is linked to tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (Zhang2020The). These findings highlight METTL8's significance in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
METTL8, a methyltransferase enzyme, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms complexes with several known protein complexes, including the nucleolar SWAP complex, DNAPK complex, and the Tho/Trex complex, which is a well-established R-loop regulator. These interactions suggest METTL8's role in RNA splicing and maturation (Zhang2020The). METTL8 also interacts with THOC2 and RPA3, both involved in R-loop regulation, indicating its potential role in this pathway (Zhang2020The).

METTL8 is part of a large SUMOylated nuclear RNA-binding protein complex that includes factors related to R-loops. Its interaction with RNAs is crucial for maintaining R-loop stability in specific gene regions (Zhang2020The). METTL8 has been shown to bind directly to ARID1A mRNA, affecting its translation and playing a role in cancer cell migration (Lee2021METTL8).

In mitochondrial contexts, METTL8 interacts with mitochondrial-encoded RNA species, particularly mt-tRNAs, and installs m3C32 modifications on mt-tRNA Thr and mt-tRNA Ser(UCN), optimizing their structure and function in mitochondrial translation (Kleiber2022The). These interactions highlight METTL8's multifaceted role in RNA modification and cellular processes.
