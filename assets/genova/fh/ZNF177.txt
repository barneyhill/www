# ZNF177

## Overview
ZNF177 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 177, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA. These proteins often function as transcription factors, playing critical roles in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 177 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the transcription of target genes. The precise biological functions and pathways involving ZNF177 are still under investigation, but its role in transcriptional regulation suggests it may have significant implications in developmental biology and disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
