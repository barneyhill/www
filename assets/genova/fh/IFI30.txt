# IFI30

## Overview
The IFI30 gene encodes the gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), a lysosomal enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating antigen processing. GILT is primarily involved in the reduction of disulfide bonds within lysosomes, a process essential for the degradation of proteins and the presentation of antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. This function is crucial for the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, thereby influencing immune responses. The enzyme is constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells and can be induced by gamma-interferon in other cell types, highlighting its importance in immune regulation (Arunachalam2000Enzymatic; Hastings2011Disulfide). GILT's activity is optimal in the acidic environment of lysosomes, and it also contributes to the cross-presentation of MHC class I-restricted epitopes, impacting cellular redox states and processes such as mitochondrial autophagy (Rausch2015Diverse; Hastings2011Disulfide).

## Structure
The IFI30 gene encodes the gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), a protein involved in antigen processing. The primary structure of GILT consists of 261 amino acids, including a 37 amino acid signal sequence and a 224 amino acid precursor form (Hastings2011Disulfide). The protein contains a thioredoxin-like CXXC motif, with Cys-46 and Cys-49 forming the active site crucial for its reductase activity (Hastings2011Disulfide; Phan2002[5]). 

GILT undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and is tagged with mannose-6-phosphate residues, which target it to the endocytic pathway (Hastings2011Disulfide). The precursor form is processed into a mature 28 kDa protein in the lysosomal system, where it is active at acidic pH (Satoh2018Microglia). 

The tertiary structure of GILT is characterized by a compact, globular form, and it can form disulfide-linked dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Hastings2011Disulfide). The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to its functional diversity, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The IFI30 gene encodes the gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), a crucial enzyme in the reduction of disulfide bonds within lysosomes. This reduction is essential for the degradation of proteins and the processing of antigens, facilitating their presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. GILT is constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes, macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells, and can be induced by gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) in other cell types (Arunachalam2000Enzymatic; Hastings2011Disulfide).

GILT is synthesized as a precursor and transported to endocytic compartments, where it becomes active after the removal of N-and C-terminal prosequences. It exhibits maximal reductase activity at acidic pH, typical of the lysosomal environment (Hastings2011Disulfide; Arunachalam2000Enzymatic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the exposure of epitopes that bind to MHC class II molecules, aiding in the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes (Hastings2011Disulfide).

GILT also plays a role in the cross-presentation of MHC class I-restricted epitopes, particularly from viral glycoproteins, and influences the cellular redox state, impacting processes like mitochondrial autophagy and superoxide levels (Rausch2015Diverse; Hastings2011Disulfide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFI30 gene, also known as gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), have been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and melanoma. In glioblastoma, high IFI30 expression is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype, poorer prognosis, and resistance to chemotherapy. It is linked to the activation of the IL6 and STAT signaling pathways, which may contribute to chemoresistance and malignant progression (IFI30; p&gt; Zhu2020&lt). IFI30 expression is also correlated with immune checkpoint genes and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which may influence treatment response and prognosis (IFI30; p&gt; Zhu2020&lt).

In breast cancer, high IFI30 expression is associated with worse overall survival, relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival. Knockdown of IFI30 in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting tumorigenesis (Fan2021IFI30).

In melanoma, high GILT expression, encoded by IFI30, is linked to improved survival outcomes. It is positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-1b, suggesting a role in enhancing immune responses against tumors (Buetow2019High).
