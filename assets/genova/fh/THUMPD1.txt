# THUMPD1

## Overview
THUMPD1 is a gene that encodes the THUMP domain containing 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in RNA modification processes, particularly in the acetylation of transfer RNA (tRNA). This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, facilitating the acetylation of tRNAs by interacting with NAT10, a tRNA acetyltransferase. The acetylation process, specifically the modification of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), is essential for maintaining proper tRNA levels and ensuring efficient protein synthesis by preventing ribosome stalling and collisions. THUMPD1 is active in the nucleolus, contributing to ribosomal RNA maturation and overall cellular protein synthesis. Its function is vital for maintaining translational efficiency and cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the THUMPD1 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental defects and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Sharma2015Yeast; Thalalla2024Transfer; Zhang2024N4acetylcytidine).

## Function
THUMPD1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the acetylation of transfer RNA (tRNA), specifically modifying N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), a conserved RNA modification crucial for maintaining proper tRNA levels, particularly tRNA Leu and tRNA Ser. This modification helps prevent ribosome stalling and collisions, thereby regulating protein synthesis and preventing the activation of stress signaling pathways, such as the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Thalalla2024Transfer).

In healthy human cells, THUMPD1 plays a critical role in maintaining translational efficiency and cellular homeostasis by ensuring optimal tRNA levels. The protein is active in the nucleolus, contributing to ribosomal RNA maturation and overall cellular protein synthesis (Thalalla2024Transfer). THUMPD1 functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating the acetylation of tRNAs by interacting with NAT10, a tRNA acetyltransferase, indicating its involvement in RNA processing and modification (Sharma2015Yeast).

The loss of THUMPD1 function can lead to reduced tRNA acetylation, causing ribosome collisions and activating stress response pathways, which can result in cellular dysfunction and apoptosis if compensatory mechanisms are insufficient (Thalalla2024Transfer).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the THUMPD1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In humans, rare bi-allelic mutations in THUMPD1 are associated with the loss of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in tRNA, leading to neurodevelopmental defects (Thalalla2024Transfer). These mutations can result in intellectual disability and hearing loss, as observed in studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to create THUMPD1-knockout cell lines, which mimic the pathogenic mechanism of these mutations (Wu2023The). 

In a specific family, a homozygous loss-of-function variant in THUMPD1 was linked to intellectual disability and trismus, a condition characterized by limited jaw opening (AlAbdi2023Diagnostic). The gene's role in cellular stress signaling and translation regulation suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to various physiological outcomes, including cellular dysfunction and disease (Thalalla2024Transfer).

Research also indicates a potential role for THUMPD1 in cancer metastasis. Reduced tRNA acetylation levels in heterozygous Thumpd1 mice were found to repress metastases, suggesting that alterations in THUMPD1 expression or function could influence cancer progression (Thalalla2024Transfer). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
THUMPD1 is known to interact with NAT10, a tRNA acetyltransferase, forming a complex that is crucial for tRNA acetylation in human cells. This interaction has been confirmed through co-precipitation experiments, indicating that THUMPD1 acts as an adaptor protein for NAT10, facilitating its function in tRNA modification (Sharma2015Yeast). The interaction between THUMPD1 and NAT10 is essential for the acetylation of tRNAs, as neither protein can catalyze the modification independently (Zhang2024N4acetylcytidine).

THUMPD1 also plays a role in the acetylation of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs), where it interacts with NAT10 to modify these RNAs with N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C). This modification enhances the binding of pri-miRNAs to the DGCR8 protein, part of the microprocessor complex involved in miRNA processing (Zhang2024N4acetylcytidine). The interaction between THUMPD1 and pri-miRNAs is dependent on the secondary structure of the pri-miRNAs, suggesting that THUMPD1 requires intact RNA structures for effective binding (Zhang2024N4acetylcytidine).

In the context of stress signaling, THUMPD1 interacts with the Gcn2 protein, a sensor kinase involved in the integrated stress response. This interaction is significant in regulating stress responses and has implications for understanding the role of tRNA modifications in stress signaling (Thalalla2024Transfer).
