# LARP4B

## Overview
LARP4B is a gene that encodes the La ribonucleoprotein 4B, a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA regulation and translation. This protein is part of the La-related protein family, characterized by the presence of a La module, which includes a La motif and an RNA recognition motif. These domains facilitate its interaction with RNA and ribosomal components, playing a crucial role in mRNA stability and translation regulation (Küspert2015LARP4B; Schäffler2010A). LARP4B is known to bind AU-rich sequences within the 3' untranslated regions of mRNAs, enhancing their stability and translation efficiency. It interacts with key proteins such as PABPC1 and RACK1, contributing to mRNA circularization and efficient translation reinitiation (Schäffler2010A). The protein's involvement in cellular growth processes and its association with polysomes and stress granules underscore its role in translation under both normal and stress conditions (Schäffler2010A). LARP4B has also been implicated in various cancers, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2024LARP4B; Coleman2023The).

## Structure
LARP4B is a cytoplasmic protein characterized by its La module, which includes a La motif (LaM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM-like domain) at its N-terminal region (Küspert2015LARP4B; Schäffler2010A). The LaM is a modified winged helix domain, featuring a 3-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by six helices, with a hydrophobic pocket that serves as the main RNA interaction site (DockBregeon2019The). This domain is crucial for RNA binding, although LARP4B lacks some conserved amino acids found in other La modules, which may influence its RNA-binding specificity (Küspert2015LARP4B).

The C-terminal region of LARP4B is essential for its interaction with ribosomal complexes, specifically binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for its role in translation (Schäffler2010A). LARP4B interacts with proteins such as PABPC1 and RACK1, with the C-terminal part alone being sufficient for interaction with RACK1 (Schäffler2010A). The protein's structure allows it to act as a binding platform for these proteins, facilitating its role in mRNA metabolism and translation regulation (Schäffler2010A). The exact molecular structure of LARP4B, including potential post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, remains to be fully elucidated.

## Function
LARP4B (La ribonucleoprotein 4B) is a protein involved in mRNA regulation, playing a crucial role in mRNA stability and translation in healthy human cells. It is part of an evolutionarily conserved family of RNA-binding proteins characterized by the La-module, which facilitates direct RNA binding. LARP4B interacts with the translation machinery and actively translating ribosomes, contributing to the mRNP code that determines mRNA fate and controls gene expression post-transcriptionally (Küspert2015LARP4B).

LARP4B binds to AU-rich sequences within the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of mRNAs, stabilizing these mRNA targets and leading to increased translation and accumulation. This binding is significant for mRNA stability, as the reduction of LARP4B levels results in destabilization and reduced translation of its mRNA targets (Küspert2015LARP4B). LARP4B also interacts with the poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPC1) and the receptor for activated C Kinase (RACK1), facilitating mRNA circularization and efficient reinitiation of translation (Schäffler2010A).

In the cytoplasm, LARP4B associates with polysomes and stress granules, indicating its involvement in translation under both normal and stress conditions. Its interaction with ribosomal components and mRNA factors suggests a stimulatory role in translation, enhancing protein synthesis and contributing to cellular growth processes (Schäffler2010A).

## Clinical Significance
LARP4B has been implicated in several cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression and metastasis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LARP4B is upregulated through m6A modification, which contributes to cancer stem cell maintenance and tumorigenicity by activating the SPINK1-induced EGFR signaling pathway. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased resistance to sorafenib, a common treatment for HCC. Targeting LARP4B in combination with sorafenib may improve treatment outcomes by disrupting the LARP4B/SPINK1/EGFR axis (Wang2024LARP4B).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), LARP4B is crucial for the self-renewal and proliferation of leukemia stem cells. Knockdown of LARP4B in murine models of MLL-AF9 AML leads to decreased leukemia cell proliferation and prolonged survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. LARP4B knockdown increases the expression of cell cycle inhibitors, leading to cell cycle arrest, which impairs leukemia stem cell maintenance (Zhang2015Larelated).

In sarcoma and carcinoma, LARP4B promotes cell cycle progression and mitosis by regulating key cell cycle regulators. Its depletion reduces tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its role in cancer cell proliferation and as a potential target for cancer therapy (Coleman2023The).

## Interactions
LARP4B interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in mRNA metabolism and translation. It binds to the cytosolic poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPC1) and the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), which is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. These interactions are RNA-independent, as they persist even after RNase A treatment (Schäffler2010A). LARP4B interacts with PABPC1 through both its N- and C-terminal regions, while its interaction with RACK1 is mediated by the C-terminal region (Schäffler2010A).

LARP4B also associates with ribosomal complexes, specifically binding to the 80S ribosomal subunit through its C-terminal domain. This interaction was demonstrated using GST-fusion proteins and confirmed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Schäffler2010A). Additionally, LARP4B is involved in mRNA stabilization by binding to AU-rich sequences within the 3' UTRs of mRNAs, as identified through PAR-CLIP analyses (Küspert2015LARP4B). This binding is crucial for its role in promoting mRNA accumulation and translation, as well as in stabilizing target mRNAs (Küspert2015LARP4B).
