# THG1L

## Overview
THG1L (tRNA-histidine guanylyltransferase 1 like) is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically the addition of a guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of tRNA^His. This enzyme plays a critical role in ensuring the proper maturation and functionality of tRNA, which is essential for accurate protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis. THG1L operates in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, contributing to cellular protein translation and mitochondrial function, which are vital for energy production and metabolic processes (Khalique2020Targeting). The protein encoded by THG1L is part of a superfamily that includes Thg1-like proteins (TLPs), which are involved in tRNA editing and repair processes (Phizicky2023The). Mutations in the THG1L gene have been linked to various neurological conditions, including cerebellar ataxia and congenital microcephaly, as well as being identified in pulmonary carcinoid tumors, highlighting its clinical significance (Walker2019Refining; Asiedu2018Pathways; Shaheen2019Genomic).

## Function
THG1L (tRNA-histidine guanylyltransferase 1 like) is an enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA, specifically adding a guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of tRNA^His. This modification is crucial for the proper function of tRNA, which is essential for accurate protein synthesis. THG1L operates in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, playing a significant role in cellular protein translation and mitochondrial function (Khalique2020Targeting).

The activity of THG1L ensures the correct maturation and functionality of tRNA^His, which is necessary for the translation of genetic information into proteins. This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various cellular functions. By contributing to the fidelity of protein synthesis, THG1L supports overall cellular health and function, impacting organismal outcomes such as growth and development.

In the context of mitochondrial function, THG1L's role in tRNA modification is particularly important, as mitochondria rely on a distinct set of tRNAs for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins. These proteins are essential for mitochondrial respiration and energy production, highlighting the importance of THG1L in maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic processes (Khalique2020Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the THG1L gene are associated with several neurological conditions. Notably, the homozygous V55A mutation in THG1L is linked to mitochondrial autosomal recessive congenital cerebellar ataxia. This condition is characterized by early onset cerebellar dysfunction, developmental delay, pyramidal signs, and cerebellar atrophy. These symptoms were observed in three siblings from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, highlighting a potential population-specific prevalence (Walker2019Refining). Another mutation, p.L294P, has been reported to cause a similar but more severe phenotype (Walker2019Refining).

THG1L has also been implicated in congenital microcephaly. A novel missense variant in THG1L was identified in a patient with intrauterine growth restriction and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, suggesting a pathogenic role in this condition (Shaheen2019Genomic).

In addition to these neurological disorders, THG1L has been identified as a significantly mutated gene in pulmonary carcinoid tumors, although the specific impact of these mutations on the disease is not fully understood (Asiedu2018Pathways). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial function and tRNA modification suggests that disruptions in its normal interactions could contribute to these pathological conditions.

## Interactions
THG1L, the human ortholog of tRNA His guanylyltransferase, is involved in tRNA modification and mitochondrial function. It is part of a superfamily that includes Thg1-like proteins (TLPs), which are involved in tRNA editing and repair processes. THG1L has been associated with mitochondrial function, and mutations in this gene, such as the V55A variant, have been linked to cerebellar ataxia and decreased mitochondrial fusion. This mutation affects mitochondrial respiration and fusion, potentially due to altered interactions with mitochondrial fusion mediators Mfn1 and Mfn2, although the exact nature of these interactions remains unclear (Phizicky2023The).

The THG1L protein is also implicated in forming multiprotein complexes, which are crucial for its role in tRNA maturation and cellular processes. These interactions may involve both stable complexes and more transient interactions, such as those that activate or inhibit its enzymatic activity. The precise details of these interactions, particularly how THG1L interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, are still under investigation, highlighting the need for further research to fully elucidate its functional partnerships and regulatory mechanisms (Phizicky2023The).
