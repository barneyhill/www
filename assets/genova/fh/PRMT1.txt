# PRMT1

## Overview
PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a type I arginine methyltransferase enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins through the methylation of arginine residues. This enzyme is crucial for various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. PRMT1 is responsible for the majority of asymmetric dimethylation in mammalian cells, influencing gene expression by modifying chromatin structure and acting as a coactivator for transcription factors. The protein encoded by PRMT1 is predominantly located in the nucleus and is involved in several multiprotein complexes, interacting with a wide range of proteins to regulate cellular signaling pathways. Due to its significant role in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression, PRMT1 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (Angelopoulou2023Functional; Nicholson2009The; Boisvert2005Arginine).

## Structure
PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) is a type I enzyme responsible for catalyzing the methylation of arginine residues in proteins. The primary structure of PRMT1 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, with over 90% sequence identity among mammals, zebrafish, and Xenopus (Zhang2003Structure). The protein's secondary structure includes a Rossmann fold, which is a common motif in proteins that bind nucleotides, and a β-barrel structure (Zhang2003Structure). 

The tertiary structure of PRMT1 features a two-domain architecture: an AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine) binding domain and a barrel-like domain, with the active site pocket located between these domains (Zhang2003Structure). The dimerization arm is a significant structural feature, essential for enzymatic activity and cofactor binding (Zhang2003Structure). 

PRMT1 functions as a dimer, indicating a quaternary structure that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. Dimerization facilitates SAM binding and enhances catalytic function (Zhou2015Molecular). The N-terminal region of PRMT1 is flexible and plays a role in SAM binding and catalysis (Zhou2015Molecular). PRMT1 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has several isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) is a key enzyme involved in the methylation of arginine residues on histones and other proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PRMT1 is responsible for the majority of asymmetric dimethylation (aDMA) and is involved in transcriptional regulation by acting as a coactivator. It methylates histone H4 at arginine 3 (H4R3), which influences gene expression by modulating chromatin structure and facilitating transcriptional activation (Strahl2001Methylation; Nicholson2009The).

PRMT1 also plays a significant role in RNA processing and nucleocytoplasmic transport. It affects the subcellular localization of RNA-binding proteins such as Sam68, which is crucial for their nuclear localization and function (Côté2003Sam68). In the context of DNA repair, PRMT1 is essential for the methylation of proteins like MRE11, which is part of the MRN complex involved in DNA damage response and repair (Boisvert2005Arginine).

PRMT1's activity is vital for maintaining genomic integrity, as its loss leads to genomic instability and defects in DNA damage repair pathways (Nicholson2009The). It is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it interacts with various transcription factors and signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and cellular signaling (Nicholson2009The).

## Clinical Significance
PRMT1 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in protein arginine methylation. In cancer, PRMT1 expression is altered in several tumor types, including prostate, colon, and breast cancer, where it is part of a transcriptional complex that modifies histones, contributing to cancer progression (Nicholson2009The). In breast cancer, PRMT1-mediated methylation of EZH2 at R342 is associated with poor clinical outcomes and promotes metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020Methylation; Li2021PRMT1mediated).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PRMT1 expression is elevated, particularly in cases with FLT3-ITD mutations. Its inhibition leads to reduced survival and growth of AML cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2019PRMT1mediated).

PRMT1 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where it affects the localization and function of nuclear ribonucleoproteins, contributing to neurodegeneration (Angelopoulou2023Functional). In Parkinson's disease, PRMT1 is implicated in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, suggesting its role in disease pathogenesis (Angelopoulou2023Functional).

In cardiovascular diseases, PRMT1 influences nitric oxide production and vascular function, with dysregulation linked to conditions like diabetes and kidney failure (Nicholson2009The).

## Interactions
PRMT1 interacts with a variety of proteins and is involved in several multiprotein complexes. It is known to methylate histone H4 at Arg3, which is crucial for coactivating nuclear receptor-controlled gene transcription (Osborne2007Protein). PRMT1 also interacts with RNA-binding proteins, such as hnRNPs and fibrillarin, which are involved in RNA processing and transport (Zhang2003Structure). 

The enzyme forms a complex with hCAF1 (CCR4-associated factor 1), which regulates PRMT1's enzymatic activity in a substrate-dependent manner. This interaction occurs in nuclear speckles and affects the methylation of substrates like Sam68 and histone H4 (RobinLespinasse2007hCAF1). PRMT1 is also part of a complex known as Five Friends of Methylated Chtop (5FMC), which includes proteins such as Senp3, Pelp1, Las1L, Tex10, and Wdr18. This complex binds specifically to methylated Chtop and is involved in the regulation of (de)sumoylation and transactivation by Zbp-89 (Fanis2012Five).

Additionally, PRMT1 interacts with antiproliferative proteins BTG1 and TIS21/BTG2, which stimulate its activity towards selected substrates (RobinLespinasse2007hCAF1). These interactions highlight PRMT1's role in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways.
