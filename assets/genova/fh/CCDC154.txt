# CCDC154

## Overview
CCDC154 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 154, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains. These structural motifs are integral to the protein's function, facilitating protein-protein interactions and the assembly of protein complexes. The CCDC154 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular transport. It plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest, which is achieved through the modulation of key cell cycle regulators. The protein is localized in early endosomes, suggesting its involvement in intracellular trafficking and bone resorption processes. CCDC154 is expressed in multiple tissues, indicating its essential physiological functions, and it has been implicated in conditions such as osteopetrosis and congenital deafness. Additionally, its potential role as a tumor suppressor and biomarker for Parkinson's disease has been explored (Xu2021CCDC154; Dong2019Proteomics; Liao2012Overexpression).

## Structure
The CCDC154 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs consisting of alpha-helices wrapped around each other to form a supercoil. These domains are involved in various cellular functions, including dimerization, protein-protein interaction, molecular targeting, DNA binding, and transcriptional regulation (Liao2012Overexpression). In the mouse version of the protein, six coiled-coil domains have been identified, while the human version contains four (Liao2012Overexpression). The protein also includes cyclin-binding motifs, which are crucial for its role in cell growth suppression by regulating cyclin-Cdk kinase activity and inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest (Liao2012Overexpression).

The tertiary structure of CCDC154 includes an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, and the protein is conserved among various mammals, including primates and rodents (Liao2012Overexpression). The protein is localized in early endosomes, suggesting a potential role in the formation of the ruffled border, important for bone resorption (Liao2012Overexpression). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, which may result in different protein isoforms, although specific structural details of these isoforms are not provided (Wilson2013A).

## Function
The CCDC154 gene encodes a protein characterized by coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These domains facilitate the assembly of protein complexes, playing roles in various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular transport. In cellular biology, CCDC154 is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. This arrest is achieved through the modulation of key cell cycle regulators, including the downregulation of Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and the upregulation of Chk1 and p21, which are negative regulators of the Cdc2-cyclin B kinase complex (Liao2012Overexpression).

CCDC154 is localized in early endosomes, suggesting a potential role in intracellular trafficking and possibly in the formation of the ruffled border in osteoclasts, which is crucial for bone resorption (Liao2012Overexpression). The gene is expressed in various tissues, indicating its essential physiological functions, although its specific role in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Liao2012Overexpression). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests it may function as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation (Liao2012Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC154 gene has been implicated in several medical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Mutations in CCDC154 are associated with osteopetrosis, a rare bone disorder characterized by increased bone density and defective bone resorption. In a mouse model, deletion of the CCDC154 gene led to autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, suggesting its critical role in bone remodeling (Liao2012Overexpression). The gene's involvement in osteopetrosis is further supported by its localization in early endosomes, which are crucial for the formation of the ruffled border necessary for bone resorption (Liao2012Overexpression).

CCDC154 mutations have also been linked to congenital deafness in mice, where abnormal remodeling of the otic capsule and auditory ossicles was observed. This resulted in moderate to severe hearing loss, highlighting the gene's importance in auditory structure development (Xu2021CCDC154).

Alterations in CCDC154 expression levels have been studied in the context of cancer. Overexpression of CCDC154 in cell lines induces G2/M cell cycle arrest, suppressing cell proliferation and suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Liao2012Overexpression). Additionally, CCDC154 has been identified as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease, with altered expression levels observed in patients (Dong2019Proteomics).
