# PERP

## Overview
The PERP gene encodes a tetraspan transmembrane protein that is a member of the PMP-22/gas3 family, playing a pivotal role in cell-cell adhesion and apoptosis. The protein, known as the p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP22, is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and is integral to the structure and function of desmosomes in epithelial cells, as well as intercalated disks in cardiomyocytes (Franke2013Transmembrane). PERP is a direct transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53 and the transcription factor p63, linking it to pathways that regulate apoptosis and epithelial integrity (Ihrie2005Perp; mcdonnell2018study). Its involvement in cellular stress responses, particularly during endoplasmic reticulum stress, underscores its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer pathogenesis (McDonnell2019ER; Roberts2020PERPing).

## Structure
The PERP protein is a member of the PMP-22/gas3 family, characterized by its tetraspan transmembrane structure. It consists of a 193-amino acid sequence with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 21 kDa (Franke2013Transmembrane; Attardi2000PERP). The protein's structure includes four membrane-spanning regions, as indicated by the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profile, which is similar to other members of the PMP-22/gas3 family (Attardi2000PERP). 

PERP localizes primarily to the plasma membrane and is involved in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in desmosomes and other junctional complexes in epithelial cells (Franke2013Transmembrane). It is also found in intercalated disks of cardiomyocytes, indicating its role in composite junctions (Franke2013Transmembrane). 

The protein is identified as a component of tessellate junctions, forming molecular mosaics with other junctional components such as tight and adherens junction molecules (Franke2013Transmembrane). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variants are not detailed in the provided context, PERP's role in apoptosis and tumor suppression suggests potential regulatory modifications. The protein's electrophoretic mobility corresponds to approximately 23 kDa, with a potential complex form at 68 kDa (Franke2013Transmembrane).

## Function
The PERP gene encodes a tetraspan membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial integrity and facilitating cell-cell adhesion, particularly in stratified epithelia such as the skin. PERP is localized to desmosomes, which are structures that enable adhesion between epithelial cells, ensuring proper tissue architecture and function (Ihrie2005Perp). In healthy cells, PERP is actively degraded by the lysosome, indicating its levels are tightly regulated to maintain cellular homeostasis (McDonnell2019ER).

PERP is a direct target of the transcription factor p63, which regulates its expression during epithelial development. The absence of PERP leads to significant defects in epithelial tissues, such as blistering and thickening of the skin, due to compromised cell adhesion and mislocalization of desmosomal proteins like desmoplakin (Ihrie2005Perp). This highlights PERP's essential role in targeting desmosomal proteins to the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining epithelial integrity.

PERP is also involved in cellular stress responses, particularly during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, where its protein levels increase due to enhanced stability and reduced turnover. This accumulation is linked to the inhibition of Golgi-plasma membrane trafficking, suggesting a role in the classical secretory pathway (McDonnell2019ER).

## Clinical Significance
The PERP gene plays a significant role in cancer pathogenesis, with its expression levels and genetic variations impacting various cancers. Downregulation of PERP is observed in several cancers, including breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and uveal melanoma, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is associated with diminished apoptosis, impaired cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Roberts2020PERPing). In lung cancer, PERP expression is paradoxically upregulated, and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as PERP-428, are linked to increased cancer risk. The PERP-428CC and CG genotypes are associated with higher lung cancer risk, potentially due to their impact on the PTEN/MDM2/p53 pathway and antioxidant activity (Liao2021Novel).

PERP's interaction with the ER Ca2+ pump SERCA2b is crucial for apoptosis, and disruptions in this interaction may contribute to tumor development. In transgenic mice, compromised PERP-SERCA2b interactions lead to increased tumor susceptibility (Roberts2020PERPing). The gene's role in inflammation is also significant, as its loss can lead to increased expression of inflammation-related genes, further implicating it in cancer progression (Roberts2020PERPing).

## Interactions
PERP, a protein involved in apoptosis and cell adhesion, interacts with several other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and interacts with p53 and p63, playing a role in apoptosis through p53 activation and caspase-dependent pathways (mcdonnell2018study). PERP also interacts with the molecular motor MYO1C, which is involved in protein trafficking. Inhibition of MYO1C leads to increased PERP levels and accumulation of autophagosomes, suggesting a role in autophagy (mcdonnell2018study).

PERP interacts with the ER Ca2+ pump SERCA2b, particularly during ER stress, where they co-localize at ER-plasma membrane junctions. This interaction is significant in the context of apoptosis, as SERCA2b-mediated calcium signaling can influence mitochondrial integrity and caspase activation (McDonnell2019ER). PERP also interacts with ORP8L, an ER membrane protein, at ER-PM junctions, which may play a role in phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane, crucial for apoptotic cell recognition (mcdonnell2018study). These interactions highlight PERP's involvement in apoptosis and its regulation through complex protein networks.
