# ARPC3

## Overview
The ARPC3 gene encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 3, a critical component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein plays a pivotal role in actin filament nucleation and branching, processes essential for cellular functions such as motility, shape maintenance, and intracellular transport. The Arp2/3 complex, with ARPC3 as a subunit, is particularly important in the formation of lamellipodia, structures that facilitate cell migration and directional movement (Suraneni2012The; Rotty2012New). ARPC3's interactions within the complex and with nucleation-promoting factors underscore its significance in actin dynamics and cellular responses to environmental cues (Xu2011Three-dimensional). Additionally, alterations in ARPC3 expression have been linked to clinical conditions such as metabolic syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (de2016A; Song2024ARPC3).

## Function
The ARPC3 gene encodes a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin filament nucleation and branching in cells. This complex is essential for the formation of lamellipodia, which are veil-like protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells composed of branched actin filaments. In fibroblast cells, the Arp2/3 complex, including ARPC3, is necessary for nucleating these branched actin networks, which are vital for cell motility and directional migration (Suraneni2012The). 

In healthy human cells, ARPC3 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at sites of dynamic actin remodeling. It plays a significant role in cell motility, shape, and intracellular transport by facilitating the formation of branched actin networks (Rotty2012New). The ARPC3 subunit is also involved in processes like endocytosis and phagocytosis, where it helps cells sense and respond to extracellular matrix gradients, aligning focal adhesions within the lamellipodium (Rotty2012New). 

The absence of ARPC3 results in the inability to form lamellipodia, leading to defects in persistent directional migration and impaired wound healing, highlighting its critical role in maintaining the directionality and efficiency of cell migration (Suraneni2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARPC3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In severely obese patients, a specific CpG-SNP, rs3759384, located within the promoter region of the ARPC3 gene, is linked to hypertriglyceridemia. This SNP is associated with changes in CpG methylation and ARPC3 expression levels, which correlate with plasma triglyceride levels. Higher ARPC3 expression is associated with increased triglyceride levels, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and conditions like metabolic syndrome (MetS) in obese individuals (de2016A).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ARPC3 is identified as an independent prognostic risk factor. High ARPC3 expression is associated with poorer prognosis and is linked to immune response modulation, particularly affecting immune checkpoint inhibitors and ferroptosis-related genes. ARPC3 influences the infiltration of various immune cells in tumors, potentially affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy. This suggests that ARPC3 may play a role in immune escape mechanisms of tumor cells and could be a target for improving immunotherapy outcomes in HCC patients (Song2024ARPC3).

## Interactions
ARPC3 is a subunit of the ARP2/3 complex, which is involved in the nucleation of branched actin filaments. Within this complex, ARPC3 interacts with other subunits, such as ARPC5, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Arabidopsis. These experiments showed that ARPC3 co-sediments with ARPC5, indicating a physical interaction between these subunits (Bellinvia2022CRISPRCas9).

Structural studies have also explored the interactions of ARPC3 within the ARP2/3 complex. The complex, including ARPC3, interacts with nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) such as cortactin and the VCA domain of WASP family proteins. These interactions are crucial for the activation and function of the ARP2/3 complex in actin filament nucleation. The VCA region of NPFs binds to the pointed end of the Arp2/Arp3 dimer, which includes ARPC3, facilitating the structural arrangement necessary for actin polymerization (Xu2011Three-dimensional).

In yeast, ARPC3, also known as Arc18, has been identified in studies involving the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family, although direct interactions with these proteins were not confirmed (Pan2004ARPC1Arc40). These interactions highlight the role of ARPC3 in the dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
