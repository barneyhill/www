# GABRB3

## Overview
The GABRB3 gene encodes the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subunit beta3, a critical component of the GABA A receptor, which is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is pivotal in mediating inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system by facilitating chloride ion flow across neuronal membranes, thereby reducing neuronal excitability. The beta3 subunit is integral to the receptor's function, contributing to the regulation of brain activity and influencing processes such as sleep, anxiety, and muscle relaxation (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). The GABA A receptor, including the beta3 subunit, is involved in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, which is essential for normal cognitive and motor functions (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). Mutations in the GABRB3 gene have been linked to various neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in brain development and function (Shi2019Synaptic; Papandreou2015GABRB3).

## Structure
The GABRB3 gene encodes the beta3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel. The primary structure of the beta3 subunit is defined by its amino acid sequence, which includes specific missense variants that can impact receptor function (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). The secondary structure of the protein features binding loops, coupling loops, and four transmembrane regions, which are crucial for its function (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). 

The tertiary structure is represented in a 3D model, showing the arrangement of the beta3 subunit within the receptor complex (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). The quaternary structure of the GABA A receptor involves the assembly of five subunits, typically in a 2α:2β:1γ configuration, forming a central pore (Hernandez2017GABA; Hernandez2023Epileptic). 

Key structural domains include the Cys-loop, which is involved in the binding/gating coupling junction, and the M2-M3 loop, part of the transmembrane domain forming the channel pore (Hernandez2017GABA). These domains are essential for receptor assembly and the GABA binding/channel gating mechanism (Hernandez2017GABA). Common post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, affecting the receptor's function and stability.

## Function
The GABRB3 gene encodes the beta3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a critical component in the central nervous system responsible for mediating inhibitory neurotransmission. This receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that facilitates the flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. The GABA A receptor, which includes the beta3 subunit, plays a crucial role in regulating brain activity, influencing processes such as sleep, anxiety, and muscle relaxation (Absalom2022Gainoffunction).

In healthy human cells, the GABA A receptor is primarily involved in phasic inhibition at synaptic sites, where it contributes to the modulation of neuronal excitability and the maintenance of neural network stability. The receptor's activity is essential for proper synaptic function and is involved in various developmental processes, including neuronal proliferation, migration, synaptic growth, and differentiation (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). The beta3 subunit, encoded by GABRB3, is part of the α1β3γ2 subtype of the GABA A receptor, which is a major subtype in the mammalian brain (Absalom2022Gainoffunction). This receptor subtype is crucial for maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, thereby ensuring normal cognitive and motor functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRB3 gene, which encodes the β3 subunit of the GABA A receptor, are associated with a variety of neurological disorders. These include several epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and infantile spasms, which are characterized by severe seizures and often accompanied by intellectual disabilities (Shi2019Synaptic; Papandreou2015GABRB3). The N328D mutation in GABRB3 is specifically linked to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, while the E357K mutation is associated with juvenile absence epilepsy (Shi2019Synaptic). 

GABRB3 mutations are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and Angelman syndrome, highlighting the gene's role in brain development and function (Shi2019Synaptic; Papandreou2015GABRB3). The variability in clinical phenotypes associated with GABRB3 mutations is partly due to differences in the stability and synaptic clustering of the β3 subunit, which affects GABA A receptor function and localization (Nwosu2023GABAA; Shi2019Synaptic). 

Alterations in GABRB3 expression levels have been linked to absence seizures and abnormal sensory processing, further contributing to the diverse clinical manifestations associated with this gene (Papandreou2015GABRB3).

## Interactions
The GABRB3 subunit is a component of the GABA-A receptor, which forms heteropentameric complexes with other subunits such as α1, α4, and γ2. These complexes are crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. GABRB3 is significantly enriched in both α1 and α4 subunit-containing GABA-A receptors, indicating its role in forming distinct receptor populations (Choi2022Analyzing). 

The β3 subunit interacts with various proteins that influence its function and localization. It is known to interact with spectrin isoforms, Kcc2, and gephyrin, which are involved in stabilizing and targeting the receptors to synaptic sites (Choi2022Analyzing). The phosphorylation of GABRB3 at serines 408 and 409 (S408/9) is critical for regulating its membrane trafficking and affects the segregation of α1 and α4 subunits into different receptor subtypes (Choi2022Analyzing).

In addition to these interactions, the β3 subunit is part of the major GABA-A receptor subtype in the mouse brain cortex, which includes two α1, two β2/3, and one γ2 subunit. This complex is involved in various protein interactions, although specific interactions of GABRB3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed (Chen2024Proteome).
