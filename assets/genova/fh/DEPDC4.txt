# DEPDC4

## Overview
DEPDC4 (DEP domain containing 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein, characterized by the presence of a DEP domain, is integral to signal transduction processes, facilitating interactions with other proteins to regulate cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. DEPDC4 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and potentially the nucleus, allowing it to influence diverse biological outcomes. Its role in signaling pathways ensures that cells can respond to internal and external stimuli, supporting the organism's adaptability and equilibrium. The gene's involvement in critical cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining healthy cell function and highlights its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and high-grade myopia (Liao2016Identification; Hawthorne2013Association; Wang2018Somatic).

## Function
DEPDC4 (DEP domain containing 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein contains a DEP domain, which is instrumental in mediating interactions with other proteins, particularly within signal transduction processes. These interactions are essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. By influencing these processes, DEPDC4 contributes to the proper functioning and survival of cells.

The protein encoded by DEPDC4 is active in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and potentially the nucleus. Its presence in these areas allows it to participate in diverse biological outcomes, impacting the overall health and functionality of cells. Through its involvement in signaling pathways, DEPDC4 helps ensure that cells respond appropriately to internal and external stimuli, thereby supporting the organism's ability to adapt to changing conditions and maintain equilibrium.

In summary, DEPDC4 plays a significant role in cellular signaling and homeostasis, with its protein product being a key player in the regulation of critical cellular processes. Its activity across different cellular compartments underscores its importance in maintaining the balance necessary for healthy cell function.

## Clinical Significance
DEPDC4 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC), somatic mutations in DEPDC4, such as p.E293A and p.T279A, have been identified and predicted to be deleterious. These mutations contribute to the genetic landscape of RCC in the Chinese population, although their direct clinical implications, such as impact on prognosis or treatment response, remain to be fully elucidated (Wang2018Somatic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DEPDC4 is part of a group of genes that are down-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. This down-regulation suggests a potential role in tumor suppression, although the specific functional consequences in HCC are not yet clear (Liao2016Identification).

DEPDC4 has also been associated with high-grade myopia through a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in its 3â€²-untranslated region. This SNP, rs4764971, showed a significant association with the condition, although further validation is needed to confirm its clinical significance (Hawthorne2013Association). The role of DEPDC4 in these conditions highlights its potential as a target for further research and therapeutic development.
