# PPP1R17

## Overview
The PPP1R17 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 17, a crucial component in the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activities. This protein functions primarily as a regulatory subunit, modulating the activity of these phosphatases in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. PPP1R17 is notably involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell cycle progression during cortical development, highlighting its role in neurogenesis and brain development (Girskis2021Rewiring). In the cerebellum, it acts as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A in Purkinje cells, contributing to synaptic plasticity and neuronal signaling (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). The gene's expression is developmentally regulated, with significant implications in neurodevelopmental processes and various diseases, including pituitary adenomas and Alzheimer's disease, where its dysregulation is associated with pathogenesis (Rao2018Spontaneous; Chittiboina2024Epigenetic).

## Structure


## Function
PPP1R17 is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the brain. It is involved in the regulation of neural progenitor cell (NPC) cycle progression, especially during human and primate cortical development. PPP1R17 is highly expressed in NPCs within the outer and inner subventricular zones of the developing cerebral cortex, which are crucial neurogenic niches (Girskis2021Rewiring). The gene is known to repress protein phosphatase complexes 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), which are essential for the G1/S transition during the cell cycle, thereby influencing NPC cycle length and proliferation (Girskis2021Rewiring).

In the cerebellum, PPP1R17 is primarily active in Purkinje cells, where it acts as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, playing a role in the induction of long-term depression (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). This activity is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. The expression of PPP1R17 in the cortex is restricted to fetal development in humans, suggesting its role in early neurodevelopmental processes (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). The gene's activity in these regions and processes highlights its importance in the regulation of neurogenesis and brain development.

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R17 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In the context of pituitary adenomas, particularly those causing Cushing's disease, PPP1R17 is reactivated epigenetically, leading to tumorigenesis. This reactivation results in the inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase PP2A, contributing to tumor growth and dysregulation of the phosphoproteome (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). The overexpression of PPP1R17 in these adenomas is associated with increased chromatin accessibility and DNA hypomethylation, which are common features in various tumor types (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic).

In Alzheimer's disease, a significant decrease in PPP1R17 expression has been observed in a mouse model, suggesting a potential compensatory role against AD-like pathology by dephosphorylating phosphorylated tau, a protein linked to the disease (Rao2018Spontaneous). Additionally, PPP1R17 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its altered expression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis (KhojastehLeylakoohi2022Down). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R17 in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PPP1R17 is known to interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), acting as an endogenous inhibitor. This interaction occurs at specific residues, Arg89 and Tyr127, similar to other known PP2A inhibitors. The inhibition of PP2A by PPP1R17 leads to the hyperphosphorylation of several PP2A targets, including pAKT, pERK, and pEGFR, which suggests a dysregulation of the kinase-phosphatase balance in pituitary adenomas (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). 

PPP1R17's role extends to transcriptional control by affecting the phosphorylation state of RNA polymerase II, contributing to differential gene expression in Cushing's disease adenomas (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic). The overexpression of PPP1R17 in murine corticotroph cells has been shown to mimic the phosphoproteomic changes observed in adenomas, indicating its significant role in tumor pathogenesis (Chittiboina2024Epigenetic).

In the context of neurodevelopment, PPP1R17 is regulated by human accelerated regions (HARs) and is involved in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells. Its expression is modulated by HARs and a primate-selective regulatory element, which includes retrotransposons, suggesting a role in the evolutionary expansion of the human cerebral cortex (Girskis2021Rewiring).
