# CNDP1

## Overview
The CNDP1 gene encodes the enzyme carnosine dipeptidase 1 (CN1), a member of the M20 metalloprotease family, which is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine, anserine, and homocarnosine. CN1 is predominantly active in the kidney, liver, and central nervous system, where it plays a significant role in dipeptide metabolism and cellular protection against oxidative stress (Chmielewska2024Human; Peters2017Carnosinase). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a dimeric form with a catalytic domain that includes two zinc ions essential for its function (Chmielewska2024Human). CNDP1's activity is modulated by genetic polymorphisms and post-translational modifications, which can influence its role in conditions such as diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease (Chmielewska2024Human; Peters2017Carnosinase).

## Structure
The CNDP1 gene encodes the human serum carnosinase enzyme, which is a member of the M20 metalloprotease family. The protein consists of 508 amino acids and includes a signal peptide with leucine repeats, indicating its primary structure (Chmielewska2024Human). The enzyme contains three N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may affect its stability and activity (Chmielewska2024Human).

The secondary structure of CNDP1 includes antiparallel β-sheets surrounded by α-helices, particularly in the catalytic domain, which spans residues from Ser1 to Pro275 and His390 to His481 (Vistoli2006Homology). The lid domain, comprising residues from Leu276 to Leu389, also features antiparallel β-sheets and α-helices (Vistoli2006Homology).

In terms of tertiary structure, the enzyme has an ellipsoidal shape and consists of two distinct domains: the upper lid domain and the lower catalytic domain. These domains are connected by a random coil region, allowing movement during substrate recognition and enzyme activation (Vistoli2006Homology).

The quaternary structure of CNDP1 is characterized by its dimeric form, which exhibits higher enzymatic activity than the monomeric form. This increased activity is likely due to specific interactions in the active site, including a proposed hydrogen bond between His235 and the ligand's carbonyl oxygen atom (Chmielewska2024Human). The enzyme's active site contains two zinc ions, coordinated by several residues, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Chmielewska2024Human).

## Function
The CNDP1 gene encodes the enzyme carnosinase 1 (CN1), which is involved in the hydrolysis of histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine, anserine, and homocarnosine. CN1 is primarily active in the kidney, liver, and central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in the metabolism of these dipeptides (Chmielewska2024Human; Peters2017Carnosinase). The enzyme is a member of the M20 metalloprotease family and is characterized as a 'true Xaa-His dipeptidase', with the highest activity for hydrolyzing carnosine (Chmielewska2024Human).

In the kidney, CNDP1 is expressed in the distal tubules and glomeruli, where it is involved in the catabolism of carnosine and anserine, contributing to the regulation of their levels and maintaining cellular protection against oxidative stress (Peters2015Intrinsic). CN1's activity is influenced by factors such as age, sex, and genetic polymorphisms, and it is modulated by post-translational modifications like N-glycosylation and metal ions (Chmielewska2024Human; Peters2017Carnosinase).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining serum carnosine concentrations, which may have implications for conditions like diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease (Peters2017Carnosinase). CNDP1's role in carnosine metabolism is essential for protecting tissues from damage and regulating glucose levels, particularly in the kidneys (Chmielewska2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CNDP1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy (DN). The CNDP1 Mannheim allele, characterized by a leucine repeat polymorphism, is linked to a decreased risk of developing DN in individuals with type 2 diabetes, especially in women. This allele is associated with lower carnosinase 1 (CN1) activity, which may lead to increased carnosine levels, providing protective effects against DN (Peters2017Carnosinase; Peters2016CNDP1). 

In Malaysian populations, the CNDP1 polymorphisms D18S880 and rs2346061 have shown varying associations with DN across different ethnic groups, with a significant association observed among Indians (Yahya2019CNDP1). The rs2346061 variant has also been studied in Iranian populations, where it was linked to differences in clinical parameters related to DN (Asgarbeik2019Investigating).

Research using animal models, such as CNDP1 knockout zebrafish and mice, has demonstrated that while CNDP1 affects amino acid metabolism and carnosine levels, its absence does not necessarily protect against diabetic complications, indicating a complex role in disease processes (Weigand2020A; Schmöhl2019CNDP1).
