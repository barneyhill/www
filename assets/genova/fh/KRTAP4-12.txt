# KRTAP4-12

## Overview
KRTAP4-12 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-12, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity and function of hair, as they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that enhances hair strength and resilience. The protein encoded by KRTAP4-12 is primarily active in the hair follicle, influencing hair texture and quality. Beyond its role in hair, KRTAP4-12 is also implicated in wound healing processes, with studies indicating its upregulation in response to certain treatments, suggesting a role in skin repair and regeneration. Additionally, KRTAP4-12 is involved in protein-protein interactions, although its specific biological roles in these interactions require further elucidation (Litman2023Ancient; Marquardt2015Characterization; Li2009Local).

## Function
KRTAP4-12 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that contributes to hair strength and resilience. KRTAP4-12 is primarily active in the hair follicle, influencing hair texture and quality (Litman2023Ancient).

In addition to its role in hair, KRTAP4-12 has been implicated in wound healing processes. Studies using a three-dimensional skin wound healing model have shown that the expression of KRTAP4-12 is significantly upregulated in response to treatments such as calciumpantothenate, suggesting its involvement in the wound healing process (Marquardt2015Characterization). This upregulation indicates that KRTAP4-12 may play a role in cellular processes related to skin repair and regeneration.

While KRTAP4-12 is primarily associated with hair and skin, its potential involvement in other cellular processes, such as extracellular matrix support, has been speculated, although further research is needed to confirm these roles (Jagirdar2013Gene).

## Interactions
KRTAP4-12, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in interactions that are significant for functional inference in human protein interaction networks. One notable interaction is with the protein PLSCR1, which has been identified with a score of -68.91001314, indicating a significant interaction within the context of the study by Hua Li and Shoudan Liang (Li2009Local). This interaction suggests a potential role in biological processes, although the specific nature of this interaction is not detailed.

Another interaction involving KRTAP4-12 is with MDFI, as noted in the same study. The interaction is highlighted with a specific score, suggesting its significance, but the precise biological implications or pathways involved are not elaborated upon (Li2009Local).

In a separate study, KRTAP4-12 was removed from the analysis of protein-protein interactions using TAP-MS data to ensure accurate results, indicating its presence as a known contaminant in the dataset (Boldt2016An). This suggests that while KRTAP4-12 may participate in interactions, its role in certain experimental contexts may be confounding, necessitating its exclusion for clarity in specific analyses.
