# IQUB

## Overview
The IQUB gene encodes the protein IQ motif and ubiquitin domain containing, which is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein degradation. This protein is characterized by its calmodulin-binding IQ motif and ubiquitin-like domain, suggesting roles in calcium signaling and ubiquitination pathways. It is particularly significant in the recycling of membrane-bound receptors, such as serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), which are coupled to G-proteins and transmit signals through MAP kinases (Kerner2013Rare). Additionally, IQUB is implicated in cilia formation and function, interacting with proteins like ZMYND10 to stabilize intermediate chain proteins during dynein arm assembly, crucial for cilia motility (Cho2018ZMYND10). The gene's expression is noted in various tissues, including the central nervous system, indicating its involvement in cilia-related processes (West2015A). Furthermore, IQUB has clinical significance in cancer progression and psychiatric disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2018Upregulated; Kerner2013Rare).

## Structure
The IQUB protein is characterized by several distinct domains, including a calmodulin-binding IQ motif and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain. It also features three C-terminal domains: a helical solenoid segment, a short Cx2Cx20Cx2C Zn2+-binding module, and a novel 120-amino-acid α+β domain. These structural elements suggest a complex tertiary structure, with potential interactions mediated by the IQ motif and the Zn2+-binding module. The helical solenoid and α+β domains likely contribute to the protein's overall folding and stability (Lai2011Functional).

The IQUB gene is involved in recycling membrane-bound receptors, such as HTR6 and MCHR1, which are coupled to G-proteins and transmit signals through MAP kinases. A novel mutation in IQUB, located on chromosome 7q31.32, results in an amino acid change from valine to glutamine in Exon 9, leading to nonsense-mediated decay (Kerner2013Rare). The protein interacts with ZMYND10, which stabilizes intermediate chain proteins in the cytoplasmic pre-assembly of dynein arms, indicating a role in protein stability (Cho2018ZMYND10). The molecular structure details, such as primary, secondary, and quaternary structures, are not specified in the available literature.

## Function
The IQUB gene encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein degradation. It plays a crucial role in the recycling of membrane-bound receptors such as the serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), both of which are coupled to G-proteins and transmit signals through MAP kinases (Kerner2013Rare). The protein contains an IQ motif, which is a calmodulin-binding domain, and a ubiquitin domain, suggesting its involvement in calcium signaling and ubiquitination pathways.

IQUB is also implicated in cilia formation and function, particularly in the ependyma of the central nervous system's ventricular system (West2015A). It interacts with ZMYND10, a protein involved in the stabilization of intermediate chain proteins during the pre-assembly of dynein arms, indicating a role in the assembly of these structures (Cho2018ZMYND10). The gene's expression is associated with various tissues, including the spinal canal, trachea, lung bronchioles, oviduct, and ureter, reinforcing its involvement in cilia-related processes (West2015A). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain limited.

## Clinical Significance
The IQUB gene has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer through its role in cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of IQUB in breast cancer cells, such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, activates the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis. This pathway's activation leads to increased expression of β-catenin and related proteins, enhancing the proliferative and migratory capabilities of cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of IQUB expression inhibits these processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Li2018Upregulated).

In addition to its role in cancer, the IQUB gene has been associated with psychiatric disorders. Rare genomic variants in IQUB have been linked to bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders. These variants are involved in intracellular signaling pathways, such as the ERK/MAPK and CREB-regulated pathways, which are essential for neuronal plasticity and affect regulation. The presence of damaging mutations in these pathways may contribute to the pathogenesis of these psychiatric conditions, highlighting the gene's significance in mental health (Kerner2013Rare).

## Interactions
The IQUB protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cellular signaling and protein stability. It is essential for the recycling of membrane-bound receptors such as the serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1), both of which are coupled to G-proteins and transmit signals through MAP kinases (Kerner2013Rare). 

IQUB also interacts with ZMYND10, a protein that stabilizes intermediate chain proteins during the pre-assembly of dynein arms in motile cilia. This interaction is part of a larger cytoplasmic protein network that includes other proteins like LRRC6, C21ORF59, and HSC70, which are crucial for cilia motility (Cho2018ZMYND10). In Zmynd10 knockout mice, the absence of ZMYND10 leads to a significant reduction in IQUB protein levels, indicating that ZMYND10 plays a role in preventing the degradation of IQUB and its interaction partners (Cho2018ZMYND10). 

These interactions highlight IQUB's role in both receptor recycling and the stabilization of protein complexes necessary for cellular functions such as cilia movement.
