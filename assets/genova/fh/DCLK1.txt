# DCLK1

## Overview
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and cancer biology. The protein product of DCLK1, also referred to as DCLK1, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes doublecortin (DCX) domains for microtubule binding and a kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity. DCLK1 plays a crucial role in neuronal migration, axon growth, and dendritic development by interacting with microtubules and other proteins, such as kinesin-3 family members, to facilitate intracellular transport. Beyond its neural functions, DCLK1 is implicated in oncogenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with cancer stem cell properties, tumor progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. The gene's expression and mutations are also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Sureban2019DCLK1; Kalantari2022Oncogenic; Koizumi2016DCLK1).

## Structure
The DCLK1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of DCLK1 features a serine/threonine kinase domain, which spans residues 382-648, and is crucial for its catalytic activity (Carli2023Structure-Guided). The N-terminal region contains tandem doublecortin (DCX) domains responsible for microtubule association (Patel2016Biochemical). Between the DCX domains and the kinase domain lies a PEST sequence, a linker rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, which is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage (Patel2016Biochemical).

The secondary structure of DCLK1 is influenced by these domains, with the DCX domains contributing to microtubule binding (Venkat2023Mechanistic). The tertiary structure involves the C-terminal tail, which acts as a regulatory element, potentially mimicking ATP functions and affecting the kinase's activity (Venkat2023Mechanistic). The C-terminal tail includes two α-helices and a 3_10 helix, which confer auto-inhibition by occluding the ATP-binding site (Carli2023Structure-Guided).

DCLK1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with variations in the C-terminal tail and the presence of N-terminal DCX domains (Venkat2023Mechanistic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating DCLK1's activity and interactions (Patel2016Biochemical).

## Function
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in several critical processes in neural development. It plays a significant role in radial migration and axon growth of cortical neurons by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins, such as MAP7D1, which is crucial for axon elongation (Koizumi2016DCLK1). DCLK1 is expressed abundantly in both the embryonic and adult brain, indicating its importance throughout neural development (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

DCLK1 is also involved in dendritic development, where it guides kinesin-3-mediated cargo transport to dendrites, affecting dendritic branching and length (Lipka2016Microtubule‐binding). It interacts with dynamic microtubules and is essential for the proper targeting of dense-core vesicles into dendrites, which is necessary for neuronal development and the release of peptide neuromodulators (Lipka2016Microtubule‐binding).

In addition to its role in neural development, DCLK1 is involved in the differentiation of neural stem cells to oligodendrocyte precursor cells. This process is regulated by phosphorylation-dependent processing of DCLK1, which affects its isoform expression and interaction networks (Hardt2023Proteomic). DCLK1's activity in these processes highlights its critical role in cellular differentiation and cytoskeletal organization (Hardt2023Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
DCLK1 (doublecortin like kinase 1) is significantly implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). Alterations in DCLK1 expression are associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis, and poor clinical outcomes. In CRC, DCLK1 is expressed in cancer stem cells and is linked to processes such as proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which are crucial for cancer progression (Chhetri2022Pleiotropic; Kalantari2022Oncogenic). High expression of the DCLK1-S isoform is associated with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival in CRC patients, making it a potential prognostic marker (Kalantari2022Oncogenic; O’Connell2015Epigenetic).

DCLK1 mutations, particularly in the N-terminal region, affect its ability to bind to microtubules, impacting protein stability and function, which contributes to tumorigenesis (Carli2023Structure-Guided). DCLK1 is also associated with chemotherapy resistance, and its expression correlates with increased EMT transcription factors and immune checkpoint markers, suggesting potential responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Sureban2019DCLK1). In addition to cancer, DCLK1 mutations and dysregulation are linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ADHD and schizophrenia (Carli2023Structure-Guided).

## Interactions
Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal development and function. DCLK1 interacts with the motor protein KIF1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family, to facilitate cargo transport in neurons. This interaction is crucial for the transport of dense-core vesicles (DCVs) into dendrites, affecting dendritic growth and branching (Liu2012Molecular; Lipka2016Microtubule‐binding). DCLK1 also interacts with microtubules through its doublecortin domains, which are involved in microtubule bundling and stabilization (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

DCLK1 phosphorylates the microtubule-associated protein MAP7D1 at serine 315, which is essential for axon elongation in cortical neurons (Koizumi2016DCLK1). This phosphorylation event highlights DCLK1's role in modulating microtubule dynamics and neuronal morphology. Additionally, DCLK1 interacts with proteins such as 14-3-3 epsilon and tubulins, indicating its involvement in a broader network of protein interactions (Koizumi2016DCLK1).

The interaction between DCLK1 and KIF1A is further supported by the presence of a conserved Kif1a-binding linker sequence in DCLK1, which is shared with its paralogue, doublecortin (DCX) (Liu2012Molecular). This suggests a specific regulatory role for DCLK1 in neuronal transport processes.
