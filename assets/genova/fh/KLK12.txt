# KLK12

## Overview
Kallikrein-related peptidase 12 (KLK12) is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in various physiological processes, including extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. The KLK12 protein, characterized by its trypsin-like activity, plays a crucial role in cleaving peptide bonds after arginine and lysine residues, which is essential for its function in tissue remodeling and cellular communication (Memari2007Enzymatic). KLK12 is expressed in multiple human tissues and exists in several splice variants, which may influence its function and localization (Talieri2012Human). The enzyme is regulated by metal ions and endogenous inhibitors, highlighting its complex regulation in physiological contexts (Talieri2012Human; Memari2007Enzymatic). KLK12's involvement in angiogenesis and its modulation of growth factors like PDGF-BB and VEGF-A underscore its significance in both normal and pathological processes, including cancer progression (Kryza2018Human; Kryza2013Angiogenesis).

## Structure
The molecular structure of kallikrein-related peptidase 12 (KLK12) is characterized by a trypsin-like structure, which includes two asymmetric juxtaposed 6-strand beta-barrels and two alpha-helices with a 'Greek key' topology. This configuration facilitates the formation of the enzyme's active site (Kryza2016The). KLK12 is synthesized as a single-chain pre-pro-enzyme, featuring a signal peptide, a pro-domain, and a core domain containing the catalytic triad, which consists of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine (Kryza2016The). The signal peptide directs the enzyme to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus for glycosylation before secretion (Kryza2016The).

KLK12 exhibits trypsin-like activity, cleaving peptide bonds after arginine and lysine residues (Memari2007Enzymatic). It is subject to regulation by metal ions, such as zinc, which can inhibit its activity, and by endogenous inhibitors like α2-antiplasmin (Talieri2012Human; Memari2007Enzymatic). KLK12 is expressed in various human tissues and has several splice variants, including KLK12sv1, KLK12sv2, and KLK12sv3, which are predicted to be secreted proteins (Talieri2012Human). These variants may result in different protein products, potentially affecting the enzyme's function and localization (Talieri2012Human).

## Function
Kallikrein-related peptidase 12 (KLK12) is a serine protease involved in several molecular processes crucial for cell biology and organismal outcomes. In healthy human cells, KLK12 plays a significant role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, by remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). It achieves this by cleaving ECM proteins such as fibronectin and tenascin-C, which affects endothelial cell adhesion and migration, essential steps in angiogenesis (Kryza2018Human).

KLK12's proteolytic activity generates a 29 kDa fibronectin fragment that inhibits fibronectin polymerization, promoting endothelial cell migration and capillary formation (Kryza2018Human). This activity is crucial for ECM remodeling, influencing cell-ECM interactions and downstream signaling pathways (Kryza2018Human).

KLK12 also modulates the bioavailability of angiogenesis-related factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), by cleaving domains essential for their retention in the ECM. This modulation facilitates the release of these growth factors, promoting angiogenesis through a PDGF-B-dependent paracrine pathway (Kryza2013Angiogenesis). These functions highlight KLK12's role in tissue remodeling and cellular communication in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLK12 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, gastric, and lung cancers. In breast cancer, KLK12 expression levels have been associated with different prognostic outcomes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), positive KLK12 mRNA expression is linked to shortened disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), suggesting a tumor-supporting role (Gong2020Prognostic). Conversely, in other breast cancer subtypes, higher KLK12 expression is associated with less aggressive forms and better survival outcomes, indicating a potential suppressive role in cancer progression (Sato2023KallikreinRelated).

KLK12 splice variants also play a role in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. The KLK12sv3 variant is associated with better prognosis, while KLK12sv1/2 is linked to poorer outcomes in TNBC (Papachristopoulou2018Human; Gong2020Prognostic). In lung cancer, KLK12 expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA CASC15, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating KLK12 levels (Bai2019CASC15).

KLK12 is also involved in angiogenesis, a critical process in cancer progression, by remodeling the extracellular matrix and influencing endothelial cell migration (Kryza2018Human). These findings highlight the complex role of KLK12 in cancer biology, with its expression and interactions significantly impacting tumor behavior and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
KLK12 interacts with various proteins, influencing several physiological processes. It is known to cleave fibronectin (FN), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), at the Arg 290 site, producing a 29 kDa fragment. This cleavage disrupts FN polymerization and fibril formation, which is crucial for ECM assembly and endothelial cell migration (Kryza2018Human). KLK12 also interacts with tenascin-C (Tn-C), another ECM protein, but does not cleave laminin-5 or collagen-IV (Kryza2018Human).

KLK12 can activate other kallikrein family members, such as KLK11. It specifically cleaves KLK11 at the pro-enzyme activation site, converting it to its active form in a dose-dependent manner (Memari2007Enzymatic).

In the context of angiogenesis, KLK12 modulates the bioavailability of growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) by cleaving domains essential for their retention in the ECM (Kryza2018Human). KLK12 also stimulates the release of PDGF-B from endothelial cells, which acts as a paracrine factor on stromal cells, promoting the secretion of VEGF-A by fibroblasts (Kryza2013Angiogenesis). These interactions highlight KLK12's role in ECM remodeling and angiogenesis regulation.
