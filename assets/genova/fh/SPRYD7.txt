# SPRYD7

## Overview
SPRYD7 is a gene that encodes the SPRY domain-containing protein 7, a member of the SPRY domain protein family. This protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a conserved SPRY domain with a bent beta-sandwich structure, which distinguishes it from other proteins in the same family (Yang2020Crystal). SPRYD7 is notably involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC), influencing processes such as cell adhesion, invasion, and angiogenesis (MonteroCalle2023Functional). The gene's overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (MonteroCalle2023Functional).

## Structure
The SPRYD7 protein, encoded by the spryd7 gene, is the smallest SPRY domain protein in humans, consisting of 196 amino acids (Yang2020Crystal). Its primary structure is unique, sharing less than 25% amino acid sequence identity with other SPRY domains (Yang2020Crystal). The secondary structure of SPRYD7 features a conserved SPRY domain fold, characterized by a bent beta-sandwich structure. Unlike other SPRY domains, SPRYD7's beta-sandwich is formed by a single folded-over beta-sheet rather than two separate sheets (Yang2020Crystal). The tertiary structure includes a triangle-like loop covering the convex side of the beta-sandwich, similar to structures found in other proteins (Yang2020Crystal). Notably, SPRYD7 lacks a loop B, which is present in other SPRY domains, marking a distinguishing feature of its structure (Yang2020Crystal). The protein's electrostatic surface potential is characterized by a concave surface formed by strands b6, b7, and the loop connecting them, which is not positively charged, unlike corresponding surfaces in other SPRY domains (Yang2020Crystal). The structure also includes a negatively charged stretch adjacent to strand b3, formed by conserved acidic residues (Yang2020Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
The SPRYD7 gene has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Overexpression of SPRYD7 is associated with increased metastatic capacity and poor prognosis in CRC patients. It enhances cell adhesion, growth, invasion, and migration, contributing to CRC progression. High levels of SPRYD7 are linked to increased angiogenesis, as indicated by elevated markers such as CD31 and CD34, which are crucial for tumor vascularization (MonteroCalle2023Functional). 

SPRYD7 is significantly upregulated in highly metastatic CRC cells compared to poorly metastatic ones, and its high expression correlates with poor survival outcomes in CRC patients. This suggests that SPRYD7 dysregulation is a common event in CRC, particularly associated with liver metastasis, although not with recurrence (MonteroCalle2023Functional). 

The gene's role in CRC is further supported by its involvement in processes such as cell cycle regulation, chromosome organization, and cytoskeleton dynamics. Proteomic analyses have identified several proteins interacting with SPRYD7, which are involved in immune responses and cytoskeleton functions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for CRC treatment (MonteroCalle2023Functional).

## Interactions
SPRYD7, a protein containing a SPRY domain, is involved in various protein interactions that are significant in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis. The protein was found to interact with a range of other proteins, as identified through immunoprecipitation assays. Notable interacting partners include NPHP3, TYMP, A2ML1, TOLLIP, ARG1, BLMH, SOD1, FSCN1, VPRBP, CAPNS2, and IL1RN, with interactions observed in different CRC cell lines such as KM12C and KM12SM (MonteroCalle2023Functional). 

The study identified 118 and 157 proteins as SPRYD7 interactors from KM12C and KM12SM protein extracts, respectively. After analysis, 133 proteins were selected as potential interactors, with 8 identified in both analyses. These interactions are associated with several biological processes, including actin filament organization, IL-1 signaling, exocytosis, muscle contraction, metabolic and biosynthetic processes, and focal adhesions, all of which are linked to CRC pathogenesis (MonteroCalle2023Functional).

The protein interactions of SPRYD7 were further validated using Western Blot analyses in various CRC cell lines, confirming its role in enhancing tumorigenic and metastatic properties by influencing cell adhesion, invasion, and angiogenesis (MonteroCalle2023Functional).
