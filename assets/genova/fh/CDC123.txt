# CDC123

## Overview
The CDC123 gene encodes the cell division cycle 123 protein, which is a member of the ATP-grasp superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, a critical component in the initiation of protein synthesis. The CDC123 protein is characterized by its ATP-binding capability, which is essential for its function in facilitating the assembly of the eIF2 complex by interacting with its γ subunit. This interaction is crucial for the recycling of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, a necessary step for continued translation initiation. The protein's function is vital for normal cell cycle progression and protein synthesis, and its dysfunction has been linked to diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes (Panvert2015Cdc123; Cardenal2023Binding).

## Structure
The CDC123 protein is part of the ATP-grasp superfamily and plays a crucial role in the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex. Structurally, CDC123 is composed of two main domains, with ATP-Mg2+ binding at the interface, similar to other ATP-grasp enzymes (Cardenal2023Binding). The primary structure includes specific residues involved in ATP binding, such as D233 and D246, which are critical for its function (Cardenal2023Binding).

The secondary structure of CDC123 features β-strands and α-helices, with domain 1 containing a three-stranded β-sheet and domain 2 containing a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Panvert2015Cdc123). The tertiary structure involves the interaction of specific residues and loops, particularly in the ATP binding cavity, which is essential for its biological function (Cardenal2023Binding).

In terms of quaternary structure, CDC123 interacts with the γ subunit of eIF2 (eIF2γ), facilitating the assembly of the eIF2 complex. This interaction is transient and involves specific contact regions between CDC123 and eIF2γ (Panvert2015Cdc123). The integrity of the ATP binding site is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the eIF2 complex (Cardenal2023Binding). The protein does not have known post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned in the context.

## Function
The CDC123 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, which is essential for protein biosynthesis. eIF2 is a heterotrimeric GTPase involved in the initiation of translation by delivering methionylated initiator tRNA to the ribosomal translation initiation complex. CDC123 is necessary for the assembly of eIF2 from its three subunits (α, β, and γ), specifically facilitating the assembly of the γ subunit with the α subunit (Panvert2015Cdc123). This interaction is critical for the recycling of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, a step catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, which is essential for continued rounds of translation initiation (Cardenal2023Binding).

The CDC123 protein is characterized as an ATP-grasp protein, indicating its involvement in ATP-dependent processes. ATP binding is crucial for its function, as mutations in the ATP-binding site impair its ability to facilitate eIF2 assembly (Cardenal2023Binding). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and protein synthesis, and it has been implicated in diseases such as cancer when mutated (Panvert2015Cdc123).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDC123 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably cancer and type 2 diabetes. In cancer, CDC123 is considered a candidate oncogene, particularly in breast cancer, due to its role in cell cycle regulation and protein biosynthesis. Mutations in CDC123 can disrupt the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, leading to impaired protein synthesis and potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Panvert2015Cdc123).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, genetic variants in the CDC123/CAMK1D locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to the disease. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs10906115 in this region is significantly linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, as demonstrated in studies involving Japanese and other populations (Imamura2011Genetic). This variant is thought to affect pancreatic β-cell function, potentially through mechanisms involving increased apoptosis and impaired insulin response (SimonisBik2009Gene; Grarup2008Association). Additionally, the CDC123/CAMK1D variant has been associated with changes in lipid metabolism, which may further contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (LaraRiegos2015Diabetes).

## Interactions
CDC123 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, which is essential for protein synthesis. It specifically interacts with the γ subunit of eIF2 (eIF2γ), particularly with domain III (γDIII) of eIF2γ. This interaction is vital for the assembly of the eIF2 heterotrimer, which consists of α, β, and γ subunits (Panvert2015Cdc123; Cardenal2023Binding). The binding of CDC123 to eIF2γDIII does not require ATP-Mg2+, and the interaction was confirmed through various biochemical methods, including molecular sieving and pull-down experiments (Panvert2015Cdc123).

The interaction involves specific regions of CDC123, such as α3, η2, α5, and α6, which are unique to CDC123 proteins and not found in ATP-grasp enzymes (Panvert2015Cdc123). The C-terminal tail of eIF2γ is crucial for its interaction with CDC123, as removal of certain residues can disrupt binding (Panvert2015Cdc123). Structural analysis revealed that the γDIII domain forms a β-barrel and binds to one side of CDC123 domain 1, with an interaction surface of 1307 Å² (Panvert2015Cdc123).

CDC123 also interacts with eIF2α, and this interaction is necessary for the assembly process of eIF2. The C-terminal domain of CDC123 is essential for its function, as it is involved in the assembly of eIF2γ to eIF2α (Panvert2015Cdc123). The integrity of the ATP binding site in CDC123 is crucial for its interaction with eIF2γ and the eIF2γ-eIF2β dimer (Cardenal2023Binding).
