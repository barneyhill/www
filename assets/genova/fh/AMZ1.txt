# AMZ1

## Overview
AMZ1, or archaelysin family metallopeptidase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the metallopeptidase family, which is involved in proteolytic processes within human cells. The protein encoded by AMZ1 is a metallopeptidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, playing a critical role in protein degradation, processing, and turnover. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by balancing protein synthesis and degradation. Such activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including the removal of damaged or misfolded proteins, thereby preventing cellular stress and ensuring proper cellular function. The involvement of AMZ1 in these proteolytic processes underscores its importance in the dynamic regulation of the proteome, which is essential for cellular adaptation and response to environmental changes (Xiao2015Identification; S2022Rare).

## Function
AMZ1 (archaelysin family metallopeptidase 1) encodes a protein that is part of the metallopeptidase family, which is crucial for proteolytic processes in human cells. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, facilitating protein degradation, processing, and turnover. AMZ1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it may play a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by regulating the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This function is essential for various cellular processes, including the removal of damaged or misfolded proteins, which helps prevent cellular stress and maintains cellular function. The activity of AMZ1 in the cytoplasm suggests its involvement in the broader context of cellular protein management, contributing to the overall health and stability of the cell. By participating in these proteolytic processes, AMZ1 supports the dynamic regulation of the proteome, which is vital for cellular adaptation and response to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
The AMZ1 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its mutations and altered expression levels. In the context of obesity, loss-of-function (LoF) variants in AMZ1 have been associated with a reduced risk of obesity, suggesting a protective role against this condition (S2022Rare). This finding highlights the potential of AMZ1 mutations to influence adiposity and metabolic health.

In cancer research, AMZ1 has been identified as significantly downregulated in colorectal cancer, with a more pronounced decrease in colon cancer compared to rectal cancer. This downregulation suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Xiao2015Identification).

The AMZ1 gene is also part of a genomic region involved in a novel microdeletion syndrome characterized by developmental delays and distinct facial features. However, there is no direct clinical phenotype linked to haploinsufficiency of AMZ1 alone, indicating that its role in this syndrome may be part of a broader genetic interaction (Yu2017Variable).

In Turner Syndrome, rare copy number variants involving AMZ1 have been identified, though their contribution to the syndrome's phenotype requires further investigation (Li2019Rare).
