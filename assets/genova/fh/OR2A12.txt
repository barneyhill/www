# OR2A12

## Overview
The OR2A12 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 12, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odor molecules, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in the perception of smell (Vavlukis2023Rosuvastatin). While its primary function is associated with olfaction, the expression of OR2A12 and other olfactory receptors in non-olfactory tissues suggests potential additional roles, although these are not yet fully understood (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
The OR2A12 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Vavlukis2023Rosuvastatin). The molecular function of OR2A12 involves detecting odorants in olfactory receptor neurons, contributing to the sense of smell by activating downstream signaling pathways upon binding to specific molecules (Vavlukis2023Rosuvastatin).

While the primary role of OR2A12 is in olfactory detection, olfactory receptors, including OR2A12, have been identified in other tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction. However, the specific molecular function of OR2A12 in healthy human cells outside the olfactory system is not well-documented (Vavlukis2023Rosuvastatin). The presence of OR genes in various tissues, such as the skin, indicates they may have additional roles in processes like epidermal homeostasis, although this is more broadly attributed to the olfactory receptor family rather than OR2A12 specifically (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
