# ZNF300

## Overview
ZNF300 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 300, a member of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, characterized by its ability to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. The ZNF300 protein contains a KRAB domain, typically associated with transcriptional repression, and twelve C2H2 zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to interact with GC-rich DNA sequences (Qiu2008Identification; Gou2004Identification). Despite its repressive domain, ZNF300 can also act as a transcriptional activator, possibly through interactions with co-factors or other domains (Qiu2008Identification). It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including immune response regulation and epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation (Yan2017ZNF300). ZNF300's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its dysregulation in diseases like cancer and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease highlight its clinical significance (Yu2020ZNF300; Yan2019ZNF300).

## Structure
The ZNF300 protein is a member of the KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein family, characterized by its 604 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 68.75 kDa (Qiu2008Identification; Gou2004Identification). The primary structure of ZNF300 includes an N-terminal KRAB domain, which is known for its transcriptional repressor activity, and twelve C2H2 zinc finger motifs located at the C-terminus (Qiu2008Identification; Gou2004Identification). These zinc finger motifs follow the consensus sequence CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H and are connected by highly conserved H/C linkers, TGE(K/R)PYX, which are typical of nucleic acid-binding proteins (Gou2004Identification).

The secondary structure of ZNF300 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in zinc finger proteins, facilitating DNA binding. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a stable conformation that allows for specific DNA interactions. ZNF300 binds to a GC-rich DNA sequence, with a preference for the sequence CTGGGGGCG, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Xue2010ZNF300; Qiu2008Identification). The protein is localized to the nucleus, supporting its role in transcriptional regulation (Gou2004Identification). There is no evidence of quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The ZNF300 gene encodes a KRAB/C2H2 zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor in human cells. This protein is involved in transcriptional regulation by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing the expression of target genes. ZNF300 contains a KRAB domain, which is typically associated with transcriptional repression, and 12 C2H2 zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding (Yan2017ZNF300; Gou2004Identification).

ZNF300 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. It has been shown to bind specifically to a GC-rich DNA element, sharing binding sites with the transcription factor Egr1. This binding is crucial for the activation of the IL-2Rβ promoter, indicating a role in immune response regulation (Xue2010ZNF300; Qiu2008Identification). Despite its KRAB domain, which usually suggests repressive activity, ZNF300 can function as a transcriptional activator, possibly by recruiting co-factors or through other domains (Qiu2008Identification).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF300 is involved in epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, which are key processes in gene expression and chromatin structure (Yan2017ZNF300).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZNF300 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ZNF300 is associated with chemoresistance and aggressive tumor behavior. Increased expression of ZNF300 in NSCLC cell lines correlates with resistance to multiple chemotherapy drugs and poor overall survival in patients. This resistance is linked to the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathways and activation of CDK1, promoting a slow-cycling phenotype that enhances malignant progression (Yu2020ZNF300).

In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the lincRNA ZNF300P1, associated with ZNF300, is frequently hypermethylated and silenced, particularly in Type II EOC. This silencing affects cell cycle regulation and motility, contributing to metastasis. The loss of ZNF300P1 expression results in decreased cell proliferation and altered cell adhesion, facilitating the metastatic spread of EOC (Gloss2014ZNF300P1).

ZNF300 also plays a role in hepatic lipid metabolism, with its expression being downregulated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This downregulation is associated with increased DNA methylation, contributing to hepatic steatosis. ZNF300 regulates fatty acid oxidation by modulating PPARα, and its altered expression may be linked to the pathogenesis of NAFLD (Yan2019ZNF300).

## Interactions
ZNF300 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the IKKβ protein, a key component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, enhancing the phosphorylation of IKKβ and promoting NF-κB activity. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays, indicating that ZNF300 can activate the kinase activity of IKKβ (Wang2012Overexpression).

ZNF300 also interacts with TRAF2, a member of the TRAF protein family involved in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. It enhances TRAF2 expression by binding to its promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays (Wang2012Overexpression).

In addition to protein interactions, ZNF300 binds to specific DNA sequences, such as the GC-rich element in the IL-2Rβ promoter, sharing binding sites with the transcription factor Egr1. This binding is crucial for activating the IL-2Rβ promoter, as shown by EMSA and supershift experiments (Xue2010ZNF300).

ZNF300 also participates in self-regulation through its interaction with ZNF300ZFR, a zinc finger domain-encoding region, which acts as a repressor. This interaction involves DNA methylation and histone acetylation, impacting gene expression and cellular differentiation (Yan2017ZNF300).
