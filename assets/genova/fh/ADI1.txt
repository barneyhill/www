# ADI1

## Overview
The ADI1 gene encodes the acireductone dioxygenase 1 protein, a member of the cupin superfamily characterized by its conserved β-barrel structure. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the methionine salvage pathway, facilitating the conversion of acireductone into formate and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate, a precursor to methionine. The protein's activity is dependent on the presence of a metal ion, typically Fe2+ or Ni2+, coordinated by a His3-Glu1 motif within its active site. Beyond its enzymatic functions, acireductone dioxygenase 1 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, influencing cellular processes such as tumor suppression and viral infection regulation. Its expression and activity are modulated by cellular iron levels and interactions with iron chaperones, highlighting its regulatory complexity. Alterations in ADI1 expression have been linked to several cancers, underscoring its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Chu2019The; Deshpande2017The; Bae2020Acireductone).

## Structure
The ADI1 gene encodes the human acireductone dioxygenase 1 protein, which is involved in the methionine salvage pathway. The protein is characterized by a conserved β-barrel structure, known as the 'cupin barrel,' which is a common feature of the cupin superfamily. This structure consists of anti-parallel β-sheets forming a β-helix 'jelly roll' motif (Deshpande2017The; Miłaczewska2018On). The active site of the enzyme typically contains a metal ion, such as Fe2+ or Ni2+, coordinated by a His3-Glu1 motif, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Deshpande2017The; Miłaczewska2018On).

The tertiary structure of ADI1 includes a central β-barrel, with the active center inside the barrel coordinating the metal ion through specific histidine and glutamate residues (Miłaczewska2018On). The protein maintains its β-barrel structure even in truncated variants, such as SipL, which lacks the first 63 amino acids but retains the metal binding site (Deshpande2017The).

ADI1 can exist in different isoforms depending on the metal ion bound, which affects its structural stability and enzymatic function. The Ni2+-bound form exhibits higher thermal stability compared to the Fe2+-bound form, due to specific interactions within the protein structure (Deshpande2017The). The protein's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as binding to the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP, which influences its regulatory functions (Liu2020A).

## Function
Acireductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1) is a non-heme iron-containing enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methionine salvage pathway, which is essential for recycling methionine from the by-product 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) (Bae2020Acireductone). This pathway is vital for maintaining methionine homeostasis, which is necessary for protein synthesis and the production of polyamines like spermidine and spermine, important for cellular proliferation and growth (Bae2020Acireductone).

ADI1 catalyzes the conversion of acireductone into formate and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoate (MTOB), a precursor to methionine (Bae2020Acireductone). The enzyme's activity is dependent on Fe(II) as a cofactor, and its expression is regulated by cellular iron levels through interactions with iron chaperones such as PCBP1 and potentially PCBP2 (Bae2020Acireductone). Under iron-replete conditions, PCBP1 facilitates the metallation and stabilization of ADI1, enhancing its expression and function (Bae2020Acireductone).

In addition to its enzymatic role, ADI1 has regulatory functions, such as inhibiting MT1-MMP-mediated cellular invasiveness, which is linked to its potential tumor-suppressive activities (Deshpande2017The). ADI1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, as evidenced by its co-localization with PCBP1 and PCBP2 in these cellular compartments (Bae2020Acireductone).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADI1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ADI1 is significantly down-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues. This down-regulation is associated with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. Overexpression of ADI1 in HCC cells reduces cell proliferation and is linked to favorable postoperative recurrence-free survival, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Chu2019The).

In prostate cancer, ADI1 is downregulated in high-grade tumors. Its expression is androgen-responsive, and enforced expression induces apoptosis, indicating a potential inhibitory role in cancer progression (Oram2007Expression).

In endometrial cancer, particularly uterine serous carcinomas (SC) and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), ADI1 is overexpressed, especially in cases with mutant p53 expression. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced migratory and invasive capacities of cancer cells, suggesting a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Gatius2022Metabolomic).

These findings underscore the complex role of ADI1 in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
Acireductone dioxygenase 1 (ADI1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. ADI1 interacts with the iron chaperones poly r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) 1 and 2. PCBP1 plays a significant role in maintaining ADI1 expression by delivering iron, which is essential for ADI1's stability and function. PCBP2 may act as a co-chaperone, although its silencing does not significantly affect ADI1 expression (Bae2020Acireductone).

ADI1 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinase I (MMP-I), specifically binding to its cytoplasmic transmembrane tail peptide. This interaction is significant in the context of tumor metastasis, as MMP-I is involved in this process. The binding site on ADI1 for the MMP-I tail peptide is located near the metal binding site, adjacent to a dynamic proline-rich loop (Liu2020A).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, ADI1 interacts with membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). This interaction is associated with the regulation of HCV infection, as MT1-MMP expression can reduce HCV cell entry, an effect that can be reversed by ADI1 overexpression (Chang2015Interaction).
