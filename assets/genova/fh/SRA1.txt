# SRA1

## Overview
The SRA1 gene encodes the Steroid Receptor RNA Activator 1 (SRAP), a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of steroid receptor activity. SRAP is categorized as a co-regulator protein, interacting with various transcription factors and steroid receptors, such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), to modulate gene expression in a context-dependent manner (Sheng2018New). The gene is notable for producing both coding and non-coding RNA products, with the non-coding RNA functioning as a transcriptional coactivator that influences nuclear receptor signaling pathways (Colley2008The). The dual nature of SRA1, encompassing both RNA and protein functions, underscores its involvement in diverse physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism (Liu2014SRA). Additionally, alterations in SRA1 expression have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Sheng2018New; Kotan2016Idiopathic).

## Structure
The SRA1 gene encodes the Steroid Receptor RNA Activator Protein (SRAP), which is involved in modulating steroid receptor activity. SRAP is composed of 236/237 amino acids and features a five-helix X bundle structure, similar to the carboxy-terminal domain of the yeast protein PRP18, a splicing factor involved in RNA interaction and pre-mRNA splicing (Sheng2018New). This structural similarity suggests a potential role in modulating splicing. 

SRAP interacts with various transcription factors and steroid receptors, such as ERα and GR, acting as a co-activator or repressor depending on the cellular context (Sheng2018New). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may play a role in cell cycle regulation (Sheng2018New). 

The SRA1 gene produces multiple splice variant isoforms, which can result in distinct functional roles. These isoforms include both non-coding RNA and the protein product, complicating functional studies due to the bifunctional nature of the locus (Sheng2018New). The presence of conserved regions in both the RNA and protein products suggests significant functional importance (Kotan2016Idiopathic).

## Function
The SRA1 gene encodes the Steroid Receptor RNA Activator (SRA), a long non-coding RNA that functions as a transcriptional coactivator in healthy human cells. SRA plays a crucial role in regulating nuclear receptor signaling by acting as an RNA scaffold that recruits various regulatory molecules to transcriptional coactivator or corepressor complexes. It interacts with nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR), as well as nonsteroid nuclear hormone receptors like thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) (Sheng2018New; Colley2008The).

SRA is involved in several physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. It enhances the transcriptional activity of PPARγ, promoting adipocyte differentiation and improving insulin sensitivity by modulating insulin signaling pathways (Sheng2018New; Liu2014SRA). SRA also influences muscle differentiation by enhancing the activity of MyoD, a key regulator of muscle differentiation (Sheng2018New).

In addition to its role in differentiation, SRA is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis, affecting the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and promoting S-phase entry (Sheng2018New). These functions highlight SRA's significant impact on cellular homeostasis and its involvement in diverse physiological pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SRA1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), inactivating mutations in SRA1 disrupt the initiation of puberty by affecting the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. These mutations can impair the function of the GnRH pulse generator, crucial for pubertal development, leading to absent secondary sexual characteristics and prepubertal hormone levels (Kotan2016Idiopathic).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, SRA1 expression is often up-regulated in tumors of steroid-responsive tissues. This up-regulation is associated with increased cancer cell invasion and progression, independent of estrogen receptor action. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the SRA1 locus are linked to breast cancer risk and estrogen receptor positivity (Sheng2018New; Colley2011Steroid).

SRA1 also plays a role in metabolic disorders. Its expression is enriched in liver and muscle tissues, and knockout studies in mice have shown resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting its potential as a target for metabolic diseases (Sheng2018New).

In colorectal cancer, increased SRA1 expression is associated with enhanced oxidative phosphorylation capacity and drug resistance, particularly in cases with KRAS mutations, indicating its potential as a biomarker for drug resistance (Mahdevar2021Steroid).

## Interactions
The SRA1 gene product, known as the Steroid Receptor RNA Activator (SRA), is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. SRA functions as a scaffold RNA, forming complexes with nuclear receptors (NRs) and transcription factors such as MyoD, Oct4, Nanog, and FOXO1. It interacts with coactivators like SRC-1 and RNA helicases such as p68/p72, enhancing the transcriptional activities of NRs, including the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and progesterone receptor (PR) (Sheng2018New).

SRA also binds to Dax-1, enhancing the transcriptional activity of Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) in steroidogenesis (Xu2009Dax1). It interacts with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer, activating a subset of NRs (Sheng2018New). SRA's interactions with repressive proteins such as SHARP and SLIRP allow it to suppress NR transactivation, demonstrating its dual role in gene regulation (Sheng2018New; Colley2008The).

In the context of actin assembly, SRA1, as Sra-1, forms a complex with Nap1, Abi-1, and WAVE2, crucial for actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation (Steffen2004Sra1). These interactions highlight SRA1's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
