# TNFRSF17

## Overview
TNFRSF17, also known as B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), is a gene that encodes a receptor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. This receptor is predominantly expressed on mature B lymphocytes and plasma cells, playing a pivotal role in B cell development, survival, and differentiation. The protein encoded by TNFRSF17 interacts with ligands such as APRIL and BAFF, which are crucial for promoting B cell survival and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating immune responses (Kampa2020The; Danielewicz2024Cord). TNFRSF17 is also implicated in various pathological conditions, including allergic diseases and cancers, where it influences processes such as inflammation, tumor cell stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Danielewicz2024Cord; Pelekanou2018BCMA).

## Function
TNFRSF17, also known as BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), is a receptor primarily expressed on mature B lymphocytes and plasma cells. It plays a significant role in B cell development, survival, and differentiation, particularly during the transition to plasma cells. TNFRSF17 binds to ligands such as APRIL and BAFF, which are members of the TNF superfamily, promoting B cell survival and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells (Kampa2020The; Danielewicz2024Cord). This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating antibody production and immune responses (Kampa2020The).

In healthy human cells, TNFRSF17 is involved in the differentiation of naïve B cells into IgA+ IL10-producing B cells, which can suppress inflammation, playing a role in conditions like atopic dermatitis and asthma (Danielewicz2024Cord). It is also associated with pathways such as TGF beta, NF kappa, and JNK, which are important in immune responses and allergy development (Danielewicz2024Cord). TNFRSF17's expression is higher in the gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes, indicating its key role in immune responses and food allergies (Danielewicz2024Cord).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TNFRSF17 gene, also known as BCMA, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of allergic diseases, TNFRSF17 methylation in cord blood is associated with early allergic phenotypes such as food allergies and eczema in children. The study found that altered methylation patterns at TNFRSF17, particularly at specific sites, were linked to the development of these conditions, suggesting its potential role as a disease marker for non-IgE-mediated food allergies (Danielewicz2024Cord).

In breast cancer, TNFRSF17 plays a significant role in promoting cancer cell stemness and metastatic potential through its interaction with the cytokines APRIL and BAFF. These interactions enhance cell migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the formation of mammospheres, which are indicative of stem cell-like properties. The BCMA-JNK signaling pathway is particularly involved in these processes, contributing to tumor growth and therapy resistance (Pelekanou2018BCMA).

Additionally, TNFRSF17 has been studied in the context of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), where its deficiency is linked to impaired plasma cell survival, mirroring some of the pathologies observed in CVID patients (Salzer2008Screening).

## Interactions
TNFRSF17, also known as BCMA, is a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that primarily interacts with the ligands APRIL (TNFSF13) and BAFF (TNFSF13B). These interactions are crucial for B-cell development and survival. In breast cancer, TNFRSF17 mediates the effects of APRIL and BAFF, promoting cancer cell stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the JNK signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the expression of pluripotency genes such as ALDH1A1, KLF4, and NANOG, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and therapy resistance (Pelekanou2018BCMA).

In colon cancer, TNFRSF17 is associated with CD8+ T cells and interacts with various proteins, including TNFSF13, TNFSF13B, and TRAF family members, which are involved in immune response regulation and tumor suppression. Overexpression of TNFRSF17 in colon cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Song2022CD8+).

TNFRSF17 also binds to BAFF in allergic responses, influencing B cell maturation and T cell-mediated responses. This interaction is significant in conditions like asthma and food allergies, where BAFF levels are elevated (Danielewicz2024Cord).
