# ATF5

## Overview
The ATF5 gene encodes the activating transcription factor 5, a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its bZIP domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, playing a pivotal role in cellular stress responses and differentiation processes (Ciaccio2008Highyield). ATF5 is particularly significant in neural development, where it maintains neural progenitor cells in a proliferative state, inhibiting their differentiation into mature neural cells (Mason2005ATF5; Angelastro2003Regulated). Additionally, ATF5 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response and mitochondrial UPR, promoting cell survival under stress conditions (Paerhati2022Advancements). Clinically, alterations in ATF5 expression are associated with various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme and breast cancer, where it contributes to tumor cell survival and proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2021ELF1; Monaco2007The).

## Structure
The ATF5 protein is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors, characterized by a bZIP domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. The bZIP domain includes a basic sequence for DNA binding and a helical leucine zipper region that enhances dimerization and DNA binding affinity (Ciaccio2008Highyield). The primary structure of ATF5 features a unique cysteine residue within the bZIP domain, which can form intermolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability and helicity (Ciaccio2009Effects).

The secondary structure of ATF5 is predominantly α-helical, with circular dichroism (CD) analysis indicating approximately 27% α-helical content (Ciaccio2008Highyield). The presence of valine residues in the leucine zipper region, instead of the typical leucine residues, affects the protein's stability and aggregation propensity (Ciaccio2009Effects). The tertiary structure is not well-defined, as ATF5 lacks a stable coiled-coil structure under physiological conditions (Ciaccio2009Effects).

ATF5 can form both monomeric and dimeric species, with the dimerization mediated by disulfide bonds (Ciaccio2008Highyield). The protein's quaternary structure is influenced by these disulfide bonds, which enhance helicity and reduce aggregation (Ciaccio2009Effects).

## Function
The ATF5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular stress responses and differentiation processes in healthy human cells. ATF5 is involved in maintaining centrosome integrity during the centrosome duplication cycle by interacting with pericentrin and polyglutamylated tubulin, which is essential for centriole formation (Paerhati2022Advancements). It undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation, which influence its stability and function (Paerhati2022Advancements).

In neural development, ATF5 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells, where it maintains them in a proliferative state and inhibits their differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Mason2005ATF5; Angelastro2005Downregulation; Angelastro2003Regulated). This regulation is crucial for proper brain development, as ATF5 downregulation is necessary for the differentiation of these progenitors into mature neural cells (Mason2005ATF5; Angelastro2003Regulated).

ATF5 also plays a role in cellular stress responses, such as the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER UPR) and mitochondrial UPR, by upregulating molecular chaperones and proteases to maintain protein homeostasis and promote cell survival under stress conditions (Paerhati2022Advancements; Sears2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATF5 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor. High ATF5 expression is associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients, as it promotes tumor cell survival and proliferation. Studies have shown that interfering with ATF5 expression or function in glioma cells induces apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2021ELF1; Angelastro2005Selective; Sheng2010A).

ATF5 is also involved in a survival pathway in malignant glioma, where it upregulates MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein, contributing to tumor cell survival. This pathway is regulated by transcription factors such as CREB3L2 and is crucial for glioma cell viability (Sheng2010A).

In breast cancer, ATF5 is overexpressed in neoplastic tissues compared to nonneoplastic tissues. Its expression is linked to the survival of cancer cells, and interference with ATF5 function selectively induces apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines (Monaco2007The).

ATF5 also plays a role in pancreatic β-cell survival during stress, with its deficiency leading to increased susceptibility to apoptosis, which may contribute to diabetes pathogenesis (Juliana2017ATF5).

## Interactions
ATF5 interacts with a variety of centrosomal proteins, including γ-tubulin, α-tubulin, GCP-2, GCP-4, and pericentrin (PCNT), as confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. It also interacts with centrosome-related proteins such as EG5, LIS1, NudE, NudEL, DISC1, and NPM1/B23. Immunofluorescence microscopy has shown that both ectopically expressed and endogenous ATF5 co-localize at the centrosome with known centrosomal markers (Madarampalli2015ATF5).

ATF5 binds to the mother centriole via polyglutamylated tubulin (PGT) through electrostatic interactions, where the positively charged amino acids in the ATF5 DNA-binding domain (DBD) interact with the negatively charged polyglutamate moieties on PGT. The proline-rich region and DBD of ATF5 are important for this interaction, while the bZIP region is not required. ATF5 also interacts with PCNT using its DBD and bZIP region, forming a tripartite complex with PGT and PCNT, which is necessary for the accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) and centriole formation (Madarampalli2015ATF5).

ATF5 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, interacting with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Cisplatin treatment affects this interaction by promoting the translocation of Cdc34 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby reducing its interaction with ATF5 and inhibiting ATF5 degradation (Wei2008Cdc34mediated).
