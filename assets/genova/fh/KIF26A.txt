# KIF26A

## Overview
KIF26A is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 26A, which is part of the kinesin superfamily. Unlike typical kinesins, KIF26A is classified as an atypical kinesin due to its lack of ATPase activity, which is a common feature in other kinesins (Hirokawa2015Kinesin). The protein plays a significant role in the development of the enteric nervous system by modulating key signaling pathways, such as the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-Ret signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative regulator (Ohara2021Genetic). KIF26A is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, heart, and kidney, indicating its diverse functional roles in cellular processes like cell migration and axon guidance (Ohara2021Genetic). Additionally, KIF26A has been implicated in pathological conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders and breast cancer, where its expression levels and regulatory mechanisms influence disease progression and phenotype (Xu2021E2F1).

## Function
KIF26A is a member of the kinesin superfamily, specifically classified as an atypical kinesin due to its lack of ATPase activity. In healthy human cells, KIF26A plays a crucial role in the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) by modulating signal transduction pathways. It acts as a negative regulator of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-Ret signaling pathway, which is essential for the proper development of the ENS. KIF26A achieves this by competitively inhibiting the binding of Grb2, a key component of the GDNF/Akt/Erk signaling pathway, thereby suppressing the pathway's activity (Hirokawa2015Kinesin; Ohara2021Genetic).

This suppression is vital for preventing enteric nerve hyperplasia, as demonstrated in studies where mice lacking KIF26A developed megacolon due to excessive enteric nerve growth (Hirokawa2015Kinesin). KIF26A is expressed in various tissues, including enteric neurons, the brain, lung, heart, and kidney, indicating its diverse functional roles (Ohara2021Genetic). Its activity in the cytoplasm contributes to the regulation of cell migration and axon guidance, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
KIF26A has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell signaling and migration. In the context of gastrointestinal disorders, KIF26A deficiency in mice has been linked to the development of megacolon, a condition characterized by an enlarged colon and enteric nerve hyperplasia. This phenotype is influenced by genetic background, as seen in Kif26a-deficient mice with different genetic backgrounds, where C57BL/6 mice develop megacolon and die early, while BALB/c mice survive longer without developing megacolon but exhibit functional bowel abnormalities like chronic constipation (Ohara2021Genetic).

In breast cancer, KIF26A is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. It is a direct transcription target of the E2F1 transcription factor, which enhances KIF26A expression, forming a feedback loop that promotes cancer cell growth. Elevated KIF26A levels are associated with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis and positive estrogen receptor expression, although it does not correlate with long-term survival outcomes (Xu2021E2F1).
