# CBL

## Overview
The CBL gene encodes the Cbl proto-oncogene, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling and regulation. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the Cbl protein is integral to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), thereby modulating signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Mohapatra2013Protein; Thien2005cCbl). Structurally, the Cbl protein is characterized by a tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, a RING finger domain, and proline-rich motifs, which facilitate its interactions with various signaling molecules and its function in ubiquitination (Hu2005Structural; Meng1999Structure). Beyond its role in protein degradation, Cbl is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and immune cell signaling, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation (Dikic2003Cbl; Swaminathan2006The). Mutations in the CBL gene are implicated in several hematological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Martinelli2015Molecular; Leardini2022Role).

## Structure
The CBL gene encodes the Cbl proto-oncogene, a protein involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The Cbl protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region, known as the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, includes a four-helix bundle, an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, and a divergent Src homology-2 (SH2) domain (Hu2005Structural; Meng1999Structure). The four-helix bundle is involved in phosphotyrosine recognition, while the EF-hand domain binds calcium, influencing the orientation of adjacent domains (Meng1999Structure). The SH2 domain, although structurally similar to other SH2 domains, has unique features that facilitate specific interactions with phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (Meng1999Structure).

Adjacent to the TKB domain is the RING finger domain, which plays a crucial role in the protein's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by binding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Hu2005Structural). The C-terminal region contains proline-rich motifs and tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which are important for interactions with other signaling proteins (Hu2005Structural). Cbl proteins undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate their activity and interactions (Dou2012Structural). Multiple splice variants of Cbl exist, which may alter its regulatory roles in cell signaling (Hu2005Structural).

## Function
The CBL gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in healthy human cells. Cbl proteins are involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of activated RTKs, such as EGFR and PDGFR, which is essential for controlling the amplitude and duration of signaling pathways (Mohapatra2013Protein; Thien2005cCbl). The Cbl protein contains a RING finger domain that facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins, leading to their degradation or functional modification (Dikic2003Cbl).

Cbl proteins are also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cell adhesion and motility. They interact with Src family kinases and PI-3 kinase activity, which are crucial for cell spreading and the formation of actin structures like stress fibers and lamellipodia (Dikic2003Cbl). In the immune system, Cbl proteins regulate signaling pathways of various immune cell receptors, such as the T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR), ensuring proper immune responses and preventing excessive activation (Dikic2003Cbl). These functions are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation (Swaminathan2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CBL gene are associated with a range of hematological malignancies and syndromes. Germline mutations in CBL can lead to CBL syndrome, a condition that predisposes individuals to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and exhibits features similar to Noonan syndrome, including cardiac defects, growth retardation, and craniofacial abnormalities (Martinelli2015Molecular; Perez2010Germline). These mutations often involve the RING finger domain or the linker helix region, disrupting CBL's E3 ligase activity and leading to pathological activation of the RAS signaling pathway (Martinelli2015Molecular; Perez2010Germline).

In myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), CBL mutations are frequently observed. These mutations often occur in the linker region between the tyrosine kinase binding domain and the RING finger domain, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival signaling (Grand2009Frequent; Bacher2010Mutations). In JMML, CBL mutations are found in 10% to 15% of cases and are associated with loss of heterozygosity via uniparental disomy, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Leardini2022Role). These mutations can also lead to constitutive activation of the RAS pathway, making them potential targets for MEK inhibitors (Leardini2022Role).

## Interactions
The CBL gene encodes the c-Cbl protein, which is involved in numerous physical interactions with other proteins, acting as a multivalent adapter and E3 ubiquitin ligase. c-Cbl interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR2, facilitating their ubiquitination and degradation (Tang2022Negative). It forms complexes with Src-family kinases and other signaling molecules, including PI-3K, Crk, and Grb2, through its various domains (Swaminathan2006The; Tsygankov2001Beyond). The TKB domain of c-Cbl binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on activated PTKs, while the RING finger domain recruits E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Mohapatra2013Protein; Tsygankov2001Beyond).

c-Cbl also interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements, such as CAP and CMS/CD2AP, which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton regulation (Tsygankov2001Beyond). It binds to SH3-containing proteins like Src-family kinases and CIN85, which are important for RTK endocytosis and degradation (Mohapatra2013Protein; Tang2022Negative). These interactions highlight c-Cbl's role in regulating various cellular processes through its extensive network of protein interactions.
