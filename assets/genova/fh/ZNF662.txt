# ZNF662

## Overview
ZNF662 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 662, which is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 662 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modifications. It has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where it influences cancer cell proliferation and survival outcomes (Wu2022A; Martins2024A). Additionally, ZNF662 is associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, where it interacts with G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, affecting patient prognosis (Piryaei2023Metaanalysis).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF662 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), ZNF662 is associated with cancer progression through epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation. It is part of a prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes, where higher expression levels correlate with a worse prognosis and lower overall survival rates (Wu2022A).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), ZNF662 is part of a cluster of KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that define a subset of DLBCL with distinct characteristics. This subset, known as KZFP High DLBCLs, is characterized by a proliferative and highly metabolic state, contributing to shorter survival rates. ZNF662 is identified as a better-prognosis gene, suggesting a potential protective role in DLBCL (Martins2024A).

In breast cancer, ZNF662 is involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and is associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Its expression is linked to G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) binding, with low GPER1 expression correlating with adverse survival outcomes (Piryaei2023Metaanalysis).
