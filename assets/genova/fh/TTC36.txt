# TTC36

## Overview
TTC36 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 36, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing TTC36 to function as a scaffold in various cellular processes. The TTC36 protein plays a significant role in maintaining the stability of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD), a key enzyme in the catabolic pathway of phenylalanine and tyrosine, by preventing its degradation through the inhibition of specific phosphorylation events. Additionally, TTC36 is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis in renal tubular cells, contributing to cellular protection against stress-induced apoptosis. The gene's expression and function have clinical implications, particularly in cancer and acute kidney injury, where it acts as a tumor suppressor and a protective agent, respectively (Yan2021Tetratricopeptide; Song2021TTC36; Xie2019HPD).

## Structure
The TTC36 protein is characterized by the presence of three adjacent tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, each consisting of a 34-amino acid sequence that folds into a helix-turn-helix motif. These motifs form a right-handed superhelix, which facilitates protein-protein interactions by accommodating complementary domains of various ligands (Song2021TTC36). The TPR motifs contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, enabling TTC36 to act as a scaffold for interactions with other proteins, such as the C-terminal domain of Hsp70, which is involved in cellular functions like chaperone activity and cell-cycle regulation (Song2021TTC36).

The molecular structure of TTC36 allows it to play a role in regulating the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD) by interacting with the TTC36-STK33-PELI1 signaling axis. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of HPD, highlighting the protein's role in maintaining HPD stability (Xie2019HPD). While specific post-translational modifications or splice variants for TTC36 are not detailed in the provided context, its structural motifs are crucial for its function in protein complex assembly and interaction.

## Function
The TTC36 gene encodes a protein that contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and facilitate the assembly of multiprotein complexes. In healthy human cells, TTC36 plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD) enzyme, which is essential in the catabolic pathway of phenylalanine and tyrosine. TTC36 achieves this by inhibiting the binding of the protein kinase STK33 to HPD, thereby preventing STK33-mediated phosphorylation of HPD at threonine 382. This phosphorylation is necessary for the binding of the E3 ligase PELI1, which leads to HPD polyubiquitylation and degradation. By blocking this process, TTC36 stabilizes HPD expression, preventing its degradation and ensuring proper tyrosine metabolism (Xie2019HPD).

In addition to its role in liver cells, TTC36 is expressed in renal tubular cells, where it helps maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. This function is particularly important in protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis, such as that caused by cisplatin treatment, by supporting mitochondrial membrane potential and autophagy-related gene expression (Yan2021Tetratricopeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TTC36 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In gastric carcinoma (GC), TTC36 expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. Low TTC36 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased malignancy in GC, as it affects cell proliferation and apoptosis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Song2021TTC36). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TTC36 is identified as a prognostic marker, with its downregulation linked to increased tumor progression and poor prognosis. Overexpression of TTC36 in HCC cells reduces cell proliferation and metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Chai2021An; Li2023Construction).

TTC36 also plays a role in acute kidney injury (AKI), where its expression is reduced in renal tubular cells during injury. Overexpression of TTC36 protects these cells from apoptosis, suggesting its potential in therapeutic interventions for AKI (Yan2021Tetratricopeptide). In the context of tyrosinemia, TTC36 regulates the degradation of the HPD protein, and its deficiency leads to neurological damage and elevated tyrosine levels, highlighting its importance in maintaining metabolic stability (Xie2019HPD).

## Interactions
TTC36, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 36, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. TTC36 interacts with 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) and plays a crucial role in regulating its degradation. It inhibits the binding of the protein kinase STK33 to HPD, which prevents the phosphorylation of HPD at threonine 382. This phosphorylation is necessary for the binding of PELI1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which leads to HPD polyubiquitylation and degradation (Xie2019HPD). By blocking these interactions, TTC36 stabilizes HPD and prevents its degradation, thereby maintaining its expression levels (Xie2019HPD).

In gastric carcinoma, TTC36 interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of TTC36 in gastric carcinoma cells leads to decreased levels of proteins associated with cell proliferation and survival, such as Survivin, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc, while increasing apoptosis markers like cleaved caspase-3. This suggests that TTC36 negatively regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting its downstream signaling events (Song2021TTC36). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TTC36 in cellular processes and disease contexts.
