# CTNS

## Overview
The CTNS gene encodes cystinosin, a lysosomal cystine transporter protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by mediating the efflux of cystine from lysosomes into the cytosol. Cystinosin is a transmembrane protein characterized by seven transmembrane domains, a feature that aligns it with the solute transporter family and bears resemblance to G-protein-coupled receptors (Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). This protein is essential for maintaining cysteine availability, which is crucial for various metabolic processes, including antioxidant synthesis (Sumayao2018The). Mutations in the CTNS gene result in cystinosis, a lysosomal storage disorder marked by cystine accumulation and crystal formation, leading to tissue and organ damage (David2018Molecular). Cystinosin's interactions with other proteins, such as galectin-3 and components of the mTOR signaling pathway, underscore its broader role in cellular processes beyond cystine transport (Zhang2017Cystinosin; Lobry2019Interaction).

## Structure
Cystinosin, encoded by the CTNS gene, is a lysosomal membrane protein consisting of 367 amino acids. It features a unique molecular structure with seven transmembrane domains, which is uncommon among solute transporters and reminiscent of G-protein-coupled receptors (Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). The protein includes a 128-amino acid N-terminal region with seven N-glycosylation sites, contributing to its stability and function within the lysosomal environment (Cherqui2001The; Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). The C-terminal tail contains a tyrosine-based lysosomal sorting motif, GYDQL, essential for its lysosomal targeting (Cherqui2001The; Kalatzis2001Cystinosin).

Cystinosin also contains a conserved internal repeat motif, designated PQ, which includes a characteristic PQ dipeptide crucial for its function as a cystine transporter (Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). The protein's activity is driven by the H+ electrochemical gradient across the lysosomal membrane (Kalatzis2004Molecular). A novel conformational lysosomal-sorting motif, YFPQA, located in the third cytoplasmic loop, is also important for its proper lysosomal localization (Cherqui2002Intralysosomal; Cherqui2001The).

Alternative splice variants of cystinosin, such as cystinosin-LKG, have been identified. This isoform lacks the GYDQL motif and is expressed in the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and other cytosolic structures (Taranta2008Identification).

## Function
The CTNS gene encodes cystinosin, a lysosomal cystine transporter protein that plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by facilitating the transport of cystine out of lysosomes into the cytosol. This transport is driven by a proton gradient established by the lysosomal H+-ATPase, which is essential for preventing cystine accumulation and subsequent crystal formation that can lead to cellular damage (Cherqui2001The; Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). In healthy cells, cystinosin ensures the availability of cysteine, a product of cystine reduction, which is vital for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant (Sumayao2018The).

Cystinosin is primarily localized to lysosomal membranes, where it functions as a cystine/H+ symporter. It is characterized by seven transmembrane domains and a lysosomal-targeting motif, which are critical for its proper localization and function (Cherqui2001The; Kalatzis2001Cystinosin). In addition to its role in cystine transport, cystinosin is involved in melanin synthesis by regulating melanosome pH and influencing tyrosinase stability, which is crucial for proper pigmentation (Chiaverini2012Cystinosin). The protein's activity is modulated by intracellular thiol levels and redox status, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular redox balance (Sumayao2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTNS gene, which encodes the lysosomal cystine transporter cystinosin, lead to cystinosis, a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Cystinosis is characterized by the accumulation of cystine within lysosomes, resulting in the formation of cystine crystals in various tissues and organs, particularly affecting the kidneys (David2018Molecular; Anikster1999CTNS). There are three clinical forms of cystinosis: infantile nephropathic, late-onset juvenile nephropathic, and non-nephropathic. The infantile form is the most severe, often leading to renal Fanconi syndrome and end-stage kidney disease if untreated (David2018Molecular; Anikster1999CTNS).

Over 140 pathogenic mutations in the CTNS gene have been identified, with a significant genotype-phenotype correlation. The most common mutation in Northern Europe and North America is a large 57-kb deletion affecting the promoter region and the first 10 exons of the CTNS gene (David2018Molecular; Kiehntopf2002Analysis). Some mutations, such as CTNS N288K, affect mTORC1 signaling, contributing to the disease phenotype (David2018Molecular). Treatment with cysteamine can lower cystine levels and prevent renal deterioration if started early (Anikster1999CTNS).

## Interactions
The CTNS gene encodes cystinosin, a lysosomal cystine transporter that participates in several protein interactions. Cystinosin interacts with galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of the b-galactoside-binding protein family, which plays a role in inflammation. This interaction is mediated by the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of Gal-3 and is inhibited by thiodigalactoside, a galectin-carbohydrate interaction inhibitor. The absence of cystinosin leads to overexpression of Gal-3 in the kidneys, enhancing macrophage infiltration and chronic kidney disease progression (Lobry2019Interaction).

Cystinosin also interacts with components of the vacuolar-type H+ adenosine triphosphatase, ragulator, and RagA/RagC, and is involved in the lysosomal recruitment of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) upon nutrient re-introduction (Lobry2019Interaction). Additionally, cystinosin is involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and affects the trafficking of the CMA receptor LAMP2A. In cystinotic cells, LAMP2A is mislocalized, but the expression of wild-type cystinosin or a mutant form (CTNS-K280R) can rescue LAMP2A trafficking defects (Zhang2017Cystinosin). These interactions highlight cystinosin's role beyond cystine transport, influencing cellular pathways such as CMA and mTOR signaling.
