# CGB3

## Overview
CGB3 is a gene that encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone that plays a pivotal role in pregnancy. The protein product, chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 3, is primarily expressed in the trophoblastic cells of the placenta and is essential for supporting the corpus luteum and stimulating progesterone production, which are critical for maintaining the uterine lining and promoting embryo implantation (Głodek2014Methylation). Structurally, the CGB3 protein is characterized by a cysteine-knot motif and undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are crucial for its stability and function (Borisova2017Human). The protein's role extends beyond pregnancy maintenance, as it is involved in immune modulation and the regulation of placental and fetal development (Biskup2020N; Borisova2017Human). Additionally, alterations in CGB3 expression and methylation have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncology (Singh2024Association; Chang2024Aberrant).

## Structure
The CGB3 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone crucial for pregnancy. The primary structure of the CGB3 protein consists of 144 amino acids, with a high degree of homology to the beta subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH), sharing approximately 85% sequence identity (Borisova2017Human). The CGB3 protein includes an additional 24-amino acid region compared to LH, which contributes to its unique function and structure (JAMESON1993Regulation).

The secondary structure of the CGB3 protein features a cysteine-knot motif stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is essential for its structural integrity and function (Borisova2017Human). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its biological activity, while the quaternary structure involves its association with the alpha subunit to form the active hCG hormone (Borisova2017Human).

Post-translational modifications, particularly glycosylation, play a significant role in the function of CGB3. The protein contains two N-glycosylated and four O-glycosylated regions, which affect its biological activity, receptor affinity, and half-life in the bloodstream (Borisova2017Human). These modifications are crucial for the stability and function of the hormone.

## Function
CGB3, a gene encoding the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), plays a crucial role in pregnancy by supporting the corpus luteum and stimulating progesterone production, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining and promoting embryo implantation (Głodek2014Methylation). The protein is predominantly expressed in trophoblastic cells of the placenta, where it contributes to the regulation of placental and fetal development by influencing angiogenesis and the formation of the blood-placental barrier (Biskup2020N; Borisova2017Human).

CGB3 is involved in the differentiation of trophoblasts and the growth of uterine tissues, helping to inhibit the contractile activity of the myometrium, which is vital for a successful pregnancy (Borisova2017Human). It also plays a role in immune modulation by blocking immune responses against the placenta, activating T-suppressors, and inducing apoptosis in T-cells, thereby promoting immune tolerance during pregnancy (Borisova2017Human).

The protein's glycosylation patterns are significant for its function, as they influence its biological activity and receptor interactions. CGB3, along with its homologs CGB5 and CGB8, shares similar glycosylation patterns, which are crucial for its functional redundancy and ability to activate intracellular signaling pathways like ERK1/2 (Biskup2020N).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the CGB3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In cervical cancer, the CGB3 gene is often subject to promoter methylation, which can lead to its silencing. This methylation is notably induced by the HPV16 E7 protein, contributing to the progression of cervical cancer by potentially silencing tumor suppressor genes (Singh2024Association). The study of CGB3 in cervical cancer has shown that its methylation status can serve as a biomarker for early detection, with high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between normal and abnormal samples (Singh2024Association).

In ovarian cancer, the expression levels of CGB3 are significantly higher in cancerous cells compared to healthy ovarian cells. This overexpression is thought to be due to demethylation of the CGB promoter regions, which may contribute to malignant transformation (Chang2024Aberrant). The altered expression of CGB3, along with other CGB genes, is also observed in bladder tumors, suggesting a broader role in cancer biology (Chang2024Aberrant). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CGB3 in cancer diagnosis and progression.
