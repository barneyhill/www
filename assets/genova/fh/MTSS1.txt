# MTSS1

## Overview
MTSS1, or Metastasis Suppressor 1, is a gene that encodes the MTSS I-BAR domain containing 1 protein, also known as Missing-in-Metastasis (MIM). This protein is a member of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) superfamily and is characterized by its inverse-BAR (I-BAR) domain, which plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane dynamics. MTSS1 is involved in various cellular processes, including endocytosis, cell signaling, and the regulation of cell shape and motility. It functions as a metastasis suppressor by influencing pathways such as Rac-PAK-LIMK and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK, which are critical for cell migration and invasion. The protein's interactions with actin and phosphoinositide-rich lipid bilayers are essential for maintaining cellular integrity and function. Alterations in MTSS1 expression have been linked to several cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, affecting disease progression and patient prognosis (Mertz2014MTSS1; Kawabata2018MTSS1; Zheng2023MTSS1).

## Structure
The MTSS1 protein, also known as Missing-in-Metastasis (MIM), is a multi-domain protein that is part of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) superfamily. It contains an inverse-BAR (I-BAR) domain, which dimerizes and binds to the plasma membrane's inner leaflet, inducing convex membrane curvature. This domain is involved in actin regulation by accumulating PI(4,5)P2 clusters and upregulating Rac1 activity, localizing it to the membrane (kawabata2018functional; Kawabata2018MTSS1). The C-terminal region of MTSS1 includes a Wiskott-Aldrich homology 2 (WH2) domain, which binds to ATP-bound actin monomers with high affinity and is involved in actin-regulating activities (kawabata2018functional; Kawabata2018MTSS1).

MTSS1 also features serine-rich (SRD) and proline-rich domains (PRD), which interact with various proteins and are subject to regulation by multiple kinases and phosphatases (kawabata2018functional). These regions are crucial for the protein's function in neurons, particularly in regulating dendritic protrusion formation (Kawabata2018MTSS1). The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms that may affect its interactions and functions (Glassmann2007Developmental).

## Function
MTSS1 (MTSS I-BAR domain containing 1) is a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and membrane dynamics. It plays a significant role in cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell signaling, influencing both cellular and organismal development (Glassmann2007Developmental). MTSS1 is active in the cytoplasm and the cell membrane, where it interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through its I-BAR domain. This interaction affects cell migration and metastasis by regulating cofilin activity via the Rac-PAK-LIMK and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK signaling pathways (Mertz2014MTSS1).

In healthy human cells, MTSS1 is involved in the formation and maintenance of intercellular junctions, which suggests its role in regulating cell migration and motility. It influences the localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the plasma membrane, thereby modulating EGF signaling and affecting cell proliferation (Dawson2011Mtss1). MTSS1's ability to regulate actin dynamics and cell motility is crucial for its function as a metastasis suppressor, as it restricts cell motility and promotes early-phase tumor growth, contributing to less aggressive cancer phenotypes and better prognosis (Kedmi2015EGF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTSS1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, often correlating with disease progression and prognosis. In glioblastoma, low MTSS1 expression is associated with poor outcomes and reduced survival rates. Overexpression of MTSS1 in glioma cells suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhang2014MTSS1). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), MTSS1 downregulation is linked to increased PD-L1 expression, promoting immune evasion and reducing CD8+ T cell infiltration. This downregulation is associated with poorer responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Wang2023MTSS1).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), MTSS1 is significantly downregulated, correlating with advanced disease stages and worse survival rates. Its ectopic expression reduces cell migration and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zheng2023MTSS1). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low MTSS1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance, and increased disease aggressiveness. MTSS1 downregulation accelerates leukemia development and is linked to increased promoter methylation (Grandits2021Downregulation).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), elevated MTSS1 expression is associated with increased metastatic potential and poor prognosis, particularly in hepatitis B-related cases (Huang2016Elevated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MTSS1 expression alterations in cancer progression and patient outcomes.

## Interactions
MTSS1 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes related to cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It binds to actin monomers through its C-terminal WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain and senses membrane curvature via its N-terminal I-BAR domain, which is crucial for its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Mertz2014MTSS1). MTSS1 also interacts with phosphoinositide-rich lipid bilayers, inducing membrane curvature and protrusions, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of adherens junctions (Zheng2023MTSS1).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, MTSS1 promotes the assembly of E-cadherin/β-catenin/F-actin complexes in adherens junctions, thereby suppressing cell migration and invasion (Zheng2023MTSS1). It also interacts with SCAMP1 in breast cancer, where this interaction enhances cell-cell adhesion and reduces invasion, particularly in HER2+/ER-/PR- breast cancer subtypes (Vadakekolathu2018MTSS1).

MTSS1 is involved in the regulation of the Rac-PAK-LIMK and RhoA-ROCK-LIMK signaling pathways, affecting cofilin activity and cell motility in melanoma cells (Mertz2014MTSS1). In glioblastoma, MTSS1 targets and inhibits cortactin (CTTN), a protein associated with cancer aggressiveness, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and invasion (Zhang2014MTSS1).
