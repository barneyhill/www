# OR10P1

## Overview
The OR10P1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily P member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The primary function of the protein encoded by OR10P1 is to detect odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptor genes, which are responsible for the diversity of odor detection in humans. The olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily P member 1 is involved in the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the complex process of olfaction (Qiu2020aarFDC).
