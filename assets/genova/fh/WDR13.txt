# WDR13

## Overview
WDR13 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 13 protein, a member of the WD-repeat protein family, which is characterized by its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions. The WD repeat domain 13 protein is primarily involved in regulatory functions within the cell, particularly in transcriptional regulation and cell-cycle control. It is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its nuclear presence suggesting a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity. The protein interacts with various cellular components, including c-Jun, a part of the AP1 transcription factor complex, and is implicated in pathways affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. WDR13's involvement in these processes highlights its potential significance in various physiological and pathological contexts, including muscle differentiation, endometrial hyperplasia, mental health disorders, and metabolic diseases such as diabetes (Singh2014Genetic; Singh2003A; Mitra2016Implication; Singh2017WDrepeat).

## Structure
The WDR13 protein is a member of the WD-repeat family, characterized by the presence of six WD-repeat motifs located in the C-terminal region. These motifs are structural elements that facilitate protein-protein interactions and are typically involved in forming a beta-propeller structure, which is a common feature of WD-repeat proteins (Smith1999The; Singh2003A). The protein consists of 485 amino acids and has an estimated molecular mass of 53 kDa (Singh2003A). The primary sequence analysis indicates that WDR13 is a basic protein with a pI value of 9.4 (Singh2003A).

The protein is predicted to undergo several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at sites for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II, which are located in the amino terminal domain (Singh2003A). WDR13 is localized in the nucleus, suggesting a regulatory role, although it lacks a known nuclear localization signal, indicating the presence of novel signals (Suresh2005A; Singh2003A). The protein's structure and motifs are highly conserved across species, underscoring its functional importance (Suresh2005A).

## Function
The WDR13 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the WD-repeat family, known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in several regulatory functions within the cell, particularly in the nucleus, where it is implicated in transcriptional regulation and cell-cycle control (Singh2003A). WDR13 interacts with c-Jun, a component of the AP1 transcription factor complex, modulating its transcriptional activity. This interaction is influenced by the phosphorylation state of c-Jun, which is affected by JNK activation (Singh2017WDrepeat). WDR13 is part of a complex with c-Jun, NCoR1, and HDAC3, suggesting a role in regulating AP1 target genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Singh2017WDrepeat).

In terms of subcellular localization, the WDR13 protein is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with different isoforms showing distinct localization patterns. The 53 kDa variant localizes to the nucleus, while the 43 kDa variant is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating the presence of novel nuclear localization and export signals (Singh2003A). The gene's expression is widespread across various tissues, with significant activity in the testis, suggesting a role in tissue-specific expression and testicular function (Singh2003A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the WDR13 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of endometrial hyperplasia (EH), WDR13 knockout female mice serve as a model for studying this condition, which is characterized by abnormal proliferation of endometrial glands and is a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The absence of WDR13 leads to increased estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) activity and the expression of pro-proliferative genes, suggesting its role in regulating cell proliferation in the uterus. This model mimics human EH associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and hyperinsulinemia (Singh2020Molecular).

In the realm of mental health, the absence of WDR13 in mice predisposes them to a depression-like phenotype when subjected to social isolation stress. This is associated with the downregulation of synaptic genes and the upregulation of the transcription factor GATA1, which is linked to major depressive disorder. The findings suggest that WDR13 may have a neuroprotective role and its interactions with GATA1 could be significant in understanding depression and stress responses (Mitra2018Absence).

In diabetes research, the deletion of WDR13 in Lepr db/db mice, a model for type 2 diabetes, results in improved metabolic phenotypes. This includes increased pancreatic beta cell proliferation, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced inflammation, indicating that WDR13 could be a potential drug target for diabetes treatment (Singh2014Genetic).

## Interactions
WDR13 is known to interact with several proteins and participate in various cellular processes. It acts as a transcriptional regulator of c-Jun, a component of the AP1 transcription factor complex, by interacting with c-Jun at the AP1 sites of its promoter. This interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation state of c-Jun, which is influenced by JNK activation (Singh2017WDrepeat). WDR13 is part of a complex with c-Jun, NCoR1, and HDAC3, but not with SMRT, and this complex is involved in the regulation of AP1 target genes, which are implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Singh2017WDrepeat).

In the context of muscle differentiation, WDR13 interacts with PIK3IP1, a known inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction was confirmed in bovine muscle-derived satellite cells, where WDR13 was shown to modulate the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby influencing cell differentiation (Fu2019WDR13). WDR13 also interacts with proteins such as ERα/β, PHIP, and HDACs, and it represses transcription from promoters containing the Estrogen Receptor Element (ERE) and AP1 element in the presence of estradiol (Mitra2016Implication).
