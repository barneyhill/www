# SPRING1

## Overview
SPRING1, also known as C12orf49, is a gene that encodes the protein SREBF pathway regulator in Golgi 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a Golgi-resident factor and is integral to the proper functioning of the SREBP (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins) signaling pathway. SPRING1 is essential for the retrograde transport of SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum, ensuring the correct localization and activation of SREBPs, which are crucial for lipid metabolism. The protein's interactions with key components of the SREBP pathway, such as Site-1-protease (S1P) and SCAP, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular lipid balance. Mutations or alterations in the SPRING1 gene have been linked to various lipid metabolism disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions like dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases (Loregger2020Haploid; Hendrix2023Hepatic).

## Function
SPRING1, also known as C12orf49, is a crucial regulator of the SREBP (Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins) signaling pathway, which is essential for cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis in human cells. This protein is a Golgi-resident factor that plays a significant role in maintaining the function of SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein), a key component in the SREBP pathway. In healthy cells, SPRING1 is involved in the retrograde transport of SCAP from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ensuring proper localization and function of SCAP, which is necessary for the activation of SREBPs (Loregger2020Haploid).

SPRING1 influences the transcriptional control of genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as LDLR, ACSL1, ACSL3, and FABP5, by regulating SREBP signaling. This regulation is vital for the cellular response to sterol depletion, affecting processes like LDL uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis (Loregger2020Haploid). The absence of SPRING1 leads to mislocalization of SCAP, reduced SREBP signaling, and impaired cholesterol metabolism, highlighting its essential role in maintaining lipid balance and metabolic health (Loregger2020Haploid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the SPRING1 gene, also known as C12orf49, have significant clinical implications, particularly in lipid metabolism disorders. Genetic variations in the SPRING locus are associated with lipid traits in humans, as demonstrated by a genome-wide association study involving approximately 1.6 million individuals. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs10507274, in the SPRING gene is significantly linked to increased plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and Apolipoprotein-A1 levels, although the functional consequences of this variation remain unclear (Hendrix2023Hepatic).

The absence of SPRING leads to aberrant activation of the SREBP pathway, which is crucial for cholesterol metabolism, and its loss is embryonic lethal in mice, indicating its critical role in development (Loregger2020Haploid). In humans, alterations in SPRING expression or function could potentially contribute to conditions such as dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases due to its role in systemic lipid metabolism (Hendrix2023Hepatic). The study of SPRING's interactions, particularly with SCAP and S1P, suggests that targeting SPRING could have therapeutic potential in managing lipid-associated metabolic diseases (Hendrix2023Hepatic).

## Interactions
The SPRING1 protein, also known as C12orf49, is involved in several critical interactions within the SREBP signaling pathway. It interacts with Site-1-protease (S1P), a key enzyme in the proteolytic activation of SREBPs. This interaction is bi-directional, as both the proS1P and its mature C-form bind with SPRING1, enhancing S1P activation while S1P reduces the abundance of full-length SPRING1, suggesting SPRING1 is subject to S1P-mediated cleavage (Hendrix2023Intermolecular). The predicted S1P cleavage site on SPRING1 is located at the end of a flexible Î±-helical strand, a common position for S1P substrates (Hendrix2023Intermolecular).

SPRING1 also interacts with SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein), a protein involved in cholesterol sensing and SREBP activation. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of SCAP, as SPRING1 is necessary for maintaining SCAP in the endoplasmic reticulum under certain conditions (Loregger2020Haploid). The absence of SPRING1 leads to SCAP mislocalization to the Golgi, affecting its function, which can be corrected by reintroducing SPRING1 (Loregger2020Haploid). These interactions highlight SPRING1's role in modulating key components of the SREBP pathway, influencing cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis.
