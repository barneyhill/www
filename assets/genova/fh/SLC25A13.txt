# SLC25A13

## Overview
The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2), also known as citrin, which is a member of the solute carrier family 25. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a pivotal role in the malate-aspartate shuttle, facilitating the exchange of aspartate and glutamate across the mitochondrial membrane. AGC2 is essential for various metabolic processes, including the urea cycle and gluconeogenesis, by maintaining the balance of NADH/NAD+ in the cytosol and mitochondria (Monné2019Mitochondrial; Palmieri2004The). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as USF1 and FOXA2, which are crucial for its activity in liver cells (Convertini2019Transcriptional). Mutations in SLC25A13 can lead to citrin deficiency, resulting in metabolic disorders such as neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial; Lin2021Neonatal).

## Structure
The SLC25A13 gene encodes the aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2), also known as citrin, which is a crucial component of the malate-aspartate shuttle. The protein structure includes an N-terminal soluble regulatory domain with EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs and a C-terminal mitochondrial carrier domain (Palmieri2020Diseases). The N-terminal domain contains four EF-hand motifs, which are exposed to the cytoplasmic surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and modulate the carrier's activity through Ca2+ binding (Palmieri2004The). The C-terminal domain is responsible for the transport activities and contains six transmembrane segments, characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (Palmieri2004The).

The primary structure of AGC2 includes specific residues such as Gly437 and Gly531, which are predicted to be within the carrier cavity and are important for aspartate/glutamate exchange (Wongkittichote2012Prediction). The protein's secondary structure is composed of alpha-helices typical of mitochondrial carriers, forming a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol (Palmieri2013The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, facilitating substrate transport (Palmieri2013The). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, as mitochondrial carriers are typically homodimers (Palmieri2004The). Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene can lead to structural changes, affecting the protein's function and localization (Wongkittichote2012Prediction).

## Function
The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2), also known as citrin, which is crucial for several metabolic processes in healthy human cells. AGC2 is primarily active in the liver, where it plays a vital role in the malate-aspartate shuttle, a key mechanism for transferring reducing equivalents of NADH from the cytosol to the mitochondria. This process is essential for maintaining the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, supporting glycolysis, alcohol metabolism, and gluconeogenesis from reduced substrates (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The).

AGC2 facilitates the transport of aspartate from the mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for glutamate and a proton, which is crucial for the urea cycle and the synthesis of proteins, purines, and pyrimidines (Monné2019Mitochondrial; Palmieri2004The). The proper functioning of AGC2 ensures the availability of aspartate in the cytosol, preventing conditions such as citrullinemia and hyperammonemia (Palmieri2004The).

The activity of AGC2 is regulated by cytosolic calcium levels, which influence its conformation and substrate accessibility, thereby modulating mitochondrial ATP synthesis in response to calcium-mobilizing agonists (Monné2019Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene are linked to citrin deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder that manifests in several clinical phenotypes, including neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency (NICCD) and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). NICCD typically presents in neonates and infants with symptoms such as transient intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatomegaly, growth retardation, and aminoacidemias. These symptoms often resolve within the first year of life, but some cases may require nutritional management or liver transplantation (Palmieri2014Mitochondrial; Lin2021Neonatal).

CTLN2 usually occurs in adolescents or adults and is characterized by neurological symptoms, including disorientation, abnormal behavior, seizures, and potentially fatal brain edema. The only effective treatment for severe CTLN2 is liver transplantation (Yasuda2000Identification; Lu2005Frequency). The SLC25A13 gene mutations lead to a deficiency in the citrin protein, affecting the urea cycle and other metabolic pathways, which results in the clinical manifestations of these conditions (Song2013SLC25A13; Lin2016Molecular). Genetic testing for SLC25A13 mutations is crucial for diagnosing citrin deficiency due to the challenges associated with chemical diagnosis (Kikuchi2012Simple).

## Interactions
The SLC25A13 gene encodes the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier isoform 2 (AGC2), which is involved in several protein interactions. AGC2 interacts with the protein OPA1, a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics. This interaction is significant as it influences OPA1 oligomerization, which is sensitive to nutrient availability and affects mitochondrial cristae structure. The interaction between AGC2 and OPA1 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting AGC2's role in nutrient sensing and mitochondrial function (wong2014role).

AGC2 is also regulated by transcription factors such as USF1 and FOXA2. USF1 binds to the E-box motif in the SLC25A13 promoter, enhancing the gene's expression in liver cells. This interaction is crucial for maintaining basal expression levels of AGC2 across tissues (Convertini2019Transcriptional). FOXA2 acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to a specific region of the SLC25A13 promoter, significantly enhancing its expression. This interaction is particularly important in liver cells, where FOXA2's role as an activator is linked to metabolic processes and potentially to cancer suppression (Convertini2019Transcriptional).
