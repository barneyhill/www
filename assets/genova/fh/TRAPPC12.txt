# TRAPPC12

## Overview
TRAPPC12 is a gene that encodes the protein trafficking protein particle complex subunit 12, which is a component of the TRAPP III complex involved in vesicle-mediated transport within cells. This protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ciliogenesis, ER-to-Golgi transport, and mitosis. TRAPPC12 is essential for maintaining the integrity of the early secretory pathway and proper ciliary length, as well as for the recruitment of kinetochore proteins during cell division. Mutations in the TRAPPC12 gene are linked to neurological disorders known as TRAPPopathies, which manifest as progressive encephalopathy with brain atrophy and spasticity, among other symptoms (Yucesan2023Functional; Zhang2020Distinct; Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Structure
TRAPPC12, also known as TTC15, TRAMM, and CGI-87, is a protein component of the human TRAPP III complex, involved in vesicle-mediated transport. The primary sequence of TRAPPC12 includes four conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs near its carboxy-terminus, which are likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These motifs suggest a role in facilitating interactions with other proteins, contributing to its function in cellular processes.

The amino-terminal region of TRAPPC12, approximately 200 amino acids in length, undergoes phosphorylation, a post-translational modification that appears to regulate the protein's function (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). This phosphorylation is particularly relevant during mitosis, where TRAPPC12 is phosphorylated and associates with metaphase chromosomes, aiding in the recruitment of kinetochore proteins like CENP-E (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

TRAPPC12 is distributed as punctae mainly in the cytoplasm and on ER exit sites, partially co-localizing with the Golgi apparatus, and traces are also visible in the nucleus (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The protein's localization and interactions suggest its involvement in the early secretory pathway and possibly in cell division (Zhao2017Mammalian).

## Function
TRAPPC12, a component of the TRAPPIII complex, plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in ciliogenesis, particularly in the regulation of ciliary length and disassembly. TRAPPC12 interacts with the ciliopathy protein OFD1, and its depletion results in increased ciliary length, indicating its necessity for cilium disassembly and maintenance of proper ciliary length (Zhang2020Distinct). 

In the early secretory pathway, TRAPPC12 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). It modulates the recruitment of the Sec13/Sec31 complex onto COPII vesicles, which is crucial for ER-to-Golgi transport. Loss of TRAPPC12 function leads to delayed transport and fragmented Golgi apparatus, highlighting its role in maintaining the integrity of the early secretory pathway (Zhao2017Mammalian).

TRAPPC12 is also involved in mitosis, where its depletion causes defects in chromosome congression and spindle assembly checkpoint activation, leading to an increased mitotic index. During mitosis, TRAPPC12 associates with metaphase chromosomes and localizes to kinetochores, recruiting kinetochore proteins like CENP-E (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRAPPC12 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, collectively known as TRAPPopathies. These conditions include progressive encephalopathy with brain atrophy and spasticity (PEBAS), characterized by severe disability, spasticity, hearing loss, and visual impairment, but notably without microcephaly and epilepsy in some cases (Yucesan2023Functional). The specific missense mutation NM_016030.6:c.679T>G in TRAPPC12 leads to highly reduced or absent protein expression, likely due to proteasome degradation, resulting in disrupted Golgi integrity and altered endoplasmic reticulum structure (Yucesan2023Functional).

TRAPPC12 is also implicated in ER-to-Golgi transport and mitosis. Variants in this gene can cause fragmented Golgi and delayed cargo transport, contributing to the clinical pathology observed in affected individuals (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The clinical manifestations of TRAPPC12 mutations are thought to arise from defects in membrane trafficking, although mitotic defects may also play a role (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These mutations can lead to a broad spectrum of symptoms, including intellectual disability and brain abnormalities (Van2019Deficiencies). Understanding the functional consequences of TRAPPC12 variations is crucial for accurate diagnosis and family counseling (Yucesan2023Functional).

## Interactions
TRAPPC12, a component of the TRAPP complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. It physically interacts with OFD1, a protein associated with ciliogenesis and ciliary length regulation. This interaction is confirmed through tandem affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The presence of TRAPPC8 inhibits the interaction between TRAPPC12 and OFD1, suggesting a regulatory mechanism within the TRAPPIII complex (Zhang2020Distinct). TRAPPC12 also interacts with PCM1, a protein essential for the organization of centriolar satellites. Depletion of TRAPPC12 leads to increased PCM1 levels, indicating its role in maintaining PCM1's association with centriolar satellites, which is necessary for recruiting proteins like OFD1 and pericentrin (Zhang2020Distinct).

TRAPPC12 is involved in ER-to-Golgi transport and interacts with various cellular components during mitosis, including metaphase chromosomes and kinetochores, where it recruits kinetochore proteins such as CENP-E (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). It also plays a role in autophagy, where it functions downstream of TRAPPC11, affecting lysosomal proteolytic activity and potentially interacting with TECPR1, a protein implicated in autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Stanga2019TRAPPC11).
