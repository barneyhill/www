# KIAA1671

## Overview
KIAA1671 is a human gene that encodes the KIAA1671 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein with potential roles in cell proliferation and immune response regulation. Although the precise biological functions of KIAA1671 are not fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Research suggests that KIAA1671 may serve as a biomarker for certain cancers and could be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease through its association with amyloid-β levels (Rosewood2023GenomeWide; Lin2012Novel; Moreaux2010A). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional mechanisms and clinical implications of KIAA1671.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The KIAA1671 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions, although its specific role remains under investigation. In the context of metabolic disorders, a polymorphism in KIAA1671 has been associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes with cataracts in the Taiwanese population, suggesting a potential link to these conditions (Lin2012Novel). Additionally, a variant in KIAA1671 has been identified as a candidate gene predisposing individuals to morbid obesity, although its clinical significance in this context is not fully understood (Sikhayeva2023WHOLE).

In cancer research, KIAA1671 has been noted for its association with various cancers and its role in cell proliferation. It has been identified in studies of circulating tumor cells in metastatic breast cancer, where it may serve as a candidate biomarker for early detection (Rossi2022Dissecting). Furthermore, KIAA1671 is considered a gene with poor prognostic value in multiple myeloma, where its overexpression is linked to worse event-free and overall survival (Moreaux2010A).

In Alzheimer's disease, KIAA1671 has been highlighted for its potential immune-related biological relevance, with suggestive associations with amyloid-β levels in cerebrospinal fluid (Rosewood2023GenomeWide). These findings indicate that KIAA1671 may play a role in various disease mechanisms, although further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
