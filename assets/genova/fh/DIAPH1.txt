# DIAPH1

## Overview
The DIAPH1 gene encodes the diaphanous-related formin 1 protein, a member of the formin family, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule dynamics. This protein is characterized by its formin homology domains, FH1 and FH2, which facilitate actin filament nucleation and elongation, as well as interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (Chiereghin2022Role; Li2013cAMPstimulated). DIAPH1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, and spindle formation, and is particularly significant in T cell activation and signaling (Azizoglu2024DIAPH1Deficiency; Bhattad2024Immune). Mutations in DIAPH1 are linked to several clinical conditions, such as autosomal dominant deafness and neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in both cellular function and human health (Chiereghin2022Role; He2023Association).

## Structure
The DIAPH1 protein, encoded by the DIAPH1 gene, is a member of the diaphanous-related formin family and plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton organization. It contains several key domains, including a GTPase-binding domain (GBD), formin homology domains FH1 and FH2, and a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) (ErcanSencicek2014Homozygous; Li2013cAMPstimulated). The FH1 domain is characterized by polyproline stretches, which facilitate interactions with profilin, an actin monomer-binding protein (Watanabe1997p140mDia). The FH2 domain is essential for actin filament nucleation and microtubule dynamics (Li2013cAMPstimulated; Nishimura2019Cdk1mediated).

DIAPH1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as threonine 759 (T759), which is located within the FH2 domain. This phosphorylation is regulated by cAMP signaling and affects the protein's stability and interactions with other proteins (Li2013cAMPstimulated). The protein also forms complexes with other proteins, such as ORP2 and ORP10, indicating specific protein-protein interactions (Li2013cAMPstimulated).

Alternative splicing of the DIAPH1 gene can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The DIAPH1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) family, which plays a crucial role in actin and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, DIAPH1 is involved in actin filament nucleation and elongation, facilitated by its formin homology (FH) domains. The FH2 domain binds actin monomers and the barbed end of filaments, while the FH1 domain interacts with the G-actin-binding protein Profilin, promoting actin polymerization (Chiereghin2022Role; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

DIAPH1 also contributes to microtubule stabilization by interacting with microtubule-associated proteins such as EB1 and APC, promoting the formation of stable microtubules (Chiereghin2022Role). It is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, and spindle formation during mitosis, particularly in neuronal precursor cells (Azizoglu2024DIAPH1Deficiency).

The protein is predominantly expressed in T cells and is essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and signaling. It plays a significant role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways, including Zap70-mediated phosphorylation of LAT, which is crucial for immune responses (Azizoglu2024DIAPH1Deficiency; Bhattad2024Immune). DIAPH1 is also involved in maintaining the structure and function of the cytoskeleton, impacting processes like cell motility and differentiation (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DIAPH1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in DIAPH1 are linked to autosomal dominant deafness 1 (DFNA1), which can occur with or without thrombocytopenia. This condition was initially identified in a Costa Rican family and is characterized by early-onset low-frequency hearing loss that progresses to profound deafness. These mutations often occur in the DAD domain at the C-terminal and the GTPase-binding domain/DID domain at the N-terminal, disrupting the autoinhibitory DID-DAD interaction and leading to a constitutively active protein (Chiereghin2022Role). The specific nonsense mutation NM_005219.4: c.3637C>T, p.R1213X, is known to cause macrothrombocytopenia and sensorineural hearing loss by altering cytoskeletal organization (Stritt2016A).

Biallelic mutations in DIAPH1 are associated with seizures, cortical blindness, and microcephaly syndrome (SCBMS), a severe autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. These mutations are typically frameshift or nonsense variants in the FH2 domain, leading to a loss of DIAPH1 function (Chiereghin2022Role). Additionally, DIAPH1 mutations have been linked to immune dysregulation, including combined immunodeficiency, characterized by defective T and B cell function (Azizoglu2024DIAPH1Deficiency). DIAPH1 mutations are also implicated in moyamoya disease, particularly affecting posterior cerebral artery involvement (He2023Association).

## Interactions
DIAPH1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular dynamics and signaling. It directly interacts with the small GTPase RhoA, which is activated by ACTH, facilitating mitochondrial trafficking and cortisol production in adrenocortical cells (Li2013cAMPstimulated). DIAPH1 also binds to actin via its formin homology (FH)-2 domain, promoting actin nucleation, and this interaction is regulated by a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) (Li2013cAMPstimulated). 

In the context of ischemic heart disease, DIAPH1 interacts with Mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a key protein in maintaining mitochondria-SR/ER contact. This interaction is crucial for modulating mitochondrial and SR/ER contact, particularly under stress conditions (Yepuri2023DIAPH1MFN2). The DIAPH1-MFN2 interaction involves the Diaphanous Inhibitory Domain of DIAPH1 and the cytosolic GTPase domain of MFN2, with electrostatic interactions playing a significant role (Yepuri2023DIAPH1MFN2).

DIAPH1 also interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, such as tubulin, kinesin, and dynein, and is associated with oxysterol-binding proteins like ORP2 and ORP10, which are involved in lipid metabolism (Li2013cAMPstimulated). These interactions highlight DIAPH1's role in regulating organelle positioning and cytoskeletal dynamics.
