# UBA2

## Overview
UBA2 is a human gene that encodes the ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 2, a crucial component of the SUMOylation pathway. This pathway involves the post-translational modification of proteins through the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs), which can alter protein stability, localization, and activity. The UBA2 protein functions as an E1 activating enzyme, forming a heterodimeric complex with SAE1 to activate SUMO proteins, facilitating their conjugation to target substrates. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability. UBA2 is predominantly active in the nucleus and plays significant roles in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression. Disruptions in the UBA2-mediated SUMOylation pathway have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and viability (Schnur2021UBA2; Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like).

## Structure
The UBA2 protein is involved in the SUMOylation pathway, functioning as an E1 activating enzyme in complex with SAE1. It contains several domains, including the ubiquitin-activating enzyme domain, which is crucial for binding ATP, substrate, and zinc, and is involved in ubiquitin thioester complex formation. The C-terminus (UBA2-C) and ubiquitin-like (UAE-UbL) domains are also significant, with the latter being structurally similar to ubiquitin and playing a role in E1-SUMO-thioester transfer to the E2 conjugation protein (Schnur2021UBA2).

Molecular modeling of the UBA2 protein reveals secondary structures such as helices, strands, and coils, with specific residues involved in hydrogen bonding (Schnur2021UBA2). The protein is composed of 640 amino acids and is encoded by 17 exons (Parveen2023A). Post-translational modifications of UBA2 may include phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which are essential for its function in protein modification processes (Schnur2021UBA2).

Variants in the UBA2 gene, such as missense and nonsense mutations, can affect the protein's structure and function, potentially disrupting ATP binding, protein folding, or protein-protein interactions (Schnur2021UBA2).

## Function
UBA2 encodes a protein that is a component of the SUMO-activating enzyme complex, which is essential for the SUMOylation process. This process involves the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) to target proteins, influencing their stability, localization, and activity. UBA2, in conjunction with SAE1, forms a heterodimeric enzyme that activates SUMO proteins, facilitating their conjugation to various substrates. This activation is crucial for several cellular processes, including nuclear-cytosolic transport, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and protein stability (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like).

UBA2 is active in the nucleus and plays significant roles in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and cell cycle progression. The SUMOylation pathway, in which UBA2 is involved, is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and viability across different organisms (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). The UBA2 protein forms a thiol ester bond and interacts with ubiquitin-like proteins, although it requires a cofactor for certain interactions, indicating its specificity and complexity in protein modification pathways (Gong1999Molecular). Defects in the UBA2-mediated SUMOylation pathway can lead to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBA2 gene are associated with several congenital disorders, most notably ectrodactyly and aplasia cutis congenita (ACC). Ectrodactyly, characterized by median clefts of the hands and/or feet, has been linked to loss-of-function mutations in UBA2, suggesting that UBA2 haploinsufficiency plays a role in this condition (Aerden2020Genotypephenotype; Schnur2021UBA2). ACC, a congenital skin defect, has also been associated with UBA2 mutations, with studies indicating a potential autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Wang2019Aplasia).

UBA2 mutations can lead to a spectrum of phenotypic manifestations, including neurodevelopmental problems, growth deficiencies, and ectodermal anomalies. These mutations are part of a syndrome that includes variable aplasia cutis congenita and ectrodactyly, with additional features such as cardiac, renal, and skeletal anomalies (Schnur2021UBA2). The gene's role in the SUMOylation pathway is crucial for normal cellular function, and disruptions can lead to significant developmental issues (Schnur2021UBA2).

Alterations in UBA2 expression are also implicated in cancer, particularly glioma, where high expression levels correlate with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis (Ou2024UBA2). UBA2's involvement in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair underscores its clinical significance in both congenital disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
UBA2, a human gene encoding a protein involved in the SUMOylation pathway, participates in several critical protein interactions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, UBA2 forms a heterodimer with Aos1p, which is essential for the activation of the ubiquitin-like protein Smt3p. This interaction involves the formation of a thioester bond between Smt3p and UBA2, a crucial step in the conjugation pathway (Johnson1997The). UBA2 also interacts with poly(A) polymerase (Pap1) in yeast, affecting polyadenylation activity. This interaction is facilitated by the last 115 amino acids of UBA2, which includes a unique 82-amino acid region not found in other E1 enzymes (del1997The). 

In Arabidopsis, UBA2 proteins, specifically UBA2a and UBA2b, can form both homo- and heterodimers, while UBA2c does not interact with itself or other UBA2 proteins. UBA2a interacts with the OST1 kinase when OST1 is fused to a DNA-binding domain (Riera2006Arabidopsis). These interactions highlight UBA2's role in various cellular processes, including protein conjugation and polyadenylation, across different species.
