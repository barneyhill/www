# ERBB4

## Overview
ERBB4, also known as HER4, is a gene that encodes the erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4, a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival, by mediating signal transduction pathways upon ligand binding and receptor dimerization (Hoesl2018The; Long2003Impaired). The ERBB4 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain with multiple phosphorylation sites (Roskoski2014The). ERBB4 is involved in critical physiological processes such as mammary gland development, neurodevelopment, and cardiac function, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncoprotein depending on the context (Segers2020The; Lucas2022The).

## Structure
ERBB4, also known as HER4, is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. It is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure. The extracellular domain of ERBB4 is divided into four subdomains: I and III, which are leucine-rich and involved in ligand binding, and II and IV, which contain cysteine-rich regions crucial for dimer formation (Roskoski2014The; Motamedi2022Cancer). The transmembrane domain is a single-pass alpha-helix, and the intracellular region includes a juxtamembrane segment, a protein kinase domain, and a carboxyterminal tail with tyrosine residues that serve as phosphorylation sites (Roskoski2014The).

ERBB4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including JMa-Cyt1, JMa-Cyt2, JMb-Cyt1, and JMb-Cyt2, which differ in their extracellular juxtamembrane regions and carboxyterminal tails (Roskoski2014The; Lucas2022The). These isoforms confer distinct signaling activities due to differences in their sequences, such as the presence or absence of specific cleavage sites and phosphorylation motifs (Lucas2022The).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are crucial for ERBB4's activation and signaling. The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other ErbB family members, influencing its role as a tumor suppressor or oncoprotein (Lucas2022The).

## Function
ERBB4 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and is activated by ligand binding, which leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, triggering downstream signaling pathways (Hoesl2018The; Long2003Impaired).

In mammary gland development, ERBB4 is crucial for the differentiation of mammary epithelial cells, particularly during pregnancy and lactation. It acts as an essential mediator of STAT5 activation, which is necessary for the expression of milk genes and successful lactation (Long2003Impaired). ERBB4's role in mammary tissue is unique among ErbB receptors as it promotes differentiation rather than proliferation, which is vital for proper lactation (Segers2020The).

In the nervous system, ERBB4 is involved in neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal migration and neurotransmitter signaling. It is highly expressed in the brain and is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia (Segers2020The). In the cardiovascular system, ERBB4, activated by neuregulin-1, regulates cardiac homeostasis and exhibits protective properties, including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects (Segers2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ERBB4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ERBB4 is overexpressed across all tumor stages, suggesting its role as an early event in tumorigenesis. This overexpression enhances cellular transformation and tumor growth, particularly when combined with other oncogenic mutations (Williams2015ERBB4). In melanoma, ERBB4 mutations are frequent and lead to increased kinase activity, promoting oncogenic transformation. These mutations are potential therapeutic targets, as melanoma cells with mutant ERBB4 show reduced growth when ERBB4 is inhibited (Prickett2009Analysis).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ERBB4 mutations are associated with improved prognosis when treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, correlating with higher tumor mutational burden and PD-L1 expression (Hu2021The). In breast cancer, ERBB4 acts as a proapoptotic protein, and its loss disrupts apoptotic pathways, aiding tumor survival (Naresh2006The). ERBB4's role in cancer is complex, functioning as both a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein, depending on its expression levels and interactions with other proteins (Lucas2022The).

## Interactions
ERBB4, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, engages in various protein interactions that influence its signaling functions. One significant interaction is with PIAS3, a protein that promotes the sumoylation and nuclear sequestration of the ERBB4 intracellular domain (ICD). This interaction is crucial for the nuclear localization of ERBB4, as PIAS3 acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, facilitating the sumoylation process. The presence of PIAS3 leads to increased nuclear accumulation of ERBB4 ICD, while PIAS3 knockdown results in reduced nuclear staining and decreased levels of ERBB4 ICD in the nucleus (Sundvall2012Protein).

ERBB4 also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), promoting its signaling. The cleaved ERBB4 ICD can associate with HIF-1α in the nucleus, stabilizing the HIF-1α protein by blocking its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is independent of the von Hippel-Lindau pathway and involves the regulation of HIF-1α target gene transcription, which is significant for cellular responses under hypoxic conditions (Paatero2012Interaction).

Additionally, ERBB4 has been shown to interact with various SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins, as identified through protein array technology. These interactions provide insights into ERBB4's signaling properties and its potential roles in oncogenesis and tumor suppression (Takahashi2008Interactome).
