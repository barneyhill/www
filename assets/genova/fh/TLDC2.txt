# TLDC2

## Overview
TLDC2 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC/LysM-associated domain containing 2, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved TLDc domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function, facilitating critical protein-protein interactions, particularly with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. The TLDC2 protein is involved in essential cellular processes, including the oxidative stress response and neuroprotection, by maintaining physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Finelli2017TLDc). The interaction with V-ATPase, especially the B1 subunit, underscores its role in acid-base homeostasis, with significant implications for kidney function (Eaton2021The). Despite its recognized importance in cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative damage, the precise functions of TLDC2 in healthy human cells are not yet fully understood (Finelli2016The).

## Structure
The TLDC2 protein, encoded by the human gene TBC/LysM-associated domain containing 2, features a conserved TLDc domain, which is crucial for its function. This domain is approximately 200 amino acids long and includes four alpha-helices and ten beta-strands, although it does not share structural similarity with any known protein folds (Bucknor2024Neuroinflammation). The TLDc domain is essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the V-ATPase complex, where TLDC2 preferentially interacts with the B1 subunit (Eaton2021The).

The TLDc domain's structure is vital for its interaction capabilities, with specific conserved residues playing a key role in maintaining its stability and function (Eaton2021The). The presence of a poly-E rich motif upstream of the TLDc domain in TLDC2 may enhance its interaction with V-ATPase, although this motif alone is insufficient for binding (Eaton2021The). The protein's molecular mass is approximately 24 kDa, as determined by western blotting (Eaton2021The). While the exact post-translational modifications and splice variants of TLDC2 are not detailed in the available context, the TLDc domain's role in oxidative stress response and neuroprotection is well-documented (Finelli2017TLDc; Finelli2016The).

## Function
TLDC2 (TBC/LysM-associated domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of oxidative stress response and interaction with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. The TLDc domain within the TLDC2 protein is a conserved motif that plays a significant role in protein-protein interactions, particularly with V-ATPase, which is essential for proton pumping across biological membranes (Eaton2021The). This interaction is crucial for maintaining acid-base homeostasis, especially in kidney-specific V-ATPase function (Eaton2021The).

TLDC2 is also implicated in the oxidative stress response, a vital cellular process for maintaining physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The TLDc domain-containing proteins, including TLDC2, are known to protect cells from oxidative damage, which is particularly important in the brain due to its high metabolic rate and relatively poor antioxidant capacity (Finelli2017TLDc). The protein's role in counteracting oxidative stress suggests its involvement in neuroprotection and cellular homeostasis, although the specific function of TLDC2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Finelli2016The).

## Interactions
TLDC2, a protein encoded by the human gene TLDC2, is known to interact with the V-ATPase complex, specifically the B1 subunit, in kidney lysates. This interaction is facilitated by the TLDc domain, which is crucial for binding, as constructs lacking this domain do not interact with the B1 subunit (Eaton2021The). The presence of a poly-E rich motif upstream of the TLDc domain in TLDC2 enhances its interaction with V-ATPase, although it is not sufficient alone for significant interaction (Eaton2021The).

In experiments involving overexpression in HEK293T cells, TLDC2 was shown to specifically co-immunoprecipitate with the B1 subunit of V-ATPase, but not with the B2 subunit, indicating a selective interaction (Eaton2021The). The interaction of TLDC2 with V-ATPase is significant in the context of kidney-specific functions, suggesting a specialized role in this organ (Eaton2021The). The evolutionary relationship of TLDC2 with other proteins like Ncoa7 and Oxr1, which also interact with V-ATPase, highlights the conserved nature of the TLDc domain in mediating these interactions (Eaton2021The).
