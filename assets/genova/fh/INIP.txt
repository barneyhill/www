# INIP

## Overview
The INIP gene encodes the protein known as INTS3 and NABP interacting protein, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. This protein is involved in the maintenance of genome stability and is a part of the integrator complex, which is essential for the 3'-end processing of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). The INIP protein interacts with other components of the integrator complex, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. Its function is critical in ensuring proper cellular responses to DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic integrity. The INIP protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in these complex cellular pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
