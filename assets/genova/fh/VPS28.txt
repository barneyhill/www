# VPS28

## Overview
VPS28 is a gene that encodes the VPS28 protein, a critical component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I). The VPS28 protein is involved in the cellular process of sorting ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are essential for the degradation of these proteins via lysosomal pathways. As a part of the ESCRT-I complex, VPS28 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell surface receptor down-regulation, cytokinesis, autophagy, and membrane repair. The protein is characterized by its C-terminal domain, which forms a four-helical bundle structure, facilitating interactions with other ESCRT components, particularly ESCRT-III (Gill2007Structural; Pineda‐Molina2006The). VPS28's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Minaidou2019Deregulation).

## Structure
The VPS28 protein, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, features a C-terminal domain (Vps28-CTD) that forms a four-helical bundle structure. This domain is crucial for interactions with other ESCRT components, particularly the ESCRT-III factor Vps20 (CHMP6) (Pineda‐Molina2006The). The four helices of the Vps28-CTD are arranged in an up-down-up-down topology, with helices 1, 2, and 4 being of similar length, while helix 3 is shorter and packs at an angle against the others (Gill2007Structural; Pineda‐Molina2006The). 

The Vps28-CTD contains a conserved surface necessary for Vps20 recruitment, involving residues Phe 228, Asp 229, and Glu 231, which are critical for binding (Pineda‐Molina2006The). This domain does not directly participate in ESCRT-I assembly but acts as an adaptor module for downstream interaction partners (Pineda‐Molina2006The). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the Vps28 protein can form dimers in solution, with the dimerization motif located in the N-terminal part (Pineda‐Molina2006The). The Vps28-CTD itself forms monomers in solution (Pineda‐Molina2006The). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, highlighting its evolutionary importance (Gill2007Structural).

## Function
VPS28 is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is crucial for the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. This complex plays a significant role in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are essential for the degradation of membrane proteins through lysosomal pathways. VPS28, along with other ESCRT-I components like Tsg101, is involved in the down-regulation of cell surface receptors by sorting them into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within MVBs (Kolmus2020Concurrent). This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating signaling pathways.

In addition to its role in receptor degradation, VPS28 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, autophagy, and membrane repair. The ESCRT machinery, including VPS28, is also hijacked by certain viruses, such as HIV-1, to facilitate viral budding from host cells (Sevrioukov2005A). Although VPS28 is not critical for influenza virus budding, it is involved in the budding of other enveloped viruses (Bruce2009Budding).

VPS28 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at endosomal membranes, where it interacts with other ESCRT components to execute its functions in protein sorting and membrane dynamics (Sevrioukov2005A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VPS28 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer, elevated VPS28 expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival duration. The gene's upregulation in breast cancer tissues correlates with increased cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its suppression leads to enhanced apoptosis. The study by Shi et al. highlights that miR-491-5p acts as a negative regulator of VPS28, and its downregulation in breast cancer tissues is linked to shorter overall survival. The miR-491-5p mimic reduces VPS28 expression and suppresses cancer cell progression, suggesting that targeting VPS28 and miR-491-5p could be a potential therapeutic strategy in breast cancer treatment (Shi2021Deciphering).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, the interaction of VPS28 with TSG101 is crucial for the formation of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and lysosomal functions. Dysregulation of this complex can affect the central nervous system and is associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Mutations in components of the ESCRT complex, such as CHMP2B, have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that similar disruptions in VPS28 could have comparable effects (Minaidou2019Deregulation).

## Interactions
VPS28, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, participates in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in cellular processes. Within the ESCRT-I complex, VPS28 interacts with other subunits such as Vps23/Tsg101 and Vps37, playing a crucial role in the recognition of ubiquitinated cargo during membrane receptor sorting into multivesicular body (MVB) vesicles (Pineda‐Molina2006The). The C-terminal domain of VPS28 (Vps28-CTD) forms a four-helical bundle structure that acts as an adaptor module for interactions with ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III components, specifically binding to Vps20 (CHMP6) (Pineda‐Molina2006The).

VPS28 also interacts with viral proteins, such as the influenza virus matrix protein M1 and the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Gag protein, facilitating their entry into the MVB machinery (Pineda‐Molina2006The). In addition to its role in endosomal sorting, VPS28 is involved in mitotic spindle organization through its interaction with Gβγ heterodimers. This interaction recruits Gβγ to the mitotic spindle, impacting microtubule dynamics and spindle organization (DionisioVicuña2018VPS28). The VPS28-Gβγ complex formation is enhanced by Gα, independent of G protein-coupled receptor stimulation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism intrinsic to mitotic processes (DionisioVicuña2018VPS28).
