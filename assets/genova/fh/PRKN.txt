# PRKN

## Overview
The PRKN gene encodes the parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a crucial enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation. Parkin is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and plays a significant role in mitochondrial quality control, particularly through the process of mitophagy, where it helps in the removal of damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis (Broadway2022Systematic; Durcan2015The). The protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and four RING-like domains, which are essential for its function and structural integrity (Clausen2024PRKNlinked). Mutations in the PRKN gene are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease, highlighting its importance in neuroprotection and cellular energy metabolism (MurilloGonzález2021Regulation; Jia2022Monogenic).

## Structure
The PRKN gene encodes the Parkin protein, a multi-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein ubiquitination and mitochondrial quality control. Parkin consists of 465 amino acids and features an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and four RING-like domains: RING0, RING1, in-between RING (IBR), and RING2, categorizing it within the RBR E3 ubiquitin ligase family (Wagner2024Understanding; Clausen2024PRKNlinked). Each RING domain coordinates two zinc ions, essential for maintaining the protein's structural integrity (Clausen2024PRKNlinked).

The tertiary structure of Parkin involves a catalytic core composed of the RING0, RING1, IBR, and RING2 domains, with the active site cysteine located at C431 in the RING2 domain (Wagner2024Understanding). Parkin's quaternary structure allows it to form complexes with other proteins, facilitating its role in ubiquitination and mitophagy (Clausen2024PRKNlinked).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by PINK1, are crucial for Parkin's activation. Phosphorylation at the S65 site in the UBL domain induces structural changes, transitioning Parkin from an auto-inhibited to an active conformation (Clausen2024PRKNlinked). Alternative splicing of the PRKN gene results in multiple transcript variants and distinct protein isoforms, which can differ in the presence or absence of specific domains, affecting Parkin's function and stability (La2018PRKN).

## Function
The PRKN gene encodes the parkin protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial quality control through the process of mitophagy. In healthy human cells, parkin is involved in tagging damaged mitochondria for degradation, thereby preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Broadway2022Systematic; Durcan2015The). Parkin is recruited to mitochondria in response to mitochondrial depolarization, a process facilitated by the kinase PINK1. PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane when the membrane potential is disrupted, which triggers parkin's translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Once there, parkin ubiquitinates various mitochondrial substrates, marking them for autophagic degradation (Narendra2008Parkin; Durcan2015The).

Parkin also enhances mitochondrial biogenesis in proliferating cells by promoting the transcription and replication of mitochondrial DNA, a function that is independent of its role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. This activity is associated with its interaction with mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), suggesting that parkin enhances TFAM-mediated mitochondrial transcription (Kuroda2006Parkin). Through these processes, parkin contributes to cellular energy metabolism and neuroprotection, playing a significant role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases (MurilloGonzález2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKN gene are a significant cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD), particularly in European populations. These mutations account for 27.6% of autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease cases, with the proportion of affected individuals increasing with younger age at onset. For instance, 42.2% of individuals with an age at onset of 20 years or younger have PRKN mutations (Jia2022Monogenic). The most common mutation is the deletion of exon 3, which is associated with structural variants, missense mutations, and frameshift mutations (Menon2024Genotype–phenotype; Kasten2018Genotype‐Phenotype).

PRKN-associated Parkinson's disease (PRKN-PD) is characterized by slow motor progression, preserved cognition, and a good response to levodopa therapy. However, patients often experience motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (Menon2024Genotype–phenotype; Jia2022Monogenic). Non-motor symptoms are also common in PRKN-PD (Menon2024Genotype–phenotype).

The role of monoallelic PRKN mutations in increasing Parkinson's disease risk is debated. Some studies suggest a small but significant increased risk, while others find no association when excluding cases with potential biallelic mutations (Lubbe2021Assessing; Yu2020Analysis). The complexity of PRKN mutations and their impact on disease risk highlights the need for comprehensive genetic assessments (Lubbe2021Assessing).

## Interactions
PRKN, also known as parkin, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial quality control through its involvement in mitophagy. PRKN interacts with several proteins, including PINK1, which phosphorylates PRKN at serine 65, facilitating its recruitment to damaged mitochondria and promoting ubiquitination of mitochondrial substrates (Durcan2015The). This interaction is essential for the activation of PRKN and the subsequent clearance of damaged mitochondria.

PRKN also interacts with deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that regulate its activity. USP15 is a DUB that antagonizes PRKN-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting mitophagy. Knockdown of USP15 enhances mitophagy in a PRKN-dependent manner, suggesting a regulatory interaction between these proteins (Cornelissen2014The). Similarly, USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN, specifically removing K6, K11, K48, and K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates, which modulates PRKN's role in mitophagy (Niu2019USP33).

PRKN also forms interactions with mitochondrial trafficking proteins RHOT1 and RHOT2, which serve as docking sites for PRKN, facilitating its activation and the mitophagy process (Safiulina2019Mitochondrial). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving PRKN in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.
