# CABP5

## Overview
CABP5 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium-binding protein 5 (CaBP5), which is predominantly expressed in the retina. CaBP5 is a member of the calcium-binding protein family and plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, particularly in the modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels. This modulation is crucial for neurotransmitter release in photoreceptor cells, thereby influencing visual processing (Haynes2012Evolution; Haeseleer2000Five). Unlike other calcium-binding proteins, CaBP5 interacts with proteins such as Munc18-1 and myosin VI in a calcium-independent manner, suggesting a unique mechanism of action in synaptic function and neurotransmitter release (Sokal2011Insight). The protein's involvement in synaptic vesicle cycling and trafficking underscores its importance in maintaining normal visual function (Sokal2011Insight).

## Function
CaBP5 (calcium-binding protein 5) is primarily expressed in the retina, where it plays a crucial role in calcium signaling pathways. It is involved in the modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels, which is essential for neurotransmitter release in photoreceptor cells, thereby influencing visual processing (Haynes2012Evolution; Haeseleer2000Five). CaBP5 interacts with proteins such as Munc18-1 and myosin VI, which are involved in synaptic vesicle cycling and trafficking, suggesting its role in synaptic function and neurotransmitter release (Sokal2011Insight). 

In the retina, CaBP5 is expressed in rod and cone bipolar cells, where it is thought to modulate cellular processes similar to those influenced by calmodulin, another calcium-binding protein (Haeseleer2000Five). The protein's interaction with Munc18-1, a key player in synaptic vesicle docking and fusion, indicates that CaBP5 may influence synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Sokal2011Insight). Although CaBP5 is a calcium-binding protein, its interactions with these proteins are calcium-independent, highlighting a unique aspect of its function in cellular signaling (Sokal2011Insight).

## Interactions
CaBP5 (calcium-binding protein 5) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release. It interacts with Munc18-1, a protein essential for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion, suggesting a role in synaptic vesicle cycling. This interaction is confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography, and it is significant in promoting neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Sokal2011Insight). CaBP5 also interacts with myosin VI, a cytoskeleton protein involved in actin-based motility and synaptic vesicle transport. This interaction is confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization studies in retinal tissue, indicating a potential role in synaptic protein traffic (Sokal2011Insight).

CaBP5 can bind to the CaM-binding domain of the Ca v 1.2 voltage-activated calcium channel in a calcium-dependent manner, modulating its activity by suppressing calcium-dependent inactivation and shifting the voltage dependence of activation. This interaction is specific to a cytoplasmic fragment of Ca v 1.2 and is crucial for normal light signal transmission in the retina (Rieke2008Characterization).
