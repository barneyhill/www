# LILRB4

## Overview
LILRB4, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. The protein, also referred to as LILRB4, is primarily expressed on myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It functions as an inhibitory receptor, playing a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating immune responses. The protein contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its intracellular domain, which recruit phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2 to inhibit downstream signaling pathways, thereby exerting an immunosuppressive effect. LILRB4 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune tolerance, inflammation regulation, and certain diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma (Liu2023Molecular; Xiang2024LILRB4; Park2016Leukocyte).

## Structure
LILRB4 is a member of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family, characterized by its unique structural features. The protein consists of an extracellular segment with two immunoglobulin-like domains, D1 and D2, which are composed of antiparallel fragments. The D1-D2 outer domain has a distinctive interdomain angle of 107°, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The D2 domain includes two new 310 helix regions, which are closely related to the D4 domains of other LILRs (Nam2013Crystal; Xiang2024LILRB4).

The intracellular segment of LILRB4 contains three immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its signaling function. These ITIMs, with sequences 335VTYAKY340, 387VTYAQL392, and 417SVYATL422, recruit SHP-1/SHP-2 phosphatases to inhibit protein tyrosine kinase-mediated activation signals. Phosphorylation sites at tyrosines 360, 412, and 442, particularly Y412 and Y442, are involved in recruiting SHP-2 to mediate the inhibition of T lymphocytes (Xiang2024LILRB4).

LILRB4 is a transmembrane protein, and its structure allows it to exert immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting downstream signaling pathways via the enzymatic phosphatase action of SHP1/2 proteins (Xiang2024LILRB4). The protein's structural features enable it to bind to ligands such as CD166 (ALCAM) and serum apolipoprotein E (APOE), which are involved in tumor cell growth and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively (Xiang2024LILRB4).

## Function
LILRB4, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4, is an inhibitory receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis by modulating immune responses. LILRB4 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its intracellular domain, which recruit phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 upon phosphorylation. This recruitment leads to the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways, including protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), resulting in an overall immunosuppressive effect and the inhibition of T lymphocyte activation (Liu2023Molecular; Xiang2024LILRB4).

In healthy human cells, LILRB4 is involved in regulating immune tolerance by acting as a regulatory switch for the immune system. It helps suppress immune responses selectively to induce tolerance to specific antigens, thereby preventing overactivation of the immune system and maintaining immune homeostasis (Xiang2024LILRB4). LILRB4 is also involved in the regulation of inflammation by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, thus modulating inflammatory responses (Xiang2024LILRB4). Additionally, LILRB4 expression is upregulated in response to certain stimuli, such as vitamin D and interferons, which further influence immune cell activity and differentiation (Liu2023Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
LILRB4 is implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), LILRB4 expression is significantly associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, particularly in patients with M4 or M5 morphology. This suggests that LILRB4 may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of CNS seeding by AML cells, and its expression could serve as a marker for CNS involvement in these patients (Bergstrom2021The). 

In multiple myeloma (MM), LILRB4 is highly expressed and negatively correlated with patient survival. It supports MM cell proliferation through the STAT3-PFKFB1 pathway, and its knockdown has been shown to delay MM cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Targeting LILRB4 with antibodies has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for MM (Xie2024LILRB4).

LILRB4 is also involved in aortic dissection (AD) development. Knockdown of LILRB4 in a mouse model inhibited AD progression by promoting a contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle cells and stabilizing the extracellular matrix. This suggests that LILRB4 could be a therapeutic target for AD (Xiong2024LILRB4).

## Interactions
Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) is known to participate in several interactions that modulate immune responses. LILRB4 interacts with the FcγRI receptor, where its co-ligation significantly reduces the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in FcγRI-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis and phagocytosis. This interaction leads to the dephosphorylation of key signaling molecules such as clathrin, Cbl, HGS, and TRIM21, thereby inhibiting Fc-receptor-dependent endocytosis and phagocytosis (Park2016Leukocyte).

LILRB4 also recruits SHP-1-like phosphatase, which results in the dephosphorylation of Syk and other downstream kinases, suppressing cytokine production and FcγRI-dependent uptake of antibody-opsonized particles (Park2016Leukocyte). This interaction underscores LILRB4's role in immune regulation by modulating phosphorylation states of proteins involved in immune signaling pathways.

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), LILRB4 interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), contributing to T-cell suppression and tumor infiltration. The humanized monoclonal antibody h128-3 targets LILRB4, blocking its interaction with ApoE, which reverses T-cell suppression and reduces AML tumor burden (Gui2019Disrupting).
