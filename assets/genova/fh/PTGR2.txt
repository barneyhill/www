# PTGR2

## Overview
PTGR2, or prostaglandin reductase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of prostaglandins, which are lipid compounds with diverse hormone-like effects in animals. The protein encoded by PTGR2 is categorized as an oxidoreductase, playing a crucial role in the reduction of 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (15-keto-PGE2), a metabolite involved in various physiological and pathological processes. PTGR2 is implicated in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, as it interacts with key cellular pathways, including those involving the transcription factors PPARγ and Nrf2. These interactions influence processes such as cancer progression, antioxidative defense, and inflammatory responses, highlighting the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in diseases like cancer and sepsis (Chen2018Targeting; YunChia2012Prostaglandin; Chang2016Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
PTGR2 (prostaglandin reductase 2) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly gastric cancer and systemic inflammation. In gastric cancer, PTGR2 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its overexpression is associated with poorer patient outcomes. Knockdown of PTGR2 in gastric cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumorigenicity, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation. This effect is linked to its modulation of mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impacting apoptotic signaling pathways such as the ERK1/2-caspase 3 pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins (YunChia2012Prostaglandin).

In the context of systemic inflammation and sepsis, PTGR2 has been shown to influence the inflammatory response. PTGR2-deficient mice exhibit improved survival rates in sepsis models, with reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced expression of antioxidant genes. This is attributed to the accumulation of 15-keto-PGE2, which activates the NRF2 pathway, providing a protective effect against oxidative stress. These findings suggest that PTGR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for managing inflammation and improving survival in sepsis (Chen2018Targeting).

## Interactions
PTGR2 (prostaglandin reductase 2) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In pancreatic cancer cells, PTGR2 interacts with pathways involving xCT and CTH, which are crucial for cysteine supply and glutathione synthesis. This interaction affects the antioxidative defense system by modulating glutathione levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Chang2016Inhibition). PTGR2 also interacts with PPARγ, a transcription factor involved in cancer progression. The silencing of PTGR2 or the addition of 15-keto-PGE2 activates PPARγ, suggesting a regulatory role in oxidative stress and cell death (Chang2016Inhibition).

In the context of systemic inflammation and sepsis, PTGR2 influences the activity of the anti-oxidative transcription factor Nrf2. The accumulation of 15-keto-PGE2, due to PTGR2 knockdown, enhances Nrf2 activity by modifying its negative regulator, Keap1, at the Cys288 site. This modification allows Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of antioxidant genes (Chen2018Targeting). PTGR2 also affects the NF-кB pathway, as its silencing inhibits NF-кB activity and increases the stability of IкBα, thereby reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Chen2018Targeting). These interactions highlight PTGR2's role in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.
