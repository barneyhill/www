# PET117

## Overview
PET117 is a gene that encodes the PET117 cytochrome c oxidase chaperone, a mitochondrial protein essential for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a critical component of the electron transport chain. The PET117 protein functions as a chaperone, facilitating the proper synthesis and assembly of CcO by stabilizing key components such as TACO1, a translational activator of COX1, and interacting with other assembly factors like MR-1S and PET100 (Sun2023PET117; Vidoni2017MR1S). These interactions are vital for the incorporation of COX subunits into the mature enzyme complex, thereby ensuring efficient ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Vidoni2017MR1S; Watson2020Functions). Mutations in the PET117 gene have been linked to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Renkema2017Mutated).

## Function
PET117 is a chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is specifically involved in the synthesis and translation of the mitochondrial-encoded COX1 protein. PET117 stabilizes TACO1, a translational activator of COX1, thereby ensuring proper COX1 synthesis and mitochondrial function (Sun2023PET117). The absence of PET117 impairs mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reduces ATP production, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial health (Sun2023PET117).

PET117 is also involved in the modular assembly of COX, interacting with other assembly factors such as MR-1S and PET100. This interaction is essential for the incorporation of COX subunits into the mature enzyme complex (Vidoni2017MR1S). PET117's role in COX assembly is critical for efficient ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Vidoni2017MR1S; Watson2020Functions). PET117 is active in the mitochondria, where it ensures the stability and functionality of the respiratory chain (Sun2023PET117).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PET117 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders, particularly complex IV deficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This deficiency is linked to neurodevelopmental regression and lesions in the medulla oblongata, as observed in two sisters from a consanguineous Moroccan family. Both exhibited symptoms such as developmental delays, speech difficulties, and elevated levels of glycine, lactate, and alanine, indicating mitochondrial involvement (Renkema2017Mutated). The study identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in the PET117 gene, resulting in a premature stop codon, which was confirmed through genetic analysis (Renkema2017Mutated).

The role of PET117 in mitochondrial function is further highlighted by its involvement in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). PET117 stabilizes TACO1, a COX1 translational activator, and its absence leads to impaired COX1 protein synthesis, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Sun2023PET117). The PET117-TACO1 axis is crucial for COX1 translation, and mutations in PET117 can lead to defects in COX assembly, potentially resulting in conditions like Leigh syndrome (Sun2023PET117). These findings underscore the critical role of PET117 in maintaining mitochondrial respiratory function and its impact on neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Interactions
PET117 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) by interacting with various proteins involved in this process. It physically interacts with Cox15, a heme a synthase, to stabilize its oligomerization, which is essential for heme a synthesis and subsequent CcO assembly. This interaction persists even in the absence of Cox15's catalytic function and heme a, although it is somewhat destabilized without Cox15's catalytic activity (Taylor2017The).

PET117 also interacts with MR-1S and PET100 during CcO biogenesis. The interaction with MR-1S and COX subunits is dependent on the presence of PET100, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In PET100-deficient cells, the interaction between PET117 and MR-1S is disrupted, highlighting the importance of PET100 in facilitating these interactions (Vidoni2017MR1S).

PET117's interaction with Cox15 is not mediated by other proteins, as it occurs independently of certain assembly factors like Mss51 and Shy1, which are involved in Cox1 synthesis and assembly (Taylor2017The). These interactions underscore PET117's role in linking heme a biosynthesis to CcO biogenesis and ensuring proper mitochondrial respiration.
