# NCCRP1

## Overview
NCCRP1, or Non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune response regulation. The protein, characterized by its F-box associated (FBA) domain, is a member of the lectin-type subfamily of F-box proteins, which are typically involved in forming E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes play a crucial role in protein degradation, suggesting that NCCRP1 may influence protein stability and turnover (Kallio2011Characterization). Unlike typical F-box proteins, NCCRP1 lacks the cyclin-like F-box domain pattern but shares conserved residues with other FBXO proteins (Kallio2011Characterization). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, indicating its intracellular localization and potential interactions with other cytoplasmic proteins (Kallio2011Characterization). NCCRP1 is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the JAK/STAT pathway, and has been associated with immune cell activation and function (JasoFriedmann2001The). Additionally, NCCRP1 has clinical significance in several cancers, where its expression and methylation status can influence disease prognosis and serve as a potential biomarker for therapeutic interventions (Miwa2017Identification; Chen2023A).

## Structure
The NCCRP1 protein is characterized by its F-box associated (FBA) domain, which is a key feature of its molecular structure (Kallio2011Characterization). Unlike typical F-box proteins, NCCRP1 does not contain the cyclin-like F-box domain pattern, although it shares 12 conserved residues with other FBXO proteins within the F-box domain region (Kallio2011Characterization). The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, lacking transmembrane helices and signal peptides, which suggests its intracellular localization (Kallio2011Characterization).

The tertiary structure of NCCRP1 includes a beta sandwich fold within the FBA domain, which is indicative of its role in protein interactions (Kallio2011Characterization). This structural feature is consistent with its classification as a member of the lectin-type subfamily of F-box proteins, which are involved in ubiquitin ligase complexes (Kallio2011Characterization). The protein's structure suggests potential interactions with other cytoplasmic proteins, possibly affecting cell surface events (Kallio2011Characterization).

NCCRP1 is expressed as a recombinant protein fused with GST for experimental purposes, and its expression has been analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Kallio2011Characterization). The protein's structure and domain organization suggest it may have unique functional roles compared to other F-box proteins.

## Clinical Significance
NCCRP1 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and methylation status playing significant roles in disease prognosis. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), NCCRP1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its promoter region is often hypermethylated, leading to reduced mRNA expression. This downregulation is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival, making low NCCRP1 expression an independent prognostic factor for ESCC (Miwa2017Identification).

In gastric cancer, higher NCCRP1 expression correlates with shorter recurrence-free and overall survival times, suggesting a role in promoting cancer proliferation and invasion (Chen2023A). Conversely, in pancreatic cancer, NCCRP1 is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, yet paradoxically, high expression is linked to worse survival outcomes. This complexity may arise from NCCRP1's expression in stromal cells rather than tumor cells (Chen2023A; Zuo2020Identification).

In melanoma, high NCCRP1 expression is associated with adverse prognosis and is identified as an independent risk prognostic predictor for metastatic melanoma (Zhang2020Identification; Sun2019Identification). These findings highlight NCCRP1's diverse roles in cancer, potentially serving as a biomarker for prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
NCCRP1, also known as Non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in immune responses. It is proposed to be a member of the lectin-type subfamily of F-box proteins, which are typically involved in forming part of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes play a role in targeting proteins for degradation, suggesting that NCCRP1 may participate in regulating protein stability and turnover (Kallio2011Characterization).

NCCRP1 has been shown to interact with Janus kinases (JAK), specifically JAK2, through its proline-rich motifs (PRMs) and BOX motifs. This interaction is essential for the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), particularly STAT-6, which translocates to the nucleus upon activation. This suggests that NCCRP1 is involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, a critical pathway for immune cell activation and function (JasoFriedmann2001The).

In Nile tilapia, NCCRP1 interacts with transferrin, a protein that can up-regulate the expression of killing effector molecules in non-specific cytotoxic cells (NCCs). This interaction enhances the cytotoxic activity of NCCs, indicating a regulatory role in the immune response (Huang2022Transferrin).
