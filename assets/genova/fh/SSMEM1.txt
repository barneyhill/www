# SSMEM1

## Overview
SSMEM1 is a gene that encodes the serine rich single-pass membrane protein 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in spermatid development. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a crucial role in the proper movement and organization of the Golgi apparatus during the maturation of spermatids. The SSMEM1 protein is hypothesized to interact with the cytoskeleton, facilitating the migration of organelles necessary for normal sperm morphology and motility. Disruptions in the function of SSMEM1 can lead to male infertility, specifically globozoospermia, characterized by sperm with abnormally round heads, which impairs fertility (Nozawa2020Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the SSMEM1 gene have been linked to male infertility, specifically causing globozoospermia and sterility in male mice. Globozoospermia is characterized by sperm with an abnormally round head shape, which is a known cause of male infertility. The absence of SSMEM1 disrupts the proper movement of the Golgi apparatus during spermatid development, leading to abnormal sperm head morphology and reduced motility. This disruption results in disorganized cell organelles and entrapped tails in the cytoplasmic droplet, ultimately causing infertility (Nozawa2020Knockout).

The SSMEM1 gene is testis-specific and its expression peaks around postnatal day 15, coinciding with the expression of cytoskeleton genes. It is hypothesized to associate with the cytoskeleton, potentially localizing to the Golgi membrane and interacting with cytoskeletal proteins to facilitate organelle migration. The gene's expression is limited to the testis and is likely degraded before spermatids are released (Nozawa2020Knockout). Given its critical role in sperm development, SSMEM1 is considered a candidate gene for human male infertility, with polymorphisms identified in the dbSNP database (Nozawa2020Knockout).
