# SMC3

## Overview
SMC3 is a gene that encodes the protein structural maintenance of chromosomes 3, a pivotal component of the cohesin complex. This protein is integral to the processes of sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability during cell division. SMC3 is characterized by its coiled-coil architecture, which includes domains such as the hinge domain, ATPase head domain, and nucleotide binding domain. These structural features facilitate its interaction with other proteins, such as SMC1A, to form a functional heterodimer essential for cohesin's activity. The protein's function is further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, which are vital for its role in chromatin association and sister chromatid cohesion. Beyond its structural and functional roles, SMC3 is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and 3D genome organization, and is associated with clinical conditions such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and certain cancers (Ghiselli2006SMC3knockdowntriggersgenomicinstabilityandp53dependentapoptosisinhumanandzebrafishcells; GilRodríguez2015De; Bastos2023SMC3).

## Structure
The SMC3 protein is a critical component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Structurally, SMC3 features a coiled-coil architecture with distinct domains, including the hinge domain, ATPase head domain, and nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (Robison2018A; GilRodríguez2015De). The hinge domain facilitates dimerization with SMC1A, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the cohesin complex's function (Gomes2022The).

The ATPase head domain of SMC3 is involved in the cohesin ATPase cycle, exhibiting intrinsic flexibility and high plasticity at the ATP-dependent interface with SMC1A (Gomes2022The). This domain contains conserved lysine residues, K112 and K113, which are acetylated by the enzyme Eco1. This acetylation is vital for the protein's function, as it stabilizes cohesin's association with chromatin and is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion (Gligoris2014Closing; Rowland2009Building).

The interaction between SMC3 and the kleisin subunit Scc1 is crucial for cohesin's association with chromosomes. The N-terminal domain of Scc1 binds to the coiled coil emerging from SMC3's ATPase head, forming a four-helix bundle essential for cohesin's function (Gligoris2014Closing). The structural integrity and function of the SMC3-kleisin interface are maintained by both hydrophobic and specific charged interactions (Gligoris2014Closing).

## Function
The SMC3 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the cohesin complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. This cohesion is essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells during mitosis, ensuring genomic stability and integrity (Uhlmann2016SMC; Ghiselli2006SMC3knockdowntriggersgenomicinstabilityandp53dependentapoptosisinhumanandzebrafishcells). SMC3 is involved in DNA recombination and repair, and it is part of the ATM/NBS1 DNA damage surveillance pathway, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Ghiselli2006SMC3knockdowntriggersgenomicinstabilityandp53dependentapoptosisinhumanandzebrafishcells).

In healthy human cells, SMC3 is active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper chromosomal segregation and centrosome organization during mitosis. Disruption of SMC3 levels can lead to genomic instability, centrosome amplification, and mitotic abnormalities, which can trigger p53-dependent apoptosis (Ghiselli2006SMC3knockdowntriggersgenomicinstabilityandp53dependentapoptosisinhumanandzebrafishcells). The acetylation of SMC3 during the S phase is crucial for recruiting sororin, an essential component of the cohesin complex, which is necessary for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion (Uhlmann2016SMC). SMC3 also plays a role in regulating gene expression through its involvement in 3D genome organization, facilitating promoter-enhancer interactions (Bastos2023SMC3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMC3 gene are associated with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) and CdLS-like phenotypes. CdLS is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, growth failure, intellectual disability, and limb malformations. Mutations in SMC3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, account for about 1%-2% of CdLS-like phenotypes. These mutations are often de novo and include in-frame deletions, duplications, and missense mutations, which can have a dominant-negative effect on the cohesin complex, crucial for sister chromatid cohesion and genome stability (GilRodríguez2015De).

In the context of cancer, SMC3 mutations have been identified in various myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These mutations are often secondary events in clonal evolution, contributing to disease progression and poor overall survival. SMC3 mutations in AML are not linked to aneuploidy but may affect gene expression and DNA-loop formation, influencing transcriptional regulation (Thota2014Genetic).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SMC3 plays a role in regulating Rab27a expression through epigenetic mechanisms. Alterations in SMC3 interactions can drive PDAC progression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Bastos2023SMC3).

## Interactions
SMC3, a core component of the cohesin complex, participates in various protein interactions essential for its function in chromosomal stability and cell cycle progression. It forms a heterodimer with SMC1, creating a functional ATPase head crucial for cohesin's role in sister chromatid cohesion (Patel2005Hinderin). SMC3 also interacts with a novel protein named Hinderin, which binds to its hinge domain and modulates its interaction with SMC1, potentially affecting cohesin complex formation (Patel2005Hinderin).

In addition to its role in the cohesin complex, SMC3 interacts with a variety of splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as SF3B1, SF3B3, and ADAR1. These interactions occur in the chromatin fraction and are independent of DNA or RNA, suggesting a role in RNA processing and mitotic progression (Kim2019Systematic). SMC3 also associates with the RPGR-ORF15 protein in retinal axonemes, indicating a role in microtubule transport processes (Khanna2005RPGRORF15).

Furthermore, SMC3 interacts with the ret finger protein (RFP) in the nucleus, where RFP influences the distribution of SMC3, suggesting a regulatory role in its nuclear localization (Patel2005The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of SMC3 in cellular processes beyond chromosomal cohesion.
