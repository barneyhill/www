# RSAD2

## Overview
RSAD2, also known as viperin, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily, characterized by its involvement in antiviral defense and metabolic regulation. The protein, viperin, is a radical SAM enzyme that contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster essential for its catalytic activity, facilitating the generation of radical intermediates necessary for its function (Lachowicz2021Structural; Honarmand2020Mechanism). Viperin is implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of metabolic pathways and immune responses, by producing metabolites that inhibit key enzymes and interacting with proteins involved in immune signaling (Honarmand2020ddhCTP; Dumbrepatil2019Viperin). Its role in disrupting viral replication and influencing immune pathways underscores its significance in both innate immunity and potential therapeutic applications (Helbig2011The). The gene's expression is also associated with several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical relevance (Sezin2018Gene; Li2024RSAD2).

## Structure
RSAD2, also known as viperin, is a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily, characterized by a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is essential for its enzymatic activity (Lachowicz2021Structural). This cluster facilitates the homolytic cleavage of SAM, generating a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical necessary for its catalytic function (Honarmand2020Mechanism). The enzyme's structure includes a conserved sequence motif, NΦHX4CX3CX2CF, which is crucial for its catalytic activity and involves residues that function as hydrogen bond acceptors/proton donors and participate in π-stacking interactions (Lachowicz2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of RSAD2 includes a partial (β/α)6-TIM barrel, which is a common fold among radical SAM enzymes, and this structure supports the binding of the [4Fe-4S] cluster at the catalytic site (Lachowicz2021Structural). The enzyme's C-terminal tail becomes ordered upon substrate binding, forming a cap over the catalytic site and providing hydrogen bonds to the substrate's polyphosphate tail (Lachowicz2021Structural). RSAD2 is highly conserved across various species, indicating its evolutionary significance in antiviral immunity (Lachowicz2021Structural). The enzyme may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its function and stability. However, specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The RSAD2 gene encodes the protein viperin, which plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and immune response. In healthy human cells, viperin is involved in the production of 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP) through its radical-SAM activity. This metabolite inhibits the NAD+-dependent activity of several enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LLDH), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), thereby modulating cellular metabolism (Honarmand2020ddhCTP). The inhibition of GAPDH by ddhCTP leads to an increased intracellular level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and enhances the flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, suggesting a role in regulating metabolic pathways (Honarmand2020ddhCTP).

Viperin also affects mitochondrial metabolism by depleting cellular nucleotide pools, specifically UTP and CTP, which can interfere with mitochondrial function and nucleotide biosynthesis (Ebrahimi2020Viperin). The protein is localized to the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, where it can disrupt lipid raft microdomains, impacting processes such as viral budding and immune signaling (Li2016miR200). These activities highlight viperin's role in both metabolic regulation and antiviral defense mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RSAD2 gene, also known as viperin, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In autoimmune diseases such as pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), RSAD2 is significantly upregulated in CD4+ T cells, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. The gene is part of a common interferon signature shared across multiple autoimmune diseases, indicating potential involvement in their etiology (Sezin2018Gene).

In breast cancer, RSAD2 has been identified as a hub gene with significant biological functions. Its expression is negatively associated with prognosis, and knockdown experiments have shown that reducing RSAD2 expression inhibits cancer cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer cell growth (Tang2019Weighted).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), RSAD2 is associated with poor overall survival and is considered an independent risk factor for prognosis. Its expression is linked to pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and alterations in immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (Li2024RSAD2).

RSAD2 is also involved in the response to insulin in cells with PIK3CA mutations, where its expression mediates inflammatory responses, potentially contributing to conditions like endometriosis and endometrial cancer (Wilson2023PIK3CA).

## Interactions
RSAD2, also known as viperin, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its antiviral functions. It interacts with the Senecavirus A (SVA) 2C protein, specifically binding to the amino acids 201-322 region of the SVA 2C protein. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting SVA replication and is facilitated by the N-terminal domain of RSAD2, particularly the amino acids 43-70 (Hou2024RSAD2).

RSAD2 also interacts with host proteins such as IRAK1 and TRAF6, which are involved in innate immune signaling. Viperin facilitates the poly-ubiquitination of IRAK1 by TRAF6, a process essential for immune signaling pathways like TLR7/9. This interaction is mediated by the formation of a complex where IRAK1 acts as a bridge between viperin and TRAF6 (Dumbrepatil2018Interactions; Dumbrepatil2019Viperin).

In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, RSAD2 interacts with the HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) and the host factor VAP-A within the HCV replication complex. This interaction disrupts the association of NS5A with VAP-A, thereby inhibiting HCV replication (Helbig2011The).
