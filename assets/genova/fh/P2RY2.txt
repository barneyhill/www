# P2RY2

## Overview
The P2RY2 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is activated by extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP. This receptor is integral to numerous physiological processes, particularly in epithelial tissues, where it regulates ion transport and intracellular calcium levels. The P2Y2 receptor's structure, characterized by transmembrane alpha helices typical of GPCRs, facilitates its interaction with ligands and G proteins, playing a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways. Its involvement in processes such as mucin secretion and ion channel regulation underscores its importance in maintaining respiratory health and its potential implications in diseases like cystic fibrosis and asthma. Additionally, P2Y2 is implicated in cancer progression and drug resistance, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target (Hu2019Targeting; Burnstock2012Purinergic).

## Structure
The P2Y2 receptor, encoded by the P2RY2 gene, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by nucleotides such as ATP and UTP. The primary structure of the P2Y2 receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor protein. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, which span the cell membrane (Hillmann2009Key). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, allowing the receptor to interact with ligands and G proteins. This structure is crucial for the receptor's function and is stabilized by disulfide bridges, such as those between C25-C278 and C106-C183, which are essential for receptor stability and function (Hillmann2009Key).

The P2Y2 receptor features a binding pocket located in the upper third of the receptor molecule, with an entry channel between transmembrane helices 5 and 6. This pocket accommodates ligands through interactions involving ionic, lipophilic, π-π, and hydrogen bonding (Hillmann2009Key). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, may affect the receptor's function and localization, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor's structure allows for ligand optimization, making it a potential target for drug development (Hillmann2009Key).

## Function
The P2RY2 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y2, a G-protein-coupled receptor activated by extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP. This receptor plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial cells. In the airways, P2Y2 receptors are involved in the regulation of ion transport, including the inhibition of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) and the regulation of Cl- secretion, which are essential for maintaining airway surface liquid homeostasis (Burnstock2012Purinergic). P2Y2 receptors are also implicated in the mobilization of intracellular calcium, which is vital for surfactant secretion in alveolar type II cells and mucin secretion in airway goblet cells (Burnstock2012Purinergic).

In normal human nasal epithelial cells, P2Y2 receptors are expressed on both luminal and basolateral membranes, where they regulate intracellular calcium levels, contributing to fluid and mucus secretion (Kim2004Membranespecific). The receptor's activation by ATP and UTP enhances mucin secretion and gene expression in human tracheobronchial tissues, playing a significant role in maintaining airway hydration and mucociliary clearance (Burnstock2012Purinergic). These functions highlight the importance of P2Y2 receptors in respiratory health and their potential involvement in conditions like cystic fibrosis and asthma (Burnstock2012Purinergic).

## Clinical Significance
The P2RY2 gene, encoding the purinergic receptor P2Y2, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In cancer, P2RY2 is associated with drug resistance and tumor progression. It contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer by activating signaling pathways like PKC-δ and MEK/ERK, and increasing the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) (Gendron2017P2Y2). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, P2RY2 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis, promoting cancer growth through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and enhancing glycolysis (Hu2019Targeting).

In cerebral infarction, P2RY2 gene variations, particularly the GG genotype of the rs4944832 SNP, are associated with increased risk, especially in Japanese women, suggesting a gender-specific genetic predisposition (Wang2009Purinergic). In cystic fibrosis, P2RY2 receptor polymorphisms affect calcium influx and chloride secretion, potentially modifying disease severity and response to therapy (Büscher2006P2Y2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of P2RY2 in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The P2RY2 receptor, a purinergic receptor, engages in several interactions with other proteins that influence cellular processes. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), P2RY2 interacts with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRb) through the Src family kinase Yes1. This interaction activates the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing glycolysis and promoting cancer progression (Hu2019Targeting). 

In ovarian carcinoma cells, P2RY2 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration through its interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This interaction is facilitated by the transactivation of EGFR, leading to increased phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK, which are critical for cell migration and EMT (Martínez‐Ramírez2015The).

During human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, P2RY2 modulates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for viral replication and cell motility. It also interacts with the viral protein UL37x1 to regulate cytosolic calcium levels, essential for viral replication (Chen2019P2Y2). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
