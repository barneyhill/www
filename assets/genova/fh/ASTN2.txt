# ASTN2

## Overview
ASTN2 is a gene that encodes the protein astrotactin 2, which is a type IV-B integral membrane protein involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. Astrotactin 2 is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including transmembrane domains and various functional domains such as EGF repeats and a MACPF domain, which are crucial for its role in neuronal migration and synaptic regulation (Ni2016Structure; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). The protein is primarily localized to vesicles within neurons and is involved in the trafficking and degradation of synaptic proteins, impacting synaptic form and function (Behesti2018ASTN2; Ni2016Structure). Mutations and alterations in the ASTN2 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Lionel2013Disruption; Hayashi2024Analysis).

## Structure
The ASTN2 (astrotactin 2) protein is a type IV-B integral membrane protein involved in neuronal development. It shares 48% amino acid identity with ASTN1 and features a complex molecular structure with several distinct domains. The protein includes a signal sequence, two transmembrane domains, a cytosolic domain, and a large C-terminal lumenal domain (Lara2018Murine; Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental). 

ASTN2 contains three Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) repeats, a fibronectin type III (Fn(III)) domain, and an annexin-like domain, which binds calcium and phosphorylated inositol species (Ni2016Structure). The MACPF domain, characteristic of the membrane attack complex-perforin family, is present but does not form pores like other proteins in this family (Berkowicz2017Neurodevelopmental; Ni2016Structure). 

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including endoproteolytic cleavage in the second transmembrane domain, resulting in two fragments linked by a disulfide bond (Lara2018Murine). ASTN2 is primarily localized to vesicles within neurons and is associated with clathrin-coated vesicles during neuronal growth (Ni2016Structure). The protein also has several splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles (Lara2018Murine).

## Function
ASTN2 (astrotactin 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic function. It is involved in the regulation of neuronal migration, particularly during glial-guided migration, by forming a complex with ASTN1 and regulating its surface expression. This process is essential for the polarized distribution of ASTN1 on migrating neurons, facilitating their movement along glial fibers (Wilson2010Astn2).

In addition to its role in neuronal migration, ASTN2 is involved in modulating synaptic strength by trafficking and degrading surface proteins. It interacts with synaptic adhesion proteins, such as members of the Neuroligin family, promoting their endocytosis and reducing their surface expression. This function is crucial for maintaining synaptic balance and function (Behesti2018ASTN2).

ASTN2 is primarily localized to vesicles inside neural cells, including endosomes and autophagosomes, where it participates in endosomal/lysosomal trafficking. It binds to various trafficking proteins, such as the Clathrin adapter AP-2, and is involved in the removal and degradation of synaptic proteins, impacting synaptic form and function (Behesti2018ASTN2; Ni2016Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASTN2 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Deletions and duplications affecting ASTN2 are significantly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly in males (Lionel2013Disruption). These genetic variations are linked to a range of phenotypes, including speech and language delays, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Lionel2013Disruption).

The study of ASTN2 deletions in neuronal cells has revealed shortened neurite outgrowth and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are common in disorders like schizophrenia and ASD (Hayashi2024Analysis). ASTN2's role in regulating mitochondrial quality and transcriptional regulation is suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders (Hayashi2024Analysis).

Polymorphisms within ASTN2 have also been associated with the age at onset of Alzheimer's disease, indicating its potential influence on cognitive disorders (Wang2014Polymorphisms). The gene's involvement in neuronal migration and synapse guidance further underscores its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions (Lionel2013Disruption).

## Interactions
ASTN2 (astrotactin 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in neuronal migration and synaptic function. It interacts with ASTN1, forming a complex crucial for the surface expression and trafficking of ASTN1 during glial-guided neuronal migration. This interaction is calcium-independent and involves multiple regions of both proteins (Ni2016Structure; Wilson2010Astn2). ASTN2 also interacts with endosomal and synaptic proteins, including the Clathrin adapter AP-2, which is involved in endosomal/lysosomal trafficking (Behesti2018ASTN2).

In the context of synaptic function, ASTN2 binds to Neuroligins, specifically NLGN1-4, and modulates their surface expression by promoting endocytosis, thereby affecting synaptic strength (Behesti2018ASTN2). It also interacts with proteins such as ROCK2 and SLC12a5, which are involved in synaptic adhesion and ion transport, respectively (Behesti2018ASTN2). These interactions suggest that ASTN2 plays a role in the trafficking and degradation of synaptic proteins, impacting synaptic form and function (Behesti2018ASTN2). ASTN2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in neuronal development and synaptic regulation.
