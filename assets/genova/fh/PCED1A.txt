# PCED1A

## Overview
PCED1A is a gene that encodes the protein PC-esterase domain containing 1A, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a cadherin-like domain, and a PC esterase domain with an ATP-grasp domain, suggesting roles in extracellular activities, cell adhesion, and acyl-transferase and acyl-esterase functions (Bokhari2020Whole; Maynard2018Characterization). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have distinct functional roles, particularly in osteogenic differentiation (Maynard2018Characterization). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as WNT16 and PPP6R3, further suggest its involvement in key signaling pathways (Bokhari2020Whole).

## Structure
The PCED1A gene encodes a protein that is composed of 1,026 amino acids and includes several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The protein features an N-terminal signal peptide, which directs it to the secretory pathway, indicating its involvement in extracellular processes (Bokhari2020Whole; Maynard2018Characterization). It also contains a cadherin-like domain, which is typically involved in carbohydrate-binding, suggesting a role in cell adhesion or signaling (Maynard2018Characterization). Additionally, the protein has a PC esterase domain with an ATP-grasp domain, which implies functions related to acyl-transferase and acyl-esterase activities, potentially modifying glycoproteins (Bokhari2020Whole; Maynard2018Characterization).

The CPED1 protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that may have different functional roles. These splicing events include exon skipping, which can alter the protein's structure without disrupting the open reading frame, maintaining the functional domains (Maynard2018Characterization). The presence of multiple promoter regions and splice variants suggests a complex regulation of expression, particularly during osteogenic differentiation (Maynard2018Characterization). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its interaction with other proteins, such as WNT16 and PPP6R3, which are involved in signaling pathways (Bokhari2020Whole).
