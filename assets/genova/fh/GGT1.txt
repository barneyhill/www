# GGT1

## Overview
The GGT1 gene encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase 1, a critical component in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. This enzyme is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase family and is primarily involved in the metabolism of glutathione (GSH), a key antioxidant. Gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 facilitates the breakdown of extracellular glutathione, enabling the uptake of its constituent amino acids, such as cysteine, which are essential for intracellular GSH synthesis and maintenance of redox balance (Coradini2020Body; Bansal2019GammaGlutamyltransferase). The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidneys, where it plays a significant role in detoxification processes and amino acid transport (Ściskalska2020Increased). Alterations in GGT1 expression or function can lead to disrupted glutathione homeostasis, contributing to oxidative stress and associated pathologies (Whitfield2001Gamma; Jean1999gammaGlutamyl).

## Structure
The human γ-glutamyltranspeptidase 1 (hGGT1) protein is a heterodimer composed of a large subunit (residues 28-380) and a small subunit (residues 381-569) (West2013Novel). The enzyme belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase family and features a core structure similar to bacterial GGTs, although significant differences exist, particularly in the orientation of the catalytic nucleophile, Thr-381, and the presence of tightly bound chlorides near the catalytic residue (West2013Novel). The active site nucleophile, Thr-381, is located in the deepest part of a substrate channel on the small subunit's surface (West2013Novel).

hGGT1 is heavily N-glycosylated, with glycosylation sites identified at specific asparagine residues, which are crucial for proper folding and activation (West2013Novel). The enzyme also contains intramolecular disulfide bonds, such as Cys-50/Cys-74 and Cys-192/Cys-196, which are essential for its autocleavage into active heterodimers (West2013Novel). The lid loop, consisting of residues Pro-427 through Ser-438, is flexible and regulates access to the active site, allowing the enzyme to accommodate a wider range of substrates (West2013Novel). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's function and its role in maintaining cysteine levels and regulating intracellular redox status.

## Function
The GGT1 gene encodes gamma-glutamyltransferase 1, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining glutathione (GSH) homeostasis and defending against oxidative stress in cells. GGT1 is a transpeptidase enzyme that increases the availability of amino acids, primarily cysteine, for intracellular GSH synthesis, which is essential for cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms (Bansal2019GammaGlutamyltransferase). The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of GSH, facilitating the extracellular cleavage of glutathione into its constituents, which are then taken up by cells to maintain antioxidant defenses (Coradini2020Body).

GGT1 is located on the cell membrane and is active in various tissues, including the liver and kidneys, where it contributes to detoxification processes by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl moiety from glutathione S-conjugates (Ściskalska2020Increased). This activity is crucial for the removal of xenobiotics from cells and for the transport of amino acids across the cell membrane, which supports cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative damage (Ściskalska2020Increased). In healthy human cells, GGT1 also regulates amino acid and mTORC1 signaling pathways, which are important for cell growth and proliferation (Bansal2019GammaGlutamyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GGT1 gene can lead to various clinical conditions. GGT1 deficiency in mice, which serves as a model for human disease, results in significant physiological abnormalities, including growth retardation, neurological issues, infertility, cataracts, and early mortality. These symptoms are attributed to disrupted glutathione metabolism, leading to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage (Lieberman1996Growth; Jean1999gammaGlutamyl; Rojas2000Accumulation). 

In humans, GGT1 deficiency is rare but has been associated with intellectual impairment and abnormal glutathione metabolism, characterized by high extracellular and urinary glutathione levels but low tissue levels. This imbalance suggests a failure in reabsorbing glutathione and its components, contributing to increased oxidative stress and potential mitochondrial dysfunction (Whitfield2001Gamma). 

Additionally, GGT1 mutations can lead to hearing and balance issues due to the loss of cochlear and vestibular hair cells, as seen in GGT1-deficient mice. This is linked to disrupted glutathione homeostasis and increased oxidative stress, which can be mitigated by treatments that promote glutathione synthesis (Ding2016Nacetylcysteine).

## Interactions
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. GGT1 is known to associate with tetraspanin proteins such as CD81, CD53, and CD82, forming part of the TM4 signal transduction complexes in B cells. These interactions suggest a role for GGT1 in modulating cell adhesion and signal transduction pathways (Nichols1998γglutamyl).

In addition to its role in B cells, GGT1 is involved in the metabolism of gamma-glutamyl compounds, including glutathione and its conjugates. It exhibits substrate specificity, interacting with compounds like GSSG and LTC4, and is inhibited by serine-borate, which acts as a competitive inhibitor (Wickham2011Gammaglutamyl). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining redox balance and is implicated in oxidative stress responses, as seen in studies involving Arabidopsis thaliana, where GGT1 activity affects the expression of proteins related to stress response and redox regulation (Trentin2015Proteome).

These interactions highlight GGT1's role in cellular detoxification and antioxidant defense, influencing various physiological processes through its enzymatic activity and protein associations.
