# USF2

## Overview
USF2, or upstream transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family. The protein product of USF2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to E-box motifs in DNA, influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and stress response. USF2 functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms homo- and heterodimers, notably with USF1, to regulate genes involved in metabolic pathways, immune responses, and circadian rhythms. The protein's activity is modulated by its structural domains, including a DNA-binding basic region and a USF-specific region critical for nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. USF2's role in transcriptional regulation is further influenced by its interactions with other proteins and post-translational modifications, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer (Luo1996Functional; RadaIglesias2008Wholegenome; FerréD’Amaré1994Structure).

## Structure
The USF2 protein is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family of transcription factors, characterized by a C-terminal bHLH-Zip domain that facilitates dimerization and DNA binding (Luo1996Functional; FerréD’Amaré1994Structure). This domain forms a parallel, left-handed four-helix bundle, with the basic region becoming alpha-helical upon DNA binding (FerréD’Amaré1994Structure). The USF2 protein binds DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer with USF1, interacting with DNA sequences similar to those recognized by Myc oncoproteins (Luo1996Functional).

USF2 contains several functional domains, including a basic region for DNA interaction and a highly conserved USF-specific region (USR) involved in nuclear localization (Luo1996Functional). The USR and exon 5-encoded region serve as transcriptional activation domains, with their activity influenced by surrounding protein regions and promoter context (Luo1996Functional). The protein's structure is further defined by its exon-intron organization, with at least 10 exons contributing to its coding sequence (Henrion1995Structure).

USF2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, such as USF2a and USF2b, which differ in the presence of exon 4 (Henrion1995Structure). These isoforms are ubiquitously expressed and may have distinct functional roles. The protein's activity can be modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its regulatory functions (FerréD’Amaré1994Structure).

## Function
USF2 (upstream transcription factor 2) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to E-box motifs in DNA. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and response to stress. USF2 is active in the nucleus, where it influences metabolic pathways, immune responses, and circadian rhythms (RadaIglesias2008Wholegenome).

USF2 forms homo- and heterodimers, primarily with USF1, and these complexes are the major DNA-binding forms in cells. These dimers recognize the canonical E-box sequence CACGTG, regulating key genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (RadaIglesias2008Wholegenome). USF2's transcriptional activity is context-dependent, requiring specific promoter elements and coactivators for activation. The USR (upstream regulatory region) is a critical domain for transcriptional activation, and its presence is necessary for USF2's function in gene regulation (Luo1996Functional; Qyang1999CellTypeDependent).

In human trophoblast cells, USF2, along with USF1, negatively regulates the expression of the hCYP19 gene, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Jiang2005O2). USF2's role in transcriptional activation is linked to its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, as observed in HeLa cells (Qyang1999CellTypeDependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USF2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. In prostate cancer, USF2 is significantly downregulated in a majority of cancer tissues, with 91% of samples showing low or negative expression levels. This downregulation is not due to mutations in the USF2 gene itself, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms are responsible for its decreased expression. The loss of USF2 expression is associated with increased tumorigenic properties, such as enhanced growth and invasion capabilities in prostate cancer cell lines (Chen2005Tumorsuppression).

In lung cancer, USF2 is upregulated in certain subtypes, such as squamous cell cancers and large cell neuroendocrine tumors, and is associated with increased cell proliferation. This suggests a potential role for USF2 in promoting lung cancer progression (Ocejo‐Garcia2005Roles).

USF2 also plays a role in mitochondrial function and cellular growth regulation. Its deficiency leads to increased cell proliferation and migration, as well as altered mitochondrial morphology and function. This is linked to enhanced ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, which promote cell survival and mitophagy, indicating a potential role in cancer and metabolic disorders (Chi2020Loss).

## Interactions
USF2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is known to bind to E-box sequences in DNA, often in promoter regions, and is associated with histone acetylation, which suggests a role in tissue-specific gene expression (RadaIglesias2008Wholegenome). USF2 forms a complex with FoxA1, a critical factor for androgenic regulation of prostate-specific promoters, and this interaction is mediated through their respective DNA-binding domains (Sun2009Upstream). USF2 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) as part of a larger transcriptional protein complex, contributing to the specificity of androgen regulation in prostate tissue (Sun2009Upstream).

In mast cells, USF2 is part of a multiprotein complex with lysyl tRNA synthetase (LysRS) and Hint, a tumor suppressor gene. This complex is involved in the regulation of USF2 transcriptional activity, with Ap4A acting as a positive regulator by dissociating Hint from USF2, allowing USF2 to transactivate its target genes (Lee2005Nonconventional). USF2 also interacts with protein kinase CK2 subunits, although it is not phosphorylated by CK2, unlike its isoform USF1 (Spohrer2016The). These interactions highlight USF2's role in various cellular processes and its regulatory influence on gene expression.
