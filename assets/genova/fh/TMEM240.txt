# TMEM240

## Overview
TMEM240 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 240, a protein primarily expressed in the brain, particularly within neurons of the cortex and cerebellum. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the formation of a novel subcellular structure known as the T240-Body, which contains components of peroxisomes and mitochondria, suggesting a potential functional relationship with these organelles (Hu2020Neuralspecific). TMEM240 plays a significant role in neuronal maturation and synaptic function, particularly in the cerebellum, where it is localized to synapses and involved in neuronal connectivity (Homa2020The). Clinically, mutations in TMEM240 are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 21 (SCA21), and its expression levels and promoter hypermethylation are significant in cancer, particularly breast and colorectal cancers, where it acts as a tumor suppressor (Chang2020Hypermethylation; Lin2022Hypermethylation).

## Function
TMEM240 is a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons within the cortex and cerebellum. It is involved in forming a novel subcellular structure known as the T240-Body, which is distinct from known cellular structures and contains components of peroxisomes and mitochondria, suggesting a potential functional relationship with these organelles (Hu2020Neuralspecific). TMEM240 is associated with neuronal maturation, as its expression pattern aligns with neural development markers like Syp and Syn1 (Hu2020Neuralspecific).

In the cerebellum, TMEM240 is localized to synapses, particularly on the post-synaptic side of Purkinje-cell soma, and is involved in neuronal projections connecting to Purkinje cells. This suggests a role in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity, particularly in the cerebellum (Homa2020The). The protein's presence in glutamatergic terminals from climbing, parallel, and mossy fibers indicates its involvement in glutamate uptake and synaptic transmission (Homa2020The).

TMEM240's role in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, but it may be linked to its expression in neurons and potential involvement in brain functions, particularly in the context of neuronal maturation and possibly peroxisome-related processes (Hu2020Neuralspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM240 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of spinocerebellar ataxia type 21 (SCA21), mutations in TMEM240 lead to neurodegenerative symptoms such as progressive ataxia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment. These mutations disrupt normal protein function, contributing to the clinical manifestations of SCA21 (Homa2020The).

In cancer, TMEM240 plays a significant role through its expression levels and promoter hypermethylation. In breast cancer, TMEM240 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its overexpression inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, reduced expression due to hypermethylation is linked to increased tumor progression and poor response to hormone therapies, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (Lin2022Hypermethylation). The gene's hypermethylation is also associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients (Lin2022Hypermethylation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM240 hypermethylation and decreased expression are potential biomarkers for early detection and poor prognosis. The gene's low expression is linked to poor overall survival and cancer-specific survival in CRC patients. TMEM240's role in CRC is further supported by its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and repress cell proliferation (Chang2020Hypermethylation).

## Interactions
TMEM240 is a transmembrane protein that participates in specific interactions within neural cells. It is known to interact with emerin (EMD), a protein involved in nuclear envelope structure and function. This interaction is crucial for the formation of a novel subcellular structure termed the T240-Body, which is located within the cytoplasm. The formation of T240-Bodies is dependent on the presence of TMEM240's transmembrane segments, but not on its C-terminal non-transmembrane fragment (Hu2020Neuralspecific).

TMEM240 also shows partial colocalization with PXMP2, a peroxisome marker, suggesting a potential functional relationship with peroxisomal components. However, TMEM240 does not localize to peroxisomes themselves, indicating that its interactions may involve other intracellular structures or components (Hu2020Neuralspecific). The T240-Body, where TMEM240 is localized, contains both peroxisome and mitochondrial components, hinting at a complex interaction network within these organelles (Hu2020Neuralspecific).

These interactions suggest that TMEM240 may play a role in neuronal maturation and intracellular signaling pathways, although the precise mechanisms and additional interacting partners remain to be fully elucidated.
