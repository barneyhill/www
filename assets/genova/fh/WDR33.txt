# WDR33

## Overview
WDR33 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 33 protein, a critical component of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex involved in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. The protein is characterized by its WD40 repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and it plays a pivotal role in recognizing the polyadenylation signal (PAS) sequence AAUAAA, essential for mRNA maturation (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Clerici2017Structural). WDR33 forms a heterodimer with CPSF160, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the CPSF complex, which is necessary for the polyadenylation and stability of mRNA (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Clerici2017Structural). The protein's activity is crucial for cellular growth and differentiation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Sun2017Molecular; Li2024A).

## Structure
WDR33 is a protein characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller domain, which spans residues T108 to T403. This domain is formed by WD40 repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Clerici2017Structural). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of WDR33, consisting of residues R54 to T107, features a unique fold with an N-terminal alpha-helix and is supported by a short loop extending from the last beta-strand of the WD40 propeller. This NTD is completely buried within the cavity formed by the beta-propeller domains of CPSF160, with specific loops of CPSF160 locking it in place (Clerici2017Structural).

WDR33 forms a heterodimer with CPSF160, which acts as a structural scaffold within the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex. This interaction is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, resulting in a significant buried surface area (Clerici2017Structural). The N-terminal region of WDR33 is crucial for recognizing the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, with specific lysine and arginine residues playing a key role in RNA binding (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Clerici2017Structural).

## Function
WDR33 is a crucial component of the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA in human cells. This protein plays a significant role in recognizing the polyadenylation signal (PAS), specifically the AAUAAA hexamer, which is vital for defining the site of RNA cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation. WDR33, along with CPSF30, directly binds to the AAUAAA sequence, facilitating the proper maturation of mRNA precursors (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Chan2014CPSF30).

The protein contains WD40 repeats, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions and potentially RNA interactions, contributing to its function in mRNA processing (Schönemann2014Reconstitution; Chan2014CPSF30). WDR33 is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in the assembly of the CPSF complex, necessary for polyadenylation activity. The presence of WDR33 is critical for the CPSF complex to bind substrate RNA and trigger polyadenylation, as complexes lacking WDR33 are inactive (Schönemann2014Reconstitution).

The proper functioning of WDR33 in mRNA processing is essential for mRNA stability and translation efficiency, impacting cellular growth and differentiation (Sun2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
WDR33 is implicated in several diseases and conditions through its role in mRNA processing. Alterations in WDR33 expression have been associated with various cancers. A pan-cancer analysis revealed that WDR33, along with other pre-mRNA 3′ end processing factors, shows reduced expression in cancer cell lines and is negatively associated with several malignancies (Li2024A). This suggests that WDR33 may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in cancer (Li2024A).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, WDR33 has been linked to Huntington's disease (HD). Changes in mRNA 3′-untranslated region isoforms, a feature of HD pathology, suggest a potential link between WDR33 and HD-related molecular changes (Nahalka2019The). Additionally, WDR33 is involved in the regulation of SMN protein levels, which is relevant to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Knocking down WDR33 increases SMN expression, indicating its role in SMN mRNA export to the cytoplasm, which could be beneficial for SMA treatment (McCormack2021A).

While WDR33 is crucial for mRNA processing, its specific role in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) in neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear (Patel2019Alternative).

## Interactions
WDR33 is a key component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for mRNA 3'-end processing. It interacts directly with the polyadenylation signal (PAS) motif AAUAAA in pre-mRNA, playing a crucial role in recognizing and binding this sequence. WDR33 forms a stable heterodimer with CPSF160, which acts as a platform for recruiting other CPSF components such as CPSF30 and Fip1 (Kumar2019Mechanistic; Clerici2017Structural). 

The N-terminal region of WDR33, characterized by a lysine/arginine-rich motif, is critical for its interaction with the AAUAAA motif. This region forms extensive contacts with CPSF30, particularly with its ZF2 and ZF3 domains, facilitating specific recognition of the PAS (Chan2014CPSF30; Clerici2017Structural). 

WDR33's interaction with CPSF160 is stabilized by numerous hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, with a significant buried surface area, indicating a strong and specific interaction (Clerici2017Structural). Additionally, WDR33 has been shown to bind near the AAUAAA signal in vivo, with high specificity, as demonstrated by PAR-CLIP studies (Schönemann2014Reconstitution). These interactions underscore WDR33's essential role in the assembly and function of the CPSF complex.
