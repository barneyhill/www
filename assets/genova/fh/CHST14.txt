# CHST14

## Overview
The CHST14 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14, also known as dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST1), which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), a key component of the extracellular matrix. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is responsible for the transfer of sulfate groups to specific positions on N-acetylgalactosamine residues within DS chains, thereby influencing the structural integrity and function of connective tissues (Miyake2010Lossoffunction; Kosho2016CHST14D4ST1). The activity of D4ST1 is essential for the proper assembly and organization of collagen fibrils, impacting cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Dündar2009Loss). Mutations in CHST14 are linked to several connective tissue disorders, underscoring the gene's clinical significance in maintaining tissue integrity and function (Hirose2020Systematic; Shimizu2011Delineation).

## Function
The CHST14 gene encodes the enzyme carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14, also known as dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST1), which is crucial for the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sulfate groups to the 4-position of N-acetylgalactosamine residues in DS chains, a process essential for the proper formation and function of DS in the extracellular matrix (Miyake2010Lossoffunction; Kosho2016CHST14D4ST1). 

In healthy human cells, D4ST1 is responsible for the sulfation of DS chains in proteoglycans like decorin, which interact with collagen fibrils to maintain the structural integrity and function of connective tissues (Kosho2016CHST14D4ST1). This interaction is vital for the assembly and organization of collagen fibrils, influencing processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Dündar2009Loss). The enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it ensures the presence of DS in the glycosaminoglycan chains, which is crucial for maintaining the flexibility and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (Miyake2010Lossoffunction). 

CHST14 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in connective tissues, heart, liver, pancreas, and placenta, highlighting its importance in various biological processes and tissue repair (Dündar2009Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHST14 gene, which encodes dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1), are associated with several connective tissue disorders. These include musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mcEDS-CHST14), adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome (ATCS), and a variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome known as EDS Kosho Type (EDSKT) (Hirose2020Systematic; Shimizu2011Delineation). These conditions are characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and craniofacial abnormalities, along with other multisystem fragility-related manifestations such as large subcutaneous hematomas and visceral ruptures (Hirose2020Systematic; Mendoza‐Londono2012Extracellular).

The pathophysiology of these disorders is linked to the impaired biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), resulting in its replacement by chondroitin sulfate (CS) in the extracellular matrix. This alteration affects the assembly of collagen fibrils, leading to tissue fragility (Kosho2016CHST14D4ST1; Hirose2019Structural). The deficiency in DS is due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CHST14, which lead to a marked reduction in D4ST1 activity (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological). These genetic mutations are autosomal recessive and have been identified in diverse populations, including Japanese, Turkish, Indian, and Afghani individuals (Mendoza‐Londono2012Extracellular).
