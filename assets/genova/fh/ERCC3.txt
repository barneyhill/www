# ERCC3

## Overview
The ERCC3 gene encodes a protein that is a vital component of the TFIIH complex, known as the ERCC excision repair 3, TFIIH core complex helicase subunit. This protein functions primarily as a DNA helicase, playing a crucial role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation. The helicase activity of the ERCC3 protein is essential for unwinding DNA strands, facilitating the repair of DNA damage, and enabling transcription by RNA polymerase II. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function. Mutations in the ERCC3 gene can lead to various genetic disorders, including Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Cockayne Syndrome, and Trichothiodystrophy, as well as an increased risk of certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Calmels2016Uncommon; Ma1994Mutational; Weeda1990Molecular).

## Structure
The ERCC3 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the TFIIH complex, playing a crucial role in DNA repair and transcription initiation. The ERCC3 protein is presumed to have helicase activity, with seven conserved helicase domains essential for its function. These domains are involved in ATP binding and DNA unwinding, which are critical for its role in nucleotide excision repair (Ma1994Mutational). The protein's helicase domains are highly conserved, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Ma1994Mutational).

The primary structure of ERCC3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a core region with these helicase domains, as well as N and C termini. The N-terminal extension contains a putative nuclear location signal (NLS) and a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (Ma1994Mutational). The C-terminal region is also significant, as deletion of the last exon abolishes repair activity, suggesting a functional boundary within this region (Ma1994Mutational).

The ERCC3 protein is known to have a 3'-to-5' DNA helicase activity and may have complementary roles with ERCC2 (Ma1994Mutational). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ERCC3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the TFIIH complex, which plays a vital role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation in healthy human cells. This protein functions as a DNA helicase, unwinding DNA strands to facilitate the repair of DNA damage and transcription by RNA polymerase II (Ma1994Mutational; Weeda1990Molecular). The ERCC3 protein is involved in the excision repair pathway, specifically correcting UV-induced DNA damage, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Weeda1990Molecular).

ERCC3 is active in the nucleus, where it helps maintain genomic stability and proper gene expression, contributing to cellular health and organismal development (Ma1994Mutational). The protein contains conserved helicase domains essential for its function in NER, and mutations in these domains impair its ability to complement UV sensitivity, indicating their importance for its repair function (Ma1994Mutational). The ERCC3 gene's product is also involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II, as evidenced by its identification as a component of the basal transcriptional initiation machinery (Ma1994Mutational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC3 gene, also known as XPB, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in nucleotide excision repair (NER). These mutations can lead to disorders such as Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne Syndrome (CS), and Trichothiodystrophy (TTD), which are characterized by increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light and various developmental and neurological abnormalities (Baer2020Early‐onset; Calmels2016Uncommon). 

The ERCC3 gene is also implicated in breast cancer risk. A specific truncating mutation, R109X, has been identified as conferring a moderate risk for breast cancer, particularly among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. This mutation is associated with a 1.53-fold increased risk for breast cancer overall and a 1.73-fold increased risk for the estrogen receptor-positive subtype (Vijai2016A). The R109X mutation leads to reduced DNA repair efficiency, contributing to cancer susceptibility (Vijai2016A).

In addition to cancer, ERCC3 mutations are linked to rare NER disorders. These include a range of phenotypes from severe XP/CS complex to milder forms of XP without CS, and TTD, with mutations often resulting in photosensitivity and developmental impairments (Calmels2016Uncommon).

## Interactions
The ERCC3 protein, also known as XPB, is a crucial component of the TFIIH complex, which is involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription initiation. ERCC3 functions as a DNA helicase, facilitating the unwinding of DNA necessary for these processes (Ma1994Mutational). It interacts with other components of the TFIIH complex, such as XPD, p44, and p62, and plays a role in the recruitment and stabilization of the transcription machinery (Ma1994Mutational).

ERCC3 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is disrupted by the Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein, which inhibits the formation of the p53-ERCC3 complex, potentially affecting transcription regulation (Qadri2002Hepatitis). The NS5A protein also interferes with the binding of p53 to DNA, further indicating its role in modulating transcription by affecting p53's interactions with ERCC3 (Qadri2002Hepatitis).

Additionally, ERCC3 is involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, where it interacts with other NER proteins to facilitate the repair of DNA lesions. This includes its role in opening the DNA strand around lesion sites, which is essential for the removal of DNA crosslinks and UV-induced damage (Khlifi2016Gene–environment).
