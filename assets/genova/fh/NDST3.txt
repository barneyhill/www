# NDST3

## Overview
NDST3 (N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a critical glycosaminoglycan in various biological processes. The protein, N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3, catalyzes the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate chains, contributing to their structural and functional diversity (Li2016Heparan; Aikawa1999Molecular). This enzyme is predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies heparan sulfate and heparin (Aikawa1999Molecular). NDST3 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with significant levels in the brain, liver, and kidney, indicating specialized roles in these organs (Aikawa1999Molecular). In the brain, its abundance in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum suggests a potential link to neural processes and psychiatric disorders (Zhang2016A). The gene has been associated with psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, although findings vary across different populations (Wang2017Association; Lencz2013Genomewide).

## Function
NDST3 (N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan involved in various biological processes. NDST3 catalyzes the N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine residues in heparan sulfate chains, which are essential modifications for the structural and functional diversity of these chains (Li2016Heparan; Aikawa1999Molecular). This enzyme is a type II transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the modification of heparan sulfate and heparin (Aikawa1999Molecular).

NDST3 exhibits both N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities, although its deacetylation activity is higher compared to its sulfotransferase activity, which influences the pattern of N-sulfation in heparan sulfate (Krenn2008Glycanogenomics:). The expression of NDST3 is tissue-specific, with high levels found in the brain, liver, and kidney, suggesting a specialized function in these tissues (Aikawa1999Molecular). In the brain, NDST3 is particularly abundant in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum, which are associated with neural processes and may be linked to psychiatric disorders (Zhang2016A).

## Clinical Significance
The NDST3 gene has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11098403, associated with the expression of NDST3, suggesting a regulatory relationship that may influence the pathophysiology of these conditions (Lencz2013Genomewide). This SNP is located near NDST3 and has been linked to increased expression levels of the gene in individuals carrying the risk allele, which remains significant even in control groups, indicating that it is not merely an artifact of psychiatric status or medication (Lencz2013Genomewide).

In the Han Chinese population, however, studies have not found a significant association between NDST3 polymorphisms and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, suggesting potential ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility (Wang2017Association). Despite these findings, NDST3 remains a gene of interest due to its role in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, which is crucial for neural development and signaling pathways that may be disrupted in psychiatric disorders (Wang2017Association). The lack of significant findings in some populations highlights the complexity of genetic contributions to mental health conditions and the need for further research across diverse groups.
