# CEMIP2

## Overview
CEMIP2, or cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the degradation of hyaluronic acid, a key component of the extracellular matrix. This protein plays a significant role in the catabolism of hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan, processes essential for cellular function and tissue homeostasis (Desale2022Epigenetic). The CEMIP2 protein specifically cleaves high molecular weight hyaluronan into intermediate fragments, facilitating its transport into the lymphatic system for further degradation (Becker2021Transcriptome). Unlike other hyaluronidases, CEMIP2 does not cleave dermatan or chondroitin sulfate, underscoring its specificity in hyaluronan degradation (Becker2021Transcriptome). The gene and its encoded protein are implicated in various physiological processes, including tissue remodeling and wound healing, and have been associated with certain clinical conditions, such as insulin-dependent diabetes in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Caulfield2023Germline).

## Function
CEMIP2, also known as cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the degradation of hyaluronic acid, a significant component of the extracellular matrix. This protein plays a crucial role in the hyaluronan catabolic process and glycosaminoglycan degradation, which are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis (Desale2022Epigenetic). CEMIP2 exhibits hyalurononglucosaminidase activity, facilitating the breakdown of hyaluronan, thereby contributing to cellular waste processing and recycling, which are vital for cell health and function (Desale2022Epigenetic).

In healthy human cells, CEMIP2 acts as a transmembrane protein on the cell surface, specifically cleaving high molecular weight hyaluronan into intermediate fragments. This process aids in the transcellular transport of hyaluronan into the lymphatic system for further degradation in lymph nodes and the liver (Becker2021Transcriptome). CEMIP2 interacts with CD44/LYVE1 on lymphatic endothelial cells to enhance this function. Unlike other hyaluronidases, CEMIP2 does not cleave dermatan or chondroitin sulfate, highlighting its specificity in hyaluronan degradation (Becker2021Transcriptome). This activity is crucial for tissue remodeling, wound healing, and maintaining the structural integrity of tissues.

## Clinical Significance
CEMIP2, also known as cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 2, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration. In cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, germline mutations in CEMIP2 have been associated with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes (ICI-DM). The prevalence of these mutations is significantly higher in ICI-DM patients compared to the general population, suggesting a potential link between CEMIP2 mutations and this condition (Caulfield2023Germline).

In the context of osteoarthritis (OA), CEMIP2 is involved in hyaluronic acid (HA) depolymerization. However, its expression was not detected in OA chondrocytes and synovial cells, indicating that CEMIP2 may not play a significant role in the initiation or development of OA (Ohtsuki2020Induction).

CEMIP2 is also upregulated in hypoxic lymphatic endothelial cells, where it facilitates the transcellular transport of HA. This function is crucial for HA turnover and may have implications in conditions involving extracellular matrix dynamics, although specific diseases linked to CEMIP2 expression changes were not directly mentioned (Becker2021Transcriptome).

## Interactions
CEMIP2, also known as cell migration inducing hyaluronidase 2, is involved in various interactions within cellular environments. In the context of the polycystin complex (PCC) in human urinary exosome-like vesicles (ELVs), CEMIP2, referred to as CEMIPS_TMEM2, is part of a large complex similar to the PC1/PC2 complex. It does not undergo proteolytic processing and exhibits mature N-linked glycosylation. CEMIP2 is present in a complex that is indistinguishable from the PC1/PC2 complex on native gels but can be released using mild SDS treatment, suggesting it may have peripheral and low-affinity interactions with the PCC (Lea2020Analysis). 

CEMIP2 is also described as an active neutral pH hyaluronidase, and its enzymatic activity may be regulated by the PCC, indicating a potential role in modulating the function of the complex (Lea2020Analysis). However, specific details on the physical interactions of CEMIP2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available context. The interactions of CEMIP2 appear to be primarily associated with its role in the PCC and its enzymatic activity within the exosome-like vesicles (Lea2020Analysis).
