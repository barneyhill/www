# PC

## Overview
The PC gene encodes the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, a biotin-dependent carboxylase that plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism. Pyruvate carboxylase is categorized as a carboxylase enzyme and is essential for catalyzing the ATP-dependent conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, a critical step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and gluconeogenesis (JITRAPAKDEE1999Structure; Wallace1998Pyruvate). This enzyme is predominantly located in the mitochondrial matrix and functions as a tetramer, with each subunit comprising distinct domains responsible for its catalytic activity (LaoOn2018Roles). The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is intricately regulated by acetyl-CoA, which serves as an allosteric activator, and is influenced by various physiological conditions, including nutritional and hormonal signals (JITRAPAKDEE1999Structure; Jitrapakdee2008Structure). Mutations in the PC gene can lead to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, a metabolic disorder with significant clinical implications (Doğulu2021Pyruvate).

## Structure
Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in metabolic processes. The enzyme is composed of several domains, including the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, carboxyltransferase (CT) domain, and biotin-carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain. The BC domain catalyzes the carboxylation of biotin, which is linked to the BCCP, while the CT domain transfers the activated carboxyl group to pyruvate, producing oxaloacetate (Xiang2008Crystal).

The quaternary structure of PC is a tetramer, organized as a dimer of dimers, with the CT domain forming dimers through its TIM barrel fold. The tetramerization is mediated by a novel PCGroup tetramerization (PT) domain, which is crucial for oligomerization (Xiang2008Crystal). The PT domain consists of 92 residues and forms a dimer of dimers, with Phe1077 and Leu1084 contributing significantly to the interface (Xiang2008Crystal).

The BCCP domain is centrally located and participates in intermolecular carboxyl group transfer between active sites on opposing polypeptide chains, essential for catalytic activity (Jitrapakdee2008Structure). The enzyme's activity is modulated by various metabolites, and it is active only in its tetrameric form (Xiang2008Crystal).

## Function
Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in several metabolic pathways in healthy human cells. It catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate, a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle (JITRAPAKDEE1999Structure; Wallace1998Pyruvate). This reaction is essential for gluconeogenesis, the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates, which is particularly important in the liver and kidney during fasting (Jitrapakdee2006Anaplerotic; Jitrapakdee2008Structure).

PC is also involved in lipogenesis, where it provides oxaloacetate for the synthesis of fatty acids and other lipids in adipose tissue (JITRAPAKDEE1999Structure; Jitrapakdee2008Structure). In the brain, PC supports the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by replenishing TCA cycle intermediates (Jitrapakdee2006Anaplerotic; LaoOn2018Roles).

The enzyme is located in the mitochondrial matrix and functions as a tetramer, with each subunit containing domains for biotin carboxylation and carboxyltransferase (LaoOn2018Roles). PC activity is regulated by acetyl-CoA, which acts as an allosteric activator, and is influenced by various physiological conditions, including nutritional status and hormonal signals (JITRAPAKDEE1999Structure; Jitrapakdee2008Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PC gene, which encodes the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, lead to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PCD), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. PCD is characterized by lactic acidosis, developmental delay, and neurological issues due to impaired pyruvate metabolism. The disorder manifests in three clinical forms: Type A (infantile), Type B (neonatal), and Type C (benign) (Coci2019Pyruvate; Doğulu2021Pyruvate). Type A typically presents with developmental delay and lactic acidemia, leading to early childhood death, while Type B is associated with severe neonatal lactic acidosis and metabolic disturbances, often resulting in death within months. Type C is less severe, with episodic metabolic acidosis and generally normal neurological development (Mhanni2021Prenatal; Coci2019Pyruvate).

The genotype-phenotype correlation in PCD is complex, with Type B often linked to homozygous stop-codon mutations, while Types A and C can result from biallelic heterozygous variants (Coci2019Pyruvate). Despite the enzyme's biotin dependence, patients with PC deficiency do not respond to biotin treatment, indicating that the mutations interfere with biotin metabolism (Monnot2009Structural). Altered PC expression is also associated with conditions such as diabetes and cancer, although these associations are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. It interacts with acetyl-CoA, which acts as an allosteric activator, enhancing the enzyme's catalytic activity by increasing the rate of biotin carboxylation and stabilizing its tetrameric structure (Lietzan2011Interaction; Jitrapakdee2008Structure). The binding of acetyl-CoA induces conformational changes that facilitate the transfer of the carboxyl group from biotin to pyruvate, a key step in the enzyme's function (Jitrapakdee2008Structure).

PC also forms part of multiprotein complexes in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis pathways, interacting with enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and malate dehydrogenase. These interactions are essential for the conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate and the subsequent steps in glucose synthesis (Jitrapakdee2008Structure). In pancreatic islets, PC interacts with the malic enzyme and participates in pyruvate cycling, which is crucial for glucose-induced insulin secretion (Jitrapakdee2008Structure). These interactions highlight the enzyme's role in maintaining metabolic balance and its regulation by acetyl-CoA and other metabolic intermediates.
