# C22orf31

## Overview
C22orf31 is a gene located on chromosome 22 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 22 open reading frame 31. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely undefined (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Despite the limited understanding of its precise role, C22orf31 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, particularly in kidney diseases and certain cancers. Research indicates that alterations in the expression of C22orf31 may influence disease progression and serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and testicular germ cell tumors (Acoba2024Kidney; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further studies are needed to elucidate the functional characteristics of the C22orf31 protein and its involvement in these diseases.

## Clinical Significance
C22orf31 has been implicated in several kidney-related conditions and cancers. In kidney diseases, C22orf31 is downregulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), lupus nephritis (LN), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Specifically, lower expression levels are observed in the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium of CKD patients compared to healthy controls. This downregulation is associated with decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), suggesting a potential role in CKD pathogenesis (Acoba2024Kidney).

In cancer, C22orf31 has been studied for its prognostic significance. In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), low expression levels of C22orf31 correlate with better disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, a genetic variant in C22orf31, specifically the R18Q variant, has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in a Han Chinese population, although detailed clinical information on this variant is limited (Lin2017TEX15:).

These findings highlight the importance of C22orf31 in both kidney diseases and certain cancers, suggesting that alterations in its expression or genetic mutations may contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression.
