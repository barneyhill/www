# DIRAS2

## Overview
DIRAS2 is a gene that encodes the DIRAS family GTPase 2, a small GTPase belonging to the Ras superfamily, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by DIRAS2 is characterized by its low intrinsic GTPase activity and is predominantly found in a GTP-bound state, distinguishing it from other RAS family members. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating signal transduction pathways, including the inhibition of the AKT1-MTOR and RAS-MAPK pathways, which are vital for cell growth and survival. DIRAS2 is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with cognitive functions, and has been implicated in various cellular processes such as autophagy and tumor suppression. Its interactions with other proteins, such as PSMD2, further influence its stability and function, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Grünewald2016Functional; Sutton2018RASrelated; Ying2022Diverse).

## Structure
DIRAS2 is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, characterized by its involvement in intracellular signaling. The protein shares 30-40% amino acid homology with other RAS family members and contains five highly conserved domains (G1-G5) that facilitate GTP binding and hydrolysis (Li2018The). DIRAS2 features a putative effector domain for interacting with downstream RAF proteins and a membrane-localizing CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus, which is crucial for its membrane association (Li2018The; Ying2022Diverse).

DIRAS2 predominantly exists in a GTP-bound form due to its low GTPase activity, which distinguishes it from other RAS family members that actively stimulate MAPK and C-RAF kinase activity (Li2018The). The protein's structure includes characteristic substitutions at conserved regions, such as Thr-63 and Ser-65, which differ from the corresponding residues in H-RAS (Li2018The).

The crystal structure of DIRAS2 has been used as a template for studying related proteins, indicating its well-defined tertiary structure (Sutton2019DIRAS3Derived). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of DIRAS2 are not extensively documented in the available literature. DIRAS2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The DIRAS2 gene encodes a small GTPase that is part of the Ras superfamily, which is involved in regulating various cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation. DIRAS2 is almost uniquely expressed in the brain, with the highest expression levels found in the cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal and temporal lobes, and cerebellum. These regions are associated with cognitive processes and behaviors, including impulsive decision-making, which are relevant to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Grünewald2016Functional).

In terms of molecular function, DIRAS2 is involved in modulating signal transduction pathways. It has been shown to inhibit the AKT1-MTOR and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth and survival. This inhibition leads to the nuclear localization of transcription factors such as FOXO3 and TFEB, which upregulate autophagy-related genes, indicating a role in autophagy and potentially in tumor suppression (Sutton2018RASrelated).

Despite its involvement in these pathways, the exact functions of DIRAS2 in healthy human cells remain largely unknown. Its role in the brain suggests it may influence neuronal development and function, but further research is needed to elucidate its specific molecular activities (Grünewald2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
DIRAS2 is implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and interactions play significant roles. In skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), DIRAS2 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, such as B cells and T cells, which are linked to improved survival rates. Low DIRAS2 expression is associated with worse prognoses, and its knockdown enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis by activating the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway (Xue2022DIRAS2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), DIRAS2 is downregulated and associated with poor outcomes. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest. DIRAS2's interaction with PSMD2 facilitates its degradation, further impacting its tumor-suppressive functions (Ying2022Diverse).

In gliomas, DIRAS2 is often epigenetically inactivated, contributing to chemo-resistance. Re-expression of DIRAS2 increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting its role in overcoming drug resistance (RothhammerHampl2021Frequent).

DIRAS2 is also downregulated in ovarian cancer, where its re-expression can suppress cancer cell growth by inducing autophagy-mediated cell death, highlighting its potential tumor-suppressive role (Sutton2018RASrelated).

## Interactions
DIRAS2, a member of the DIRAS family of GTPases, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function as a tumor suppressor. One significant interaction is with PSMD2, a subunit of the 26S proteasome. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of DIRAS2 stability through a proteasome-mediated mechanism. Experiments using FLAG-tagged protein enrichment assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence staining have demonstrated that DIRAS2 and PSMD2 co-localize in the cytoplasm of RKO and HEK293 cells. Overexpression of PSMD2 leads to decreased DIRAS2 protein levels, indicating that PSMD2 acts as an upstream regulatory gene, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of DIRAS2 (Ying2022Diverse).

DIRAS2 also plays a role in autophagy and autophagic cell death in ovarian cancer cells. It inhibits the PI3K-AKT1 and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways, leading to the upregulation of autophagy-related genes through transcription-dependent mechanisms. This regulation involves modulating the nuclear localization of transcription factors such as FOXO3 and TFEB, which are key regulators of autophagy-related transcription (Sutton2018RASrelated). These interactions highlight DIRAS2's involvement in critical cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
