# MORF4L1

## Overview
MORF4L1 is a gene that encodes the protein mortality factor 4 like 1, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, contributing to the modification of chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression. MORF4L1 is characterized by the presence of a chromodomain, which is involved in recognizing methylated lysine residues on histones, thereby influencing transcriptional silencing and chromatin dynamics. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and cellular senescence, and acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the expression of genes such as p21 and E-cadherin. MORF4L1's interactions with other proteins, such as BRCA2 and RAD51, underscore its role in maintaining genomic stability. Additionally, MORF4L1 is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, including alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, which affect its function and stability (PorrasYakushi2021Indepth; Sang2018MORF4L1; Boije2013Alternative).

## Structure
MORF4L1, a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation, contains several structural motifs that contribute to its function. The protein includes a chromodomain, which is part of the Royal family of protein domains. Chromodomains are known for recognizing methylated lysine residues on histones, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcriptional silencing (Yap2011Structure). The chromodomain in MORF4L1 is capable of binding methylated histone H3 at lysine 36, which is significant for its role in transcriptional regulation (Boije2013Alternative).

MORF4L1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms: a short isoform with an intact chromodomain and a long isoform with a 21 amino acid insertion near the chromodomain. This insertion may disrupt the chromodomain's structure or affect its binding capacity (Boije2013Alternative). The short isoform is highly conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Boije2013Alternative).

Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation, also play a role in regulating MORF4L1. Specific ubiquitylation sites, including K104 and K187, are involved in transcriptional control and protein stability (PorrasYakushi2021Indepth). These modifications suggest a complex regulation of MORF4L1's activity and stability within the cell.

## Function
MORF4L1, also known as mortality factor 4 like 1, is a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. It is part of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, which modifies chromatin structure to regulate gene expression (Sang2018MORF4L1). MORF4L1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and cellular senescence. It interacts with proteins such as BRCA2, RAD51, and replication protein A1, facilitating the homology-directed repair of chromosomal breaks (Sang2018MORF4L1).

In healthy human cells, MORF4L1 is involved in transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation. It acts as a tumor suppressor by increasing the levels of p21 and E-cadherin, which are crucial for inhibiting cell proliferation and maintaining cellular integrity (PorrasYakushi2021Indepth). The protein is also regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system, with its ubiquitylation decreasing upon proteasome inhibition, leading to increased protein stability and abundance (PorrasYakushi2021Indepth).

MORF4L1's role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation is essential for embryonic development and cellular differentiation, as evidenced by its involvement in the developing chicken retina, where it regulates cell proliferation and differentiation (Boije2013Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MORF4L1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), breast, colon, and lung cancers. In NPC, MORF4L1 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This downregulation is partly due to promoter hypermethylation, a common epigenetic modification in cancer cells. The ectopic expression of MORF4L1 in NPC cell lines has been shown to inhibit these malignant processes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Sang2018MORF4L1).

In breast cancer, MORF4L1 interacts with PALB2, a protein involved in DNA damage repair, indicating a potential role in maintaining genomic stability. However, no significant pathogenic mutations in MORF4L1 have been directly linked to increased breast cancer risk, although its involvement in the FA/BrCa pathway suggests it may contribute to cancer susceptibility in certain genetic contexts (Martrat2011Exploring).

In pneumonia, MORF4L1 expression is upregulated, leading to epithelial cell death. This process is exacerbated by bacterial infections, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which stabilize MORF4L1 through acetylation, preventing its degradation. Targeting MORF4L1 with specific inhibitors like argatroban has shown potential in reducing cell death and improving survival in mouse models of pneumonia (Zou2015Mortality).

## Interactions
MORF4L1, also known as mortality factor 4 like 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. MORF4L1 primarily forms homodimers, a process enhanced by the deacetylation of Lys-148 by histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). This homodimerization is essential for MORF4L1's role in repressing cellular proliferation and forming a corepressor complex with proteins such as PF1 and Sin3A (Chen2014Histone).

MORF4L1 interacts with several other proteins, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Pam14, histone acetyltransferase hMOF, Sin3A, and TLE. These interactions allow MORF4L1 to participate in transcriptional activation and repression (Chen2014Histone). The protein also interacts with the SCF E3 ligase component Fbxl18, which mediates its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is specific and involves the formation of a complex with Skp1 and Cullin1, leading to MORF4L1 ubiquitination (Zou2015Mortality).

MORF4L1 is part of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, where it plays a role in histone acetylation, a process inhibited by the thrombin inhibitor argatroban, which acts as a MORF4L1 antagonist (Zou2015Mortality).
