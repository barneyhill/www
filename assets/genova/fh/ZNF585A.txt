# ZNF585A

## Overview
ZNF585A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 585A, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. The ZNF585A protein is implicated in several biological functions, including transcriptional regulation, and has been associated with various pathological conditions. Its expression and methylation status have been studied in the context of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as in fetal brain development, indicating its potential role in disease progression and therapeutic response (Iwabu2019FGF5; Venhoranta2013Fetal; Jin2019Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF585A has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its altered expression and potential role in disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZNF585A is significantly up-regulated and associated with poorer overall survival. This suggests that ZNF585A may contribute to the progression of HCC and could serve as a marker for poor prognosis (Jin2019Comprehensive). 

In the context of fetal brain development in cattle, ZNF585A expression is significantly downregulated in cases of MIMT1 deletion, which is linked to fetal growth restriction. This downregulation may affect transcriptional regulation processes in the brain, although the specific clinical significance in neural development remains unclear (Venhoranta2013Fetal).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ZNF585A has been identified as having different methylation levels between responders and non-responders to definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). This suggests that ZNF585A methylation status could potentially be used to predict patient response to treatment, highlighting its clinical significance in personalizing ESCC therapy (Iwabu2019FGF5).
