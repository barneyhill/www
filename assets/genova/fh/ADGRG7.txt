# ADGRG7

## Overview
ADGRG7 is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G7, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family. This receptor is distinguished by its atypical structure, featuring eight transmembrane helices, which includes an additional N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, setting it apart from the typical seven-helix configuration of most GPCRs (Kuhn2024The). The ADGRG7 protein undergoes autoproteolysis at the GPS site, resulting in a membrane-anchored N-terminal fragment and a GPCR-like C-terminal fragment, a process crucial for its activation (Kuhn2024The). The gene exhibits multiple transcript variants, suggesting diverse functional roles in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and communication (Kuhn2024The). While the specific physiological functions of ADGRG7 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural characteristics and expression patterns imply a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and potentially in developmental processes (Kuhn2024The).

## Structure
The ADGRG7 protein, also known as GPR128, is a unique member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family, characterized by its atypical structure featuring eight transmembrane helices instead of the usual seven. This includes an additional N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, resulting in both the N and C termini being located intracellularly (Kuhn2024The). The protein undergoes autoproteolysis at the GPS (G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site), which cleaves it into a membrane-anchored N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a GPCR-like C-terminal fragment (CTF). This cleavage is crucial for the activation mechanism of aGPCRs, potentially exposing the Stachel sequence from the GAIN domain for binding and activation (Kuhn2024The).

The ADGRG7 gene has seven transcript variants, with variant 4 being the most abundant. Variants 2, 3, and 4 include an additional transmembrane helix at the N terminus, while a signal peptide is predicted only in variants 1 and 6 (Kuhn2024The). The structure of ADGRG7 was predicted using AlphaFold, confirming the presence of the additional transmembrane helix and suggesting a transmembrane bundle of eight helices (Kuhn2024The). The protein's structure has been validated using domain prediction tools such as SMART, DeepTMHMM, MEMSAT3, and Phobius (Kuhn2024The).

## Function
ADGRG7, also known as GPR128, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) family, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and communication. The ADGRG7 protein is characterized by a unique structure that includes an additional N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, resulting in a total of eight transmembrane helices, which is atypical for GPCRs that usually have seven (Kuhn2024The). This structural feature suggests a potential role in mechanosensory functions, possibly involving the cleavage at the GPS (G protein-coupled receptor proteolysis site) to produce a membrane-anchored N-terminal fragment and a GPCR-like C-terminal fragment (Kuhn2024The).

The ADGRG7 gene exhibits multiple transcript variants, with some isoforms containing an additional transmembrane helix and others having a signal peptide, indicating diverse functional roles (Kuhn2024The). The intracellular localization of the N- and C-termini of ADGRG7 has been experimentally validated, suggesting its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways (Kuhn2024The). While the specific functions of ADGRG7 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its structural features and expression patterns imply a role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and possibly in developmental processes (Kuhn2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The ADGRG7 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its mutations and altered expression levels. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), genomic and transcriptional alterations in ADGRG7 are prevalent, with 95.1% of patients exhibiting such changes. The study by Yang et al. identified that two patients had fusions in the ADGRG7 gene, highlighting its potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Yang2018Characterization). However, specific survival outcomes related to ADGRG7 expression in AML could not be assessed due to the lack of expression data (Yang2018Characterization).

In the context of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), the TFG::ADGRG7 gene fusion was identified in a primary pancreatic tumor, suggesting a role in ACTH production associated with ectopic Cushing syndrome. This fusion was mutually exclusive with other common mutations in neuroendocrine tumors, indicating a distinct genetic pathway (Agaimy2023Gene).

The structural uniqueness of ADGRG7, including its additional transmembrane helix, may influence its function and interaction with cellular pathways, potentially contributing to disease mechanisms (Kuhn2024The). However, specific diseases directly linked to ADGRG7 mutations or expression changes are not detailed in the available literature.
