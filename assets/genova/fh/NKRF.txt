# NKRF

## Overview
The NKRF gene encodes the NF-κB repressing factor, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and ribosome biogenesis. As a transcriptional repressor, the NF-κB repressing factor is involved in modulating NF-κB-driven gene expression, particularly under conditions of inflammation and cancer. It achieves this by interacting with transcription elongation factors and inhibiting transcription elongation at promoter-proximal sites, thereby reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes (Rother2015NF‐κB‐repressing). Additionally, the protein is integral to ribosomal RNA processing and nucleolar homeostasis, interacting with RNA helicases and exonucleases to facilitate the maturation of ribosomal RNAs (Memet2017The). The NKRF gene's expression and function are implicated in various diseases, including cancers, where its dysregulation can influence disease progression and response to treatment (Chen2019Homoharringtonine; Lu2023Mechanism).

## Structure
The NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (DSRMs), a glycine-rich G-patch domain, and an R3H domain, which are involved in RNA binding and interactions with RNA helicases (Chen2019Homoharringtonine; Memet2017The). The G-patch domain specifically mediates interactions with RNA helicases like DHX15, facilitating its role in ribosome biogenesis (Memet2017The). 

The protein also includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a DNA binding domain (DBD), which are essential for its nuclear and nucleolar localization (Niedick2004Nucleolar). The nucleolar localization is primarily attributed to sequences between amino acids 361 and 550, with specific regions contributing to its binding to nucleolar structures (Niedick2004Nucleolar).

NKRF undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function, although its nucleolar localization is not dependent on phosphorylation (Niedick2004Nucleolar). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have varied structural and functional properties (Niedick2004Nucleolar).

## Function
The NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) is a multifunctional protein involved in transcriptional regulation and ribosome biogenesis in human cells. NKRF plays a critical role in repressing NF-κB-driven transcription by interacting with transcription elongation factors such as NELF-E and XRN2. This interaction inhibits transcription elongation at promoter-proximal sites in unstimulated cells, thereby reducing basal transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes (Rother2015NF‐κB‐repressing).

NKRF is also involved in ribosomal RNA processing and nucleolar homeostasis. It interacts with the RNA helicase DHX15 and the exonuclease XRN2, forming a complex essential for the maturation of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and the assembly of ribosomal proteins. NKRF facilitates the recruitment of XRN2 to nucleolar pre-ribosomal complexes, which is crucial for pre-rRNA processing and the turnover of excised pre-rRNA spacer fragments (Memet2017The).

In the nucleolus, NKRF is predominantly localized and is involved in the processing of pre-rRNAs by enhancing the catalytic activity of DHX15, necessary for efficient cleavage at specific sites within the pre-rRNA transcript (Memet2017The). This function is vital for maintaining cellular protein synthesis and is linked to various cellular processes, including inflammation and cancer (Coccia2017Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NKRF gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), NKRF acts as a repressor of NF-κB, which is constitutively activated in primitive AML cells. The drug homoharringtonine (HHT) can induce the translocation of NKRF, affecting its interaction with NF-κB components and the transcriptional activity of MYC, a gene associated with cell proliferation. This suggests that NKRF plays a role in the regulation of MYC in AML, and its alterations could influence the response to HHT treatment (Chen2019Homoharringtonine).

In lung cancer (LC) associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), NKRF expression is significantly decreased, potentially due to regulation by hsa-miR19-3p. This miRNA negatively regulates NKRF by binding to its 3'UTR, contributing to cancer progression through the NF-κB pathway. The presence of lncRNA ICL can inhibit this pathway by acting as a sponge for hsa-miR19-3p, suggesting a complex regulatory network involving NKRF in LC development in COPD patients (Lu2023Mechanism).

In gastric cancer, miRNA-301a-3p targets NKRF, leading to enhanced NF-κB signaling and tumor progression. This interaction highlights the role of NKRF in cancer progression through the modulation of NF-κB signaling pathways (Xu2020Upregulation).

## Interactions
The NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcription regulation and ribosome biogenesis. NKRF interacts with the transcription elongation factors NELF-E and XRN2, specifically through a domain within NKRF comprising amino acids 421-429. This interaction is crucial for regulating transcription elongation, and phosphorylation of NKRF in this region is essential for these interactions (Rother2015NF‐κB‐repressing).

NKRF also interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65, but not with other NF-κB family members like p50 or p52. This interaction is involved in the regulation of NF-κB-driven gene expression, particularly under conditions of inflammation and cancer (Rother2015NF‐κB‐repressing). NKRF's role extends to ribosome biogenesis, where it recruits the exonuclease XRN2 and the RNA helicase DHX15 to pre-ribosomal complexes in the nucleolus. These interactions are crucial for the processing and maturation of pre-rRNA (Memet2017The).

NKRF also acts as a cofactor for DHX15, enhancing its ATPase and helicase activities, which are necessary for efficient pre-rRNA processing (Memet2017The). During stress conditions, NKRF interacts with XRN2 to regulate its nucleolar localization, which is essential for rRNA processing and nucleolar homeostasis (Coccia2017Human).
