# VAT1L

## Overview
VAT1L is a gene that encodes the vesicle amine transport 1 like protein, which is a member of the NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase family. This protein is characterized by its dimeric structure, comprising two α/β domains, and is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. VAT1L interacts with several transcription factors and histone deacetylases, playing a significant role in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription, which may influence circadian rhythms and social-emotional processing (Yang2018Transcriptomic). The protein is also implicated in synaptic function, neurotransmitter release, and cellular stress responses, highlighting its multifaceted role in neuronal physiology (Shao2015Methylmercury; Acharya2020Dopamine‐induced). Clinically, VAT1L has been associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and ADHD, and is involved in the response to treatments for spinal muscular atrophy, underscoring its potential significance in disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions (Ma2019Identification; Garofalo2023Preliminary).

## Structure
The VAT1L protein, encoded by the human gene VAT1L, is a member of the NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase family. Its molecular structure is characterized by a dimeric form, with each protomer comprising two α/β domains, designated as Domain I and Domain II (Kim2021Structural). Domain I consists of 126 N-terminal residues and 37 C-terminal residues, while Domain II is formed by 187 residues (Kim2021Structural). The protein structure includes ten α-helices, five 3_10-helices, and sixteen β-strands, with a notable Rossmann fold in Domain II that facilitates NADPH binding (Kim2021Structural).

The VAT1L protein features a Switch segment between the β12 and β13 strands, which undergoes conformational changes upon NADP binding, affecting the dimer configuration (Kim2021Structural). The dimerization is mediated by a β-α-β motif in Domain II, involving the β13-α8-β14 segment, which forms a compact fold with a hydrophobic mini core (Kim2021Structural). The nucleotide-binding site is located at the interface between the two domains, forming a tunnel that accommodates the NADP molecule (Kim2021Structural). The protein's structure does not include a deep cleft for lipid binding, distinguishing it from other lipid transfer proteins (Kim2021Structural).

## Function
VAT1L (vesicle amine transport 1 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It interacts with transcription factors such as MEF2A, MYOD1, and MEF2C, as well as histone deacetylases like HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7. These interactions are crucial for regulating chromatin 3D dynamics and transcription, suggesting a role in circadian rhythm regulation through inter-chromosomal interactions between the IGF2/H19 locus and the VAT1L locus (Yang2018Transcriptomic).

VAT1L is highly expressed in von Economo neurons (VENs) in the human anterior cingulate cortex, where it is associated with social-emotional-autonomic functions. Its increased expression in VENs may contribute to their unique morphology and rapid signal conduction capabilities, which are important for social-emotional processing (Yang2018Transcriptomic). The gene is also involved in oxidoreductase activity and chromatin hub functions, with a mouse gene-knockout phenotype indicating abnormal behavior (Yang2018Transcriptomic).

In the context of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis, VAT1L is hypothesized to affect oxidoreductase activity and zinc ion binding, potentially influencing the beta-3 adrenergic pathway essential for non-shivering thermogenesis (Chen2021Investigation).

## Clinical Significance
The VAT1L gene has been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. It is identified as a target gene of bta-miR-378, which is significantly up-regulated in exosomes from bovine milk infected by Staphylococcus aureus. This up-regulation suggests a potential link between VAT1L and schizophrenia, as network-based analyses of schizophrenia genome-wide association studies have implicated VAT1L in the disorder (Ma2019Identification). Additionally, VAT1L has been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a genome-wide linkage study, indicating its relevance to behavior and neurological phenotypes (Lu2015Multiple).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), VAT1L expression is up-regulated following nusinersen treatment, suggesting a protective role against oxidative stress, which may be a downstream effect of SMN-mediated processes (Garofalo2023Preliminary). Furthermore, VAT1L is part of a prognostic model for breast cancer, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis, although its specific clinical significance in this context remains to be fully elucidated (Gao2023Integrative). These associations highlight the gene's involvement in various diseases, though the exact mechanisms and clinical implications require further investigation.

## Interactions
VAT1L, a synaptic vesicle membrane protein, is involved in various protein interactions that play a role in synaptic function and neurotransmitter release. It interacts with chromatin remodeling transcription factors such as MEF2A, MYOD1, and MEF2C, as well as histone deacetylases HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7. These interactions are crucial for regulating chromatin 3D dynamics and transcription, suggesting a role for VAT1L in transcription regulation and chromatin dynamics (Yang2018Transcriptomic).

In the context of dopamine-induced interactions, VAT1L is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and interacts with the progestin receptor-A (PR-A) in a dopamine-dependent manner. This interaction is significant for synaptic transmission and plasticity, indicating that VAT1L may contribute to synaptic physiology and neurotransmitter release (Acharya2020Dopamine‐induced).

VAT1L is also associated with oxidoreductase activity, which is relevant in the context of neurotoxicity. It plays a role in transcription regulation related to DNA damage response, highlighting its involvement in cellular stress responses (Shao2015Methylmercury). These interactions underscore VAT1L's multifaceted role in neuronal function and stress response mechanisms.
