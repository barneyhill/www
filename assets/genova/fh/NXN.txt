# NXN

## Overview
Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a gene that encodes the protein nucleoredoxin, a member of the thioredoxin family known for its role as an oxidoreductase enzyme. This protein is integral to maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and is involved in regulating several signaling pathways, including the WNT/β-catenin and Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)/MYD88 pathways. Nucleoredoxin's interactions with proteins such as disheveled (DVL) and MyD88 highlight its regulatory functions in cellular processes like proliferation, organogenesis, and immune responses. The protein is characterized by a thioredoxin-like domain and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing chromatin remodeling and transcription factor regulation. Mutations in the NXN gene have been associated with various diseases, including Robinow syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is; Funato2007Nucleoredoxin).

## Structure
Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a member of the thioredoxin family, characterized by its thiol-redox activity. The primary structure of NXN consists of 435 amino acids, with a high degree of conservation between human and mouse proteins, sharing 99% identity (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin). The protein contains two conserved cysteine residues essential for its oxidoreductase activity (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin).

NXN's secondary structure includes a thioredoxin-like domain with a WCPPC motif, which is crucial for its redox function. This domain is more similar to tryparedoxin (TryX) than to human TRX1, despite sharing only 25% identity with the latter (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin). The tertiary structure of NXN is not fully detailed, but it is noted that TryX and TRX proteins, despite low sequence homology, have similar structures with characteristic α/β folds (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin).

The C-terminal region of NXN contains an acidic region resembling the b' domain of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) proteins, which is involved in substrate recognition, although its specific role in NXN is not yet understood (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin). NXN does not have a reported quaternary structure, and no splice variant isoforms have been identified (Funato2007Nucleoredoxin).

## Function
Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a member of the thioredoxin family and functions as an oxidoreductase enzyme, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. It is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of signaling pathways in a redox-dependent manner. NXN interacts with several proteins, such as disheveled (DVL), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and SEC63, influencing key cellular processes like proliferation, organogenesis, cell cycle progression, glycolysis, and neuronal plasticity (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is).

NXN is particularly important in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it interacts with DVL to negatively regulate the pathway by preventing the formation of the frizzled (FZD)/DVL complex. This action inhibits β-catenin stabilization and its nuclear translocation, thereby suppressing WNT target gene expression (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). NXN also plays a role in the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)/MYD88 signaling pathway, where it negatively regulates NF-κB activation, thus modulating immune and inflammatory responses (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is).

In terms of cellular localization, NXN is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences chromatin remodeling and transcription factor regulation, contributing to the maintenance of cellular functions and homeostasis (Kurooka1997Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NXN gene have been implicated in several diseases. NXN is linked to Robinow syndrome, a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short-limb dwarfism and craniofacial abnormalities. Mutations in NXN disrupt non-canonical WNT signaling pathways, contributing to the syndrome's phenotypes (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). In Alzheimer's disease, NXN's interaction with CAMK2A, a kinase crucial for neuronal plasticity, suggests its involvement in the disease's progression. Alterations in this interaction may affect neuronal processes, potentially leading to various brain diseases (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is).

NXN also plays a role in metabolic disorders. In diabetes mellitus, NXN mutations may sensitize beta cells to oxidative stress, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is). In obesity, NXN regulates adipogenic differentiation through WNT/β-catenin signaling, promoting adipogenesis and potentially leading to increased fat accumulation and insulin resistance (IdelfonsoGarcía2022Is).

NXN's involvement in alcoholic liver disease is linked to its interaction with the FLII/Actin complex, which is altered during disease progression. Overexpression of NXN can partially revert these alterations, suggesting its regulatory role in ALD pathogenesis (Alarcón‐Sánchez2020Nucleoredoxin). These findings highlight NXN's significant role in various pathologies through its redox-regulating functions and interactions.

## Interactions
Nucleoredoxin (NXN) is a redox-regulating protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. NXN is known to interact with Dishevelled (DVL) proteins, which are key mediators in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, as NXN modulates the formation of complexes involving DVL, Frizzled (FZD), and Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type-IIα (PI4K2A), which are important for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) production (ArellanesRobledo2018Ethanol).

NXN also interacts with the Flightless-I (FLII)/Actin complex, which is involved in cellular motility and actin remodeling. This interaction is altered during the progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), suggesting a role for NXN in modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses (Alarcón‐Sánchez2020Nucleoredoxin).

Additionally, NXN has been shown to interact with MyD88, a key adaptor protein in the TLR4 signaling pathway, where it facilitates the interaction between Flightless-I and MyD88, thereby suppressing NF-kB activation (Hayashi2010Nucleoredoxin). These interactions highlight NXN's role in regulating various signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
