# IAPP

## Overview
The IAPP gene encodes the islet amyloid polypeptide, also known as amylin, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells. This hormone plays a critical role in glucose homeostasis by regulating gastric emptying and suppressing glucagon secretion, thereby moderating postprandial blood glucose levels (Ding2001Glucose). Structurally, the IAPP protein is characterized by a signal peptide and a propeptide region, which undergo proteolytic processing to yield the mature 37 amino acid peptide (Betsholtz1989Islet). The mature peptide is known for its amyloidogenic properties, forming fibrils that are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus through the formation of amyloid deposits in the islets of Langerhans (Westermark1987Amyloid). These deposits can impair islet function, contributing to the disease's progression (Cooper1987Purification). The IAPP protein also interacts with other proteins, such as amyloid-beta 42 and insulin, influencing its aggregation and biological effects (Kachkin2023The; Susa2014Defining).

## Structure
The human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) gene encodes a precursor protein of 89 amino acids, which undergoes proteolytic processing to produce the mature 37 amino acid IAPP peptide (Betsholtz1989Islet). The primary structure of IAPP includes a signal peptide, which is characteristic of secretory proteins, and a propeptide region that is cleaved to form the mature peptide (Betsholtz1989Islet). The mature IAPP peptide shares over 40% sequence identity with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family, indicating evolutionary conservation in certain regions (Betsholtz1989Islet).

The secondary structure of IAPP is predicted to include a beta-pleated sheet conformation, particularly in the amyloidogenic segment comprising amino acid residues 58-62. This segment is implicated in the formation of amyloid fibrils, which are associated with age-related diabetes mellitus (Betsholtz1989Islet). The tertiary structure is characterized by a hydrophobic amino-terminus, typical of proteins that are secreted (Betsholtz1989Islet).

Post-translational modifications of IAPP include carboxyterminal amidation, which is a common feature in the maturation of peptide hormones (Betsholtz1989Islet). The quaternary structure involves the formation of amyloid fibrils, a process that is facilitated by the amyloidogenic regions within the peptide (Betsholtz1989Islet).

## Function
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), also known as amylin, is a hormone co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells. In healthy human cells, IAPP plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of gastric emptying and the suppression of glucagon secretion, which helps to moderate postprandial blood glucose levels (Ding2001Glucose). IAPP is synthesized in the β-cells of the pancreas and is co-localized with insulin, indicating its role in the secretory pathway of these cells (Westermark1987Amyloid).

IAPP is known to inhibit glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, contributing to the regulation of glucose levels in the bloodstream (Ding2001Glucose). The gene's expression is regulated by glucose through a protein kinase A-independent pathway, highlighting its involvement in cellular signaling processes (Ding2001Glucose). IAPP's structure shares significant identity with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), suggesting potential endocrine regulatory effects (Westermark1987Amyloid).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, IAPP is associated with the formation of amyloid deposits in the islets of Langerhans, which are a characteristic feature of the disease (Westermark1987Amyloid). These deposits may impair islet function, contributing to the pathogenesis of diabetes (Cooper1987Purification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IAPP gene are significantly associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). IAPP, also known as amylin, is prone to aggregation, forming amyloid deposits in the pancreatic islets, which are a hallmark of T2DM. These deposits contribute to beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis, leading to reduced insulin secretion and impaired glucose metabolism (Westermark2011Islet). 

Mutations in the IAPP gene, such as the S20G mutation, have been identified in specific populations, including Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This mutation increases the amyloidogenicity and cytotoxicity of IAPP, exacerbating beta-cell damage (Westermark2011Islet). 

The overexpression of IAPP can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to beta-cell apoptosis. This stress is linked to the unfolded protein response, which is activated during protein misfolding and aggregation (Westermark2011Islet). 

IAPP aggregation also interacts with lipid membranes, causing membrane rupture and cell damage, further contributing to beta-cell failure (Westermark2011Islet). These pathological processes underscore the clinical significance of IAPP in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.

## Interactions
The islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing its aggregation and biological effects. IAPP physically interacts with the amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) peptide, forming hetero-oligomers and large aggregate heterocomplexes that are more cytotoxic than aggregates of either protein alone. This interaction is specific to IAPP and Aβ42, as IAPP does not show a similar interaction with the prion protein (PrP) despite occasional colocalization. The interaction between IAPP and Aβ42 may play a crucial role in seeding Aβ42 aggregation, potentially promoting the development of Alzheimer's disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Kachkin2023The).

IAPP also interacts with the human serum protein C4b-binding protein (C4BP), which inhibits IAPP-induced inflammasome activation and reduces IL-1β secretion. C4BP binds to IAPP, preventing its fibrillation and subsequent inflammasome activation, thereby preserving beta cell function and viability. This interaction suggests that C4BP acts as an extracellular chaperone protein, limiting the proinflammatory effects of IAPP (Kulak2017The).

Insulin is another protein that interacts with IAPP, inhibiting its aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Insulin stabilizes IAPP in a monomeric, nonamyloidogenic state by forming heterogeneous clusters with IAPP, preventing its aggregation (Susa2014Defining).
