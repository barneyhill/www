# CLBA1

## Overview
CLBA1, or clathrin binding box of aftiphilin containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular transport processes, particularly in vesicle formation and intracellular trafficking. The protein encoded by CLBA1 is characterized by its interactions with HEATR5 proteins, such as Heatr5b, and is implicated in forming biochemically distinct complexes with co-factors like Aftiphilin. These interactions are conserved across species, highlighting the evolutionary significance of CLBA1 in cellular functions. The protein is associated with various cellular organelles, including the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and nucleus, suggesting a multifaceted role in cellular organization and function (Shi2021Yeast; Marmorale2023Two).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CLBA1, or clathrin binding box of aftiphilin containing 1, is involved in interactions with HEATR5 proteins, specifically Heatr5b. High-confidence predictions suggest that CLBA1 binds to the C-terminus of Heatr5b, similar to the interaction between Laa1 and HEATR5b in yeast. This interaction is supported by evidence showing that CLBA1 binds Heatr5b when overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Mutations between the HR2 and HR3 regions disrupt the interactions of CLBA1 with Heatr5b, indicating a specific binding interface (Marmorale2023Two).

CLBA1 is also associated with cellular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and nucleus, as identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen during mouse spermiogenesis. However, specific details on the physical interactions of CLBA1 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not provided (Shi2021Yeast).

The interactions of CLBA1 with HEATR5 proteins suggest that it forms part of biochemically distinct complexes with mutually exclusive co-factors, such as Aftiphilin, which are conserved across species. This indicates a role for CLBA1 in cellular transport processes, potentially involving vesicle formation and intracellular trafficking (Marmorale2023Two).
