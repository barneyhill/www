# LGALS9

## Overview
LGALS9 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-9, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-9 is characterized by its two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) connected by a linker peptide, which allows it to engage in various biological functions, particularly in the immune system. As a multifunctional protein, galectin-9 plays a significant role in immune response regulation, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. It is involved in modulating T-cell activity and phagocytosis, influencing both innate and adaptive immune responses. The protein's ability to form homodimers enhances its functional interactions, making it a critical player in cellular processes. Galectin-9's involvement in disease pathogenesis, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Querol2019Intracellular; Zhang2024Galectin9; John2016Galectin9:).

## Structure
LGALS9 encodes the protein galectin-9, which plays a role in immune response regulation. The primary structure of galectin-9 is characterized by a sequence rich in conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's stability and function. The protein contains two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) connected by a linker peptide, which is a distinctive feature of its structure.

In terms of secondary structure, galectin-9 features β-sheets, a common structural motif among galectins. These β-sheets contribute to the protein's ability to bind carbohydrates, which is essential for its biological activity. The tertiary structure of galectin-9 involves the folding of the CRDs, allowing the protein to achieve its functional conformation.

Galectin-9 can form homodimers, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure. This dimerization is important for its biological function, as it enhances the protein's ability to interact with other molecules. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, potentially influencing the protein's activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variants of LGALS9 can result in different isoforms of galectin-9, which may have varied linker lengths, affecting their structural and functional properties.

## Function
Galectin-9, encoded by the LGALS9 gene, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in maintaining plasma membrane integrity and structure, particularly in dendritic cells (DCs), where it is essential for organizing the actin cytoskeleton. This organization is vital for effective phagocytosis, as Galectin-9 modulates Rac1 activity, influencing actin polymerization and the formation of phagocytic cups (Querol2019Intracellular). 

Galectin-9 also interacts with the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN, facilitating DC-SIGN-mediated phagocytosis by maintaining plasma membrane and cortical actin stiffness (Querol2019Intracellular). Its intracellular presence is crucial for particle uptake by moDCs, independent of surface interactions, and it affects the stability and formation of phagosomes (Querol2019Intracellular).

Beyond its role in phagocytosis, Galectin-9 is involved in immune regulation. It binds to TIM-3 on T-cells, influencing T-cell apoptosis and migration, and modulates immune responses, highlighting its importance in immune synapse formation and signaling (John2016Galectin9:). Galectin-9's ability to bind to various glycan units and its pH-sensitive interactions allow it to participate in cell adhesion, migration, and modulation of signaling pathways (John2016Galectin9:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS9 gene, which encodes galectin-9, have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, galectin-9 is involved in tumor progression and immune evasion. High expression levels are linked to cancer cell aggregation, while low levels are associated with increased invasion and metastasis, as seen in breast cancer and melanoma (Zhang2024Galectin9; Kageshita2002Possible). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), elevated galectin-9 expression correlates with disease progression and adverse chromosomal aberrations, suggesting its role in creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment (BojarskaJunak2023Prognostic).

Galectin-9 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. It modulates immune responses by shifting innate immunity towards an anti-inflammatory profile, which is beneficial in conditions like autoimmune encephalomyelitis and graft rejection (Wiersma2011Therapeutic). In rheumatoid arthritis, specific polymorphisms in LGALS9 are associated with increased disease susceptibility, and higher serum levels of galectin-9 correlate with disease activity (Ameen2023A).

The protein's interactions with immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1 and TIM-3 are crucial in regulating T cell death, making it a target for cancer immunotherapy (Yang2021Galectin9). These findings highlight the potential of galectin-9 as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in various diseases.

## Interactions
Galectin-9 (LGALS9) is involved in various interactions with proteins on the cell surface, influencing immune cell functions. It binds to IgM-BCR and CD45 on B cells, organizing IgM-BCR into larger clusters that restrict their mobility and inhibit BCR signaling. This interaction also involves CD22, an inhibitory co-receptor, which enhances the inhibitory effect on B-cell activation by recruiting phosphatases like SHP-1 to dampen BCR signaling (Cao2018Galectin9).

In T cells, galectin-9 interacts with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) on the cell surface, affecting the redox environment and enhancing T-cell migration. This interaction is carbohydrate-dependent and involves the retention of PDI at the cell surface, which increases its thioreductase activity, crucial for T-cell migration and HIV entry (Bi2011Galectin9).

In dendritic cells, galectin-9 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and the phagocytic receptor DC-SIGN. It is essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and plasma membrane rigidity, which are crucial for phagocytosis. Galectin-9's interaction with DC-SIGN and actin-binding proteins forms a multiprotein complex that regulates cytoskeleton remodeling and phagocytic activity (Querol2019Intracellular).
