# RTEL1

## Overview
RTEL1 (regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1) is a gene that encodes a DNA helicase protein crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and genomic stability. The RTEL1 protein belongs to the superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases and is characterized by its 5'-3' helicase activity, facilitated by an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster (Ghisays2021RTEL1; Vannier2014RTEL1:). It plays a pivotal role in dismantling telomeric structures such as T loops and G-quadruplexes, which are essential for proper telomere replication and stability (Vannier2012RTEL1). RTEL1's interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, including the shelterin complex and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), underscore its multifaceted role in genome maintenance (Kotsantis2020RTEL1). Mutations in the RTEL1 gene are linked to several genetic disorders, including dyskeratosis congenita and familial pulmonary fibrosis, due to their impact on telomere length and genomic stability (Ballew2013A; Borie2019Regulator).

## Structure
The RTEL1 protein is a DNA helicase that plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance and DNA repair. It belongs to the superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases and contains an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster, which specifies its 5'-3' helicase activity (Ghisays2021RTEL1; Vannier2014RTEL1:). The protein structure includes several domains: a RAD3-related DNA helicase domain, DEXDc2, DEAD_2, HELICx2, and DinG domains, as well as harmonin-N-like domains that may serve as molecular scaffolds for protein-protein interactions (Tanshee2024A; Vannier2014RTEL1:). The C-terminal region of RTEL1 contains a RING-finger domain, which is important for protein-protein interactions and binding to ubiquitination enzymes (Ghisays2021RTEL1; Vannier2014RTEL1:).

The harmonin-N-like domains in RTEL1 are structurally related to paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains, sharing a common fold and hydrophobic core, which suggests a role in protein-protein interactions (Faure2013The). The RTEL1 protein also interacts with the shelterin complex to preserve telomeres and is involved in resolving DNA secondary structures like G-quadruplexes (Tanshee2024A). The R1264H mutation within the RING domain affects its structure by potentially altering zinc coordination, highlighting the domain's functional importance (Ghisays2021RTEL1).

## Function
RTEL1 (regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1) is a DNA helicase that plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere integrity and genome stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in dismantling T loops and counteracting telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures, which are essential for proper telomere replication and stability (Vannier2012RTEL1). RTEL1 acts as an antirecombinase, disrupting D loops formed during homologous recombination to prevent toxic recombination intermediates (Vannier2012RTEL1). It is transiently associated with telomeres during the S phase of the cell cycle to facilitate T loop disassembly, preventing telomere loss and fragility (Vannier2012RTEL1).

RTEL1 also plays a role in resolving R-loops, RNA:DNA hybrids that can impede replication fork progression, thereby preventing replication stress and genomic instability (Björkman2020Human). It binds to RNA and influences the abundance and localization of TERRA RNA, which is important for stabilizing telomeric ends (Ghisays2021RTEL1). RTEL1's helicase activity is essential for unwinding DNA structures, facilitating telomere replication, and maintaining chromosomal stability (Vannier2014RTEL1:). Its deficiency can lead to severe telomere shortening, genomic instability, and various cellular dysfunctions (Awad2020Full).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RTEL1 gene are associated with several severe genetic conditions. RTEL1 mutations can lead to dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and its severe variant, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH), which are characterized by bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and a predisposition to cancer. Patients with HH also experience cerebellar hypoplasia and enteropathy (Ballew2013A; Speckmann2017Clinical). RTEL1 mutations are linked to telomere dysfunction, resulting in decreased telomere length and genomic instability (Touzot2016Extended).

RTEL1 mutations have also been implicated in pulmonary diseases, such as familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). These mutations can lead to shortened telomeres, contributing to the progression of these conditions (Kannengiesser2015HeterozygousRTEL1mutations; Borie2019Regulator). In the context of bone marrow failure and myeloid neoplasms, RTEL1 variants are associated with conditions like aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, where they contribute to telomere shortening and genomic instability (Marsh2018Heterozygous).

RTEL1 mutations are also linked to increased susceptibility to certain cancers, including high-grade gliomas and astrocytomas, due to their role in maintaining telomere integrity and genome stability (Vannier2014RTEL1:).

## Interactions
RTEL1 (regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are essential for maintaining genomic stability. RTEL1 interacts with the DNA polymerase δ (POLδ) complex, specifically with the subunit Poldip3, forming a stable complex crucial for chromatin binding after replication stress. This interaction is essential for preventing R-loop accumulation, which can lead to genomic instability (Björkman2020Human). RTEL1 also binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures in TERRA RNA and telomeric DNA, with a strong preference for these structures, mediated by its C-terminal domain. This binding is crucial for telomere stability and cell viability (Ghisays2021RTEL1).

RTEL1's interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is vital for counteracting R-loops and maintaining telomere integrity. Its loss leads to telomeric fragility and replication defects (Kotsantis2020RTEL1). RTEL1 also plays a role in resolving G4-DNA/R-loops to prevent transcription-replication collisions, which are linked to altered transcription and replication defects (Kotsantis2020RTEL1). These interactions highlight RTEL1's multifaceted role in genome maintenance and telomere stability.
