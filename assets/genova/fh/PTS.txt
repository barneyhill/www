# PTS

## Overview
The PTS gene encodes the enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor essential for the activity of several hydroxylase enzymes involved in neurotransmitter production, such as dopamine and serotonin. PTPS is a zinc-dependent enzyme that functions as a homo-hexamer, with each subunit contributing to the formation of active sites necessary for its catalytic role. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate into 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, a pivotal step in the BH4 synthesis pathway. The PTS gene is located on chromosome 11q22.3-q23.3 and is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications, which can affect its enzymatic activity. Mutations in the PTS gene can lead to BH4 deficiency, resulting in various neurological disorders due to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin; Muniz2019Role; Hara2019Reversible).

## Structure
The human 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTS) protein is crucial for the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). The primary structure of PTS consists of 145 amino acids, encoded by the PTS gene located on chromosome 11q22.3-q23.3 (Muniz2019Role). The secondary structure of PTS includes a four-stranded beta-sheet flanked by helices, forming an elongated shape (Muniz2019Role). 

The tertiary structure of PTS results in a compact, globular form, which is essential for its enzymatic function. The quaternary structure of PTS is a homo-hexameric assembly, organized as a dimer of trimers in a head-to-head manner, creating a central 12-stranded beta-barrel pore (Muniz2019Role). Each of the six active sites in the hexamer is located at the interface of three subunits, featuring conserved histidines for metal ion coordination and a Cys43-Asp89-His90 triad for proton transfer during catalysis (Muniz2019Role).

PTS undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are necessary for its normal function (Himmelreich2021Molecular). Additionally, reversible S-glutathionylation at Cys-43 protects the enzyme from oxidative stress, maintaining its activity (Hara2019Reversible). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's role in BH4 synthesis and its interaction with other biomolecules.

## Function
The PTS gene encodes the enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), which plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for several hydroxylase enzymes involved in neurotransmitter production, including dopamine and serotonin (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin; Thöny2006Mutations). PTPS catalyzes the conversion of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate into 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, a key step in the BH4 synthesis pathway (Hara2019Reversible). This enzyme is a zinc-dependent homohexamer, with each subunit containing an active site that coordinates a zinc ion, crucial for its catalytic activity (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin).

In healthy human cells, PTPS is constitutively expressed, although its activity can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which significantly increases its activity (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining normal neurological function by ensuring adequate levels of BH4, which is necessary for the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters and nitric oxide (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin; Hara2019Reversible). PTPS activity can become rate-limiting in BH4 biosynthesis, particularly in humans, where its activity is lower compared to rodents (THÖNY2000Tetrahydrobiopterin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PTS gene, which encodes the enzyme 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), are associated with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency, leading to hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and various neurological disorders. BH4 is a crucial cofactor for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and its deficiency can result in conditions such as dopa-responsive dystonia and phenylketonuria (Liu1998Mutation; Chiu2012Mutation).

PTS gene mutations can lead to different forms of BH4 deficiency, with missense mutations being the most common. These mutations often result in reduced enzyme stability and activity, contributing to the clinical manifestations of the disease (Thöny1997Mutations; Li2022Identification). Specific mutations, such as c.84-291A>G, affect mRNA splicing and lead to mild PTPS deficiency, while others like c.259C>T (p.P87S) are associated with severe symptoms (Liu2001Identification; Li2022Identification).

Splicing errors caused by mutations such as IVS3+1G>A can lead to exon skipping, resulting in inactive enzyme variants and severe neurological symptoms, including hypotonia and seizures (Liu2001Identification). The clinical phenotype can vary even among patients with the same mutation, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (Liu1998Mutation).
