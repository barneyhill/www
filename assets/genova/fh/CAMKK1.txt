# CAMKK1

## Overview
CAMKK1, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in calcium signaling pathways. The protein product of CAMKK1 plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by activating downstream kinases such as CAMK1 and CAMKIV, which are integral to pathways regulating metabolism, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (Dong2017A). This kinase is primarily expressed in the central nervous system but is also present in other tissues, including the pancreas and lung, where it influences cellular energy homeostasis and neuronal function (Dong2017A). CAMKK1 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue repair and cardiovascular function, and has been associated with diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disorders (Beghi2020Gene; Zhang2021Associations). The protein's activity is regulated by calcium levels and post-translational modifications, which modulate its interaction with calmodulin and its downstream effects (Prajisha2020Discovery).

## Structure
CAMKK1, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in calcium signaling pathways. The protein structure includes a kinase domain, an autoinhibitory sequence, and a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) (Prajisha2020Discovery). The kinase domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity and is followed by an auto-inhibitory sequence that overlaps with the calmodulin-binding domain (Prajisha2020Discovery). 

The primary structure of CAMKK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes a p-loop (phosphate-binding loop) composed mostly of β-strands, which are connected by a flexible linker to a predominantly α-helical C-terminal region (Prajisha2020Discovery). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes the kinase domain and regulatory domains that interact with calmodulin. 

CAMKK1 is kept inactive through auto-inhibition, which is relieved by increased Ca2+ levels interacting with the CBD (Prajisha2020Discovery). The protein's activity can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. While the context does not provide specific details on quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms, these features may contribute to the functional diversity of CAMKK1.

## Function
CAMKK1 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1) is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, primarily expressed in central nervous system cells, with detectable levels in tissues such as the pancreas, amygdala, hypothalamus, prostate, and lung (Dong2017A). It plays a crucial role in calcium-triggered signaling pathways by activating downstream kinases such as CAMK1 and CAMKIV through phosphorylation of their amino acids Thr177 and Thr196, respectively (Dong2017A). This activation influences various cellular processes, including metabolism, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation.

CAMKK1 is involved in modulating signaling pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC) and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which are critical for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and regulating cell growth (Dong2017A). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting neuronal function and energy balance within cells. Its role in enhancing the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) secretome suggests that CAMKK1 may also influence tissue repair and healing processes, particularly in the context of cardiac function following myocardial infarction (Dong2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CAMKK1 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The polymorphism rs7214723 in the CAMKK1 gene has been linked to a decreased risk of death in lung cancer patients. This association is especially significant among male patients, smokers, those under 60 years of age, and patients with advanced-stage disease. The mutation results in a T to C transition, leading to an amino acid change from glutamate to glycine at position 375, which affects the kinase domain of CAMKK1. This change reduces the activation ability of CAMKK1 on downstream kinases, potentially inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, thereby improving prognosis (Zhang2021Associations).

In cardiovascular diseases, CAMKK1 is involved in calcium-triggered signaling crucial for heart function. Although its precise role in the heart is not fully defined, overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells has been shown to improve cardiac function after infarction. The polymorphism rs7214723 may influence the substrate specificity of CAMKK1, potentially affecting downstream protein kinases and contributing to complex pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases (Beghi2020Gene; Dong2017A).
