# ETFBKMT

## Overview
ETFBKMT, also known as METTL20, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme specifically targets the beta subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFB), methylating it at lysine residues K200 and K203. As a methyltransferase, ETFBKMT plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism by modulating the activity of ETFB, which is integral to the process of fatty acid oxidation. The methylation of ETFB by ETFBKMT inhibits its catalytic function, thereby influencing the electron transfer processes essential for energy production, particularly under metabolic conditions such as fasting or ketogenic states (Shimazu2018Role). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and preventing excessive energy output during periods of nutrient scarcity (Campeanu2021Multiomics; Shimazu2018Role).

## Function
ETFBKMT, also known as METTL20, is a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase that specifically methylates the beta subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFB) at lysine residues K200 and K203. This methylation plays a crucial role in regulating the catalytic activity of ETFB, which is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism (Shimazu2018Role). The methylation of ETFB by ETFBKMT inhibits its activity, thereby modulating the electron transfer capabilities of ETF, particularly its interaction with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Shimazu2018Role).

In healthy human cells, ETFBKMT-mediated methylation of ETFB influences the oxygen consumption rate in mitochondria, suggesting a regulatory role in mitochondrial metabolism (Shimazu2018Role). This regulation is important for maintaining energy homeostasis, especially under conditions where fatty acid metabolism is accelerated, such as fasting or ketogenic states (Shimazu2018Role). The enzyme is primarily localized to the mitochondrion, where it modulates energy production to prevent excessive energy output during fasting, which could be crucial for survival during long-term starvation (Campeanu2021Multiomics; Shimazu2018Role).

## Interactions
ETFBKMT, also known as METTL20, is a mitochondrial lysine methyltransferase that specifically methylates the β subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFB). This methylation occurs at lysine residues K200 and K203, which are located near the 'recognition loop' of ETFB. The methylation of these sites by ETFBKMT influences the interaction of ETFB with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (MCAD) and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, thereby affecting the oxidation of fatty acids (Lukinović2020Lysine; Shimazu2018Role).

The interaction between ETFBKMT and ETFB is significant as it modulates the catalytic activity of ETFB, which is crucial for its function as an electron transfer protein for acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. This interaction and subsequent methylation inhibit ETFB's catalytic activity, impacting metabolic processes such as β-oxidation and heat production, particularly under fasting or ketogenic conditions (Shimazu2018Role).

Studies using Mettl20 knockout mice have demonstrated that the absence of ETFB methylation leads to increased ETF activity, suggesting that ETFBKMT plays a regulatory role in mitochondrial metabolism by modulating ETFB activity through lysine methylation (Shimazu2018Role).
