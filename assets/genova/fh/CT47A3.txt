# CT47A3

## Overview
The CT47A3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cancer/testis antigen family, specifically known as cancer/testis antigen family 47 member A3. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of human spermatogenesis, a critical process for male fertility. It functions by interacting with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), an epigenetic regulator, to influence the transcriptional landscape necessary for the progression of spermatocytes through meiosis (Li2022Humanspecific). The CT47A3 protein is crucial for the stabilization of PRMT5, preventing its degradation and ensuring its nuclear presence during key stages of spermatogenesis (Li2022Humanspecific). The gene's expression is tightly linked to testosterone signaling, which is essential for the proper timing of meiotic progression during puberty (Li2022Humanspecific). Deficiencies in CT47A3 expression have been associated with idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia, underscoring its importance in reproductive health (Li2022Humanspecific).

## Function
The CT47A3 gene, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, plays a crucial role in human spermatogenesis by regulating the entry of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into meiosis. It achieves this by interacting with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a key epigenetic regulator involved in the methylation of arginine residues, which affects transcriptional regulation (Li2022Humanspecific). CT47A3 stabilizes PRMT5 by preventing its K63-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus during the leptotene/zygotene-to-pachytene transition in spermatogenesis (Li2022Humanspecific).

In healthy human cells, CT47A3 is essential for the proper response to testosterone, which induces the nuclear depletion of the CT47/PRMT5 complex, allowing the progression of spermatocytes beyond the leptotene stage (Li2022Humanspecific). This gene is particularly important for maintaining the prespermatogenesis stage and ensuring the synchronization of the meiotic process with testosterone during puberty (Li2022Humanspecific). Low levels of CT47A3 expression are associated with idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia, highlighting its significance in human fertility (Li2022Humanspecific).
