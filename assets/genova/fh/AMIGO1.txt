# AMIGO1

## Overview
AMIGO1 is a gene that encodes the adhesion molecule with Ig-like domain 1, a type I transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the nervous system. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which facilitate its role as a cell adhesion molecule. AMIGO1 is integral to neuronal development, influencing axon growth, synapse formation, and neural circuit maintenance. It also interacts with Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channels, particularly Kv2.1, modulating neuronal excitability and action potential duration. The protein's expression and function are closely linked to the presence of Kv2 α subunits, which are essential for its intracellular trafficking and surface expression. Alterations in AMIGO1 expression have been associated with neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Sepela2021The; Bishop2018Kv2; KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

## Structure
The AMIGO1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the nervous system. It features an ectodomain approximately 400 amino acids long, which includes six N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a membrane-proximal immunoglobulin (Ig) module (Winther2013Neural). The LRR domain is a solenoid-type motif, typically 20-29 amino acids in length, forming a curved, horseshoe-shaped structure with β-strands on the concave side and α-helices on the convex side (Winther2013Neural; Chen2006AMIGO). The ectodomain also contains five sites for N-linked glycosylation, which are crucial for the proper orientation and function of the protein (Winther2013Neural).

AMIGO1 undergoes homophilic interactions, resulting in dimerization through the concave side of the LRR domain, which is essential for its cell surface expression and function in cell-cell adhesion (Winther2013Neural). This dimerization is also involved in the modulation of neurite outgrowth and neural circuit development (Zhao2014Amigo; Chen2006AMIGO). The protein's cytoplasmic domain is about 100 amino acids long, but specific details on its structure are not provided in the available context (Winther2013Neural).

## Function
AMIGO1, a member of the AMIGO family of proteins, plays a crucial role in neuronal development and function. It is primarily expressed in the nervous system, where it acts as a cell adhesion molecule facilitating axon growth and guidance, synapse formation, and maintenance of neural circuits (KujaPanula2003AMIGO; Soto2022AMIGO1). AMIGO1 is involved in the modulation of Kv2 voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically Kv2.1, which are essential for regulating neuronal excitability and action potential duration. This interaction promotes the activation of Kv2.1 channels by destabilizing the resting state of voltage sensors, thereby influencing neuronal electrical activity (Sepela2021The; Bishop2018Kv2).

AMIGO1's expression and localization are closely linked to the presence of Kv2 α subunits, which facilitate its intracellular trafficking and surface expression. In the absence of these subunits, AMIGO1 expression is significantly reduced, highlighting its dependency on Kv2 channels for proper function (Bishop2018Kv2). Additionally, AMIGO1 is implicated in axon tract development and myelination, with its expression being upregulated during critical stages of brain development (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AMIGO1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. AMIGO1 is crucial for neuronal circuit development and proper functioning of Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channels, which are essential for regulating neuronal excitability and action potential duration. Disruptions in these processes can lead to neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and developmental epileptic encephalopathy (Sepela2021The).

The absence of AMIGO1 in knockout mice has been associated with altered IK currents and features related to schizophrenia, suggesting its role in maintaining normal neuronal function and behavior (Sepela2021The). Additionally, AMIGO1's interaction with Kv2 channels is vital for its expression and localization in neurons. The loss of Kv2 α subunit expression significantly reduces AMIGO1 levels, which may contribute to neurological dysfunctions (Bishop2018Kv2).

While the exact clinical significance of AMIGO1 gene mutations or expression alterations remains to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical neuronal pathways highlights its potential impact on neurological health (Sepela2021The; Bishop2018Kv2).

## Interactions
AMIGO1, a protein characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an immunoglobulin-like domain, is involved in several key interactions within the nervous system. It functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, facilitating neurite outgrowth and fasciculation in central neurons through its LRR domains (Winther2013Neural; Zhao2014Amigo). AMIGO1 interacts with the Kv2.1 potassium channel, acting as an auxiliary subunit that modulates the channel's voltage-dependent activation and affects neuronal excitability (Zhao2014Amigo; Peltola2011AMIGO). This interaction is significant for the regulation of channel activity and neuronal signaling, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and colocalization studies (Bishop2018Kv2; Zhao2014Amigo).

AMIGO1 is also extensively colocalized with Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 ion channels in brain neurons, particularly at ER:PM junctions, where it is coclustered with Kv2 α subunits (Bishop2018Kv2). The presence of Kv2 α subunits is crucial for the clustered localization of AMIGO1, indicating a dependency on these subunits for its expression and plasma membrane trafficking (Bishop2018Kv2). These interactions highlight AMIGO1's role in neural circuit formation and function, as well as its influence on ion channel expression and stability (Zhao2014Amigo).
