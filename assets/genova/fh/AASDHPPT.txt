# AASDHPPT

## Overview
The AASDHPPT gene encodes the enzyme aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function and metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and is essential for the post-translational modification of proteins through phosphopantetheinylation, a process vital for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and the assembly of electron transport chain complexes (Norden2024Mitochondrial). The enzyme localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, where it contributes to the production of lipoic acid, a necessary cofactor for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and supports the stability and function of mitochondrial proteins (Norden2024Mitochondrial). Deficiencies in AASDHPPT can lead to impaired mitochondrial respiration and metabolic dysfunction, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Norden2024Mitochondrial).

## Structure


## Function
The AASDHPPT gene encodes an enzyme crucial for mitochondrial oxidative function and metabolism in humans. This enzyme, known as aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase phosphopantetheinyl transferase, is responsible for the phosphopantetheinylation of proteins, a post-translational modification essential for mitochondrial function (Norden2024Mitochondrial). AASDHPPT is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) by modifying the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (mtACP), also known as NDUFAB1, with a 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'PP) group. This modification is crucial for mtFAS, as it allows NDUFAB1 to act as a scaffold for fatty acid synthesis and facilitates interactions with electron transport chain (ETC) assembly factors (Norden2024Mitochondrial).

The enzyme localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, where it plays a significant role in the production of lipoic acid, an essential cofactor for enzymes in the TCA cycle, and in the assembly of ETC complexes (Norden2024Mitochondrial). AASDHPPT deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial respiration and TCA cycle metabolism, primarily due to altered mtFAS function, evidenced by reduced protein lipoylation and stability of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) (Norden2024Mitochondrial). The re-expression of AASDHPPT can rescue these deficiencies, restoring protein lipoylation, SDHB stability, and mitochondrial respiration, highlighting its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial health (Norden2024Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AASDHPPT gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Variants of unknown significance (VUS) in AASDHPPT, such as R47H and W79G, have been identified as potentially pathogenic due to their weaker ability to rescue mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) activity in PPT-deficient cells, suggesting a role in inborn genetic diseases (Norden2024Mitochondrial). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial oxidative function and its localization to the mitochondrial matrix are crucial for its role in mtFAS and mitochondrial metabolism, with deficiencies leading to impaired mitochondrial respiration and protein modifications (Norden2024Mitochondrial).

In the context of cancer, AASDHPPT has been studied for its co-essentiality in human cancer cell lines, indicating its potential role in cellular metabolism and cancer biology (Norden2024Mitochondrial). Additionally, in glioma, AASDHPPT expression is up-regulated, which may contribute to the abnormal metabolism of lipids and nucleotides, suggesting its clinical significance in the pathogenesis of this brain tumor (Li2018Glycerophosphatidylcholine).

In pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), AASDHPPT expression is increased as a compensatory mechanism for low mitochondrial CoA levels, highlighting its role in mitochondrial phosphopantetheinylation and potential therapeutic implications (ÁlvarezCórdoba2021Down).

## Interactions
AASDHPPT, a human phosphopantetheinyl transferase, primarily interacts with acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs) to facilitate the transfer of the phosphopantetheinyl moiety from coenzyme A (CoA) to these carrier proteins. This interaction is crucial for the activation of enzymes involved in fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. The binding of AASDHPPT to its target proteins is largely governed by hydrophobic interactions and shape complementarity, rather than specific polar interactions (Beld2014The).

The structural analysis of AASDHPPT reveals that it forms a complex with human AcpP, a component of the type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) biosynthetic complex. In this complex, a mutation is introduced to prevent phosphopantetheinyl transfer, allowing the study of the interaction between AASDHPPT and AcpP. The active site Glu, responsible for Mg2+ coordination and serine deprotonation, is rotated away from the Mg2+ binding site, possibly due to crystallization conditions (Beld2014The).

AASDHPPT is also involved in the phosphopantetheinylation of enzymes such as mitochondrial fatty acid synthases and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (fTHF-DH), indicating its broad substrate scope and essential role in these processes (Beld2014The).
