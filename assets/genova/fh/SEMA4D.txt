# SEMA4D

## Overview
SEMA4D is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 4D, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in a variety of biological processes. Semaphorin 4D is a member of the semaphorin family, characterized by a sema domain that plays a critical role in axon guidance, immune responses, and angiogenesis. The protein exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter generated through proteolytic cleavage. Semaphorin 4D interacts with receptors such as Plexin-B1 and CD72, mediating diverse cellular functions, including T-cell activation, B-cell survival, and endothelial cell migration. Its involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Dysregulation of SEMA4D expression and function is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer, bone diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders (Elhabazi2003Structure; Kumanogoh2004Biological; Fard2021Semaphorins).

## Structure
SEMA4D, also known as semaphorin 4D or CD100, is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. The primary structure of SEMA4D includes an NH2-terminal signal peptide, a sema domain, an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain, a lysine-rich stretch, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (Kumanogoh2004Biological; NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology). The sema domain, a signature feature of semaphorins, is characterized by a β-propeller architecture and is crucial for the protein's function in axon guidance and immune responses (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Siebold2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of SEMA4D is stabilized by disulfide bonds, particularly within the sema domain, which is essential for its dimerization and biological activity (Lontos2018The; Kumanogoh2004Biological). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a stable homodimer through a disulfide bond between cysteine residues (Lontos2018The). Post-translational modifications include potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular region (Kumanogoh2004Biological).

SEMA4D exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, the latter being generated through proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteases (Elhabazi2003Structure). The protein interacts with receptors such as Plexin-B1 and CD72, mediating diverse biological functions (Elhabazi2003Structure).

## Function
SEMA4D, also known as semaphorin 4D, is a multifunctional protein involved in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation, axonal guidance, and angiogenesis. In the immune system, SEMA4D is expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells, macrophages, and other immune cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell interactions and functions. It enhances T-cell activation and proliferation by delivering costimulatory signals through interactions with receptors such as CD45 and CD72 (Elhabazi2003Structure). SEMA4D also promotes B-cell survival and antibody production by engaging CD72, which modulates inhibitory signaling pathways (Kumanogoh2004Biological; Fard2021Semaphorins).

In addition to its immune functions, SEMA4D is involved in axonal guidance during neuronal development, where it interacts with plexin-B1 to influence cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (Kumanogoh2004Biological). SEMA4D also acts as a pro-angiogenic factor, promoting endothelial cell migration and new blood vessel formation, which is essential for maintaining vascular health (Fard2021Semaphorins). These diverse roles highlight SEMA4D's importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
SEMA4D, also known as semaphorin 4D, is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, SEMA4D is overexpressed in several tumor types, including lung, colon, breast, and gastric cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Jiang2022Semaphorins; Lontos2018The). Its interaction with Plexin-B1 promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, contributing to cancer aggressiveness (Rajabinejad2020Semaphorin; Ch’ng2010Roles). In melanoma, lower SEMA4D expression correlates with poorer prognosis and reduced survival time (Liu2023Low).

SEMA4D also plays a role in bone diseases. It is highly expressed in osteoclasts and inhibits osteoblast differentiation, affecting bone remodeling and potentially contributing to conditions like osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Lontos2018The). Elevated SEMA4D levels are linked to increased disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (Lontos2018The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, SEMA4D is upregulated in neurons of diseased brains, contributing to astrocyte reactivity and neuropathogenesis in conditions like Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases (Evans2022Semaphorin). Blocking SEMA4D signaling has shown potential in ameliorating disease symptoms and preserving neuronal functions (Evans2022Semaphorin).

## Interactions
Semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) interacts with several receptors and proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It primarily binds to plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 receptors, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics. The interaction with plexin-B1 can lead to both activation and inhibition of RhoA, a small GTPase, depending on the associated receptor tyrosine kinases, such as ErbB-2 and Met. In the presence of Met, SEMA4D binding results in RhoA inactivation through the recruitment of p190 RhoGAP, facilitated by Grb2, which is crucial for the antimigratory effects observed in certain cell types (Sun2012Grb2).

SEMA4D also interacts with CD72, a low-affinity receptor, influencing B cell responses by inhibiting CD72-mediated negative signaling, which enhances B cell activation (Kumanogoh2004Biological). In the context of cancer, SEMA4D interacts with plexin-B1 on endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression. This interaction is crucial for tumor-induced angiogenesis, as SEMA4D deficiency impairs cancer cell aggregation and metastasis (NkyimbengTakwi2011Biology). Additionally, SEMA4D can bind to plexin-B2 on keratinocytes, leading to cytoskeletal changes necessary for cell migration (Kuklina2021Semaphorin).
