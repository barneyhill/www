# LZTS2

## Overview
LZTS2, or leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a tumor suppressor. The LZTS2 protein is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics, a critical process for cell division and migration, and is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its interactions with various cellular components. It plays a significant role in the cell cycle by interacting with proteins such as Katanin, β-catenin, and components of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby influencing processes like cytokinesis, spindle formation, and transcriptional regulation. LZTS2's ability to modulate these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. Its clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in various cancers, where alterations in LZTS2 expression or function can contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Shen2018LZTS2; Maru2009The; Xu2018LZTS2).

## Function
The LZTS2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a critical role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which are essential for cell division and migration. LZTS2 interacts with the microtubule-severing protein Katanin by binding to its p80 regulatory subunit, inhibiting its interaction with microtubules. This regulation is crucial during specific phases of the cell cycle, ensuring proper central spindle assembly for cytokinesis and suppressing cell migration (Maru2009The). LZTS2 is involved in the hierarchical transport of proteins to the midbody during cytokinesis, interacting with several centrosomal proteins, including Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and γ-tubulin (Maru2009The).

LZTS2 also interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, to repress its transcriptional activity and regulate its subcellular localization. This interaction influences processes such as cell migration and spindle formation, highlighting LZTS2's role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Shen2018LZTS2; Maru2009The). LZTS2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates microtubule dynamics and β-catenin activity, contributing to proper mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation (Maru2009The).

## Clinical Significance
LZTS2 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In prostate cancer, LZTS2 is often deleted alongside PTEN, another tumor suppressor gene, leading to enhanced β-catenin activity and accelerated tumor progression. This suggests that the combined loss of LZTS2 and PTEN significantly contributes to prostate tumorigenesis (Yu2017LZTS2). In colorectal cancer, RRP15 deficiency induces ribosome stress, which increases LZTS2 expression, leading to the suppression of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibiting cancer proliferation and metastasis (Dong2023RRP15).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LZTS2 expression is often reduced, and its regulation is influenced by the linc00921/miR-9-5p axis. This axis affects the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis, by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Zhang2022Long). In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), LZTS2 promoter hypermethylation is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Shen2018LZTS2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LZTS2 in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LZTS2 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K, competing with the catalytic subunit p110 for binding. This interaction disrupts the p85-p110 association, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis and radioresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Lu2021βTrcp; Xu2018LZTS2). LZTS2 also interacts with β-catenin, a protein involved in cell-cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. LZTS2 enhances the nuclear export of β-catenin, reducing its levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which suppresses cell migration and transcriptional activity (Maru2009The).

In the context of cell division, LZTS2 interacts with several centrosomal proteins, including Polo-like kinase 1, γ-tubulin, and mitotic kinesin-like protein 1, playing a role in cytokinesis and microtubule dynamics (Maru2009The). It also binds to α-catenin, a mechanosensitive protein, influencing cytokinesis fidelity by localizing to cell-cell junctions and midbody structures (Wang2023αcatenin). These interactions highlight LZTS2's role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular integrity.
