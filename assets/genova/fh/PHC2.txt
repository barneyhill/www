# PHC2

## Overview
PHC2, or polyhomeotic homolog 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which are critical for transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. The PHC2 protein is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining repressive chromatin states through histone modifications, such as H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub (Bae2019Phc2). Structurally, PHC2 contains conserved domains, including a (Cys)4-type zinc coordination domain and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the formation of higher-order chromatin structures (Isono2005Mammalian; Tonkin2002Identification). Functionally, PHC2 is involved in various biological processes, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell mobilization and embryonic development, particularly in the repression of Hox genes (Isono2005Mammalian; Bae2019Phc2). Through its interactions with other PcG proteins, such as BMI1 and CBX4, PHC2 contributes to the assembly and function of PRC1 complexes, underscoring its importance in gene expression regulation (Vandamme2011Interaction; Gray2016BMI1).

## Structure
The PHC2 protein is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and plays a role in transcriptional repression. It consists of 858 amino acids and includes several conserved domains that contribute to its function. The protein features a (Cys)4-type zinc coordination domain, which is involved in structural stability and potentially in protein-protein interactions (Tonkin2002Identification). The C-terminal region of PHC2 contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is crucial for mediating homodimerization and forming higher-order chromatin structures (Isono2005Mammalian; Tonkin2002Identification). This domain is known for its ability to self-associate and engage in heterotypic interactions, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes (Isono2005Mammalian).

PHC2 shares highly conserved N-terminal domains with PHC3, which are not as conserved in PHC1 or the Drosophila polyhomeotic proteins, suggesting unique functional roles (Tonkin2002Identification). The protein is part of multimeric complexes, such as the hPRC-H-like complex, and interacts with other PcG proteins, including Phc1, to regulate gene expression (Isono2005Mammalian). The presence of these domains and interactions highlights the importance of PHC2 in maintaining chromatin structure and gene repression.

## Function
PHC2 (polyhomeotic homolog 2) is a component of the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, specifically part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which plays a crucial role in maintaining transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, PHC2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression by modulating histone modifications, such as enhancing H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub, which are associated with repressive chromatin states (Bae2019Phc2).

PHC2 functions by binding to specific genomic loci, such as the Vcam1 gene in bone marrow stromal cells, to repress transcription. This repression is crucial for processes like hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization from the bone marrow, as it regulates the expression of adhesion molecules that affect cell migration (Bae2019Phc2).

In addition to its role in hematopoiesis, PHC2 is involved in embryonic development, particularly in the repression of Hox genes, which are essential for proper axial skeleton patterning and skull development. PHC2 acts synergistically with other PcG proteins, such as PHC1, to maintain the transcriptional repression of these genes, ensuring normal developmental processes (Isono2005Mammalian).

## Interactions
PHC2 is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and interacts with various proteins within this complex. It is expressed as two isoforms in mammals: PHC2a and PHC2b. Both isoforms can associate with CBX proteins, but PHC2b is more commonly found in PRC1 complexes, particularly interacting with CBX4 through the conserved Pc box of CBX4 (Vandamme2011Interaction).

PHC2 also interacts with BMI1, another core component of PRC1. The interaction between PHC2 and BMI1 involves the central domain of BMI1, which adopts an ubiquitin-like (UBL) fold. This domain is crucial for the interaction, forming an antiparallel beta-sheet stabilized by hydrogen bonds with PHC2, which adopts a beta-hairpin conformation (Gray2016BMI1). The interaction is characterized by a high affinity and involves specific residues from both proteins (Gray2016BMI1).

PHC2 is also part of a multimeric protein complex similar to hPRC-H, associating with proteins like Rnf110, Rnf2, and Phc1, as confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Isono2005Mammalian). These interactions suggest that PHC2 plays a significant role in the formation and function of PRC1 complexes, contributing to the regulation of gene expression through chromatin association.
