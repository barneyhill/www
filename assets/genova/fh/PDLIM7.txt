# PDLIM7

## Overview
PDLIM7 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ and LIM domain 7, which is a member of the Enigma sub-family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of both PDZ and LIM domains, which are essential for mediating protein-protein interactions. PDZ and LIM domain 7 functions primarily as a scaffold protein, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization by linking membrane and cytosolic proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. It is involved in various cellular processes, including actin dynamics, cellular signaling, and muscle development. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as β-tropomyosin and integrin-related signaling pathways, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function. Additionally, PDZ and LIM domain 7 is implicated in several signaling pathways, including TGF-β and BMP, which are crucial for bone formation and cell differentiation (Jiang2023PDZ; D’Cruz2016PDLIM7; Urban2016Pdlim7).

## Structure
PDLIM7 is a protein characterized by the presence of both PDZ and LIM domains, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions. The PDZ domain of PDLIM7 is known for its ability to bind to the C-terminus of target proteins, typically recognizing type III PDZ binding motifs (PDZbm) in an unconventional 'upright' manner due to steric hindrance from an acidic Glu sidechain. This binding is stabilized by a conserved arginine residue, Arg17, which facilitates specific electrostatic interactions (healy2023pdlim; Healy2021Proteomic).

The LIM domains of PDLIM7, which are zinc-binding motifs, adopt a zinc finger fold that stabilizes their structure and facilitates protein interactions. PDLIM7 contains a triple tandem repeat of LIM domains, with the LIM3 domain binding to the endocytic signal peptide in the INSR and the LIM2 domain interacting with the carboxy terminus of the receptor tyrosine kinase RET (healy2023pdlim).

PDLIM7 is part of the Enigma sub-family and is involved in cytoskeletal organization, acting as a scaffold that connects membrane and cytosolic proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its interactions (healy2023pdlim).

## Function
PDLIM7, also known as PDZ and LIM domain 7, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling. It is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, which is essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating cellular processes such as migration and adhesion (Krcmery2010Nucleocytoplasmic; Urban2016Pdlim7). PDLIM7 interacts with actin filaments and is known to bind to β-tropomyosin, suggesting its involvement in the structural organization of the cytoskeleton (D’Cruz2016PDLIM7).

In healthy human cells, PDLIM7 is active in the cytoplasm, where it associates with the actin cytoskeleton in undifferentiated myoblasts and translocates to a diffuse cytoplasmic location in differentiated myotubes, indicating a role in muscle development and differentiation (D’Cruz2016PDLIM7). PDLIM7 is also involved in integrin-related signaling, which is crucial for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, allowing cells to adapt to mechanical stress (Jiang2023PDZ).

PDLIM7's role extends to the regulation of signaling pathways, including the TGF-β and BMP pathways, which are important for bone formation and cell differentiation (Jiang2023PDZ). Its involvement in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular structure and function.

## Clinical Significance
PDLIM7 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions with other proteins. In thyroid cancer, PDLIM7 expression increases with cancer progression, correlating with advanced stages and poorer survival outcomes. It interacts with oncogenic proteins such as MDM2 and PI3K/AKT, but not with BMP-1, and shows a strong interaction with VDR and DBP, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Rood2023Regulatory). In acute myeloid leukemia, high PDLIM7 expression is an independent risk factor for poor survival, and in breast cancer, it prevents the degradation of RETMEN2A, promoting metastasis. PDLIM7 also enhances cancer cell growth in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer by inhibiting p53 degradation through MDM2 interaction (Jiang2023PDZ).

PDLIM7's role extends to influencing treatment responses. During CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy, PDLIM7 stabilizes MDM2, preventing senescence in cancer cells. Its interaction with CDH18 can modulate therapy outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Klein2018PDLIM7). Additionally, PDLIM7's involvement in the p53-MDM2 axis highlights its role in cancer cell malignancy, particularly through post-translational modifications affecting its interactions (Hu2023Cancerderived).

## Interactions
PDLIM7, a member of the PDZ and LIM domain protein family, engages in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with MDM2, a key regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, to inhibit MDM2 autoubiquitination, thereby affecting MDM2 turnover during CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy-induced senescence (Klein2018PDLIM7). PDLIM7 also forms a specific interaction with CDH18 in LS8817 cells, contributing to the formation of cytoplasmic foci, which is crucial for its role in cellular responses to therapy (Klein2018PDLIM7).

In the context of inflammatory signaling, PDLIM7 interacts with PDLIM2 and p62/Sqstm1 to promote the degradation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. This interaction is essential for controlling NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses by facilitating the proteasomal degradation of p65, thereby suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Jodo2020PDLIM7).

PDLIM7 also binds to sorting nexin SNX17 through its PDZ domain. This interaction involves the C-terminal residues of SNX17 docking into a conserved surface pocket on PDLIM7, highlighting a unique binding orientation that is crucial for the structural basis of their interaction (Healy2021Proteomic).
