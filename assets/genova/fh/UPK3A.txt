# UPK3A

## Overview
The UPK3A gene encodes the protein uroplakin 3A, which is a critical component of the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. Uroplakin 3A is a transmembrane protein that plays a vital role in forming the asymmetric unit membrane, contributing to the structural integrity and barrier function of the bladder. This protein is essential for maintaining the impermeability of the bladder lining, thereby protecting underlying tissues from urine penetration (Szymańska2021Initial). Uroplakin 3A is involved in urothelial cell differentiation and interacts with other uroplakin proteins to form urothelial plaques, which are crucial for the bladder's permeability barrier (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation; Thumbikat2009BacteriaInduced). Additionally, UPK3A has clinical significance, as mutations in this gene have been linked to renal hypodysplasia and potentially to vesicoureteral reflux, although these associations are considered rare and weak, respectively (Jiang2004Lack; SCHONFELDER2006Mutations).

## Function
Uroplakin 3A (UPK3A) is a protein encoded by the UPK3A gene, primarily expressed in the urothelium, the epithelial lining of the urinary tract. UPK3A plays a crucial role in forming the asymmetric unit membrane, which is essential for the barrier function and structural integrity of the bladder. This protein contributes to the impermeability of the bladder lining, preventing urine from penetrating underlying tissues and maintaining the integrity of the urinary tract (Szymańska2021Initial).

UPK3A is involved in urothelial cell differentiation, which is vital for the proper function of the urothelium. The protein's glycosylation is significant, as changes in its glycan structures are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and urinary tract infections (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation). In healthy cells, UPK3A is part of a family of integral membrane proteins that contribute to the formation of urothelial plaques, creating a membrane zipper that enhances the barrier function of the urothelium (KątnikPrastowska2014Glycosylation).

The protein's role in maintaining the barrier function is crucial for protecting deeper cells and tissues from harmful substances in the urine, thus playing a significant role in the homeostasis of the urothelial tract (Szymańska2021Initial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UPK3A gene, which encodes the uroplakin 3A protein, have been implicated in renal hypodysplasia, a congenital condition characterized by underdeveloped kidneys. A study identified a de novo missense mutation (Gly202Asp) in a patient with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), suggesting a potential link between UPK3A mutations and renal malformations (SCHONFELDER2006Mutations). However, these mutations are considered rare causes of renal hypodysplasia, with a low mutation detection rate observed in a cohort of 170 patients (SCHONFELDER2006Mutations).

Alterations in UPK3A expression or mutations may also be associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition involving the backward flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys. Although studies in mice have shown that UP III gene deficiency can lead to VUR, human studies have found only a weak association between UP gene alterations and VUR, suggesting that these mutations may not play a major role in the condition (Jiang2004Lack). The presence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UP III has been noted as weak risk factors for VUR, indicating potential disease heterogeneity (Jiang2004Lack).

## Interactions
UPK3A (uroplakin 3A) is a protein that plays a significant role in the formation of urothelial plaques by interacting with other uroplakin proteins. It forms heterodimers with UPK1B (uroplakin Ib), which is essential for its surface expression and function in the urothelium (Thumbikat2009BacteriaInduced). This interaction is crucial for the export of uroplakins from the endoplasmic reticulum and their assembly into the urothelial plaques that contribute to the bladder's permeability barrier (Thumbikat2009BacteriaInduced).

UPK3A also interacts with the bacterial adhesin FimH, a component of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which binds to the uroplakin receptor complex. This interaction initiates a signaling cascade that includes the phosphorylation of UPK3A at threonine-244 by casein kinase II, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels. These signaling events are critical for bacterial invasion and urothelial cell apoptosis (Thumbikat2009BacteriaInduced). The phosphorylation of UPK3A is a key step in mediating calcium signaling in response to bacterial infection, highlighting its role as a signal transducer in the bladder's response to UPEC (Thumbikat2009BacteriaInduced).
