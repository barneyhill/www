# IER3IP1

## Overview
IER3IP1, or Immediate Early Response 3 Interacting Protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in critical cellular processes such as cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking. The protein, characterized by an 82 amino-acid sequence, contains a G-patch domain, which is typically associated with RNA binding, although IER3IP1 itself does not interact with nucleic acids (Yiu2004Cloning). Functionally, IER3IP1 is implicated in the ER stress response and is essential for maintaining ER homeostasis, particularly in pancreatic beta cells and the developing brain cortex (Shalev2013Microcephaly; Abdel‐Salam2012A). Mutations in the IER3IP1 gene are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including Microcephaly with Simplified Gyral Pattern, Epilepsy, and Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Syndrome-1 (MEDS1), highlighting its clinical significance (Anitei2024IER3IP1mutations; Abdel‐Salam2012A).

## Structure
The IER3IP1 protein is an 82 amino-acid protein encoded by a full-length cDNA of 1304 base pairs. It is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and contains a G-patch domain, which is a conserved region found in several RNA-associated proteins and is suggested to be involved in RNA binding (Yiu2004Cloning). The G-patch domain is characterized by six highly conserved glycine residues and is located between positions 163 and 201 of the protein sequence (Yiu2004Cloning). This domain is often associated with RNA processing functions, although IER3IP1 lacks an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) (Yiu2004Cloning).

The primary structure of IER3IP1 includes its amino acid sequence, but detailed information on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not provided in the available data (Yiu2004Cloning). The presence of a transmembrane domain at the C-terminal suggests a specific orientation and potential interactions within the ER membrane (Yiu2004Cloning). The protein has a calculated molecular weight of 8.9 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.72 (Yiu2004Cloning). Homologs of IER3IP1 are found in mouse, drosophila, and yeast, indicating a conserved function across species (Yiu2004Cloning).

## Function
The IER3IP1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cytokinesis, particularly in vesicle trafficking during cell division. In healthy human cells, IER3IP1 is involved in the movement and fusion of secretory and recycling vesicles at the ingressing furrow, which is essential for delivering new membrane and proteins necessary for the progression of the cleavage furrow and subsequent abscission (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are). The protein localizes to Rab11 vesicles and interacts with Rab11, a GTPase required for vesicle fusion during cytokinesis, suggesting its involvement in vesicle docking, tethering, or fusion (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are).

IER3IP1 is also associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is implicated in the ER stress response, playing a role in maintaining ER homeostasis and influencing cellular stress responses (Abdel‐Salam2012A). In the context of organismal outcomes, IER3IP1 is expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where its loss can lead to proinsulin misfolding, ER stress, and reduced proliferation of beta cells, ultimately affecting insulin production (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are). Additionally, IER3IP1 is highly expressed in the developing brain cortex, where it may help regulate apoptosis and ensure proper neural development (Shalev2013Microcephaly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IER3IP1 gene are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as Microcephaly with Simplified Gyral Pattern, Epilepsy, and Permanent Neonatal Diabetes Syndrome-1 (MEDS1). This condition is characterized by microcephaly, a simplified gyral pattern, severe epilepsy, and early-onset infantile diabetes mellitus. Patients often exhibit dysmorphic facial features, skeletal deformities, and typically have a shortened lifespan, dying in early childhood between the ages of 1.5 to 8 years (Anitei2024IER3IP1mutations; Abdel‐Salam2012A).

Specific mutations in IER3IP1, such as p.V21G, p.L78P, and a compound heterozygosity involving p.V21G and a c.79delT deletion (p.T79D), have been identified in patients with MEDS1. These mutations disrupt the normal function of the IER3IP1 protein, which is crucial for ER-Golgi transport, leading to retention of specific cell-surface receptors and secreted proteins within the ER. This affects neuronal migration and results in ER membrane distension and increased lysosomal activity (Anitei2024IER3IP1mutations).

In addition to MEDS1, IER3IP1 mutations have been linked to increased β-cell death and decreased proliferation, contributing to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. This is associated with the activation of apoptotic pathways and ER stress, further implicating IER3IP1 in the pathology of diabetes (Sun2017IER3IP1).

## Interactions
IER3IP1 interacts with Rab11 vesicles in both Drosophila neuroblasts and human cells, suggesting a role in vesicle docking, tethering, or fusion during cytokinesis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed that IER3IP1 physically interacts with Rab11, a protein involved in vesicle trafficking (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are). Pathogenic mutations in IER3IP1, such as V21G, L78P, and T79*, disrupt its interaction with Rab11, affecting its stability and localization to Rab11 vesicles (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are).

IER3IP1 also interacts with TMEM167A, a Golgi membrane-localized protein, indicating a potential role in the docking or fusion of COPII vesicles with the Golgi membrane (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are). Despite the presence of a G-patch domain, which is often associated with RNA binding, there is no specific evidence of IER3IP1 interacting with nucleic acids (Yiu2004Cloning). The precise molecular function of IER3IP1 in these interactions remains to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in critical cellular processes like cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking is evident (Kakade2024InseparableIER3IP1are).
