# ZNF420

## Overview
ZNF420, also known as APAK, is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 420, a member of the KRAB-ZFP (Kruppel-associated box zinc finger protein) family. This protein is characterized by its KRAB domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression, and multiple zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding, allowing it to function as a transcriptional regulator. ZNF420 plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by interacting with the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby modulating p53-mediated apoptotic pathways. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. The gene has been studied in the context of various cancers, where alterations in its expression and methylation patterns have been linked to tumorigenesis, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Gaykalova2015Outlier; Munro2018Two; Lim2015Transcriptional).

## Structure
ZNF420, also known as APAK, is a KRAB-ZFP (Kruppel-associated box zinc finger protein) characterized by a KRAB domain located at the N-terminal (amino acids 6-86) and 19 zinc finger motifs in the C-terminal region (Lim2015Transcriptional). The KRAB domain is involved in transcriptional repression, while the zinc finger motifs facilitate DNA binding, playing a crucial role in the protein's function as a transcriptional regulator (Lim2015Transcriptional).

The primary structure of ZNF420 includes cysteine and histidine residues that form the zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its DNA-binding capability. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to enable interaction with DNA, and the quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, such as p53, which ZNF420 negatively regulates in a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway (Lim2015Transcriptional).

Post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, affect the stability and localization of ZNF420, influencing its function under cellular stress conditions (Lim2015Transcriptional). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms of ZNF420.

## Function
ZNF420, also known as APAK, is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, ZNF420 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, functioning to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell death pathways, which helps maintain normal cellular functions and prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation (Munro2018Two).

ZNF420 is part of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. These proteins often act as transcription factors, regulating gene expression. ZNF420 is typically active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and other nuclear proteins, contributing to processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. This activity is essential for maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Munro2018Two).

In the context of cancer, ZNF420 has been studied for its DNA methylation patterns, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor gene, with hypermethylation associated with reduced expression in cancerous tissues (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF420, also known as APAK, has been implicated in various cancers due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), colon and rectal adenocarcinomas (COAD/READ), and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), ZNF420 exhibits mutations at critical positions within its zinc finger domains. These mutations are thought to affect DNA-binding preferences, potentially leading to transcriptional dysregulation and contributing to cancer progression (Munro2018Two).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF420 shows significant promoter hypermethylation, particularly in HPV-negative patients, which correlates with decreased gene expression. This suggests that ZNF420 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its methylation serving as a potential biomarker for HNSCC (Gaykalova2015Outlier). The methylation patterns of ZNF420, along with other zinc finger genes, have been proposed as useful biomarkers for the detection and surveillance of HNSCC, especially in high-risk patients (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ZNF420 is associated with better patient survival and lower tumor grade when upregulated, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role in this context (Czerwinska2021Low).

## Interactions
ZNF420, also known as APAK, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular stress responses and cancer pathways. It acts as a p53-specific negative regulator in a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway, particularly in response to DNA damage and oncogenic stress. Under normal conditions, the stability of ZNF420 is regulated by the deSUMOylase SENP1. However, upon cellular stress, ZNF420 undergoes SUMOylation, leading to its dissociation from SENP1. This modification results in the translocation of ZNF420 from the nucleolus and subsequent inhibition of 47S pre-rRNA transcription, indicating its role in transcriptional repression during stress conditions (Lim2015Transcriptional).

The interaction between ZNF420 and SENP1 highlights its involvement in the regulation of protein stability and cellular localization, which are crucial for its function in stress response pathways. Although the specific interactions of ZNF420 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its role as a transcriptional repressor and its interaction with SENP1 suggest that it may participate in multiprotein complexes or engage in inhibitory interactions within cellular pathways (Lim2015Transcriptional).
