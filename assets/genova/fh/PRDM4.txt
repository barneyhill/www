# PRDM4

## Overview
PRDM4 is a gene that encodes the PR/SET domain 4 protein, a member of the PRDM family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PR domain and zinc finger motifs, which are involved in chromatin-mediated gene expression and transcriptional regulation (Di2021The; Briknarová2011The). Although PRDM4 lacks direct methyltransferase activity due to specific amino acid substitutions, it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation, by recruiting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) (Chittka2012Transcription). PRDM4 is also involved in neurotrophin signaling and cell cycle regulation, acting as a transcriptional repressor in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) (Di2013PRDM). Its expression and interactions are significant in cancer biology, where it can function as a tumor suppressor or contribute to cancer progression, depending on the context (Liu2018PRDM; Yang2021PRDM4).

## Structure
PRDM4 is a member of the PRDM protein family, characterized by the presence of a PR domain and zinc finger motifs. The PR domain in PRDM4 is similar to the SET domain, which is typically involved in chromatin-mediated gene expression, although PRDM4 itself may not have direct methyltransferase activity due to specific amino acid substitutions that prevent efficient SAM binding (Di2021The). The zinc finger motifs in PRDM4 include a zinc knuckle motif, which is a short sequence that binds zinc and is distinct from the longer C2H2-like zinc fingers. This zinc knuckle motif is conserved across several PR proteins and is involved in coordinating zinc through cysteine and histidine residues (Briknarová2011The).

The 3D structure of the zinc knuckle in PRDM4 has been determined using NMR spectroscopy, providing insights into its structural features and potential regulatory functions (Briknarová2011The). PRDM4 is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system, and plays a role in transcriptional regulation, nerve growth factor signal transduction, and cell growth arrest (Briknarová2011The). While PRDM4 is a non-essential transcriptional regulator during development, its genomic regions are frequently deleted in cancer, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor function (Di2021The).

## Function
PRDM4 (PR/SET domain 4) is a transcription factor involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation by recruiting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) to mediate histone arginine methylation. This process is crucial for controlling the timing of neurogenesis, as it involves the symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me2s), a modification associated with maintaining the undifferentiated state of cortical NSCs (Chittka2012Transcription). PRDM4's activity in the nucleus influences cell cycle progression by down-regulating cyclin E expression, which is essential for the G1-S phase transition (Di2013PRDM).

PRDM4 also interacts with the p75 neurotrophin receptor in neurotrophin signaling, acting as a transcriptional repressor. Upon nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment, PRDM4 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, a process specific to the p75 receptor, which is associated with reduced cell proliferation (Di2013PRDM). These activities highlight PRDM4's role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in neural development and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
PRDM4 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Alterations in PRDM4 expression or its interactions can significantly impact cancer progression and metastasis. In cervical cancer, PRDM4 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. It achieves this by inactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through the transactivation of PTEN, a known inhibitor of this pathway. Lower levels of PRDM4 expression are associated with increased tumor growth and reduced survival in cervical cancer patients (Yang2021PRDM4).

In metastatic prostate cancer, PRDM4 is involved in YAP-induced cell invasion by activating leukocyte-specific integrin β2 (ITGB2) expression. This interaction is crucial for cancer cell adhesion and invasion, suggesting that PRDM4 contributes to the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells (Liu2018PRDM). High PRDM4 expression is also correlated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer, liver cancer, and melanoma, indicating its role in cancer progression (Liu2018PRDM).

PRDM4's involvement in neurotrophin signaling and cell cycle regulation suggests potential implications in neurological conditions. Alterations in PRDM4 expression or mutations could impact neurotrophin signaling pathways and epigenetic modifications, which may have clinical significance in neurological diseases (Di2013PRDM).

## Interactions
PRDM4 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It is known to bind to specific DNA motifs in the PTEN promoter, enhancing PTEN transcription and thereby inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cervical carcinoma (Yang2021PRDM4). PRDM4 also forms a complex with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which is involved in histone arginine methylation, crucial for maintaining the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells (Chittka2012Transcription; Leszczyński2020Emerging).

In the context of cancer metastasis, PRDM4 interacts with Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TEAD transcription factors to mediate the expression of integrin β2 (ITGB2), facilitating cell invasion. This interaction involves the binding of PRDM4 to the WW domains of YAP, forming a heterotrimeric complex with TEAD4, which is critical for YAP-induced tumorigenesis and cell invasion (Liu2018PRDM). PRDM4's interaction with YAP and its role in the Hippo signaling pathway highlight its involvement in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2018PRDM).
