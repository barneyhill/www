# CILP

## Overview
The CILP gene encodes the cartilage intermediate layer protein, a significant component of the extracellular matrix in cartilaginous tissues. This protein is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce two distinct polypeptides, one of which is homologous to porcine nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase. The cartilage intermediate layer protein is characterized by a Type 1 thrombospondin-like repeat and is heavily involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cartilage. Functionally, CILP acts as a negative regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling, playing a crucial role in chondrocyte metabolism and cartilage homeostasis. It also interacts with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), influencing cellular signaling pathways that are vital for cartilage and cardiac tissue maintenance. Clinically, variations in the CILP gene have been associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as intervertebral disc degeneration and osteoarthritis, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Lorenzo1998Cloning; Mori2006Transcriptional; Kalichman2008The).

## Structure
The human CILP gene encodes the cartilage intermediate layer protein, which is synthesized as a precursor protein that is cleaved into two distinct polypeptides: CILP and a homologue to porcine nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (NTPPHase) (Lorenzo1998Cloning; Lorenzo1999The). The primary structure of CILP consists of 1184 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 21 amino acids, and features 30 cysteine residues and six putative N-glycosylation sites (Lorenzo1998Cloning). The NH2-terminal domain of CILP contains a Type 1 thrombospondin-like repeat and a hydrophobic region from amino acids 130-225 (Lorenzo1998Cloning).

The precursor protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin or furin-like proteases at a consensus sequence RX(K/R)R, resulting in the formation of two separate proteins (Lorenzo1998Cloning). Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, increase the molecular mass of CILP from 78.5 kDa to approximately 92 kDa (Lorenzo1998Cloning). The protein's structure is characterized by a high degree of intrachain disulfide cross-bridging due to the abundance of cysteine residues, which likely contributes to its stability and function in the extracellular matrix of cartilage (Lorenzo1998Cloning).

## Function
The CILP gene encodes the cartilage intermediate layer protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of cartilage tissue. In healthy human cells, CILP is primarily found in the extracellular matrix of cartilaginous tissues, including the middle zone of articular cartilage, meniscus, tendon, ligament, synovial membrane, and intervertebral disc (Mori2006Transcriptional). It is involved in cartilage scaffolding and contributes to the structural integrity of cartilage by being deposited into the extracellular matrix (Port2023A).

CILP is synthesized as a precursor protein that is processed into two distinct polypeptides: the N-terminal half corresponds to the classical CILP protein, and the C-terminal half is homologous to a porcine nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase (Lorenzo1998Cloning). The N-terminal domain of CILP contains a Type 1 thrombospondin-like repeat, which is associated with a hydrophobic region and a compact, disulfide-bonded region, indicating a high degree of intrachain disulfide cross-bridging (Lorenzo1998Cloning).

CILP interacts with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) by binding directly to it, acting as a negative regulator in chondrocytes, which suggests a role in a feedback loop that regulates chondrocyte metabolism (Mori2006Transcriptional). This interaction is crucial for maintaining cartilage homeostasis and regulating cellular processes such as chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation (Mori2006Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CILP gene have been associated with several musculoskeletal conditions, particularly intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) and osteoarthritis (OA). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CILP gene, +1184T/C, results in an amino acid substitution (Ile395Thr) and has been linked to IDD in Japanese populations, with an odds ratio of 1.61, indicating a significant risk factor (Kalichman2008The; Mayer2013Genetic). This SNP affects the binding and inhibition of TGF-β1, a growth factor crucial for maintaining extracellular matrix proteins in intervertebral discs, suggesting that CILP plays a role in the progression of IDD by modulating TGF-β signaling (Kalichman2008The).

Increased expression of CILP has been observed in degenerating discs, indicating its involvement in the pathogenesis of disc degeneration (Mayer2013Genetic). However, the association between CILP polymorphisms and IDD has not been consistently observed across different ethnic groups, such as Finnish and Chinese populations, suggesting potential population-specific effects (Kalichman2008The; Mayer2013Genetic).

CILP gene variants have also been linked to hand osteoarthritis, particularly in individuals with low variation in work tasks, highlighting a gene-environment interaction (Taipale2017Functional). The CILP rs2073711 SNP is associated with an increased risk of hand OA, especially among certain occupational groups (Taipale2017Functional).

## Interactions
Cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. CILP is known to interfere with the binding of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to their respective receptors. It binds to TGF-β, potentially sequestering it and preventing its interaction with its receptor, thereby inhibiting the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. This interference results in the suppression of SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the signaling pathway (Liu2020Cartilage). 

CILP also acts as an antagonist to IGF-1 by blocking its ability to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis and proliferation in chondrocytes. The N-terminal domain of CILP inhibits IGF-1-induced chondrocyte proliferation and IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation (Johnson2003One). 

In the context of cardiac fibrosis, CILP-1, a variant of CILP, inhibits TGF-β1-induced Smad3 activation by enhancing the interaction between Akt and Smad3, suggesting a physical interaction with the Akt/Smad3 signaling pathway (Zhang2018Cartilage). These interactions highlight CILP's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cartilage and cardiac tissue homeostasis.
