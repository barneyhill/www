# NCKAP1

## Overview
NCKAP1 (NCK-associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cellular processes such as motility, adhesion, and morphology. As a cytoplasmic protein, NCKAP1 is involved in actin polymerization by interacting with the Arp2/3 complex, thereby facilitating essential cellular functions like migration and phagocytosis (Noh2023Role). The protein's interactions within the WRC, including its binding with proteins such as WASF3 and CYFIP1, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular dynamics and signaling pathways (Teng2016The). NCKAP1's involvement in these processes also links it to various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Guo2020NCKAP1; Cao2023Disulfidptosisrelated).

## Structure
The NCKAP1 protein, a component of the WAVE regulatory complex, plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton organization. While the specific molecular structure of NCKAP1 is not detailed in the provided context, some insights into its interactions and functional domains are available. NCKAP1 is known to interact with other proteins within the WAVE regulatory complex, such as CYFIP2, and these interactions are critical for the stability and function of the complex (Xie2024Molecular).

NCKAP1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially facilitated by domains like the SH3 domain, which is common in proteins that mediate such interactions (Yamamoto2001Isolation). The protein's interaction with hNap1BP, a tyrosine kinase-binding protein, suggests the presence of proline-rich regions and SH3 domains, which are typical features that enable binding to other proteins like c-Abl and Nck (Yamamoto2001Isolation).

The context does not provide specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of NCKAP1, nor does it mention post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms. Therefore, further research would be necessary to elaborate on these structural aspects.

## Function
NCKAP1 (NCK associated protein 1) is a crucial component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. This protein is involved in various molecular processes essential for cell motility, adhesion, and morphology by regulating actin polymerization. NCKAP1 interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to reorganize actin filaments, facilitating processes such as cell migration and phagocytosis (Noh2023Role).

In healthy human cells, NCKAP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it is essential for the proper functioning of the cytoskeleton. It is involved in the regulation of cell migration and invasion, processes critical for normal cellular functions such as immune response and tissue repair (Kwon2023NCKassociated). NCKAP1's role in actin polymerization is vital for maintaining cell shape and enabling cellular movements, which are necessary for various physiological processes (Kwon2023NCKassociated).

The protein's involvement in the WAVE regulatory complex also suggests its participation in signaling pathways that control cell cycle progression and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Zhong2019NCKAP1).

## Clinical Significance
NCKAP1 (NCK associated protein 1) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. In cancer, alterations in NCKAP1 expression are linked to tumor progression and prognosis. For instance, in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), overexpression of NCKAP1 is associated with poor overall survival and advanced cancer stages (Cao2023Disulfidptosisrelated). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), higher NCKAP1 expression correlates with better patient outcomes, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role by enhancing the activation of the Rb1/p53 pathway (Zhong2019NCKAP1). In breast cancer, NCKAP1 is necessary for the stability of the WASF3 complex, promoting metastasis, and its high expression is linked to poor relapse-free survival (Teng2016The).

NCKAP1 is also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with autism-like features. Disruptive variants in NCKAP1 can lead to neurological issues, including sleep disturbances and seizures, and are linked to impaired neuronal migration during cortical development (Guo2020NCKAP1). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both cancer progression and neurodevelopmental disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
NCKAP1 (NCK associated protein 1) is a key component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. NCKAP1 interacts with several proteins, including WASF3, CYFIP1, and RAC1, forming a complex that is crucial for cellular processes such as cell invasion and metastasis, particularly in breast cancer cells (Teng2016The). The interaction between NCKAP1 and WASF3 is essential for the stability and activation of the WASF3 complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and cell motility (Teng2016The). 

NCKAP1 also interacts with the WAVE1 complex, which includes proteins like PIR121, Nap125, and HSPC300. This complex is regulated by the small GTPase Rac1 and the adapter protein Nck, which activate the WAVE1 complex, leading to actin nucleation (Eden2002Mechanism). NCKAP1 binds to activated Rac1, a GTP-binding protein, in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting its role in actin dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (KITAMURA1997Interaction). These interactions highlight the importance of NCKAP1 in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and its potential implications in cancer metastasis and other cellular processes.
