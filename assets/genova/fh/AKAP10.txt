# AKAP10

## Overview
AKAP10, or A-kinase anchoring protein 10, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). The protein, also known as D-AKAP2, is categorized as an anchoring protein due to its role in localizing PKA to specific subcellular compartments, such as the cytoplasm and mitochondria, thereby facilitating precise signal transduction. AKAP10 is integral to cardiac function, influencing heart rate and rhythm by modulating the sensitivity of cardiac cells to cholinergic inputs. It also plays a role in energy metabolism and apoptosis, impacting both cardiovascular and metabolic health. Variations in the AKAP10 gene, such as the Ile646Val polymorphism, have been associated with increased risks of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wirtenberger2006The; Neumann2009AKAP10; Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations).

## Function
AKAP10, also known as D-AKAP2, is a crucial A-kinase anchoring protein involved in the regulation of heart rate and rhythm in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which is vital for numerous biological processes, including the compartmentalization of cAMP (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations). AKAP10 is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it influences processes such as apoptosis and energy metabolism, impacting cardiovascular and metabolic health (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations).

In cardiomyocytes, AKAP10 is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in cardiac signaling pathways. It modulates the sensitivity of cardiac cells to cholinergic inputs from the vagus nerve, which is crucial for heart rhythm regulation (Tingley2007Genetrapped). The protein's role in anchoring PKA to specific cellular locations facilitates localized signal transduction, thereby influencing heart rate and rhythm (Scott2010AKinase).

AKAP10's involvement in the cAMP/PKA pathway and its ability to bind to both regulatory subunit type I and II isoforms of PKA highlight its importance in maintaining normal cardiac function and its potential as a target for cardiovascular disease interventions (Wong2004AKAP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the AKAP10 gene have been associated with various health conditions, particularly in the context of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The Ile646Val polymorphism in AKAP10 is linked to an increased risk of familial breast cancer. This variant affects the binding of AKAP10 to protein kinase A (PKA), potentially enhancing PKA activity and contributing to carcinogenesis (Wirtenberger2006The). 

In cardiovascular health, the I646V polymorphism is associated with changes in heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). Carriers of the Val646 variant tend to have higher heart rates and lower HRV, which are risk factors for sudden cardiac death (Neumann2009AKAP10). This polymorphism is also linked to shorter PR intervals on electrocardiograms, indicating altered cardiac electrical activity (Suryavanshi2018PolymorphismsMutations). 

In mice, mutations in Akap10 lead to increased sensitivity to cholinergic signals, resulting in arrhythmias and premature death, suggesting a similar potential impact in humans (Tingley2007Genetrapped). These findings underscore the clinical significance of AKAP10 in both cancer and cardiovascular disease contexts.

## Interactions
AKAP10 (A-kinase anchoring protein 10) is known for its dual-specific binding capability with the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA), specifically RIα and RIIα. This interaction is facilitated by a dual-specific binding domain located at amino acids 629-652, which has been shown to have significant binding affinities for both PKA-RIα and PKA-RIIα through molecular modeling and docking studies (Burgers2014A). AKAP10 utilizes three anchor points to form polar interactions and hydrogen bonds with the RIIα-D/D dimer, stabilizing the AKAP-RIIα complex (Götz2016AKAP18:PKARIIα).

A single-nucleotide polymorphism in AKAP10, resulting in an Ile to Val change at position 646, enhances its affinity for the type 1 PKA holoenzyme by threefold. This increased affinity has been linked to cardiac arrhythmias, as demonstrated in mutant mice that cannot anchor PKA, leading to arrhythmias and premature death (Scott2010AKinase).

AKAP10's interactions are not limited to PKA subunits. It also plays a role in cardiac contractility by affecting phosphorylation of proteins like phospholamban (PLB) and troponin I (TnI), which are crucial for cardiac myocyte contraction and relaxation (Dema2015Pharmacological).
