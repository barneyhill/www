# C1orf74

## Overview
C1orf74, also known as URCL4, is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein chromosome 1 open reading frame 74. This protein is implicated in the regulation of the EGFR/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as growth and survival, particularly in the context of cancer progression (Parida2023Increased). The expression of C1orf74 is notably increased in certain cancers, including cervical cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis, especially in HPV-positive cases (Parida2023Increased). The gene's promoter region is often hypomethylated in cancerous tissues, leading to its upregulation (Parida2023Increased). While primarily studied in cervical cancer, elevated expression of C1orf74 has also been observed in lung squamous cell carcinomas and thymoma, suggesting a broader role in oncogenesis (Parida2023Increased).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The C1orf74 gene, also known as URCL4, has been identified as having increased expression in cervical cancer, particularly in HPV-positive cases, and is associated with poor prognosis. This gene is involved in the regulation of the EGFR/AKT/mTORC1 pathway, which is significant in cancer progression (Parida2023Increased). Studies have shown that mRNA expression of C1orf74 is significantly higher in primary and metastatic cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, with even higher expression in HPV-positive tumors (Parida2023Increased). The increased expression of C1orf74 is linked to poor overall survival, making it a novel prognostic marker for cervical cancer (Parida2023Increased).

The promoter region of C1orf74 is hypomethylated in cervical cancer tissues, suggesting that hypomethylation leads to its increased expression (Parida2023Increased). Despite its association with poor prognosis, the study did not find a significant role for C1orf74 in metastasis, as its expression did not vary significantly across different pathological stages of cervical cancer (Parida2023Increased). The gene's expression was also found to be elevated in lung squamous cell carcinomas and thymoma, indicating its potential involvement in other cancer types (Parida2023Increased).
