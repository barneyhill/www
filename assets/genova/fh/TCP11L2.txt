# TCP11L2

## Overview
TCP11L2, or t-complex 11 like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in the context of cell migration and differentiation. The protein encoded by TCP11L2 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a crucial role in cellular processes by interacting with other proteins such as formin-like 2 (FMNL2). These interactions are vital for the assembly and rearrangement of microfilaments, impacting the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, which is essential for cytoskeletal dynamics. The expression and interaction of TCP11L2 with FMNL2 and other cytoskeletal components are significant for the migration and differentiation of muscle-derived satellite cells, highlighting its importance in muscle development (Li2020TCP11L2).

## Interactions
TCP11L2 is involved in interactions with several proteins that play a role in cell migration and differentiation. Notably, TCP11L2 interacts with the formin-like 2 (FMNL2) protein, which is crucial for cell migration. This interaction influences the expression of the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex, a key component in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have confirmed that TCP11L2 and FMNL2 bind to each other, and their expression colocalizes in the cytoplasm of bovine skeletal muscle-derived satellite cells (MDSCs) (Li2020TCP11L2).

TCP11L2 is also associated with microfilament assembly and cytoskeleton rearrangement, interacting with actin and tubulin. These interactions are essential for the migration and differentiation of MDSCs, as TCP11L2 affects the expression of proteins related to these processes (Li2020TCP11L2). The study suggests that TCP11L2, through its interaction with FMNL2 and other cytoskeletal components, plays a significant role in regulating the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for effective cell migration and differentiation during muscle development (Li2020TCP11L2).
