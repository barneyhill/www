# ARID1A

## Overview
ARID1A is a gene that encodes the AT-rich interaction domain 1A protein, a pivotal component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. This protein is categorized as a chromatin remodeler and plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by modifying chromatin structure, thereby facilitating access to transcription factors. The ARID1A protein is characterized by its ARID domain, which is involved in non-sequence-specific DNA binding, and other domains that contribute to its interactions within the SWI/SNF complex and with various transcription factors (Odnokoz2021ARID1; Chandler2013ARID1aDNA). Functionally, ARID1A is essential for processes such as cell differentiation, development, and maintenance of cell identity, and it is involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Hargreaves2011ATPdependent; Pagliaroli2021The). Clinically, mutations in the ARID1A gene are associated with several cancers, including ovarian, colorectal, and gastric cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor (Xu2021The; Mehrvarz2021ARID1A).

## Structure
The ARID1A protein is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and is characterized by several distinct domains. It contains an ARID (AT-rich interactive domain), which is a conserved helix-turn-helix motif of about 100 amino acids. This domain is involved in DNA binding, although it binds DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner (Odnokoz2021ARID1; Chandler2013ARID1aDNA). The ARID domain includes multiple alpha-helices and forms a hydrophobic pocket crucial for protein stability and DNA interaction (Chandler2013ARID1aDNA).

ARID1A also features a BAF250 C domain, which is important for the assembly of the BAF complex and interactions with other proteins (Odnokoz2021ARID1). The protein contains multiple LXXLL motifs, an elongin-binding BC box motif, and a nuclear localization signal, which are involved in its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and protein-protein interactions (Odnokoz2021ARID1).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination play roles in regulating ARID1A's stability and function. Phosphorylation by nuclear kinase ATM is necessary for its recognition by ubiquitin ligases, leading to degradation (Odnokoz2021ARID1). The protein is subject to proteasomal degradation primarily in the nucleus, influenced by mutations in its nuclear localization and export signals (Odnokoz2021ARID1).

## Function
The ARID1A gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a vital role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure to make it more accessible to transcription factors (Wang2004Expression; Pagliaroli2021The). This process is essential for various cellular functions, including differentiation, development, and maintenance of cell identity (Pagliaroli2021The). In healthy human cells, ARID1A is involved in the regulation of pluripotency and cell fate determination, which are crucial for proper development and differentiation (Pagliaroli2021The).

ARID1A is active in the nucleus, where it influences DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation (Hargreaves2011ATPdependent). It is particularly important for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into various cell lineages, including the mesodermal layer, and is involved in the generation of myeloid colonies and normal T cell maturation (Pagliaroli2021The). The protein's activity is linked to tissue-specific gene expression and the restriction of cell proliferation, playing a significant role in normal differentiation and development (Wang2004Expression). ARID1A's function in chromatin remodeling is facilitated by ATP hydrolysis, which allows the SWI/SNF complex to alter chromatin structure and promote gene expression necessary for cell differentiation and development (Pagliaroli2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARID1A gene are implicated in a variety of cancers, often acting as a tumor suppressor. In colorectal cancer, ARID1A mutations are associated with increased tumor mutational burden and immune activation, particularly in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. These mutations correlate with higher expression of immune checkpoint genes and increased T cell infiltration, suggesting potential susceptibility to immune therapy (Mehrvarz2021ARID1A).

In ovarian cancer, ARID1A mutations are prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) and endometrioid carcinomas, with mutation rates of 46%-57% and 30%, respectively. These mutations are linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and are more frequent in deficient mismatch repair OCCC (Wiegand2010ARID1AMutations; Xu2021The).

In gastric cancer, ARID1A acts as a driver gene with mutation rates ranging from 8% to 31%, often accompanied by wild-type TP53. These mutations are associated with an altered immune microenvironment, making ARID1A a potential biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition (Xu2021The).

ARID1A mutations also play a role in breast cancer, particularly in luminal A or HER2-rich subtypes, where low expression is linked to poor survival outcomes. The gene's status can influence responses to treatments like endocrine therapies and CDK4/6 inhibitors (Cheng2021ARID1A).

## Interactions
ARID1A is a key component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, where it interacts with various subunits, including the catalytic ATPase subunits SMARCA4/BRG1 or SMARCA2/BRM, and non-catalytic subunits such as SMARCB1/SNF5, BAF155, and BAF170. These interactions are crucial for the nucleosome remodeling activity of the SWI/SNF complexes (Wu2013ARID1A). ARID1A also interacts with transcription factors and transcriptional coactivator/corepressor complexes, contributing to transcriptional regulation. It has been shown to interact with nuclear hormone receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor, through a C-terminal region containing LXXLL motifs (Wu2013ARID1A).

ARID1A is involved in DNA interactions that are essential for the occupancy of promoters by the SWI/SNF complex. The ARID domain of ARID1A is crucial for these interactions, forming a hydrophobic pocket necessary for binding (Chandler2013ARID1aDNA). The ARID domain interacts with DNA primarily in the major groove using an atypical helix-turn-helix motif, with specific residues forming hydrogen bonds with DNA bases, contributing to binding specificity (Maulik2019Molecular).

ARID1A also interacts with proteins outside the SWI/SNF complex, such as the tumor suppressor p53, and coactivator or corepressor complexes like p300/CBP and SMAD2, to regulate transcription (Luo2020Remodeling). These interactions highlight ARID1A's multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression.
