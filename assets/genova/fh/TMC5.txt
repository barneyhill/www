# TMC5

## Overview
TMC5, or transmembrane channel-like 5, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring multiple transmembrane helices that form a pore, potentially functioning as an anion-assisted non-selective ion channel and lipid scramblase. TMC5 is primarily localized at the tips of microvilli in intestinal epithelial cells, where it is involved in mechanosensitive processes and mechanotransduction, possibly in conjunction with calcium and integrin binding protein 3 (CIB3) (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). The protein's ability to conduct ions, particularly chloride ions, and its role in lipid scrambling suggest its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to mechanical stimuli. TMC5 is also implicated in various cellular signaling pathways and cancer-related processes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022TMC5).

## Structure
The TMC5 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes multiple transmembrane helices. Homology-based structural models of TMC5 reveal the presence of 10 transmembrane helices, with a significant pore formed by helices TM4 to TM8 at the protein-lipid interface. This pore is highly conserved among TMC proteins, indicating its functional importance (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). The pore cavity of TMC5 is more positively charged compared to TMC1, which may influence its ion conduction properties (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

TMC5 also forms dimeric complexes, with a dimeric interface created by swapped TM10 helices, similar to the structures of TMC1 and TMC2 (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the ion conduction pathway in TMC5 is occluded by residues from TM4 and TM6, and the protein exhibits a dynamic chloride-binding site (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

Specific residues such as R717, R635, R641, and R736 are involved in ion selectivity and interaction, with some being unique to TMC5 (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). These structural features suggest that TMC5 may function as an anion-assisted non-selective ion channel, with potential roles in ion permeation and lipid scrambling (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

## Function
TMC5 (transmembrane channel-like 5) is a protein that is suggested to function as both an ion channel and a lipid scramblase. It is localized at the tips of microvilli in intestinal epithelial cells, where it is involved in mechanosensitive processes. TMC5, along with TMC4, is thought to participate in mechanotransduction, potentially forming a complex with calcium and integrin binding protein 3 (CIB3) (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). Structural models and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that TMC5 has a pore that can conduct ions, with a preference for chloride ions, although lipid insertion can block this conduction (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

TMC5 is also implicated in lipid scrambling, a process that involves the movement of lipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the cell membrane, which can affect membrane asymmetry and cell signaling (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). The protein's role in ion conduction and lipid scrambling suggests it may be crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to mechanical stimuli in the gut (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
The TMC5 gene is implicated in various human cancers, with its expression levels and mutations affecting prognosis and survival outcomes. TMC5 is highly expressed in several cancers, including skin cutaneous melanoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and breast cancer, where its alterations are linked to significant differences in overall survival and disease-specific survival (Zhang2022TMC5). In prostate cancer, TMC5 is significantly upregulated and associated with clinical Gleason score and PSA levels, promoting cancer cell proliferation through cell cycle regulation (Zhang2019Transmembrane). Knockdown of TMC5 in prostate cancer cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-Fluorouracil (Zhang2019Transmembrane).

In renal clear cell carcinoma, TMC5 expression is downregulated and associated with worse overall and disease-specific survival, although it is not confirmed as an independent prognostic factor (Tang2023Comprehensive). In lung adenocarcinoma, TMC5 is overexpressed and identified as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis, correlating with longer survival (Arroyo2020Expressionbased). These findings suggest that TMC5 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TMC5 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that suggest its involvement in various cellular processes. Notably, TMC5 interacts with calcium and integrin binding protein 3 (CIB3). This interaction has been demonstrated through in vitro experiments using NMR spectroscopy, which showed that fragments of TMC5 interact with CIB3, indicating a stable complex formation (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane). Co-transfection experiments in COS7 cells further confirmed the interaction, showing that CIB3 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum when co-expressed with TMC5 (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).

TMC5 is also part of a broader protein interaction network, as identified using the STRING database, which includes 34 potential interactors. These interactions suggest that TMC5 is involved in significant biological pathways, particularly in the context of cancer (Zhang2022TMC5). The protein's interaction with the TMEM family and its role as an activator of pathways such as PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK, and TSC/mTOR further highlight its involvement in cellular signaling and cancer-related processes (Zhang2022TMC5).

These interactions underscore TMC5's potential role in mechanosensitive processes and its function as an ion channel or lipid scramblase, particularly at microvillar tips in intestinal epithelial cells (Ebrahim2024Transmembrane).
