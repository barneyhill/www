# SH3BGRL2

## Overview
SH3BGRL2 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain binding glutamate rich protein like 2, a protein involved in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and cell signaling. This protein is categorized as a signaling molecule due to its role in modulating pathways that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. SH3BGRL2 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme. The protein interacts with key components of the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing the phosphorylation and activity of downstream effectors such as YAP, which are critical for tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, SH3BGRL2's expression levels are often downregulated in various cancers, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yin2020SH3BGRL2; Nie2021SH3BGRL2).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3BGRL2 gene is implicated in various human cancers, where its expression is often downregulated, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), SH3BGRL2 expression is significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages, metastasis, and decreased overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yin2020SH3BGRL2). SH3BGRL2 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in ccRCC through the Hippo/TEAD1/Twist1 signaling pathway, affecting processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yin2020SH3BGRL2).

In glioblastoma, SH3BGRL2 functions as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels correlating with higher tumor grades and poor prognosis. Overexpression of SH3BGRL2 in glioblastoma cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and the self-renewal of glioma stem cells, suggesting its role in tumor suppression (Nie2021SH3BGRL2).

SH3BGRL2 is also downregulated in other cancers, including breast, uterus, esophagus, brain, blood, lung, and skin cancers, where its reduced expression is linked to poor prognosis in several types, such as ovarian cancer and breast cancer (Yin2020SH3BGRL2).

## Interactions
SH3BGRL2 is involved in interactions with components of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is positively correlated with LATS1 and LATS2, key components of this pathway, and regulates the phosphorylation of YAP, a downstream effector. This regulation influences YAP's nuclear translocation and interaction with TEAD1, which is significant for tumor growth and metastasis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Yin2020SH3BGRL2). SH3BGRL2's interaction with the Hippo/TEAD1 pathway leads to the modulation of Twist1 expression, a key regulator in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Yin2020SH3BGRL2).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SH3BGRL2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the expression of SOX2 and CD133, which are key regulators of glioma stem cell self-renewal. Although specific protein interactions in GBM are not detailed, SH3BGRL2's involvement in signaling pathways related to tumor suppression and stem cell regulation is suggested (Nie2021SH3BGRL2). These interactions highlight SH3BGRL2's role in modulating critical pathways involved in tumor progression and metastasis.
