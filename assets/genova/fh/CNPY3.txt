# CNPY3

## Overview
CNPY3, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as CNPY3, functions primarily as a cochaperone within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in protein folding and trafficking. This protein is essential for the modulation of FGF receptor activity, thereby influencing key cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and survival (Gao2024Canopy). CNPY3 is also involved in the maturation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) through its interaction with the hsp90 paralogue gp96, highlighting its importance in immune response regulation (Liu2010Folding). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Xiang2021Genetic; Gao2024Canopy).

## Function
CNPY3, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 3, is a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and survival. CNPY3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in protein folding and trafficking, thereby influencing cell signaling and organismal development. This protein modulates FGF receptor activity, which is essential for proper cellular communication and function (Gao2024Canopy).

In healthy human cells, CNPY3 plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the correct folding and processing of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. This function is vital for the proper functioning of the FGF signaling pathways, which are involved in numerous physiological processes, including embryonic development and tissue repair. Although specific details about CNPY3's function in healthy cells are not extensively detailed in the provided context, its involvement in these fundamental cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (Gao2024Canopy).

## Clinical Significance
CNPY3, also known as canopy FGF signaling regulator 3, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), CNPY3 is significantly up-regulated and associated with advanced tumor stages and poor survival outcomes. High CNPY3 expression correlates with decreased overall survival and disease-specific survival in COAD patients, making it an independent prognostic factor alongside age and tumor stage (Gao2024Canopy). Functional studies indicate that CNPY3 influences cancer cell behavior through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, affecting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Gao2024Canopy).

In gastric cancer, the SLITRK4-CNPY3 axis promotes liver metastasis by enhancing TrkB receptor endocytosis and recycling, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. High CNPY3 expression in gastric cancer tissues is linked to worse overall survival (Zhou2023The).

Mutations in CNPY3 have also been associated with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 60 (EIEE60), a neurological disorder characterized by developmental delay and seizures. Compound heterozygous variants in CNPY3 have been identified in patients with this condition, suggesting a potential link between these mutations and neurological symptoms (Xiang2021Genetic).

## Interactions
CNPY3, also known as canopy FGF signaling regulator 3, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It acts as a cochaperone for the hsp90 paralogue gp96, facilitating the folding of multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs), including TLR9, but not TLR3. CNPY3 and gp96 form a complex that is crucial for the post-translational maturation of TLRs. This interaction is sensitive to adenosine nucleotides, with ATP causing the complex to dissociate (Liu2010Folding). 

CNPY3 also interacts with the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94) and is involved in the trafficking of TLR4 to the cell surface, suggesting a role in the proper folding or release of TLR4 from ER chaperones (Schildknegt2019Characterization). Additionally, CNPY3 forms complexes with Grp94 and BiP, indicating a broader role in ER protein folding (Schildknegt2019Characterization).

In Drosophila, CNPYb, a homolog of CNPY3, interacts with gp93, the Drosophila equivalent of gp96, highlighting the conservation of cochaperone functions across species (Morales2017Drosophila). These interactions underscore CNPY3's critical role in the regulation and expression of TLRs.
