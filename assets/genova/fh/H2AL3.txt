# H2AL3

## Overview
H2AL3 is a gene that encodes the H2A.L variant histone 3, a member of the histone protein family involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin. Histones are essential for the structural organization of chromatin and play a critical role in regulating gene expression by controlling the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA. The H2A.L variant histone 3, specifically, is a non-canonical histone variant that can influence chromatin dynamics and gene expression patterns, potentially impacting various cellular processes and developmental pathways. The study of H2AL3 and its encoded protein is significant for understanding the complexities of chromatin remodeling and its implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
