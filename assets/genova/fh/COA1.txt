# COA1

## Overview
The COA1 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1, a protein integral to the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor and is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of CcO by facilitating the insertion of essential cofactors into its subunit, Cox1 (Pierrel2007Coa1). COA1 is involved in forming a complex with other proteins such as Mss51, Cox14, and Shy1, which is essential for the proper translation and assembly of Cox1, thereby ensuring efficient mitochondrial function and energy production (Pierrel2007Coa1). Additionally, COA1 contributes to maintaining mitochondrial copper homeostasis, which is vital for CcO activity and overall cellular energy efficiency (Pierrel2007Coa1). Through these functions, COA1 plays a significant role in cellular respiration and ATP synthesis, impacting metabolic processes and energy homeostasis in human cells (Cytochrome; Xue2020&lt; p&gt).

## Function
The COA1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and stabilization of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a key component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV. This protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is involved in the biogenesis of CcO by facilitating the insertion of cofactors into Cox1, a subunit of CcO (Pierrel2007Coa1). COA1 interacts with other proteins such as Mss51, Cox14, and Shy1, forming a complex that is essential for the proper translation and assembly of Cox1 (Pierrel2007Coa1). 

In healthy cells, COA1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production by ensuring the efficient assembly of CcO, which is vital for cellular respiration and ATP synthesis (Pierrel2007Coa1). The protein's role in copper homeostasis is also significant, as it helps maintain adequate mitochondrial copper levels necessary for CcO activity (Pierrel2007Coa1). Through these processes, COA1 contributes to overall cellular energy efficiency and organismal energy homeostasis, impacting metabolic processes and energy production in human cells (Cytochrome; Xue2020&lt; p&gt).

## Interactions
COA1, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1, is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and participates in several protein interactions crucial for this process. COA1 is part of a high-molecular-weight complex and interacts with MSS51, COX14, and newly synthesized COX1. The interaction with MSS51 is demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where COA1-Myc and MSS51-HA co-adsorb, indicating a physical interaction within a complex of approximately 400 kDa. This interaction is disrupted when COX14 is deleted, suggesting COX14 may mediate the interaction between COA1 and MSS51 (Pierrel2007Coa1).

COA1 also interacts with Shy1, which promotes the dissociation of Cox14 and Mss51, allowing Mss51 to recycle to its translational function. This interaction suggests that COA1 and Shy1 function at a related step in CcO assembly (Pierrel2007Coa1). COA1 is involved in the cotranslational insertion of Cox1 into the mitochondrial inner membrane, likely via Oxa1, and is part of a feedback regulatory loop controlling Cox1 translation (Pierrel2007Coa1).

In addition to its role in CcO assembly, COA1 is associated with the MITRAC complex, where it co-purifies with COX1 and TIM21, indicating its involvement in the assembly of mitochondrial complexes I and IV (Wang2019MITRAC15COA1).
