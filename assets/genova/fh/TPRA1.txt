# TPRA1

## Overview
The TPRA1 gene encodes the transmembrane protein adipocyte associated 1, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular signaling pathways and is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue. The TPRA1 gene is implicated in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and function, contributing to metabolic processes within the body. Research has suggested that alterations in the expression of TPRA1 may have significant implications for metabolic disorders, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
