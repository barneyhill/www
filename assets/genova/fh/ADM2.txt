# ADM2

## Overview
Adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2) is a gene that encodes the peptide hormone adrenomedullin 2, also known as intermedin. This peptide is a member of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family and is primarily recognized for its role as a vasodilator, contributing to cardiovascular homeostasis by regulating blood pressure and blood flow (Takei2003Identification). ADM2 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, where it plays a crucial role in promoting trophoblast invasion and migration, essential processes for successful implantation and placental development (Chauhan2011Adrenomedullin; Chauhan2009Expression). The peptide is involved in angiogenesis, enhancing the formation of new blood vessels, which is vital for placental development and fetal morphogenesis (Havemann2013IntermedinAdrenomedullin). ADM2 exerts its physiological effects through interactions with specific receptor complexes, such as the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), activating various signaling pathways that influence processes like osteogenesis and metabolic regulation (Aslam20197.; Wang2021Accelerated).

## Function
Adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2), also known as intermedin, is a peptide involved in several critical physiological processes, particularly in the context of human pregnancy. ADM2 is expressed in human trophoblast cells and plays a significant role in promoting trophoblast invasion and migration, which are essential for successful implantation and placental development (Chauhan2011Adrenomedullin; Chauhan2009Expression). This peptide enhances the expression of HLA-G, a protein crucial for immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses during pregnancy (Chauhan2011Adrenomedullin).

ADM2 is part of the calcitonin gene-related peptide family and is known for its vasodilatory effects, contributing to cardiovascular homeostasis by regulating blood pressure and blood flow (Takei2003Identification). It is also involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which is vital for placental development and fetal morphogenesis (Havemann2013IntermedinAdrenomedullin). ADM2's expression in various tissues, including the placenta, suggests its importance in maintaining normal placental function and possibly influencing fetoplacental growth (Chauhan2009Expression). The peptide's actions are mediated through specific receptors and signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, which is involved in cell migration and invasion (Chauhan2011Adrenomedullin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ADM2 gene, also known as adrenomedullin 2, have been implicated in several cardiovascular diseases. High levels of ADM2 mRNA expression have been observed in patients with chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction, suggesting a protective role in these cardiovascular pathologies (Kovaleva2016Intermedinadrenomedullin). ADM2 is also associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, vascular calcification, and atherosclerosis (Kovaleva2016Intermedinadrenomedullin). During myocardial infarction, ADM2 levels increase and correlate with disease severity, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2017Adrenomedullin).

In cancer, ADM2 expression is linked to tumor angiogenesis, particularly in hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas, where it may promote tumor growth by enhancing blood supply to the tumor (Kovaleva2016Intermedinadrenomedullin). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as estrogen, hypoxia, and stress responses, which can influence its role in disease contexts (Kovaleva2016Intermedinadrenomedullin).

Low plasma levels of ADM2 have been associated with pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure during pregnancy (Zhang2017Adrenomedullin). An exonic insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ADM2 gene is linked to renal dysfunction, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease in Japanese individuals (Zhang2017Adrenomedullin).

## Interactions
ADM2, also known as adrenomedullin 2, interacts with several proteins and receptor complexes to exert its physiological effects. It primarily interacts with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs), forming different receptor complexes. ADM2 has a greater affinity for ADM 2 receptors, which are formed by CLR in combination with RAMP3, while it shows low affinity for ADM 1 and CGRP receptors (Aslam20197.).

ADM2's interaction with these receptor complexes activates various signaling pathways. It is known to inhibit the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and activate protein kinase B (AKT), which in turn influences the β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for ADM2's role in promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) (Wang2021Accelerated).

ADM2 also interacts with the CRLR/RAMP1 receptor complex to inhibit the BLIMP-CIITA-MHCII axis in adipocytes, which is significant for its role in improving insulin resistance in obesity (Zhang2016Adrenomedullin). These interactions highlight ADM2's involvement in various physiological processes, including bone regeneration and metabolic regulation.
