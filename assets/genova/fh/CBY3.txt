# CBY3

## Overview
The CBY3 gene encodes the protein chibby family member 3, which is a crucial component in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling. As a regulatory protein, chibby family member 3 plays a significant role in maintaining the normal function and structure of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes. The protein's involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway highlights its importance in cell proliferation and differentiation, processes that are vital for normal development and tissue homeostasis. Disruptions in the function or expression of CBY3 can lead to a range of clinical conditions, including ciliopathies and cancer, due to its regulatory role in these pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CBY3 gene can significantly impact cellular processes, leading to various diseases. CBY3 is involved in ciliogenesis and Wnt signaling, pathways crucial for normal cellular function. Disruptions in these pathways due to CBY3 mutations or expression changes can result in ciliopathies, a group of disorders characterized by defects in the structure or function of cilia. These disorders can manifest in a range of symptoms, including respiratory issues, kidney disease, and developmental abnormalities.

Alterations in CBY3 expression or its interactions may also contribute to the development of cancer. The Wnt signaling pathway, in which CBY3 plays a role, is known to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Dysregulation of this pathway is a common feature in various cancers, suggesting that CBY3 may have a role in tumorigenesis when its normal function is compromised.

Furthermore, disruptions in CBY3 interactions could lead to developmental disorders. Given its involvement in critical signaling pathways, any imbalance in CBY3 activity may affect normal development, potentially resulting in congenital anomalies or other developmental issues. Understanding the clinical significance of CBY3 mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing targeted therapies for these conditions.
