# ABT1

## Overview
The ABT1 gene encodes the protein activator of basal transcription 1, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of basal transcription by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) within the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, thereby facilitating the assembly and function of the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus (Oda2000A). ABT1 is categorized as a transcription cofactor due to its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner, influencing gene expression by modulating RNA polymerase II activity (Oda2000A). Additionally, ABT1 plays a significant role in RNA processing through its interaction with IGHMBP2, enhancing the latter's ATPase and helicase activities, which are essential for pre-rRNA processing (Vadla2023ABT1). The protein's localization to the nucleus and nucleolus underscores its involvement in nuclear processes, particularly in the regulation of transcription and RNA processing (Oda2000A).

## Function
The ABT1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This interaction suggests that ABT1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator, facilitating the assembly or function of the transcriptional machinery in the nucleus (Oda2000A). The ABT1 protein is localized to the nucleus and nucleolus, indicating its involvement in nuclear processes, particularly in the regulation of basal transcription (Oda2000A).

ABT1 is known to enhance basal transcription from core promoter sequences, suggesting its role in influencing gene expression across various cellular contexts (Oda2000A). The protein can bind DNA in a sequence-independent manner, which implies it may function as a transcription cofactor, potentially affecting DNA accessibility and modulating RNA polymerase II activity (Oda2000A). In addition to its role in transcription, ABT1 interacts with the IGHMBP2 protein, enhancing its ATPase and helicase activities, which are crucial for pre-rRNA processing (Vadla2023ABT1). This interaction highlights ABT1's involvement in RNA processing and its broader impact on cellular function.

## Interactions
ABT1 (activator of basal transcription 1) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence transcriptional regulation. ABT1 directly interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a component of the transcription factor TFIID, enhancing basal transcription. This interaction is stable under moderate ionic conditions but dissociates at higher salt concentrations, indicating a specific yet somewhat transient binding (Oda2000A). ABT1 also binds to DNA in a sequence-independent manner, suggesting a role as a transcription cofactor (Oda2000A).

In addition to its interaction with TBP, ABT1 forms a complex with IGHMBP2, a protein involved in RNA processing. This interaction significantly enhances the ATPase and helicase activities of IGHMBP2, which are crucial for pre-rRNA processing. The ABT1/IGHMBP2 complex also associates with the 47S pre-rRNA 5′ external transcribed spacer and U3 small nucleolar RNA, indicating its role in RNA processing (Vadla2023ABT1).

ABT1's activity is modulated by ABTAP, a nuclear protein that represses ABT1-stimulated transcription by disrupting its interaction with TBP. This regulatory mechanism highlights the dynamic nature of ABT1's role in transcriptional activation (Oda2004ABT1‐associated).
