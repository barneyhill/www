# LDLRAD1

## Overview
LDLRAD1 is a gene that encodes the protein low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 1, which is involved in various biological processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLRA) domain, which suggests a potential role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. Although the precise biological functions of LDLRAD1 are still being elucidated, it is categorized as a receptor protein due to its structural features. Research has indicated that LDLRAD1 may play a role in cardiovascular health, as well as in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Hahn2020Genetic; CastillejoLópez2024A; Beecham2015PARK10).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LDLRAD1 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, LDLRAD1 has been significantly linked to coronary heart disease (CHD). A study identified seven rare variants in LDLRAD1 with a strong association with prevalent CHD, suggesting that alterations in this gene may contribute to the risk of developing CHD (Hahn2020Genetic). 

LDLRAD1 is also implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Research using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in HepG2 cells showed that changes in the expression of LDLRAD1, due to regulatory alterations in the DIO1 gene, may contribute to NAFLD pathobiology. This was evidenced by increased lipid accumulation and altered cholesterol levels in edited cells (CastillejoLópez2024A).

Additionally, LDLRAD1 is located within the PARK10 locus, which has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although LDLRAD1 itself has not been directly implicated in PD biology, its presence in this locus suggests potential relevance in the disease's genetic landscape (Beecham2015PARK10).
