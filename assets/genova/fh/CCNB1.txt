# CCNB1

## Overview
Cyclin B1 is a regulatory protein encoded by the CCNB1 gene, playing a pivotal role in cell cycle control, particularly in the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis. As a member of the cyclin family, cyclin B1 forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is essential for the initiation and progression of mitosis. This complex is tightly regulated through phosphorylation and feedback mechanisms to ensure accurate cell cycle progression (Lindqvist2009The). Cyclin B1 is synthesized during the S phase and accumulates in the cytoplasm before translocating to the nucleus to trigger mitotic events, such as nuclear envelope breakdown (Lindqvist2009The). Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin B1 is involved in the DNA damage response, where its timely degradation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Müllers2014Nuclear). Dysregulation of CCNB1 expression is associated with various cancers, making it a significant biomarker for cancer prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chen2024Cyclin; Aljohani2022The).

## Function
Cyclin B1, encoded by the CCNB1 gene, is a crucial regulatory protein involved in the control of the cell cycle, specifically facilitating the transition from the G2 phase to mitosis. Cyclin B1 forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), which is essential for initiating mitosis. This complex, known as cyclin B-Cdk1, is tightly regulated through feedback loops and phosphorylation events that ensure precise timing of mitotic entry (Lindqvist2009The).

Cyclin B1 is synthesized during the S phase and accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Its nuclear import is regulated by phosphorylation, and it accumulates in the nucleus to trigger mitotic entry by phosphorylating nuclear targets, such as structural lamins, leading to nuclear envelope breakdown (Lindqvist2009The). The activation of cyclin B-Cdk1 is characterized by a bistable, switch-like mechanism that ensures cells commit to mitosis without reverting to an intermediate state (Lindqvist2009The).

Cyclin B1 also plays a role in the DNA damage response, where its degradation is mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA. This degradation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Müllers2014Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCNB1 gene, which encodes cyclin B1, are implicated in the progression and prognosis of various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high CCNB1 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Gu2019MicroRNA144). In breast cancer, elevated CCNB1 levels are linked to aggressive tumor characteristics, such as larger tumor size, higher histological grade, and lymphovascular invasion. This overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and is considered an independent predictor of breast cancer-specific survival (Fu2022High; Aljohani2022The).

CCNB1 is also highly expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma, where it is associated with negative prognosis and is considered a potential diagnostic marker (Li2019CDK1). In a pan-cancer analysis, high CCNB1 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in several cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma, renal papillary cell carcinoma, and mesothelioma. It is also linked to immune cell infiltration and interactions with immune checkpoint genes, suggesting its role in tumor immunity (Chen2024Cyclin). These findings highlight CCNB1 as a significant biomarker for cancer prognosis and a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) is a key regulatory protein that interacts with several other proteins to control cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis. It forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is essential for mitotic entry and progression (Chen2008Cyclin). Cyclin B1 interacts directly with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein MAD1 at the kinetochore corona, a crucial interaction for activating the mitotic checkpoint. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of MAD1, specifically residues 41-62, which contain a conserved acidic patch essential for binding (Allan2020Cyclin). Mutations in this region can disrupt the interaction, affecting MAD1's localization and function during mitosis (Allan2020Cyclin).

Cyclin B1 also interacts with separase, a protease involved in sister chromatid separation, and this interaction is regulated by CDK1-cyclin B1-mediated phosphorylation (Hayward2019Orchestration). Additionally, Cyclin B1 is involved in the inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) through the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which includes proteins such as MAD2, BUBR1, BUB3, and CDC20 (Hayward2019Orchestration). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the mitotic state and ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation.
