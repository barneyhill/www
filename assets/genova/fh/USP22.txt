# USP22

## Overview
USP22, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 22, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme belonging to the family of cysteine proteases. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and protein stability by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific protein substrates. As a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, USP22 is involved in histone modification, particularly the deubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (Atanassov2011USP22; Zhang2008The). Beyond its role in transcriptional regulation, USP22 influences cell cycle progression and apoptosis by stabilizing non-histone proteins such as Cyclin B1 and Sirt1 (Lin2015Ubiquitin-specific; Lin2012USP22). The enzyme's activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, including SIRT1, and is subject to post-translational modifications that affect its function within the SAGA complex (Armour2013A). Due to its involvement in critical cellular processes, dysregulation of USP22 has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Guo2022Immune; McCann2020USP22).

## Structure
USP22 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that is part of the SAGA transcriptional coactivating complex. It contains an N-terminal ZnF-UBP domain and a C-terminal C19 peptidase domain. The ZnF-UBP domain is unique in that it cannot bind free ubiquitin due to differences in key ubiquitin-binding residues, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions rather than ubiquitin binding (Armour2013A). The C19 peptidase domain contains the catalytic cysteine necessary for its enzymatic activity (Armour2013A).

USP22 forms heterotetrameric complexes within the SAGA complex, which are essential for its deubiquitinating activity. It is relatively inactive when isolated but becomes active as part of these high-molecular-mass complexes (Armour2013A). The interaction with SIRT1, a protein deacetylase, is highly specific and occurs within the ZnF-UBP domain of USP22, independent of the catalytic cysteine residue (Armour2013A).

Post-translational modifications of USP22 include acetylation, which affects its activity and interaction with the SAGA complex. Lysine 129 (K129) within the ZnF-UBP domain is a critical acetylation site, influencing USP22's function and interaction with SIRT1 (Armour2013A).

## Function
USP22 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 22) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, where it functions as a histone ubiquitin hydrolase, removing ubiquitin from histones H2A and H2B. This activity is essential for transcriptional regulation, as it influences chromatin structure and facilitates the recruitment of transcriptional machinery, thereby promoting the transcription of specific genes (MeloCardenas2016Ubiquitinspecific; Zhang2008The).

USP22 is also involved in stabilizing non-histone proteins, such as Cyclin B1, by preventing their degradation through deubiquitination. This stabilization is crucial for proper cell cycle progression, particularly during the G2/M transition (Lin2015Ubiquitin-specific). Additionally, USP22 regulates the stability of Sirt1, a protein that modulates p53 activity, thereby influencing cell apoptosis and survival. By deubiquitinating Sirt1, USP22 suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal embryonic development (Lin2012USP22).

Overall, USP22's deubiquitinating activity is integral to maintaining proper cell function and organismal development by regulating protein stability and gene expression (Atanassov2011USP22).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in USP22 expression or function have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In prostate cancer, USP22 acts as an oncogenic driver by regulating cell proliferation and DNA repair. Its expression increases with disease progression, particularly in the transition from hormone therapy-sensitive to castration-resistant stages. These alterations are associated with poor outcomes and decreased progression-free survival, often co-occurring with changes in androgen receptor (AR) and MYC activity (Schrecengost2014USP22; McCann2020USP22).

In lung cancer, elevated USP22 expression is linked to poor survival and promotes tumorigenesis by upregulating MDMX and inhibiting the P53 pathway. It also prevents EGFR degradation, enhancing resistance to EGFR-TKIs (Guo2022Immune). In colorectal cancer, USP22 expression correlates with metastasis and chemotherapy resistance, activating pathways like Wnt/β-catenin (Guo2022Immune).

USP22 is also implicated in liver cancer, where it is associated with poor prognosis and tumor growth through interactions with survivin and the E2F6-DUSP1-AKT axis (Guo2022Immune). In breast cancer, USP22 maintains estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) stability, contributing to endocrine resistance (Wang2020USP22). These findings suggest that USP22 is a potential target for cancer therapy due to its role in tumor progression and drug resistance.

## Interactions
USP22 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) complex, where it interacts with several other proteins to regulate gene expression. Within the SAGA complex, USP22 forms a stable deubiquitination module (DUBm) with subunits ATXN7, ATXN7L3, and ENY2. These interactions are essential for USP22's deubiquitination activity, particularly on histones H2A and H2B, which is necessary for the activation of SAGA-dependent inducible genes (Lang2011The).

USP22 also interacts with SIRT1, a protein deacetylase, to regulate the acetylation state of the SAGA complex. This interaction is mediated by the ZnF-UBP domain of USP22 and is crucial for the deacetylation of SAGA components, influencing the formation of DUBm subcomplexes (Armour2013A). USP22's interaction with SIRT1 also affects the stability of SIRT1 by deubiquitinating it, which in turn modulates p53 acetylation and suppresses cell apoptosis (Lin2012USP22).

Additionally, USP22 interacts with the transcriptional regulator FBP1, deubiquitinating it as part of the SAGA complex, which affects cell proliferation and gene expression (Atanassov2011USP22). These interactions highlight USP22's role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.
