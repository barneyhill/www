# GJC2

## Overview
The GJC2 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma 2, also known as connexin 47 (Cx47), which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the connexin family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system by facilitating direct intercellular communication through the formation of gap junction channels. Cx47 is predominantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it is essential for the maintenance of myelin integrity and efficient neuronal signaling. The protein forms functional channels with other connexins, such as connexin 43 (Cx43), to mediate communication between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which is crucial for processes like potassium buffering during neural activity. Mutations in the GJC2 gene can lead to neurological disorders such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease and hereditary spastic paraplegia, underscoring the importance of Cx47 in maintaining normal central nervous system function (Kleopa2010Gap; OrthmannMurphy2007Two; Molica2014Mutations).

## Structure
The GJC2 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma 2, also known as connexin 47 (Cx47), which is a member of the connexin family. This protein is composed of 439 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa (OwczarekLipska2019Novel; Molica2014Mutations). The primary structure of Cx47 includes four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and three cytoplasmic domains, which consist of the N- and C-termini and a cytoplasmic loop (OwczarekLipska2019Novel).

The secondary structure of Cx47 is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which likely form alpha helices, a common feature in membrane-spanning proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a functional protein capable of embedding in the cell membrane. In terms of quaternary structure, Cx47 assembles into hexameric hemichannels, known as connexons, which dock with connexons from adjacent cells to form gap junction channels (OwczarekLipska2019Novel).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur and can influence the function of the gap junction channels formed by Cx47, although specific modifications for Cx47 are not detailed in the provided context (Beyer2018Gap).

## Function
The GJC2 gene encodes the gap junction protein gamma 2, also known as connexin 47 (Cx47), which plays a crucial role in the central nervous system (CNS) by forming gap junctions that facilitate direct cell-to-cell communication. Cx47 is primarily expressed in oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath, which insulates nerve fibers and ensures efficient transmission of electrical signals (OrthmannMurphy2007Two; Molica2014Mutations).

In healthy human cells, Cx47 forms functional gap junction channels with other connexins, such as Cx43, to mediate communication between oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This interaction is essential for maintaining the integrity of CNS myelin and proper neuronal function (Kleopa2010Gap; OrthmannMurphy2007Two). The gap junctions formed by Cx47 allow the exchange of ions and small molecules, which is critical for processes like potassium buffering during neural activity (OrthmannMurphy2007Two).

Mutations in GJC2 can disrupt these functions, leading to disorders such as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) and hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting the importance of Cx47 in maintaining normal CNS function (Kleopa2010Gap; Molica2014Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJC2 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein gamma 2 (connexin 47), are associated with several neurological disorders. The most severe condition linked to GJC2 mutations is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease type 1 (PMLD1), a rare hypomyelinating leukodystrophy characterized by early-onset developmental delays, speech problems, and progressive spasticity (OwczarekLipska2019Novel; Gotoh2014GJC2). PMLD1 is caused by autosomal recessive mutations that disrupt the function of connexin 47, leading to impaired myelin formation in the central nervous system (Gotoh2014GJC2).

GJC2 mutations are also linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 44 (SPG44), a milder condition with later onset, and hereditary lymphedema type IC (LMPH1C), which is associated with dominant mutations (Ferrell2010GJC2; Abrams2023Mechanisms). The phenotypic variability of GJC2-related disorders is notable, with some mutations leading to subclinical hypomyelinating leukodystrophy or complicated spastic paraplegia (Kuipers2019Lateonset; Ghasemi2023Description).

Mutations in the promoter region of GJC2 can also result in a milder form of PMLD, affecting transcriptional regulation and leading to reduced expression of connexin 47 (Gotoh2014GJC2). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of GJC2 in maintaining normal neurological function.

## Interactions
Connexin 47 (Cx47), encoded by the GJC2 gene, is a gap junction protein that primarily interacts with other connexins to form intercellular channels. Cx47 forms heterotypic channels with astrocytic connexin 43 (Cx43), facilitating oligodendrocyte-astrocyte coupling. These channels exhibit unique properties, such as ionic and chemical rectification, which create directional diffusion barriers for ions and larger molecules, crucial for maintaining myelin integrity and ionic homeostasis in the central nervous system (Wasseff2011Cx32; Fasciani2018Directional).

Cx47 is also involved in oligodendrocyte-oligodendrocyte coupling, primarily through interactions with connexin 32 (Cx32). However, studies indicate that Cx47 and Cx32 do not form heteromeric channels, as evidenced by minimal physical association and lack of functional interaction between these connexins (Abrams2021Investigating; Abrams2023Mechanisms). Despite being co-expressed in oligodendrocytes, Cx47 and Cx32 maintain distinct roles, with Cx47 primarily coupling with Cx43 in oligodendrocyte-astrocyte interactions (Wasseff2011Cx32).

Mutations in Cx47, such as the P90S mutation, can disrupt its channel properties, affecting its interactions and leading to myelin disorders like leukodystrophy (Fasciani2018Directional). These mutations highlight the critical role of Cx47 in maintaining CNS function.
