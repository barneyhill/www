# RBMXL1

## Overview
RBMXL1 is a gene that encodes the RBMX-like 1 protein, which is a member of the RNA-binding motif protein family. This protein is primarily involved in RNA processing and splicing, functioning as a component of the spliceosome complex. It plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by interacting with various splicing factors and RNA molecules. RBMXL1 is also implicated in chromatin regulation, particularly in the context of myeloid leukemia, where it helps maintain chromatin structure and integrity. The protein shares a high degree of homology with its paralog RBMX, allowing it to compensate for RBMX loss in certain cellular contexts. Beyond its role in leukemia, RBMXL1 is associated with male infertility and age-related hematopoietic disorders, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Hu2022Exploration; Elliott2019RBMX; Prieto2021Transcriptional; Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel).

## Clinical Significance
RBMXL1 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA splicing and chromatin regulation. In myeloid leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), RBMXL1 is overexpressed and contributes to leukemogenesis by maintaining chromatin state through the regulation of CBX5, a gene involved in chromatin compaction. Depletion of RBMXL1 in leukemia cells leads to reduced proliferation, increased differentiation, and apoptosis, indicating its critical role in leukemia cell survival (Prieto2021Transcriptional).

RBMXL1 also plays a role in male infertility, specifically in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Altered expression of RBMXL1 variants is associated with spermatogenesis defects, potentially leading to germ cell death or meiotic arrest. The gene is highly overexpressed in conditions like maturation arrest and Sertoli cell-only syndrome, suggesting a link to male infertility through mechanisms related to apoptosis (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel).

In the context of aging and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), RBMXL1 is down-regulated, contributing to the decline in proliferation and differentiation capacities of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This dysregulation may influence the development of age-related conditions like MDS (Hu2022Exploration).

## Interactions
RBMXL1, a protein involved in RNA processing and splicing, participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to form part of the spliceosome complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. RBMXL1 can bind to RNA and may interact with proteins such as ASF/SF2, hnRNPs, and other splicing factors, influencing gene expression regulation (Elliott2019RBMX).

In the context of myeloid leukemia, RBMXL1, along with its paralog RBMX, plays a crucial role in maintaining chromatin state and structure. These proteins are predominantly localized in the chromatin-bound fraction of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, where they regulate chromatin compaction and chromosome integrity by controlling the heterochromatin component CBX5. RBMXL1 and RBMX directly bind to CBX5's intronic regulatory element, promoting transcriptional activity at the CBX5 locus (Prieto2021Transcriptional).

RBMXL1 also compensates for the loss of RBMX in leukemia maintenance, as it shares 95% protein homology with RBMX. This compensation is evident in RBMX-depleted leukemia cells, where RBMXL1 expression is detected, suggesting its role in maintaining leukemia cell survival and function (Prieto2021Transcriptional).
