# KRT39

## Overview
KRT39 is a gene that encodes keratin 39, a type I intermediate filament protein predominantly expressed in epithelial cells. This protein is integral to the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of tissues such as hair, nails, and skin. Keratin 39 is characterized by its α-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments. These filaments provide mechanical support and stability to epithelial cells, enabling them to withstand physical stress (Ho2022Update). The gene's evolutionary trajectory indicates its adaptation for specific functions in mammals, particularly in the context of skin appendages (Ho2022Update). Clinically, KRT39 has been associated with various cancers, including gastric and thyroid cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and survival (Tous2023Identification; Chen2019Identification). Further research is necessary to elucidate its precise roles in these and other conditions.

## Structure
KRT39, or keratin 39, is a type I intermediate filament protein primarily found in epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central α-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This α-helical region is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the protein's structural integrity (Ho2022Update).

The secondary structure of KRT39 is characterized by these coiled-coil motifs, which are common in keratin proteins and contribute to their ability to form stable filamentous networks. The tertiary structure involves the assembly of these motifs into a filamentous network, providing mechanical support to epithelial cells (Ho2022Update).

In terms of quaternary structure, KRT39 forms through the lateral and end-to-end association of keratin filaments. This assembly is crucial for the formation of mature intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural integrity of epithelial tissues (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT39 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect filament assembly and stability, although specific details on these modifications for KRT39 are not provided in the context (Ho2022Update).

## Function
KRT39 encodes a type I intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial cells, particularly in hair follicles and skin. This keratin is involved in the formation and maintenance of hair and skin structure, providing protection against friction and dehydration (Ho2022Update). The protein is part of a complex network of keratins that form stable heterodimers and homodimers, which are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments in epithelial cells (Ho2022Update). These filaments contribute to the mechanical stability of cells, allowing them to withstand physical stress.

KRT39 is primarily expressed in tissues such as hair, nails, and tongue, although specific expression data in these tissues are not detailed in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (Ho2022Update). The gene's evolutionary history suggests that it has adapted to provide specific functions in mammals, reappearing in this clade after disappearing in the Sauropsida lineage, which reflects differences in skin appendages between these groups (Ho2022Update). The gain and loss of keratin functions, including those of KRT39, are likely involved in evolutionary adaptations to different environmental conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The KRT39 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, primarily related to cancer. In gastric cancer, KRT39 is part of a gene module significantly correlated with clinical traits such as overall survival, death events, and cancer staging. This suggests its potential role as a biomarker for prognosis and survival in gastric cancer patients (Chen2019Identification). Additionally, KRT39 has been identified in familial thyroid cancer, where variants lead to truncated proteins, indicating a possible involvement in the disease, although the specific role remains unclear (Tous2023Identification).

In the context of HER2-positive gastric cancer, KRT39 is located on chromosome 17q21.2, a region with frequent copy number variations, suggesting its association with this cancer subtype (Zhou2018Difference). However, its specific function in this context is not detailed.

In horses affected by Degenerative Suspensory Ligament Desmitis (DSLD), KRT39 expression was examined, but no significant differences were found compared to controls. This suggests that while KRT39 was identified as a potential biomarker, its role in DSLD remains uncertain (Roberts2023Expression). Overall, KRT39's clinical significance is primarily linked to its potential as a biomarker in cancer, with further research needed to clarify its roles in other conditions.
