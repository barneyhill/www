# FAM81B

## Overview
FAM81B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 81 member B. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The FAM81B protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including signal transduction pathways, given its structural features that suggest a role in intracellular signaling. Research into the FAM81B gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to clarify its involvement in physiological and pathological contexts. Understanding the precise function of FAM81B could have significant implications for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying certain diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
