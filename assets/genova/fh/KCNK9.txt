# KCNK9

## Overview
KCNK9 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 9, commonly referred to as TASK-3. TASK-3 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is integral in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability, particularly in neurons. The TASK-3 protein is characterized by its two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments, which facilitate its role in generating background potassium currents that are largely time- and voltage-independent (Kim2000TASK3; Rajan2000TASK3). Predominantly expressed in the brain, TASK-3 is involved in neuronal signaling and muscle function, and its activity is modulated by various factors including extracellular pH and neurotransmitters (Barel2008Maternally; Graham2016KCNK9). Dysregulation of KCNK9 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including Birk-Barel syndrome and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Barel2008Maternally; KIM2004Altered).

## Structure
The KCNK9 gene encodes the TASK-3 protein, a member of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The primary structure of TASK-3 includes two pore-forming domains and four transmembrane segments, which are characteristic of the K2P channel family (Kim2000TASK3; Rajan2000TASK3). The protein is composed of 365 amino acids, with a large extracellular loop between the M1 and P1 segments and a cytosolic C-terminus that contains phosphorylation sites (Rajan2000TASK3). 

The secondary structure features transmembrane helices that are highly conserved between TASK-3 and its closest relative, TASK-1, with which it shares 55-60% sequence identity (Enyedi2010Molecular). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices to form a functional channel, with specific motifs such as the 3-helix bundle (3-HB) playing a crucial role in channel regulation (Cousin2022Gain). 

In terms of quaternary structure, TASK-3 functions as a dimer, with two subunits forming the channel (Enyedi2010Molecular). Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by protein kinase A and C, are common and can regulate channel activity (Kim2000TASK3).

## Function
The KCNK9 gene encodes the TASK-3 protein, a member of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in neurons and other cell types. TASK-3 channels contribute to background potassium currents that are largely time- and voltage-independent, influencing the duration, frequency, and amplitude of action potentials. This regulation is essential for neuronal signaling and muscle function (Barel2008Maternally; Graham2016KCNK9).

In healthy human cells, TASK-3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, where it is involved in the maturation of cerebellar neurons and modulation of action-potential firing. The activity of these channels is modulated by extracellular pH, neurotransmitters, and volatile anesthetics, and they play a role in K+-dependent apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons (Ruf2007Sequencebased; Barel2008Maternally).

TASK-3 channels are also involved in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis, with implications for cellular energy regulation. The gene's imprinting ensures that TASK-3 is expressed at appropriate levels, maintaining normal cellular functions (Skaar2021Epigenetic). The proper function of KCNK9 is critical for normal physiological processes, and its dysfunction can lead to significant neurological and developmental issues (Barel2008Maternally).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCNK9 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. KCNK9 is linked to Birk-Barel syndrome, a maternally inherited disorder characterized by mental retardation, hypotonia, and unique dysmorphic features. This condition is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of KCNK9, which results in the complete loss of channel currents, affecting both homodimer and heterodimer formations with KCNK3. The mutation identified is a 770G/A change in exon 2, leading to a glycine to arginine substitution at position 236 (G236R) (Barel2008Maternally).

KCNK9 is also implicated in various cancers, including breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, where it is often amplified and overexpressed. In colorectal cancer, 46% of samples showed overexpression of KCNK9, although no significant correlation with tumor stage or lymph node metastasis was found. This suggests that overexpression, rather than mutation, may contribute to cancer development (KIM2004Altered). The oncogenic potential of KCNK9 is linked to its role in cell proliferation and survival, with its potassium channel activity being directly associated with these functions (Pei2003Oncogenic).

## Interactions
KCNK9, also known as TASK-3, is a potassium channel that interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which are crucial for its functional expression and trafficking to the cell membrane. The interaction is mediated by a conserved C-terminal motif, specifically the pentapeptide motif RRx(S/T)x, which is essential for binding 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction is necessary for the proper localization of TASK-3 at the cell surface and for the generation of significant outward potassium currents (Rajan2002Interaction).

The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TASK-3 masks a tri-basic retention signal, KRR, in the C-terminus, which prevents the channel from being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, as demonstrated by mutational analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zuzarte2009Intracellular; Kilisch2015The). The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is crucial for the forward transport of TASK-3 to the cell surface, as it facilitates the channel's trafficking by modulating the exposure of the KRR retention signal (Zuzarte2009Intracellular; Kilisch2015The).

TASK-3 also interacts with the COPI complex, which is involved in retrograde transport. The KRR motif serves as a retention signal that interacts with COPI, and the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TASK-3 is shown to mask this retention signal, allowing for forward transport to the cell surface (Kilisch2015The).
