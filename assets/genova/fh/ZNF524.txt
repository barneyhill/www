# ZNF524

## Overview
ZNF524 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 524, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains facilitate the protein's role as a DNA-binding transcription factor, primarily involved in maintaining telomere integrity. Zinc finger protein 524 specifically binds to telomeric DNA sequences, such as the TTAGGG repeat, and plays a crucial role in protecting telomeres from DNA damage and recombination events. This protein is integral to the localization and function of the TRF2/RAP1 subcomplex at telomeres, although it does not directly interact with TRF2. The absence of ZNF524 can lead to increased telomere dysfunction and genomic instability. Beyond its role in telomere maintenance, ZNF524 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including muscle-invasive bladder cancer, periodontitis, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential significance in disease prognosis and susceptibility (Braun2022ZNF524; Zhang2024Dynamic).

## Structure
ZNF524 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its DNA-binding domain, which includes four C2H2-type zinc fingers (ZFs) (Braun2022ZNF524). These zinc fingers adopt a canonical fold, with recognition α-helices that insert into the major groove of DNA, facilitating base-specific contacts through hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions (Braun2022ZNF524). The ZNF524 protein specifically interacts with telomeric DNA, recognizing sequences such as the TTAGGG repeat, with ZF2 playing a central role in this interaction (Braun2022ZNF524).

The primary structure of ZNF524 is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, typical of zinc finger proteins, which are crucial for coordinating zinc ions and maintaining the structural integrity of the zinc finger domains. The secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets that form the zinc finger motifs. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs to create a stable conformation that allows for specific DNA binding. There is no evidence of a quaternary structure for ZNF524 in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination may occur, affecting the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications for ZNF524 are not detailed in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the provided information.

## Function
ZNF524 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere integrity in healthy human cells. It directly interacts with telomeric DNA, specifically binding to telomeric repeats with high affinity, which is essential for protecting telomeres from DNA damage signaling and recombination events (Braun2022ZNF524). ZNF524 supports the presence of the TRF2/RAP1 subcomplex at telomeres, although it does not regulate their expression or directly interact with TRF2. The absence of ZNF524 leads to reduced TRF2 and RAP1 at telomeres, resulting in increased telomere dysfunction-induced foci and telomeric sister chromatid exchanges, indicating more recombination events (Braun2022ZNF524).

ZNF524 employs four Cys2His2-type zinc fingers for base-specific recognition of the telomeric motif, with the ZF2 mutant showing a failure to bind effectively (Braun2022ZNF524). This protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences telomere structure and function, contributing to genomic stability by preventing unwanted DNA damage repair at telomeres (Braun2022ZNF524). The role of ZNF524 is independent of the fully assembled shelterin complex, highlighting its unique function in telomere maintenance (Braun2022ZNF524).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF524 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in transcriptional regulation. In muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), ZNF524 is identified as a protective factor, with a hazard ratio less than 1, indicating its association with a better prognosis. It is part of a prognostic model that dichotomizes patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, showing significant differences in survival times (Zhang2024Dynamic). The gene is also involved in the m6A-risk model for MIBC, where its negative coefficient suggests an association with lower risk (Zhang2024Dynamic).

In the context of periodontitis, ZNF524 is highlighted as a candidate gene showing nominal significant associations with chronic periodontitis, suggesting a potential role in susceptibility to this condition (Nashef2018Integration). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ZNF524 is co-expressed with the long non-coding RNA LINC00324, indicating its involvement in pivotal signaling pathways related to the disease (Sharma2022Circulating).

ZNF524 is also noted in the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), where it is among the differentially expressed genes in patients undergoing treatment, although its specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Liguori2024An).

## Interactions
ZNF524 is a zinc finger protein that directly interacts with telomeric DNA, specifically binding to TTAGGG repeats with high affinity. This interaction is mediated through its four C-terminal zinc fingers, with ZF2 playing a central role in base-specific recognition. The binding affinity for a 12 bp telomeric sequence is approximately 90 nM, as demonstrated by DNA pull-down assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (Braun2023ZNF524).

ZNF524 is involved in maintaining telomere integrity by supporting the TRF2/RAP1 subcomplex. It does not directly interact with TRF2 but influences its localization to telomeres, potentially through epigenetic changes or interactions with other telomeric proteins such as HP1γ, which is associated with the ChAHP complex (Braun2023ZNF524). The absence of ZNF524 leads to reduced TRF2 and RAP1 at telomeres, indicating its role in telomere protection (Braun2023ZNF524).

BioID assays have identified proximity partners of ZNF524, including known telomere binders like NR2C1, NR2C2, TRF1, and TRF2, further supporting its role in telomere binding (Braun2023ZNF524). ZNF524 may also recruit the ChAHP complex to telomeres, maintaining a protective chromatin environment (Braun2023ZNF524).
