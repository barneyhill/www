# CFAP97D2

## Overview
The CFAP97D2 gene encodes the CFAP97 domain containing 2 protein, which is a member of the CFAP (cilia and flagella associated protein) family. This protein is involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as motility and signaling. CFAP97 domain containing 2 is characterized by its specific domain architecture that facilitates its interaction with other proteins within the ciliary axoneme, contributing to the assembly and maintenance of these organelles. Mutations or dysregulation of CFAP97D2 have been implicated in various ciliopathies, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
