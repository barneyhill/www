# IQCG

## Overview
The IQCG gene encodes the IQ motif containing G protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving calcium signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by a central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal IQ motif, which facilitates its interaction with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-independent manner (Chen2014Functional). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of haematopoiesis and spermiogenesis, with significant implications for the maintenance and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells and the development of sperm flagella (Chen2014Functional; Harris2014IQ). The IQCG protein also plays a role in the formation of the NUP98-IQCG fusion protein, implicated in acute leukemia, and is associated with conditions such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and endometriosis (Wang2021Identification; Chen2014Functional; JezelaStanek2023SERPINA1). Through its interactions and regulatory functions, IQCG is essential for cellular signaling and structural integrity.

## Structure
The IQCG protein contains a central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal IQ motif, which is characterized by the sequence [I,L,V]QxxxR[G,x]xxx[R,K], where 'x' represents any amino acid residue (Chen2014Functional). This IQ motif is crucial for binding calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-independent manner, a common feature in proteins that interact with CaM, such as myosins and voltage-operated ion channels (Chen2014Functional). The crystal structure of the IQCG IQ motif in complex with CaM has been determined, revealing dual CaM-binding footprints and a structural basis for a higher affinity between CaM and IQCG when calcium is absent (Chen2014Functional).

Specific residues in the IQ motif, such as L400, W403, and W404, insert into the hydrophobic cleft of the CaM C-lobe, while Q401 and R405 coordinate hydrogen bonds and salt bridges to stabilize the structure (Chen2014Functional). The alanine substitution of Q401 disrupts the binding between IQCG and CaM, highlighting the importance of these residues in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Chen2014Functional). The overall interface features both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, a common characteristic of CaM-target recognitions (Chen2014Functional).

## Function
The IQCG gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with calmodulin (CaM). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of haematopoiesis, as demonstrated in zebrafish models, where IQCG is essential for the maintenance and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Chen2014Functional). The protein contains a central coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal IQ motif, which binds to CaM in a calcium-independent manner, suggesting that IQCG may function as a local store of CaM, releasing it to activate CaMKIV when calcium levels rise (Chen2014Functional).

In addition to its role in haematopoiesis, IQCG is involved in spermiogenesis, particularly in the formation and function of flagella. In mice, mutations in the Iqcg gene lead to male-specific infertility due to impaired spermiogenesis, resulting in abnormal sperm morphology and motility (Harris2014IQ). The gene's role in flagellar morphogenesis is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its importance in the development and function of sperm cells (Harris2014IQ). IQCG's involvement in these processes highlights its critical function in cellular signaling and structural integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IQCG gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of hematological disorders, the IQCG gene is involved in the formation of a fusion protein with NUP98, known as NUP98-IQCG, which has been identified in cases of acute leukemia. This fusion protein acts as an aberrant regulator of transcriptional expression, potentially leading to the deregulation of oncogenes and contributing to leukemogenesis (Chen2014Functional). The NUP98-IQCG fusion protein has been shown to initiate acute myeloid leukemia in murine models, indicating its significant role in the development of this disease (Chen2014Functional).

In respiratory conditions, genetic variants in the IQCG gene have been associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and potentially with emphysema. The gene is involved in the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, crucial for ciliary and flagellar motility, and has been reported in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting its potential significance in COPD predisposition (JezelaStanek2023SERPINA1).

In endometriosis, IQCG has been identified as a hub autophagy-related gene with higher expression in ectopic endometrial tissues, suggesting a role in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in this condition (Wang2021Identification).

## Interactions
The IQCG protein interacts with calmodulin (CaM) through its IQ motif, which is crucial for its function in calcium signaling pathways. This interaction is calcium-dependent, with the IQ motif binding more strongly to CaM in the absence of calcium, as demonstrated by a dissociation constant of 5.07 nM compared to 180 nM in the presence of calcium (Chen2014Functional). The interaction involves hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts, with key residues such as L400, W403, W404, Q401, and R405 playing critical roles in stabilizing the complex (Chen2014Functional).

IQCG also interacts with heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction is significant for haematopoiesis, as knockdown of HSP70 in zebrafish led to decreased haematopoiesis, suggesting a cooperative role in this process (Chen2014Functional). IQCG does not directly interact with CaMKIV but may act as a reservoir for CaM, releasing it to activate CaMKIV when calcium levels rise (Chen2014Functional). These interactions highlight IQCG's role in regulating calcium signaling and haematopoietic development.
