# PDZK1IP1

## Overview
PDZK1IP1, also known as MAP17, is a gene that encodes the PDZK1 interacting protein 1, a small membrane-associated protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and transport. The protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain, which facilitates its role in interacting with PDZ domain-containing molecules, thereby influencing multiple signaling pathways (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting). PDZK1IP1 is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a cargo protein, aiding in the transport of membrane proteins and enhancing sodium-dependent transport systems (GarcíaHeredia2017The). The protein's interactions with key signaling molecules, such as Smad4 and NUMB, underscore its regulatory role in pathways like TGF-β and Notch, which are critical in cancer progression and immune response modulation (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting; GarciaHeredia2017The). PDZK1IP1's expression and activity are implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhou2022A).

## Structure
PDZK1IP1, also known as MAP17, is a small membrane-associated protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein includes a transmembrane domain, which is characteristic of its role in signal transduction and transport (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting). PDZK1IP1 interacts with PDZ domain-containing molecules, indicating the presence of specific binding sites that facilitate these interactions (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting). 

The N-terminal region of PDZK1IP1 is crucial for its function, particularly in inhibiting TGF-β signaling. This region, spanning from Met 31 to Ala 49, is essential for its interaction with Smad4, a key mediator in the TGF-β signaling pathway (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting). Mutants lacking this region lose the ability to inhibit TGF-β signaling, highlighting its importance in the protein's inhibitory function (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting).

PDZK1IP1 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting). The protein is also known to have splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse roles in cellular processes and cancer progression (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting).

## Function
PDZK1IP1, also known as MAP17, is a protein that plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes through its involvement in membrane transport and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, PDZK1IP1 is primarily located on the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a cargo protein facilitating the transport of membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (GarcíaHeredia2017The). This protein is involved in the internalization of sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2b and stimulates the sodium-dependent transport of mannose and glucose, suggesting its role in enhancing the endogenous uphill transport system in the kidney (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting).

PDZK1IP1 also interacts with PDZ domain-containing molecules, which are crucial for various cellular signaling pathways. It has been implicated in the regulation of the immune microenvironment, particularly through its association with inflammation-related genes and pathways (GarcíaHeredia2017The). Although its expression is typically low in normal tissues, its overexpression in other contexts can lead to increased inflammation and altered immune responses, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under normal conditions (GarcíaHeredia2017The).

## Clinical Significance
PDZK1IP1, also known as MAP17, plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing tumor progression and patient outcomes. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PDZK1IP1 acts as a favorable prognostic factor. Its suppression, often mediated by miR-455-5p, promotes cell migration and metastasis by regulating partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer invasion (Hsiao2023MiR4555p). In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), PDZK1IP1 is identified as an oncogenic driver, with high expression levels linked to tumor growth in vivo. The presence of a CRC-enriched super-enhancer at the PDZK1IP1 locus suggests a transcriptional dependency for CRC growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2022A).

PDZK1IP1 is also implicated in the activation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cancer stem cell properties. Overexpression of PDZK1IP1 leads to increased Notch pathway activity and the expression of stem cell markers, contributing to tumor progression and the maintenance of the cancer stem cell pool (GarciaHeredia2017The). In sarcoma, high levels of PDZK1IP1, along with pH2AX, are associated with poor survival, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker and potential target for combination therapies (Perez2020Sarcoma).

## Interactions
PDZK1IP1, also known as MAP17, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with NUMB, a protein that typically inhibits the Notch signaling pathway. This interaction results in the mislocalization of NUMB, leading to increased nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and subsequent activation of the Notch pathway. This activation is linked to enhanced tumorigenic properties in cancer cells (GarciaHeredia2017The).

PDZK1IP1 also interacts with Smad4, a key mediator in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This interaction retains Smad4 in the cytosol, preventing its nuclear localization and inhibiting the formation of complexes with other Smad proteins, such as Smad2 and Smad5. This mechanism effectively suppresses TGF-β signaling (Ikeno2019PDZK1interacting).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PDZK1IP1 is targeted by miR-455-5p, which suppresses its expression. This suppression promotes OSCC cell migration and invasion by regulating partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Hsiao2023MiR4555p). PDZK1IP1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in modulating key signaling pathways that affect cancer progression.
