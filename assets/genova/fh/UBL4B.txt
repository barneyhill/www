# UBL4B

## Overview
UBL4B is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-like protein 4B, which is part of the ubiquitin-like protein family. This family is known for its role in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein stability and modulating various cellular pathways. The UBL4B protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in sleep-related traits, particularly sleep apnea, suggesting a role in circadian rhythm pathways and synaptic remodeling during sleep, with notable expression in neurons, especially within the hippocampus (Fei2024Exome). Despite these associations, the specific functions of UBL4B in humans remain to be fully elucidated, as much of the current understanding is derived from studies in model organisms like mice (Yu2021The).

## Function
UBL4B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and cellular stress responses. The protein is part of the ubiquitin-like protein family, which plays a role in tagging proteins for degradation, regulating protein stability, and modulating cellular pathways. UBL4B is active in the cytoplasm and may influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

In healthy human cells, UBL4B has been associated with sleep-related traits, particularly sleep apnea, as identified through whole exome sequencing studies. This suggests a potential role in circadian rhythm pathways and synaptic remodeling during sleep, with high expression in neurons, especially in the hippocampus (Fei2024Exome). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific function of UBL4B in healthy human cells remains unclear, as much of the research has focused on its role in mice and its potential compensatory relationship with its counterpart, UBL4A (Yu2021The).

UBL4B's evolutionary conservation and expression patterns indicate it may have roles in cellular homeostasis and protein metabolism, although its precise molecular activities in humans are not fully understood (Yu2021The).
