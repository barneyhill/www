# FKBP1A

## Overview
FKBP1A is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase 1A, commonly referred to as FKBP12. This protein is a member of the immunophilin family and functions primarily as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, which is crucial for protein folding and cellular regulation. FKBP12 is characterized by its ability to bind immunosuppressive drugs such as FK506 and rapamycin, which inhibit its isomerase activity and modulate immune responses (Nath2015Insights; Hanes2015Prolyl). The protein plays a significant role in calcium signaling by interacting with ryanodine and inositol trisphosphate receptors, thereby influencing muscle contraction and cardiac function (Perrucci2015Peptidylprolyl). Additionally, FKBP12 is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by TGF-β receptors, and has implications in cancer biology and immune regulation (Liu2016FKBP12; Wang2004The). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to clinical outcomes in conditions such as renal transplantation, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and glioblastoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2018FKBP1A; Li2022The; Xu2023Identification).

## Structure
FKBP1A, also known as FKBP12, is a protein that functions as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, playing a crucial role in protein folding and immunoregulation. The primary structure of FKBP1A consists of 108 amino acids. Its secondary structure includes five antiparallel beta-strands and one alpha-helix, which are characteristic of FK506-binding proteins (Nath2015Insights). The protein contains a prominent FKBP domain, essential for its isomerase activity, and is known for its high binding affinity to immunosuppressive drugs like FK506 and rapamycin (Hanes2015Prolyl).

The tertiary structure of FKBP1A is defined by its FK506-binding domain, which is a small domain of approximately 10 to 12 kDa (Galat2019Compression). This domain is crucial for its interaction with immunosuppressive drugs, which inhibit its PPIase activity. FKBP1A typically functions as a monomer, indicating it lacks a quaternary structure (Hanes2015Prolyl). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can occur, affecting its function and interactions. The protein does not have known splice variant isoforms, and its structure is highly conserved, reflecting its essential role in cellular processes.

## Function
FKBP1A, also known as FKBP12, is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that plays a crucial role in protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of proline residues in peptide bonds. This activity is essential for the proper folding and function of proteins within the cell (Nath2015Insights). FKBP12 is primarily located in the cytoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it interacts with ryanodine receptors (RyR1 and RyR2), stabilizing their closed-channel state and regulating calcium ion release, which is vital for muscle contraction and cardiac function (Perrucci2015Peptidylprolyl).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, FKBP12 is involved in immune regulation. It forms complexes with immunosuppressive drugs like FK506 and rapamycin, inhibiting the calcineurin-NF-AT signaling pathway in T cells, which reduces interleukin-2 synthesis and T cell proliferation (Nath2015Insights). This interaction highlights FKBP12's role in modulating immune responses and its potential impact on immune cell signaling and function (Zgajnar2019Biological).

FKBP12 also interacts with inositol trisphosphate receptors and inhibits calcineurin and mTOR, influencing cytokine production and T-cell translocation, which are critical for immune response and cardiac development (Perrucci2015Peptidylprolyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FKBP1A gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In renal transplant patients, the FKBP1A rs6041749 polymorphism is associated with renal function outcomes. Patients with the TT genotype exhibit more stable renal function, while those carrying the C allele are at a higher risk for deterioration in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting allograft function (Wu2018FKBP1A).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), FKBP1A expression is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis. High FKBP1A levels are associated with advanced tumor stages and grades, and its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly M2 macrophages, which are associated with poor survival outcomes. FKBP1A also correlates with immune checkpoint proteins, indicating a role in immune evasion and suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Li2022The).

In glioblastoma (GBM), FKBP1A expression is upregulated and associated with worse survival outcomes. It is linked to increased dendritic cell infiltration, which serves as an independent predictor of survival, highlighting its potential role as an oncogene in GBM (Xu2023Identification).

## Interactions
FKBP1A, also known as FKBP12, is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple cellular processes. It binds to the TGF-β family type I receptors, such as ALK5 and ALK2, where it regulates their signaling activity by inhibiting kinase activity through blocking the ATP binding site and preventing leaky signaling at low ligand concentrations (Wang2004The). FKBP1A's interaction with these receptors is modulated by phosphorylation events mediated by type II receptor kinases, which release FKBP12 to allow receptor activation (Wang2004The).

FKBP1A also interacts with calcium channels, including the ryanodine receptors (RyR1 and RyR2) and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R2), modulating their gating and closing kinetics, which affects muscle contraction and excitation-contraction coupling (Wang2004The). In the context of cancer, FKBP1A binds to the C-terminal RING domain of MDM2, enhancing its self-ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating MDM2 stability and function (Liu2016FKBP12).

Additionally, FKBP1A interacts with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, inhibiting its autophosphorylation and thus its activation, a process that can be reversed by the drugs FK506 and rapamycin (LopezIlasaca1998Effects). These interactions highlight FKBP1A's role in regulating diverse signaling pathways.
