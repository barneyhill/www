# TM4SF5

## Overview
TM4SF5, or transmembrane 4 L six family member 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. The TM4SF5 protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including nutrient sensing, lipid metabolism, and cell adhesion. It is involved in the regulation of mTORC1 signaling by acting as a membrane-based sensor for lysosomal arginine levels, and it modulates lipid metabolism in hepatocytes by interacting with fatty acid transporters. TM4SF5 also forms complexes with integrins and other proteins, influencing cell motility, invasion, and angiogenesis, which are critical in cancer progression and metastasis. Alterations in TM4SF5 expression have been linked to several diseases, notably cancers and liver conditions, where it contributes to tumor aggressiveness and the progression of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Park2021Tetraspanin; Rahim2023Three; Jung2019Transmembrane).

## Structure
TM4SF5 is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and two short cytoplasmic tails (Lee2008Tetraspanin). The protein's structure includes a short extracellular loop and a long extracellular loop (LEL), with the LEL playing a crucial role in binding interactions, such as with L-arginine (Jung2019Transmembrane). Specific residues in the LEL, including W124, Y126, and F128, are important for arginine binding, which is essential for TM4SF5's role in mTORC1 signaling (Jung2019Transmembrane).

TM4SF5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at residues N138 and N155, which are located in the extracellular loops (Jung2020Amino; Lee2008Blockade). These modifications are critical for its structural integrity and function, influencing protein-protein interactions and tumorigenic activities (Lee2008Blockade). The protein also forms complexes with other membrane proteins, such as integrins, contributing to its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Jung2020Amino). TM4SF5's structural features and modifications are integral to its function in cellular processes and its involvement in cancer progression.

## Function
TM4SF5 (transmembrane 4 L six family member 5) is a tetraspanin protein involved in various cellular processes, including nutrient sensing and lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, TM4SF5 plays a crucial role in sensing arginine levels for mTORC1 signaling. It forms a complex with mTOR and the amino acid transporter SLC38A9 on lysosomal membranes, facilitating arginine efflux and mTOR/S6K1 activation, which is essential for protein translation and cell proliferation (Jung2019Transmembrane). TM4SF5's interaction with mTOR is regulated by arginine availability, highlighting its role as a membrane-based sensor for lysosomal arginine levels (Jung2019Transmembrane).

TM4SF5 also influences lipid metabolism in hepatocytes by modulating the uptake and accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs). It interacts with fatty acid transporters SLC27A2 and SLC27A5, negatively regulating FFA uptake and preventing excessive lipid accumulation, which is important for maintaining energy homeostasis and preventing lipotoxicity (Park2021Tetraspanin). TM4SF5's expression and activity are linked to metabolic conditions, suggesting its role in regulating energy balance and lipid metabolism in liver cells (Kim2022TM4SF5Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TM4SF5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and liver conditions. In cancer, TM4SF5 overexpression is associated with the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. This is particularly evident in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and pancreatic cancer, where TM4SF5 overexpression correlates with poor survival rates and increased tumor aggressiveness (Rahim2023Three). TM4SF5 also interacts with CD44 to induce self-renewal properties in circulating tumor cells, contributing to cancer progression and chemoresistance (Rahim2023Three).

In liver diseases, TM4SF5 is involved in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and further to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. TM4SF5 overexpression in transgenic mice leads to phenotypes resembling NAFLD, with increased lipid accumulation and fibrotic extracellular matrix production (Ryu2020Differentiala; Kim2022TM4SF5Mediated). TM4SF5 is also implicated in immune evasion by modulating the inflammatory environment and interacting with immune cells, such as macrophages and natural killer cells, which can lead to chronic liver disease features and hepatocellular carcinoma (Kim2022TM4SF5Mediated; Sun2021TM4SF5mediated).

## Interactions
TM4SF5, a member of the tetraspanin family, engages in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It forms complexes with integrins, such as integrin alpha5, to modulate cell motility, invasion, and angiogenesis. This interaction enhances chemotactic migration and invasion in hepatocytes by activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and forming invadopodia, structures involved in extracellular matrix degradation (Lee2011Modulation). TM4SF5 also interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, where its C-terminal tail binds to the SH1 domain of c-Src, leading to its activation. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins like FAK, paxillin, and p27 Kip1, which are involved in cell adhesion and migration (Song2021N-terminus-independent).

In addition, TM4SF5 interacts with CD44, particularly the CD44v8-10 variant, to regulate the xc- system, which is important for cystine uptake and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) resistance. This interaction stabilizes the xCT light chain of the xc- system in the plasma membrane, highlighting TM4SF5's role in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms (Jung2020Amino). These interactions underscore TM4SF5's involvement in cancer progression and metastasis.
