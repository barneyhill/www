# ANKRD66

## Overview
ANKRD66 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 66, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ankyrin repeat domain 66 may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. While the specific biological functions of ANKRD66 and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, proteins with ankyrin repeats are often involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, and cytoskeletal integrity. Further research is needed to clarify the precise role of ANKRD66 in these or other cellular pathways.
