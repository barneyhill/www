# TPGS1

## Overview
TPGS1 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin polyglutamylase complex subunit 1, which is a crucial component of the tubulin polyglutamylase (TPG) complex. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically through the process of polyglutamylation, which is essential for the regulation of microtubule stability and function. TPGS1 is categorized as a centriolar satellite component, indicating its role in localizing the polyglutamylase complex to specific cellular sites such as centrioles. This localization is vital for maintaining centriolar stability and facilitating neuronal differentiation. The interactions of TPGS1 with other proteins within the TPG complex and centriolar satellites underscore its significance in cellular processes related to microtubule dynamics (Zhang2024Computing; Gheiratmand2019Spatial).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
TPGS1, a subunit of the tubulin polyglutamylase (TPG) complex, is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including TTLL1, TPGS2, LRRC49, and NICN1. The study by Zhang et al. predicts additional subunits such as TBC1D19, CSTPP1, and SANBR, with TBC1D19 being a central component interacting with five other subunits, including TPGS1 (Zhang2024Computing).

TPGS1 is also identified as a centriolar satellite component, colocalizing with PCM1 and interacting with known satellite proteins like LRRC49 and C11orf49. This suggests that TPGS1 plays a role in localizing the polyglutamylase complex to sites of polyglutamylation, such as centrioles, which is crucial for centriolar stability and neuronal differentiation (Gheiratmand2019Spatial).

The interactions of TPGS1 within the TPG complex and its association with centriolar satellites highlight its role in the regulation of microtubule stability and function. These interactions are essential for understanding the broader implications of tubulin modifications in cellular processes (Gheiratmand2019Spatial).
