# LCE3D

## Overview
LCE3D (late cornified envelope 3D) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a crucial component of the skin's protective barrier. The protein encoded by LCE3D is categorized as a structural protein, playing a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. This protein is expressed in specific layers of the epidermis, namely the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum, but not in the stratum corneum, indicating its involvement in the early stages of epidermal morphogenesis and response to epidermal injury (Niehues2016Late). The expression of LCE3D is notably upregulated in response to skin injury and inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, suggesting its role in skin barrier repair and maintenance (Hoss2013Control; Bergboer2011Psoriasis). Additionally, LCE3D is part of a gene cluster that has been implicated in various skin disorders and is associated with the body's immune response, highlighting its clinical significance in dermatological and autoimmune conditions.

## Structure


## Function
LCE3D (late cornified envelope 3D) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin's protective barrier. This protein plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. LCE3D is expressed in the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum layers of the epidermis, but not in the stratum corneum, indicating its involvement in the early stages of epidermal morphogenesis and response to epidermal injury (Niehues2016Late).

The expression of LCE3D is upregulated in response to skin injury and inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, suggesting its role in skin barrier repair and maintenance (Hoss2013Control; Bergboer2011Psoriasis). The protein is thought to function as a barrier repair protein, with its expression driven by proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 (Bergboer2011Psoriasis). Additionally, LCE3D, along with other LCE3 proteins, may be upregulated by vitamin D receptor ligands, which could aid in skin repair and improve psoriasis treatment outcomes (Hoss2013Control). These activities highlight the importance of LCE3D in maintaining skin integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCE3D gene have been implicated in several skin disorders, most notably psoriasis. Psoriasis is characterized by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and the LCE3D gene, part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, plays a role in skin barrier formation. The deletion of LCE3B and LCE3C, which are part of the same gene cluster, is a known genetic risk factor for psoriasis, and LCE3D may compensate for their loss by being upregulated in response to certain treatments, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and delphinidin (Hoss2013Control).

In addition to psoriasis, LCE3D has been associated with other conditions. For instance, its expression is altered in oral lichen planus, a chronic autoimmune condition affecting the oral mucosa, where it is identified as one of the top hub genes involved in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhang2021Bioinformatics). Furthermore, LCE3D is part of a gene expression signature linked to poor survival outcomes in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential role in cancer prognosis (Metzger2020A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LCE3D in various diseases, emphasizing its role in skin integrity and immune response.
