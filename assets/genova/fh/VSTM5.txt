# VSTM5

## Overview
VSTM5 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and transmembrane domain containing 5, which is a type I integral membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. This protein is characterized by its simple structural arrangement, including an extracellular V-set domain and a single transmembrane region, making it the simplest among known IgSF CAMs (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5 is highly conserved across species, particularly in mammals, and is extensively glycosylated, which is crucial for its proper cellular trafficking and function (Lee2016Putative; Lee2017Differential). The protein plays a significant role in the central nervous system, where it regulates neuronal morphology and migration by influencing dendritic complexity and spine morphology through interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and small GTPases like Cdc42 (Lee2016Putative).

## Structure
VSTM5 is a type I integral membrane protein composed of 199 amino acids. It features an N-terminal signal peptide, an Ig-V-set domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular region (Lee2016Putative). The protein is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and has a simple structural arrangement, which is the simplest among known IgSF CAMs (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5 is highly conserved across species, particularly in mammals, and is characterized by an extracellular V-set domain and a single membrane-spanning region (Lee2016Putative).

The protein is extensively glycosylated, with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified in its extracellular domain: Asn 43, Asn 87, Asn 101, and Asn 108 (Lee2016Putative; Lee2017Differential). Glycosylation is crucial for the proper trafficking of VSTM5 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, and it is essential for its surface expression and function (Lee2017Differential). The protein can form homomultimeric complexes in a cis configuration within the same cell membrane (Lee2016Putative).

## Function
The VSTM5 gene encodes a putative cell adhesion membrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating neuronal morphology and migration in the central nervous system (CNS) (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by a simple structural arrangement, including an extracellular V-set domain and a single membrane-spanning region (Lee2016Putative). It is highly expressed in the CNS and other tissues such as the stomach, kidney, and intestines (Lee2016Putative).

VSTM5 is involved in controlling dendritic complexity and spine morphology in neurons. In vivo studies on mice have shown that VSTM5 expression leads to increased dendritic branching and spine density, particularly affecting the formation of thin, stubby, and branched spines (Lee2016Putative). The protein also induces membrane protrusions resembling filopodia in various cell lines, suggesting a role in membrane dynamics (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5's effects on membrane structure are thought to involve the Cdc42 pathway, a key regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics (Lee2016Putative).

The protein is also involved in synapse remodeling and actin reorganization in hippocampal neurons, crucial for maintaining the structures of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5 expression increases the density and length of dendritic spines, influencing the filopodia-to-spine transition and contributing to neuronal morphology and migration in the CNS (Lee2016Putative).

## Interactions
VSTM5 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system. It is a glycoprotein that forms homomultimeric complexes in a cis configuration, meaning these complexes form within the same cell membrane rather than across neighboring cells (Lee2016Putative). VSTM5 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, as it is associated with F-actin in the formation of membrane protrusions, such as filopodia, in various cell types. This interaction is crucial for its role in actin filament interaction and membrane dynamics (Lee2016Putative).

VSTM5 also influences the activity of small GTPases, particularly Cdc42, a member of the Rho GTPase family involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein's expression increases the levels of activated Cdc42 and Rac1, suggesting that VSTM5 may activate Cdc42 to induce changes in membrane dynamics and dendritic filopodia formation (Lee2016Putative). The juxtamembrane region of VSTM5, containing multiple basic residues, is critical for inducing membrane filopodia, potentially through the activation of the Cdc42 pathway (Lee2016Putative). These interactions highlight VSTM5's role in regulating neuronal morphology and migration by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane protrusions.
