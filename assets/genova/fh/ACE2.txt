# ACE2

## Overview
The ACE2 gene encodes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and serves as a critical receptor for certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The ACE2 protein is involved in the conversion of angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor, into angiotensin-(1-7), which has vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties, thereby counterbalancing the effects of the classical RAS pathway (Burrell2012The; Turner2015ACE2). Structurally, ACE2 is characterized by a peptidase domain that facilitates its enzymatic activity and a collectrin-like domain that contributes to its function and stability (Devaux2022An). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lungs, and kidneys, and is implicated in cardiovascular and pulmonary health (Hamming2007The). Its role as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has highlighted its significance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with genetic and epigenetic variations in ACE2 influencing susceptibility to infection and disease severity (Bakhshandeh2021Variants; Kianmehr2021Epigenetic).

## Structure
The ACE2 protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 805 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa (Devaux2022An). Its primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a peptidase domain (PD) with a zinc-binding metalloprotease motif, and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain (CLD) (Devaux2022An). The PD is responsible for the enzymatic activity of ACE2, featuring a cleft for substrate binding and a zinc ion coordinated by specific histidine and glutamate residues (Devaux2022An).

The tertiary structure of ACE2 is characterized by a deep channel at the top of the molecule, which contains the catalytic site, surrounded by ridges with loops, helices, and a portion of a β-sheet (Prabakaran2004A). The protein is highly glycosylated, with several N-glycosylation sites identified, contributing to its stability and function (Yan2020Structural; Prabakaran2004A).

ACE2 forms a homodimer, with the neck domain playing a crucial role in dimerization (Barros2021The). The protein can also interact with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, forming a dimer of heterodimers (Yan2020Structural). Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene results in different isoforms, including a truncated form known as deltaACE2, which lacks the ability to bind SARS-CoV-2 (Devaux2022An).

## Function
The ACE2 gene encodes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a critical role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a key regulator of cardiovascular physiology. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase, converting angiotensin II (Ang II), a potent vasoconstrictor, into angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), which has vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This conversion helps counterbalance the classical RAS pathway, which involves ACE, Ang II, and the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), known for increasing blood pressure and contributing to cardiac remodeling and inflammation (Burrell2012The; Turner2015ACE2).

ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with its catalytic domain facing the extracellular space, allowing it to metabolize circulating peptides. It is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, lungs, and intestines, and is involved in modulating cardiac function, renal physiology, and intestinal health (Burrell2012The; Hamming2007The). In the lungs, ACE2 is expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and plays a role in maintaining the balance of the RAS, potentially mitigating the effects of increased ACE activity associated with pulmonary conditions (Hamming2007The). Additionally, ACE2 serves as a receptor for certain coronaviruses, facilitating viral entry into host cells (Turner2015ACE2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ACE2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of COVID-19. ACE2 serves as the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2, facilitating viral entry into host cells. Variations in ACE2 expression and genetic diversity can affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with higher ACE2 expression correlating with increased susceptibility and severity of infection (Kianmehr2021Epigenetic). Specific polymorphisms, such as rs4240157, rs4646155, and rs4830542, have been associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, which are comorbidities that can exacerbate COVID-19 severity (Singh2021ACE2).

Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, also play a role in regulating ACE2 expression. These modifications can influence ACE2 levels in various tissues, potentially impacting conditions like acute lung injury and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (Kianmehr2021Epigenetic). MicroRNAs, such as miR-200c and miR-421, are involved in the regulation of ACE2 and may serve as therapeutic targets for modulating its expression (Kianmehr2021Epigenetic).

Genetic variants in ACE2 can alter the binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, influencing infection risk. Variants like K31R and E37K are predicted to enhance binding affinity, potentially increasing susceptibility to infection (Bakhshandeh2021Variants). Understanding these genetic and epigenetic factors is crucial for assessing individual susceptibility to COVID-19 and developing personalized treatment strategies.

## Interactions
The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein is a critical receptor for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, facilitating viral entry into host cells. This interaction is primarily mediated by the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein to the N-terminal peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2. The binding interface includes hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding regions, with key residues such as Lys31, Glu35, Asp38, Tyr41, Met82, and Lys352 of ACE2 interacting with residues Tyr442, Leu472, Asn479, Asp480, and Thr487 of the S-protein (SENAPATI2021Contributions).

The binding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 is higher than that of SARS-CoV, partly due to specific amino acid substitutions and the presence of an N-linked glycan at Asn90 on ACE2, which enhances the interaction (Cao2020Biomechanical). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) also interacts with ACE2 and the S-protein, promoting cleavage of the S-protein and facilitating viral entry (SENAPATI2021Contributions).

ACE2 is involved in the renin-angiotensin system, where it degrades angiotensin II to generate angiotensin 1-7, counteracting the effects of the ACE/angiotensin II/AT1R axis (Kai2020Interactions). This interaction is significant in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections, as ACE2 downregulation can lead to an imbalance in this system (Kai2020Interactions).
