# CUL4A

## Overview
CUL4A is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 4A, which is a core component of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically the CRL4A complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, facilitating the targeted degradation of proteins to regulate various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and repair (Zhang2003CUL4A; Hannah2015Distinct). As a scaffold protein, cullin 4A interacts with other proteins such as DDB1 and ROC1 to form multi-protein complexes that are essential for its function in ubiquitination (Li2006Structure; Zimmerman2010Structural). The activity of cullin 4A is modulated by post-translational modifications like neddylation, which enhance its ubiquitin ligase activity (Sharma2014CUL4A). Dysregulation of CUL4A has been linked to various pathologies, including cancer, due to its critical role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell proliferation (Kopanja2009Proliferation).

## Structure
CUL4A is a protein encoded by the CUL4A gene, characterized by an elongated structure with distinct domains. The primary structure of CUL4A includes a sequence of amino acids that form a scaffold for protein interactions. The secondary structure features an arc-shaped helical N-terminal domain and a globular C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is involved in binding to substrate receptors or substrate binding adaptors, while the C-terminal domain interacts with the small RING finger protein ROC1, which is essential for recruiting the E2 enzyme to the cullin complex (Sharma2014CUL4A).

CUL4A's tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing it to function as a scaffold in the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex. The quaternary structure of CUL4A includes its assembly into multi-protein complexes, such as the CRL4 complex, where it interacts with DDB1, a protein that acts as an adaptor and substrate binding receptor (Li2006Structure; Zimmerman2010Structural).

CUL4A undergoes post-translational modifications, including neddylation, which enhances its ubiquitin ligase activity by promoting conformational changes in the E3 complex (Sharma2014CUL4A). The gene encodes multiple transcript variants, resulting in different isoforms that may affect its function (Sharma2014CUL4A).

## Function
CUL4A (cullin 4A) is a core component of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, specifically the CRL4A complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This pathway is responsible for the targeted degradation of proteins, a process essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and repair (Zhang2003CUL4A; Hannah2015Distinct). CUL4A is involved in the degradation of multiple nuclear proteins, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1, which helps manage cell cycle checkpoints and ensure proper DNA repair (Hannah2015Distinct).

CUL4A is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing processes like chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, facilitating the repair of UV-induced DNA damage by targeting proteins like DDB2 and XPC for ubiquitination and degradation (Hannah2015Distinct). The protein's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as neddylation, which enhance CRL activity (Hannah2015Distinct). CUL4A's function is critical for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell proliferation, with its dysregulation linked to various pathologies, including cancer (Kopanja2009Proliferation).

## Clinical Significance
CUL4A is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which regulates protein degradation. Overexpression of CUL4A is frequently observed in cancers such as breast, lung, colorectal, and gastric cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes (Li2018High; Cheng2019The; Wang2014CUL4A). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CUL4A overexpression correlates with increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced tumorigenic capacity, suggesting its oncogenic role (Wang2014CUL4A). 

CUL4A is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to cancer metastasis and progression. In colorectal cancer, CUL4A promotes EMT by interacting with transcription factors like ZEB1, leading to increased migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells (Li2018High). 

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CUL4A is up-regulated and contributes to EMT in small airway epithelium, indicating its role in disease pathogenesis (Ren2019The). 

CUL4A's involvement in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation further links it to cancer susceptibility, as its overexpression can lead to genomic instability and tumorigenesis (Hannah2015Distinct).

## Interactions
CUL4A is involved in several critical protein interactions, primarily as part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It forms a complex with DDB1 and ROC1, which is essential for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This complex interacts with various substrate receptors, influencing processes such as DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Bondar2006Cul4A).

CUL4A physically associates with MDM2 and p53, playing a significant role in the proteolysis of p53. This interaction is crucial for regulating p53 stability, as CUL4A enhances the decay rate of p53 in an MDM2-dependent manner. The presence of MDM2 is necessary for CUL4A to effectively polyubiquitinate p53, highlighting the importance of this interaction in the MDM2 pathway of p53 proteolysis (Banks2006L2DTLCDT2; Nag2004Cul4A).

CUL4A also interacts with γ-tubulin, a protein involved in microtubule nucleation. The CUL4A-DDB1 complex can polyubiquitinate γ-tubulin, suggesting a role in regulating its stability and centrosome-related processes. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies, indicating a functional relationship between CUL4A and γ-tubulin in maintaining centrosome stability (Thirunavukarasou2014Cullin).
