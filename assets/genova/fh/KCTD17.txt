# KCTD17

## Overview
KCTD17 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 17, which is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing (KCTD) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions and oligomerization (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). KCTD17 functions as an adaptor protein within the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins and playing a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation, gene transcription, and cytoskeleton organization (Graziola2019A). It is also involved in neurological functions, particularly in synaptogenesis and brain development, through its interactions with G protein-coupled receptors and calcium signaling pathways (Rizk2024KCTD). Mutations in KCTD17 have been linked to neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Jung2024KCTD17mediated; Todisco2020KCTD17related).

## Structure
KCTD17 is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing family, characterized by the presence of a conserved BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This domain is located in the N-terminal region and is crucial for oligomerization and interactions with other proteins, such as cullin 3 and the GABAB2 receptor (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The BTB domain in KCTD17 forms homopentamers, a common quaternary structure among KCTD proteins, which is essential for its function in protein-protein interactions (Ji2016Structural).

The predicted three-dimensional structure of KCTD17, as determined by AlphaFold, shows significant similarity to KCTD5, characterized by a central cavity surrounded by regular and exposed β-strands (Esposito2022Alphafold). This structural feature is consistent with the propeller-like fold observed in other KCTD family members (Esposito2022Alphafold). The BTB domain of KCTD17 is composed of a single β-sheet surrounded by five helices, a structure that is highly conserved across the KCTD family (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted).

KCTD17 also interacts with cullin 3, forming complexes that are crucial for its role in ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes, although it lacks the typical φ-X-E motif or 3-box/BACK domain found in other BTB proteins (Ji2016Structural).

## Function
KCTD17 is a member of the Potassium Channel Tetramerization Domain (KCTD) family, which is involved in various cellular functions. In healthy human cells, KCTD17 plays a role in regulating cellular proliferation, gene transcription, cytoskeleton organization, and protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Graziola2019A). It acts as an adaptor for the CUL3-RING E3 ligase within the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins such as PHLPP2, which is involved in insulin signaling (Kim2017Degradation). This degradation process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating metabolic pathways.

KCTD17 is also implicated in synaptogenesis and brain development, particularly through its involvement in endoplasmic reticulum-dependent calcium signaling. It is highly expressed in the basal ganglia, especially in the putamen, indicating its significant role in neurological functions (Graziola2019A). The protein's interaction with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Gβγ subunits suggests its involvement in cellular signaling pathways that influence cell growth and survival (Rizk2024KCTD). These functions highlight KCTD17's importance in both cellular and organismal processes, contributing to normal physiological functions and potentially influencing disease states when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCTD17 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurological disorders and cancers. In the context of neurological conditions, KCTD17 mutations are associated with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome, a movement disorder characterized by myoclonic jerks and dystonia. A specific heterozygous missense variant in KCTD17 (c.229 C > A, p.Leu77Ile) has been identified in patients with atypical late-onset myoclonus-dystonia, presenting symptoms such as dysphonia, vocal tremor, and upper limb myoclonus (Todisco2020KCTD17related). Another study reported a novel mutation affecting the splice site of exon 5 in KCTD17, leading to early-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders in children (Graziola2019A).

In cancer, KCTD17 is notably upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor progression by stabilizing Ras-related signaling pathways. This upregulation is linked to increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. Knockout studies in mice have shown that KCTD17 is essential for HCC progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jung2024KCTD17mediated). High KCTD17 expression in HCC patients correlates with advanced disease stages and poorer prognosis, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Jung2024KCTD17mediated).

## Interactions
KCTD17 is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its BTB domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. It acts as an adaptor for the cullin3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as proliferation and cytoskeleton organization (Jung2024KCTD17mediated). KCTD17 has a high binding affinity with Cul3, forming 5:5 heterodecameric complexes, which are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Pinkas2017Structural).

KCTD17 also interacts with the leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 (Lztr1), a known Ras destabilizer. This interaction leads to the degradation of Lztr1, resulting in the stabilization of the Ras oncogene and activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma progression (Jung2024KCTD17mediated).

Additionally, KCTD17 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with other members of the KCTD protein family, such as KCTD5, although this interaction is weaker compared to others within the family (Liao2023KCTD5). These interactions highlight KCTD17's role in complex protein networks that influence various cellular functions.
