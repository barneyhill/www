# NAGK

## Overview
NAGK is a gene that encodes the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine kinase, a crucial component in amino sugar metabolism. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in phosphorylating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate, a precursor in the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc is a vital substrate in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Campbell2021Glutamine; Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine). Beyond its enzymatic function, N-acetylglucosamine kinase is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration and neuronal development, through its interactions with components of the dynein motor complex (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Campbell2021Glutamine; Nataf2024The).

## Structure
The N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) protein is composed of 11 β-strands and 10 α-helices, forming a distinct structural arrangement. It features an N-terminal small domain (residues 1 to 117) and a C-terminal large domain (residues 118 to 307 and 335 to 344), which are arranged in a 'V' shape. The active site is located in the large domain, surrounded by a β-sheet and a small domain helix, and is divided into substrate and ATP binding sites (Dash2021Computational).

The primary substrate, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), binds in the substrate binding site, which includes residues N36, S76 to D79, and D107, extending into loop domains T127 to N130 and G145 to D152. The small domain contains conserved motifs, such as the PHOSPHATE1 motif (G9 to L19), involved in phosphate binding, while the large domain includes the ADENOSINE motif (V269 to L275), interacting with the adenine base of ATP (Dash2021Computational).

NAGK also plays non-enzymatic roles, interacting with dynein light chain roadblock 1 (DYNLRB1) to promote dynein functions in neuronal development. Genetic variations, specifically nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), can alter NAGK's structure and function, affecting both enzymatic and non-enzymatic roles (Dash2021Computational).

## Function
N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in amino sugar metabolism by phosphorylating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to produce N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. This product is essential for the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, a key substrate in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is vital for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Campbell2021Glutamine; Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine). NAGK is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, development, and division. It interacts with the dynein motor complex, particularly with proteins NudC and Lis1, to promote cell migration by facilitating nuclear-cytoplasmic coupling and influencing dynein activity (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine).

In neurons, NAGK is expressed at high levels and is critical for the development of dendrites and axons, as well as for protein aggregate clearance and cell division. It plays a role in nuclear envelope breakdown and chromosome separation during cell division by interacting with the dynein-Lis1-NudE1 complex (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine). NAGK also contributes to maintaining UDP-GlcNAc levels under nutrient-limited conditions, such as glutamine deprivation, by participating in the hexosamine salvage pathway (Campbell2021Glutamine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the SNP rs10191329 is associated with decreased NAGK expression in immune cells, particularly monocytes. This reduction may impact the NAGK-MDP-NOD2 regulatory pathway, potentially increasing MS severity by affecting immune regulation and protein glycosylation processes (Nataf2024The).

In cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), NAGK expression is elevated in tumor tissues. NAGK supports tumor growth by facilitating nutrient scavenging and recycling, especially under nutrient-limited conditions. Its deletion in PDA cells impairs tumor growth, suggesting its role in tumor progression and highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Campbell2021Glutamine).

Missense variants in NAGK, such as G11R, G32R, G120E, and A156D, have been shown to disrupt its structural integrity and interactions with other proteins, potentially leading to protein misfolding and loss of function. These variants may impact NAGK's role in neurodevelopmental disorders and other conditions related to its enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions (Dash2021Computational).

## Interactions
N-acetylglucosamine kinase (NAGK) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the dynein motor complex. NAGK interacts with nuclear distribution protein C (NudC) and lissencephaly 1 (Lis1), which are crucial for promoting cell and neuronal migration. These interactions have been demonstrated using proximity ligation assays and immunocytochemistry, showing colocalization at nuclear peripheries, cell cortices, and leading projections of migrating neurons (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine). Protein-protein docking analysis identified specific regions in NAGK that interact with NudC, with the peptide Y 157 WIAHQAVKIVFDSI 171 showing a higher binding affinity (Islam2020NAcetyldGlucosamine).

NAGK also interacts with dynein light-chain roadblock type 1 (DYNLRB1) at Golgi outposts in neuronal dendritic branch points. This interaction is essential for maintaining dendritic structure, as disruption leads to dendritic degeneration (Islam2015N-acetyl-D-glucosamine). The interaction with DYNLRB1 is part of a tripartite complex involving dynein and Golgi, which is important for dendritic growth and branching (Islam2015N-acetyl-D-glucosamine). These interactions suggest that NAGK plays a non-enzymatic role in cellular processes, particularly in neuronal function and cell migration, by forming complexes with components of the dynein motor complex.
