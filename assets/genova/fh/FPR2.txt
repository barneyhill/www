# FPR2

## Overview
The FPR2 gene encodes the formyl peptide receptor 2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is integral to the immune system's response to inflammation and infection. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, typical of Class A GPCRs, and is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as in various nonhematopoietic cells (Chen2020Structural; Ye2009International). FPR2 is notable for its ability to bind a diverse array of ligands, including formyl peptides and lipid mediators, which enables it to mediate both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, depending on the ligand involved (Tylek2021Formyl). This receptor plays a significant role in processes such as chemotaxis, angiogenesis, and the resolution of inflammation, making it a potential therapeutic target for a range of immune-related diseases (Cattaneo2013Distinct; Ye2009International).

## Structure
The formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven-transmembrane helical bundle, typical of Class A GPCRs (Chen2020Structural). The primary structure of FPR2 includes specific residues crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation, such as D106, R201, and R205, which form hydrogen bonds with ligands like WKYMVm (Chen2020Structural). The secondary structure features a disulfide bridge connecting helix III and the second extracellular loop (ECL2), with ECL2 adopting a β-hairpin conformation (Chen2020Structural).

The tertiary structure of FPR2 reveals an active conformation with a deep ligand-binding pocket, where the extracellular region forms a 'lid' over the pocket (Chen2020Structural). The quaternary structure involves the FPR2-Gi protein complex, where the α-helical domain of Gαi interacts with the cytoplasmic region of FPR2, forming a major interaction interface (Zhuang2020Structure).

FPR2 is known for its functional promiscuity, binding a wide array of ligands, including formyl peptides, non-formyl peptides, lipid mediators, and small molecules (Chen2020Structural). The receptor's ability to recognize diverse ligands is attributed to its versatile extracellular region and the amphiphilic nature of its binding pocket (Zhuang2020Structure). Specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
FPR2, also known as formyl peptide receptor 2, is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in immune response regulation in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in differentiated myeloid cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as in nonhematopoietic cells like epithelial and endothelial cells (Lee2023Formyl; Ye2009International). FPR2 is involved in mediating chemotaxis, the directed movement of immune cells towards sites of infection or injury, by interacting with various ligands, including formyl peptides and lipoxins (Cattaneo2013Distinct; Ye2009International).

The receptor is known for its ability to bind a wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands, which allows it to modulate both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. This dual role is dependent on the nature of the bound agonist and the receptor's recognition sites (Tylek2021Formyl). FPR2's interaction with lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and aspirin-triggered lipoxins mediates anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to the resolution of inflammation and immune homeostasis (Cattaneo2013Distinct; Ye2009International).

FPR2 also plays a role in angiogenesis, wound healing, and the activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells, linking innate and adaptive immune responses (Ye2009International). Its ability to interact with diverse ligands makes FPR2 an attractive therapeutic target for immune-related diseases (Tylek2021Formyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FPR2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. A single nucleotide mutation in the core promoter of the FPR2 gene reduces promoter activity, leading to decreased mRNA and protein expression in neutrophils. This mutation is associated with a history of cardiovascular disease, suggesting a link between FPR2 expression and cardiovascular conditions (Simiele2011Transcriptional).

In cystic fibrosis, the upregulation of microRNA-181b results in reduced ALX/FPR2 levels, impairing inflammation resolution and antimicrobial defense. This dysregulation contributes to chronic inflammation in cystic fibrosis patients (Pierdomenico2017microRNA181b).

FPR2 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where it mediates the cytotoxic effects of the β-amyloid peptide Aβ42. Mutations affecting FPR2's interaction with Aβ42 and humanin can influence neurodegenerative processes, highlighting its role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis (Zhu2022Structural).

In cancer, FPR2 influences macrophage polarization, affecting tumor progression. FPR2 deficiency leads to increased M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2013Cell).

## Interactions
FPR2 (formyl peptide receptor 2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in immune response regulation. FPR2 forms complexes with G proteins, specifically Gαi proteins, which are essential for its signaling pathways. The interaction involves the insertion of the C-terminal half of α5 of Gαi into the cytoplasmic cavities of FPR2, forming major interaction sites. Specific residues in FPR2, such as M233, form hydrophobic clusters with Gαi residues, and the ICL2 region of FPR2 is involved in direct interactions with Gαi, forming hydrophobic clusters and hydrogen-bonding interactions (Zhuang2022Molecular).

FPR2 also interacts with various peptide agonists, including Aβ42 and humanin (HN). The binding of these peptides involves a deep binding cavity formed by extracellular loops and helices of FPR2. The N-terminal formylated methionine of the peptides and specific residues of Aβ42 insert into a conserved binding crevice, forming contacts with residues such as L109, F110, V113, W254, F257, and Q258, which are crucial for receptor signaling (Zhu2022Structural). These interactions are essential for the agonistic activity of the peptides, influencing their neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Zhu2022Structural).
