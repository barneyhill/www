# OR1G1

## Overview
The OR1G1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily G member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. As a GPCR, OR1G1 is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates its interaction with a diverse array of odorants through a broadly tuned binding cavity. The receptor's ability to recognize a wide range of chemical compounds is attributed to its hydrophobic binding pocket and the flexibility of its ligand-binding site, allowing it to undergo conformational changes to accommodate different odorants (Charlier2012How). This adaptability is essential for the olfactory system's capacity to perceive a vast array of distinct odors, highlighting the functional significance of OR1G1 in olfactory perception (Belhassan2017Study).

## Structure
The human olfactory receptor OR1G1 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of this receptor family. The primary structure of OR1G1 includes conserved motifs such as the D(E)RY motif in transmembrane domain 3, which is crucial for receptor activation (de2015G). The secondary structure is dominated by alpha-helices forming the transmembrane domains, which are involved in the receptor's ability to interact with odorants (Kim2014Predicted).

The tertiary structure of OR1G1 is stabilized by interhelical hydrogen-bonding networks and conserved salt bridges, such as those between D3.49 and K6.30, which are common features in family A GPCRs (Kim2014Predicted). Disulfide bridges between conserved cysteine residues also contribute to the structural stability of the receptor (Kim2014Predicted). The binding pocket of OR1G1 is primarily hydrophobic, with residues like F104, M105, and F260 playing significant roles in ligand recognition (Charlier2012How).

Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, are crucial for the function and stability of OR1G1, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the available literature. The receptor's structure allows it to undergo conformational changes to accommodate various odorants, highlighting its adaptability and broad tuning capabilities (Charlier2012How).

## Function
The human gene OR1G1 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that plays a crucial role in the sense of smell. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it detects odor molecules. OR1G1 is a broadly tuned receptor, capable of recognizing a wide range of odorants due to its large recognition spectrum and plasticity in its binding cavity. This broad recognition is facilitated by non-polar interactions and hydrophobic contacts within the receptor's binding pocket, allowing it to bind odorants from different chemical families (Charlier2012How).

The receptor's binding cavity is composed of several key residues, including F104, M105, V108, T202, T206, F256, F260, and T279, which are crucial for ligand recognition. These residues contribute to the receptor's ability to recognize odorants primarily through hydrophobic interactions, allowing for flexibility in ligand orientation (Charlier2012How). OR1G1's adaptability is demonstrated by its ability to undergo conformational changes to fit different odorants, which is contrary to the classical lock-and-key model of receptor-ligand interaction (Charlier2012How). This adaptability is essential for the olfactory system's ability to perceive a vast array of distinct odors (Belhassan2017Study).

## Clinical Significance
The OR1G1 gene, an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several health conditions through its altered expression and genetic variations. In breast cancer, OR1G1 is among the olfactory receptor genes found to be differentially hypomethylated, suggesting a potential link between its methylation status and cancer development. This hypomethylation may influence pathways related to cancer progression, although the specific clinical significance of OR1G1 mutations in breast cancer is not directly addressed (Fessahaye2021Breast).

In Parkinson's Disease (PD), rare variants in OR1G1 have been associated with the disease, reaching exome-wide significance in certain analyses. However, these associations were not consistent across all datasets, indicating that further research is needed to confirm the role of OR1G1 in PD (Makarious2022Largescale).

Additionally, OR1G1 has been identified in studies exploring the genetic architecture of bile acid levels. Rare variants in OR1G1 were associated with bile acid traits, although these findings require further investigation due to a lack of replication in other cohorts (Landini2022Genomewide). The clinical implications of these associations remain to be fully elucidated.
