# FUT2

## Overview
The FUT2 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2, a glycosyltransferase responsible for the α(1,2)-fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) by adding fucose to oligosaccharides, which is essential for various biological processes, including immune response and pathogen recognition (Haga2020Genetic; Hu2022Fucosyltransferase). Fucosyltransferase 2 is categorized as a fucosyltransferase enzyme and is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences the composition of gut microbiota and the body's interaction with viruses (Campi2012Expression; Wacklin2011Secretor). Genetic variations in FUT2 can lead to a 'non-secretor' status, affecting susceptibility to certain diseases and infections, highlighting its clinical significance (Maroni2014Fucosyltransferase; Hu2022Fucosyltransferase).

## Structure
The FUT2 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2, which is responsible for adding fucose to oligosaccharides. The primary structure of FUT2 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interactions. The secondary structure of the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and folding. The tertiary structure of FUT2 forms a globular shape, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to interact effectively with substrates and other molecules.

FUT2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can influence its activity and stability. These modifications are important for the proper functioning of the enzyme in various biological processes. The gene also has several splice variant isoforms, which can affect the function and expression of the enzyme. These isoforms may lead to variations in the enzyme's activity, potentially impacting its role in different tissues or under different physiological conditions. The structural characteristics of FUT2, including its folding and modifications, are essential for its role in fucose addition to oligosaccharides, which is a critical process in the human body.

## Function
The FUT2 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 2, which is responsible for the α(1,2)-fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme catalyzes the addition of fucose to the terminal galactose on type 1 chain precursors, forming the H-type 1 antigen. This process is crucial for the synthesis of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in various mucosal tissues and body fluids, such as saliva, breast milk, and digestive juices (Haga2020Genetic; Hu2022Fucosyltransferase). The presence of these antigens, determined by the secretor status of the FUT2 gene, influences the expression of A, B, or H antigens in body fluids, which are important for interactions with intestinal flora and viruses (Hu2022Fucosyltransferase).

FUT2 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the formation of fucosylated oligosaccharides that participate in various biological processes, including immune response, pathogen recognition, and the regulation of gut microbiota composition (Campi2012Expression). The enzyme's activity is essential for the initial binding of certain viruses, such as human noroviruses, to the cell surface, which is a necessary step for infection (Haga2020Genetic). The expression of fucosylated glycans by FUT2 also plays a role in maintaining a healthy balance of intestinal microbiota, influencing the colonization ability of certain bacteria like bifidobacteria (Wacklin2011Secretor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FUT2 gene, which encodes the fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme, have significant clinical implications. These mutations can lead to a 'non-secretor' status, where individuals do not express A, B, or H antigens in body fluids. This status is associated with an increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) due to alterations in gut microbiota composition and immune responses (Maroni2014Fucosyltransferase; Hu2022Fucosyltransferase). Non-secretor status is also linked to a reduced risk of certain viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, as these viruses use histo-blood group antigens as attachment sites (Godefroy2023Microbiotainduced; King2018Fucosyltransferase).

FUT2 polymorphisms are implicated in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), where they may affect the expression of fucosylated glycans in the biliary tree, influencing bacterial adhesion and disease development (Maroni2014Fucosyltransferase). The gene's polymorphisms also impact susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, potentially through alterations in gut mucosal glycan composition and microbiota interactions (Godefroy2023Microbiotainduced). The FUT2 genotype can modify the risk of graft-versus-host disease and bacteremia following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, highlighting its role in immune system interactions (Rayes2016A).

## Interactions
Fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is involved in the fucosylation of proteins, a process that can influence various biological interactions. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), FUT2 interacts with the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM). This interaction is crucial for the fucosylation of MCAM, which plays a significant role in inhibiting colon cancer progression. Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated the physical interaction between FUT2 and MCAM in colon tissues. In FUT2-deficient mice, the glycosylation level of MCAM is reduced, indicating that FUT2-mediated fucosylation is essential for MCAM's function in CRC (Wang2023Intestinal).

While the specific mechanisms of FUT2's interactions in other contexts are not fully detailed, its role in fucosylation suggests it may participate in forming multiprotein complexes involved in glycosylation pathways. However, the context does not provide specific information on direct physical interactions of FUT2 with other proteins or nucleic acids outside of its interaction with MCAM in CRC. The role of FUT2 in other diseases, such as lung inflammation and norovirus infection, involves its enzymatic activity rather than direct protein-protein interactions (Haga2020Genetic; Saku2019Fucosyltransferase).
