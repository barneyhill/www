# EPOP

## Overview
EPOP, or elongin BC and polycomb repressive complex 2 associated protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. The protein encoded by EPOP is an accessory subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 (PRC2.1), which plays a critical role in transcriptional repression through chromatin modification. EPOP modulates the dimerization and chromatin binding of PRC2.1, influencing its ability to target specific genomic loci and maintain gene repression balance, particularly during developmental processes (Gong2024EPOP). The protein interacts with key components of the PRC2.1 complex, such as SUZ12 and RBBP4, and contains a BC-box motif that facilitates interaction with the Elongin BC complex, which is crucial for the proliferation of certain cancer cell lines (Chammas2019Engaging; Fischer2022Evolutionary). EPOP's expression is notably high in embryonic stem cells and decreases during differentiation, underscoring its role in early development (Gong2024EPOP).

## Structure
EPOP, or elongin BC and polycomb repressive complex 2 associated protein, is a component of the PRC2.1 complex and plays a role in modulating its dimerization and chromatin binding. The C-terminal domain of EPOP (EPOP(C)) has been resolved in a 2.7Å crystal structure, revealing its interaction with SUZ12, RBBP4, and PHF19. EPOP(C) consists of four structural elements: a short helix, loop 1, a β hairpin, and loop 2. These elements interact with SUZ12 and RBBP4, suggesting competition in assembling distinct holocomplexes (Gong2024EPOP). EPOP's interaction with the PRC2 core member SUZ12 is facilitated by a conserved C-terminal region, which is 52% homologous to SKIDA1, another PRC2-interacting protein (Fischer2022Evolutionary).

EPOP also contains a BC-box at its N-terminus, which interacts with the Elongin BC complex, although this interaction is not involved in the dimer disruption of PRC2.1 (Gong2024EPOP). The BC-box motif is crucial for the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines (Chammas2019Engaging). EPOP's structure and interactions suggest it plays a significant role in the regulation of PRC2.1's chromatin targeting and gene repression activities.

## Function
EPOP, or elongin BC and polycomb repressive complex 2 associated protein, functions as an accessory subunit of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.1 (PRC2.1), which is involved in chromatin modification and transcriptional repression. In healthy human cells, EPOP modulates the dimerization and chromatin binding of the PRC2.1 complex, influencing its ability to target specific genomic loci. This modulation is crucial for maintaining an appropriate balance of gene repression, particularly during developmental processes (Gong2024EPOP).

EPOP interacts with components of the PRC2.1 complex, such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12, and RBBP4, affecting their dimerization and chromatin association. This interaction restricts the over-repression of key developmental genes, ensuring proper gene expression timing and preventing premature repression (Gong2024EPOP). EPOP's role in modulating PRC2.1's chromatin targeting is achieved by disrupting the dimeric structure of the complex, which may lead to distinct chromatin binding patterns and influence gene expression (Gong2024EPOP).

EPOP is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and is downregulated during neuronal differentiation, suggesting its involvement in maintaining low expression of certain gene loci during early development and potentially in other contexts (Gong2024EPOP).

## Interactions
EPOP, or elongin BC and polycomb repressive complex 2 associated protein, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily within the context of the PRC2.1 complex. EPOP interacts with the PRC2 core member SUZ12 through a conserved C-terminal region, enhancing the methyltransferase activity of PRC2 in vitro (Fischer2022Evolutionary). It also interacts with the Elongin BC heterodimer via a BC-box at its N-terminus, which is crucial for its role in transcription elongation and protein turnover (Chammas2019Engaging; Fischer2022Evolutionary).

EPOP's interaction with Elongin BC is essential for the proliferation of several human cancer cell lines, as depletion of EPOP reduces their proliferative capacity (Chammas2019Engaging). This interaction is mediated by a crucial leucine residue (L40) in the BC-box motif, and mutation of this residue impairs the binding of Elongin BC with EPOP and PRC2 (Chammas2019Engaging).

EPOP also plays a role in modulating the dimerization and chromatin binding of the PRC2.1 complex. It disrupts the dimeric form of PRC2.1, which includes MTF2 or PHF19, thereby constraining its chromatin binding both in vitro and in vivo (Gong2024EPOP). This modulation affects the genome-wide enrichment of MTF2 and H3K27me3 in mouse epiblast-like cells (Gong2024EPOP). EPOP's interactions suggest a complex role in balancing PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 activities, influencing gene expression during cell differentiation (Gong2024EPOP).
