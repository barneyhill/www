# YPEL4

## Overview
YPEL4 (yippee like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly cell cycle regulation and proliferation. The YPEL4 protein is a member of the YPEL family, characterized by a Yippee domain, which is a putative zinc-finger-like metal-binding domain. This domain suggests potential roles in oxidative stress protection and cellular stress signaling (Turan2023Dynamic; Liang2010MVP; Truong2018Potential). YPEL4 is expressed in various human tissues and is associated with the centrosome during cell cycle phases, indicating its involvement in mitosis and cell division (Truong2018Potential). The protein interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and the major vault protein (MVP), which modulates its activity, suggesting a role in signal transduction and cellular proliferation (Liang2010MVP). Despite its known interactions and expression patterns, the precise biological functions of YPEL4 remain to be fully elucidated, with ongoing research exploring its potential implications in clinical conditions, particularly those affecting red blood cell integrity (Mattebo2021Yippee).

## Structure
The YPEL4 protein is a member of the YPEL family, characterized by the presence of a Yippee domain, which is a putative zinc-finger-like metal-binding domain (Liang2010MVP; Truong2018Potential). The primary structure of YPEL4 consists of 127 amino acids, with an estimated molecular mass of 14.3 kDa (Turan2023Dynamic). Structural predictions suggest that YPEL proteins, including YPEL4, fold into a superimposable globular structure known as the Yippee domain, except for short sequences at the amino termini (Turan2023Dynamic). This domain is shared among various protein families, indicating potential functional roles related to oxidative stress protection and cellular stress signaling (Turan2023Dynamic).

YPEL4 is expressed in various human tissues and is associated with the centrosome, particularly during cell cycle phases such as interphase and mitosis, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Truong2018Potential). The protein interacts with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, with the major vault protein (MVP) identified as a binding partner, which inhibits YPEL4-mediated Elk-1 activation (Liang2010MVP). Despite extensive research, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of YPEL4 are not explicitly detailed in the available literature.

## Function
YPEL4 (yippee like 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and proliferation. The protein is characterized by zinc-finger-like metal-binding domains and is localized to the centrosome adjacent to the nucleolus during interphase and the mitotic apparatus during mitosis, suggesting a role in cell division (Liang2010MVP; Truong2018Potential). YPEL4 is implicated in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is essential for converting extracellular stimuli into cellular responses, thereby regulating gene expression, cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, and differentiation (Truong2018Potential).

In healthy human cells, YPEL4 interacts with the major vault protein (MVP), which inhibits YPEL4-mediated activation of Elk-1, a transcription factor in the MAPK pathway. This interaction suggests that YPEL4 may play a role in MVP-mediated MAPK signaling, potentially influencing cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (Liang2010MVP). YPEL4 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, and placenta, indicating its widespread role in cellular functions (Truong2018Potential). Despite its involvement in these pathways, the precise function of YPEL4 in maintaining normal cellular functions remains to be fully elucidated (Liang2010MVP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the YPEL4 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly those affecting red blood cell (RBC) integrity and function. In mice, the absence of YPEL4 leads to secondary polycythemia, characterized by increased RBC mass and serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration, due to decreased tissue oxygenation (Mattebo2021Yippee). YPEL4-null mice exhibit ovalocytic and less deformable erythrocytes, resulting in increased clearance of these cells from circulation, which suggests a defect in RBC functionality (Mattebo2021Yippee). This condition is associated with a reduction in Band 3 protein levels in RBC membranes, although no direct interaction between YPEL4 and Band 3 was found (Mattebo2021Yippee).

The study by Mattebo et al. highlights the potential for YPEL4 mutations or expression alterations to lead to RBC membrane disorders and related clinical conditions (Mattebo2021Yippee). While the exact molecular function of YPEL4 remains unclear, its role in maintaining RBC membrane integrity suggests that disruptions could contribute to anemic conditions and impaired recovery from anemia (Mattebo2021Yippee). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of YPEL4 in human diseases.

## Interactions
YPEL4 interacts with the major vault protein (MVP) in mammalian cells, forming a protein complex that plays a role in cellular signaling pathways. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed by various assays, including luciferase activity assays, co-localization assays, GST pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation (Liang2010MVP; Truong2018Potential). YPEL4 and MVP co-localize near the mitotic apparatus, suggesting a role in mitosis-associated functions (Liang2010MVP). 

The interaction between YPEL4 and MVP influences the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly affecting the activity of the transcription factor Elk-1. Overexpression of YPEL4 increases Elk-1 activity, while MVP suppresses this activation, indicating that MVP negatively regulates YPEL4's effect on Elk-1 (Liang2010MVP; Truong2018Potential). This regulatory mechanism suggests that YPEL4 and MVP are involved in cell proliferation and signal transduction pathways (Liang2010MVP). 

In addition to its interaction with MVP, YPEL4 is implicated in maintaining red blood cell membrane integrity, although no direct interaction with the Band 3 protein was found (Mattebo2021Yippee).
