# NFE2

## Overview
The NFE2 gene encodes the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 (NF-E2), a transcription factor that is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of genes essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryocyte development. NF-E2 functions as an obligate heterodimer, typically pairing with a small Maf protein, which is crucial for its DNA-binding activity. The protein's structure includes a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper region, both of which are highly conserved and essential for its function (Chan1993Isolation). NF-E2 is predominantly active in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells, where it regulates the expression of genes critical for cell differentiation and function, such as those involved in globin gene expression and platelet formation (Andrews1993The; Chan1993Isolation). Dysregulation of NFE2, through mutations or overexpression, has been implicated in hematological disorders, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, highlighting its clinical significance (Staehle2023The).

## Structure
The human NF-E2 protein is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors, characterized by a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper region essential for dimerization (Chan1993Isolation). The protein consists of 373 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 41 kDa (Chan1993Isolation). The NF-E2 protein functions as an obligate heterodimer, typically pairing with a small Maf protein, which is crucial for its DNA-binding activity (Armstrong1996NFE2; Chan1993Isolation).

The basic DNA-binding domain is highly conserved between human and mouse NF-E2 proteins, indicating its importance in sequence-specific DNA interaction (Chan1993Isolation). The leucine zipper domain, also conserved, facilitates dimerization, which is necessary for the protein's function (Chan1993Isolation). Variations in the leucine zipper domain suggest different dimerization partners, which may influence the protein's regulatory roles (Chan1993Isolation).

An 11-amino acid segment within the protein shows complete similarity between human and mouse NF-E2, potentially indicating a motif for protein interaction or post-translational modification (Chan1993Isolation). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its dimerization properties, as it binds DNA as a heterodimer rather than a homodimer (Chan1993Isolation).

## Function
The NFE2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of genes involved in erythropoiesis and megakaryocyte development. NFE2 forms a heterodimeric complex with a small Maf protein, which is essential for its DNA-binding activity. This complex recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences, such as the extended AP-1 motif found in the locus control regions of globin gene clusters, which are critical for the regulation of globin gene expression (Andrews1993The; Chan1993Isolation).

In erythroid cells, NFE2 is vital for the high-level expression of globin genes, which are necessary for hemoglobin production and red blood cell function. The p45 subunit of NFE2 is particularly important for this process, as its absence leads to a significant reduction in globin gene expression (Lu1994Retroviral). In megakaryocytes, NFE2 is essential for the maturation process and subsequent platelet formation. Mice lacking the p45 subunit of NFE2 exhibit a complete block in megakaryocyte maturation, resulting in thrombocytopenia due to the absence of circulating platelets (Shivdasani1995Transcription).

NFE2 is primarily active in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells, including erythroid, megakaryocyte, and mast cell lineages, where it regulates the expression of genes critical for cell differentiation and function (Chan1993Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and overexpression of the NFE2 gene are clinically significant in the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). NFE2 is overexpressed in most patients with MPN, and specific mutations in this gene are found in a subset of these patients. These mutations significantly increase the risk of transformation into acute leukemia. Transgenic mice studies have shown that overexpression of NFE2 or the presence of NFE2 mutations leads to an MPN phenotype and spontaneous development of leukemia, highlighting the gene's role in disease progression (Staehle2023The).

The study also identifies the histone demethylase JMJD2C as a novel target gene of NFE2, which is elevated in MPN patients and NFE2 transgenic mice. Loss of JMJD2C selectively impairs the proliferation of JAK2 V617F mutated cells, suggesting that JMJD2C could be a promising drug target in MPN. This finding underscores the potential for targeting downstream effectors of NFE2 in therapeutic strategies (Staehle2023The).

Overall, the dysregulation of NFE2, through either mutations or overexpression, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of hematological disorders, particularly in the progression of MPN to acute leukemia.

## Interactions
NFE2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2) is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in gene regulation. NFE2 forms a heterodimer with a small Maf protein, which is essential for its DNA-binding activity. The p45 subunit of NFE2 interacts with several proteins, including the transcriptional coactivator CBP, TAF II 130, and WW domain-containing proteins such as WWP1.1. The interaction with TAF II 130, a component of the TFIID complex, is mediated by the transactivation domain of p45 and is crucial for enhancer-dependent transcription of globin genes (Amrolia1997The). 

NFE2 also interacts with WW domains through its PPXY motifs, with the p45 subunit showing high-affinity binding to the WW domain of WWP1.1, a ubiquitin ligase. This interaction is significant for the transcriptional activation of the β-globin gene, as demonstrated by the necessity of the PPXY-1 sequence for efficient transactivation (Mosser1998Physical). Additionally, NFE2 is involved in forming large multiprotein complexes with USF proteins, which regulate the recruitment and activity of RNA polymerase II at the β-globin gene locus (Zhou2010USF).
