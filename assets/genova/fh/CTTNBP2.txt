# CTTNBP2

## Overview
CTTNBP2, or cortactin binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a neuronal protein involved in the regulation of dendritic spine formation and maintenance, which are critical for synaptic connectivity and plasticity. The protein is characterized by distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins such as cortactin and contribute to its role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule stability (Chen2012CortactinBinding; Shih2020Autismlinked). CTTNBP2 is predominantly expressed in neurons and is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, with mutations in the gene linked to autism spectrum disorders (Shih2020Autismlinked). The protein's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and form biological condensates further underscores its importance in synaptic function and its potential involvement in neurological disorders (Shih2022Phase).

## Structure
The CTTNBP2 protein, encoded by the CTTNBP2 gene, is characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in neuronal cells. The protein includes an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for oligomerization, allowing both homopolymerization and heteropolymerization with other proteins (Xie2022Dendritic; Shih2020Autismlinked). This domain is also involved in interactions with cortactin, a key player in dendritic spine formation (Shih2020Autismlinked).

The C-terminal region of CTTNBP2 contains a proline-rich domain, which facilitates binding to cortactin through its SH3 domain, playing a significant role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton (Chen2012CortactinBinding). This region is also intrinsically disordered, contributing to the protein's ability to form biological condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation, a process influenced by zinc binding (Shih2022Phase).

CTTNBP2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, with the short form being predominant in the brain (Chen2012CortactinBinding). These structural features and isoforms enable CTTNBP2 to regulate dendritic spine formation and maintenance, impacting synaptic function and neuronal connectivity (Shih2020Autismlinked).

## Function
CTTNBP2, or cortactin binding protein 2, plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal morphology by stabilizing microtubules and influencing dendritic arborization and spine formation. In healthy human cells, CTTNBP2 is specifically expressed in neurons, where it associates with microtubules and F-actin, contributing to the stability and maintenance of dendritic structures (Shih2014Cortactin). The protein contains distinct domains, including a C-terminal proline-rich domain that interacts with cortactin and a middle domain sufficient for microtubule association (Shih2014Cortactin). 

CTTNBP2 is involved in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and plasticity. It interacts with cortactin, an actin-binding protein, to modulate actin dynamics within dendritic spines, thereby influencing spine density and morphology (Chen2012CortactinBinding). The protein's role in microtubule stability is highlighted by its ability to increase tubulin acetylation and resistance to microtubule-disrupting agents, which is crucial for maintaining neuronal structure and function (Shih2014Cortactin). CTTNBP2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in synaptic formation and signaling, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (Shih2020Autismlinked).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTTNBP2 gene have been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These mutations, such as M120I, R533*, and D570Y, impair protein interactions and reduce dendritic spine density, leading to synaptic impairments that are characteristic of ASD (Shih2020Autismlinked). The M120I mutation, for instance, disrupts the interaction with cortactin, a protein crucial for dendritic spine formation, resulting in impaired synaptic activity (Shih2020Autismlinked). 

Research has shown that these mutations can lead to reduced social interaction and altered neuronal morphology in mouse models, mimicking autism-like symptoms (Shih2020Autismlinked). The CTTNBP2 gene's role in synaptic regulation is further complicated by its involvement in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and zinc-induced phase transitions, which are essential for synaptic retention and protein interactions. Mutations affecting these processes can lead to morphological defects, such as reduced dendritic spine size and number, contributing to ASD pathophysiology (Shih2022Phase).

Zinc supplementation has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach, as it can ameliorate synaptic deficits and improve social behaviors in mice with certain CTTNBP2 mutations (Shih2022Phase).

## Interactions
CTTNBP2 interacts with cortactin, a protein involved in actin polymerization and branching. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal SH3 domain of cortactin and the proline-rich domain of CTTNBP2. Mutations in the SH3-binding domains of CTTNBP2 can significantly reduce its interaction with cortactin, affecting dendritic spine density and morphology (Chen2012CortactinBinding; Shih2014Cortactin). CTTNBP2 also interacts with striatin and zinedin, regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), through its N-terminal coiled-coil domains. These interactions suggest a role for CTTNBP2 in modulating the distribution of these proteins in dendritic spines (Shih2014Cortactin).

CTTNBP2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation to form condensates in dendritic spines, a process enhanced by zinc binding to its N-terminal coiled-coil region. This phase separation is crucial for synaptic retention and involves interactions with SHANK3, forming large condensates that indicate a strong physical interaction (Shih2022Phase). Autism-linked mutations in CTTNBP2, such as M120I and R533*, disrupt its interaction with cortactin, leading to impaired dendritic spine formation (Shih2020Autismlinked). These interactions highlight the role of CTTNBP2 in synaptic function and its potential involvement in neurological disorders.
