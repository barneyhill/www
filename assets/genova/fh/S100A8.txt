# S100A8

## Overview
S100A8 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A8, a member of the S100 protein family known for its role in calcium-dependent cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as calgranulin A, is characterized by its two EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding and are crucial for its function in immune responses and inflammation (Kerkhoff1998Novel; Ishikawa2000The). S100A8 often forms a heterodimer with S100A9, collectively known as calprotectin, which is involved in modulating inflammatory processes and acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule (Kerkhoff1998Novel; Gonzalez2020Role). The protein is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, playing a significant role in leukocyte adhesion and migration (Henke2006UPREGULATION). Additionally, S100A8 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Huang2020Prognostic; Minner2019DownRegulation).

## Structure
The S100A8 protein, also known as calgranulin A, is a member of the S100 protein family characterized by its calcium-binding properties. Its primary structure consists of 93 amino acids, forming two EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures responsible for calcium binding (Kerkhoff1998Novel). The secondary structure includes alpha helices, with the N-terminal EF-hand being non-canonical and having a lower affinity for calcium compared to the canonical C-terminal EF-hand (Ishikawa2000The).

In terms of tertiary structure, S100A8 forms a dimer through non-covalent interactions between hydrophobic patches of the monomers, which are related by non-crystallographic twofold symmetry (Ishikawa2000The). The quaternary structure often involves forming a heterodimer with S100A9, known as calprotectin, which plays a role in inflammatory processes (Kerkhoff1998Novel).

Post-translational modifications of S100A8 include methionine sulfoxidation, cysteine S-nitrosylation, and phosphorylation, which can impact the protein's structure and function (Nolan2023Posttranslational). These modifications are significant in the context of the protein's role in immune responses and metal ion sequestration (Nolan2023Posttranslational).

## Function
S100A8, also known as calgranulin A, is a member of the S100 protein family, which are calcium-binding proteins involved in various cellular functions. In healthy human cells, S100A8 primarily functions as part of a heterodimer with S100A9, known as calprotectin. This complex plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune responses. S100A8/A9 is involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration, particularly influencing neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells through interactions with L2 integrins (Kerkhoff1998Novel).

The S100A8/A9 complex also acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, activating immune and endothelial cells by binding to toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptors for advanced-glycation end products (RAGE). This interaction triggers signaling cascades that modulate inflammation and immune responses (Gonzalez2020Role). Additionally, S100A8/A9 is involved in the binding of polyunsaturated fatty acids in a calcium-dependent manner, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and the regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism (Kerkhoff1998Novel).

S100A8 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, predominantly in myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocytes, and is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli (Henke2006UPREGULATION). It is also involved in the activation of NFκB, a transcription factor crucial for cell proliferation and survival, particularly in keratinocytes (Voss2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100A8 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In prostate cancer, S100A8 expression is typically present in normal prostate tissue but is lost in approximately 60% of cancer cases. This loss is associated with advanced tumor stage, high Gleason grade, and increased risk of early PSA recurrence, suggesting its potential as an independent predictor of prostate cancer prognosis (Minner2019DownRegulation).

In breast cancer, higher S100A8 expression is linked to increased tumor proliferation and higher histopathological grades. Tumors with significant S100A8 expression are associated with poorer survival outcomes, particularly in non-luminal subtypes such as HER2-positive and basal phenotypes (Børkja2023S100A8).

S100A8 is also involved in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with CALR DEL mutations. Its expression is crucial for the proliferation and survival of these cells, and its up-regulation is mediated by the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (Wang2023MutationDriven).

In a broader context, high S100A8 expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in various solid cancers, including breast and bladder cancers (Huang2020Prognostic).

## Interactions
S100A8, a member of the S100 protein family, is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms a heterodimer with S100A9, known as the S100A8/A9 complex, which is crucial for the activation of NADPH oxidase, a key enzyme in the production of reactive oxygen species. This complex enhances NADPH oxidase activity by binding arachidonic acid (AA) in a calcium-dependent manner and interacting with cytosolic phox proteins, particularly p67phox and Rac-2, but not with membrane-bound flavocytochrome b (Kerkhoff2005The).

S100A8 also interacts with S100A10, as identified through protein interaction assays using SELDI-MS and co-immunoprecipitation techniques. This interaction suggests a broader network of S100 protein interactions, including potential interactions with S100A7 (Lehmann2005Detection). The structural studies of S100A8 reveal that zinc ions play a role in stabilizing its tetrameric form, which may influence its interactions with other proteins and its functional properties (Lin2016Crystal). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of S100A8 in cellular signaling and immune responses.
