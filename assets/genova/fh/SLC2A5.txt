# SLC2A5

## Overview
The SLC2A5 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 5, commonly known as GLUT5, which is a member of the solute carrier family of transporters. GLUT5 is a transmembrane protein primarily responsible for the transport of fructose across cell membranes, distinguishing it from other glucose transporters due to its specificity for fructose (Augustin2010The; Cheeseman2015Structure). It is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, where it facilitates the absorption of dietary fructose, but is also found in lower levels in other tissues such as the kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (Augustin2010The; Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein's structure, characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, is integral to its function as a transporter, and its activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic processes (Zwarts2019Identification; Cheeseman2015Structure). The regulation and expression of SLC2A5 have significant implications for metabolic health and disease, including its involvement in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and various cancers (Liang2021GLUT5; Zwarts2019Identification).

## Structure
The SLC2A5 gene encodes the GLUT5 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 2, which functions primarily as a fructose transporter. GLUT5 is composed of 501 amino acids and is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature among GLUT family members, forming a channel for substrate transport (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein lacks the tryptophan residue after the GPXXXP motif found in Class I GLUTs and instead features a hydrophobic isoleucine residue in transmembrane domain 7 (TM7), which is associated with fructose/glucose selectivity (Cheeseman2015Structure). This isoleucine residue forms a hydrophobic cluster that influences substrate specificity (Cheeseman2015Structure).

GLUT5 is primarily expressed in the small intestine, with lower levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein's structure includes specific domains for substrate binding and transport, although detailed structural information such as 3D conformation or specific binding sites is not provided in the available context (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization (Cheeseman2015Structure).

## Function
The SLC2A5 gene encodes the GLUT5 protein, a fructose transporter primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in the absorption of dietary fructose. GLUT5 facilitates the passive transport of fructose across the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, allowing fructose to enter the bloodstream (Koepsell2020Glucose; Mueckler2013The). This process is essential for the first-pass metabolism of fructose, which is primarily metabolized in the liver (Zwarts2019Identification).

GLUT5 is highly specific for fructose and does not transport glucose, distinguishing it from other glucose transporters (Augustin2010The). The expression of SLC2A5 in the intestine is regulated by the presence of fructose and diurnal rhythms, independent of fructose availability (Mueckler2013The). In addition to its primary location in the small intestine, GLUT5 is expressed at lower levels in other tissues, including the kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, although its physiological role in these tissues is less understood (Zwarts2019Identification; Augustin2010The).

GLUT5's activity is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic processes, influencing glucose and lipid metabolism. Its regulation is significant due to its involvement in fructose metabolism, which has implications for metabolic health (Zwarts2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC2A5 gene, which encodes the fructose transporter GLUT5, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SLC2A5 is significantly upregulated, contributing to increased fructose uptake and utilization, which enhances cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in LUAD patients, and targeting GLUT5 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy (Weng2018SLC2A5). SLC2A5 is also involved in the brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, where it is regulated by miR-215-3p and lnc-REG3G-3-1, affecting cancer progression (Jiang2020lncREG3G31miR2153p).

In metabolic diseases, GLUT5 expression is increased in the intestine and skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetes patients, indicating its role in fructose metabolism and potential as a treatment target (Zwarts2019Identification). The regulation of GLUT5 by liver X receptor α (LXRα) suggests that modulating its expression could impact conditions like obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Zwarts2019Identification). The upregulation of SLC2A5 in various cancers, including breast and pancreatic cancer, further underscores its clinical significance (Liang2021GLUT5).
