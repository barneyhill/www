# NUFIP2

## Overview
NUFIP2 (nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, particularly within the immune system. The protein, also named NUFIP2, functions as a cofactor that enhances the binding efficiency of Roquin proteins to specific RNA elements, thereby influencing mRNA stability and translation. This interaction is crucial for regulating the expression of inducible T-cell co-stimulatory receptor (ICOS) mRNA, among others, and plays a significant role in immune responses. NUFIP2 is predominantly expressed in the brain and immune-related tissues and is known to localize in the cytoplasm of T cells, where it can form stress granules under oxidative stress conditions. The protein's interactions are not limited to Roquin; it also binds with other proteins such as Ddx6 and the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), indicating its involvement in broader cellular processes, including ribosomal biogenesis and RNA binding (Taha2020Novel; Rehage2018Binding).

## Function
NUFIP2 (nuclear FMR1 interacting protein 2) is a crucial cofactor in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, particularly in cooperation with Roquin proteins. It plays a significant role in the regulation of inducible T-cell co-stimulatory receptor (ICOS) mRNA by binding directly to Roquin, enhancing its ability to bind specific RNA elements in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target mRNAs. This interaction promotes the decay of ICOS mRNA, thereby regulating its expression levels in cells (Rehage2018Binding).

NUFIP2 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of T cells and can aggregate into stress granules under oxidative stress conditions. It colocalizes with Roquin-1 in P bodies, which are involved in mRNA regulation, although its presence in these structures is dependent on Roquin (Rehage2018Binding). The protein is highly expressed in the brain and immune-related tissues, with its expression increasing upon T-cell stimulation, indicating its role in immune responses (Rehage2018Binding).

NUFIP2 also enhances the binding efficiency of Roquin to its target mRNA elements, forming a ternary complex that influences mRNA stability and translation, which is crucial for maintaining proper immune function (Rehage2018Binding).

## Clinical Significance
NUFIP2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in RNA binding and interaction with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Alterations in NUFIP2 expression or its interactions can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. In a study of a patient with a severe NF1 phenotype, a large germline deletion encompassing the NUFIP2 gene was identified. This deletion was associated with mental retardation, suggesting that deregulation of NUFIP2 might be linked to cognitive impairments (Pasmant2008Characterization).

NUFIP2 has also been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A transcriptome-wide association study identified NUFIP2 as one of the genes with significant associations to RA, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's susceptibility and progression (Wu2021Transcriptomewide).

In the context of immune regulation, NUFIP2 acts as a cofactor in Roquin-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation. Its interaction with Roquin proteins is crucial for the regulation of T-cell activation and differentiation, which could have implications for autoimmune conditions (Rehage2018Binding). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NUFIP2 in various conditions related to its expression and functional interactions.

## Interactions
NUFIP2 is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. It directly binds to the amino-terminal part of Roquin-1 with high affinity, forming a complex that enhances Roquin's binding affinity to specific RNA elements, such as those found in ICOS mRNA. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ICOS mRNA, where NUFIP2 enhances Roquin-mediated post-transcriptional repression (Rehage2018Binding). NUFIP2 also interacts with Ddx6, which may further enhance Roquin-dependent repression (Rehage2018Binding).

NUFIP2's interaction with Roquin is mutually exclusive with its interaction with the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), as the presence of FMRP inhibits NUFIP2's binding to Roquin, suggesting competition between Roquin and FMRP for NUFIP2 binding (Rehage2018Binding). NUFIP2 is involved in RNA binding, particularly recognizing poly(G) homopolymers, and it enhances the binding affinity of Roquin to RNA elements, forming a more stable complex (Rehage2018Binding). NUFIP2 is also associated with ribonucleoprotein complex formation and is involved in ribosomal biogenesis (Taha2020Novel).
