# RELCH

## Overview
The RELCH gene encodes the protein known as RAB11 binding and LisH domain, coiled-coil and HEAT repeat containing, which plays a significant role in cellular trafficking and lipid transport. This protein is categorized as a trafficking effector due to its interactions with members of the Rab GTPase family, including Rab11, Rab5A, and Rab25. These interactions are crucial for processes such as vesicular trafficking and nonvesicular cholesterol transport, particularly between recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. The absence of RELCH function can lead to cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Gillingham2019In; Wilson2022Proximity; Harada2018A).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
RELCH is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role as an effector of Rab11, a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking. RELCH forms a complex with Rab11 and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), which is crucial for nonvesicular cholesterol transport between recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. This complex facilitates the tethering of these cellular compartments, and its absence leads to cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes, highlighting its importance in cholesterol transport pathways (Harada2018A).

RELCH has also been identified as a potential interactor with Rab5A, another small GTPase, suggesting its involvement in the endocytic system. This interaction was identified using the MitoID approach, which revealed RELCH as a novel hit for Rab5A-GTP, indicating that RELCH may bind to the GTP-bound form of Rab5A (Gillingham2019In).

In addition to its interactions with Rab11 and Rab5A, RELCH is robustly recruited to Rab25, another member of the Rab GTPase family, further supporting its role in endocytic recycling and trafficking processes (Wilson2022Proximity). These interactions underscore RELCH's involvement in lipid transport and cellular trafficking mechanisms.
