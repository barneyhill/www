# CD2BP2

## Overview
CD2BP2 is a gene that encodes the CD2 cytoplasmic tail binding protein 2, a protein primarily involved in T-cell signaling and pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is characterized by its GYF domain, which facilitates binding to proline-rich sequences, notably in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD2 receptor, a critical component in T-cell activation (1; Nielsen2007Structural). CD2BP2 is a part of the 20S U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, playing a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the spliceosome, thereby influencing mRNA maturation and protein synthesis (Schneider2024Structure; LAGGERBAUER2005The). The protein's interactions are essential for the formation of signaling-competent assemblies in T cells, impacting interleukin-2 production and T-cell receptor signaling (Freund2002Dynamic; Nishizawa1998Identification). Despite its involvement in these processes, CD2BP2's role in cytokine expression appears to be limited, suggesting that some aspects of CD2 signaling may occur independently of this protein (Heinze2007Investigating).

## Structure
The CD2BP2 protein, also known as U5-52K, is characterized by its GYF domain, which is a novel poly-proline interacting domain. This domain is involved in binding proline-rich sequences, such as those found in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD2 receptor (1; Nielsen2007Structural). The GYF domain of CD2BP2 is well-conserved across species, except in plants, and is shared with other proteins like Snu40p/Lin1p in yeast (LAGGERBAUER2005The).

The primary structure of CD2BP2 includes a conserved N-terminal region rich in charged residues and serines, a second conserved region of about 40 amino acids, and a C-terminal GYF motif (LAGGERBAUER2005The). The secondary structure of the GYF domain consists of an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by three α-helices, while the U5-15K protein, which interacts with CD2BP2, consists of a five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices (Nielsen2007Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, CD2BP2 is part of the 20S U5 snRNP complex, where it interacts with proteins such as U5-15K and U5-102K, but it dissociates upon the formation of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (Schneider2024Structure; LAGGERBAUER2005The). The protein's interactions are crucial for the assembly and stabilization of the U5 snRNP, playing a role in pre-mRNA splicing (Schneider2024Structure).

## Function
CD2BP2 (CD2 cytoplasmic tail binding protein 2) is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily in T cells. It plays a significant role in T-cell signaling by interacting with the CD2 cytoplasmic tail through its GYF domain, which binds to proline-rich sequences. This interaction is crucial for regulating interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, enhancing IL-2 production upon CD2 crosslinking but not upon T-cell receptor crosslinking (Freund2002Dynamic; Nishizawa1998Identification). CD2BP2 is involved in the formation of signaling-competent assemblies in T cells, which depend on the recruitment of signaling molecules into lipid rafts (Freund2002Dynamic).

CD2BP2 is also implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with spliceosomal components to facilitate the assembly and function of the spliceosome. It is primarily active in the nucleus, contributing to the regulation of mRNA maturation, which impacts protein synthesis and cellular function (Heinze2007Investigating). Despite its involvement in CD2 signaling, CD2BP2 does not appear to significantly influence cytokine expression in primary cells when knocked down, suggesting that CD2 signaling may be partially independent of CD2BP2 (Heinze2007Investigating).

## Interactions
CD2BP2 interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic region of CD2, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in T-cell activation. This interaction is mediated by a 17-amino acid motif within CD2BP2, which is crucial for binding to CD2. The motif is distinct from known protein-protein interaction domains like SH3 or WW domains. Deletion or mutation of this motif abolishes the interaction, highlighting its importance (Nishizawa1998Identification). CD2BP2 does not interact with CD4, indicating specificity for CD2 (Nishizawa1998Identification).

CD2BP2 is also involved in the assembly and function of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, a component of the spliceosome. It acts as a transient component within non-catalytic complexes of the U5 snRNP and is associated with the R2TP/PFDL complex, which is involved in the biogenesis and recycling of the U5 snRNP (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike). The interaction of CD2BP2 with these complexes suggests a role in pre-mRNA splicing and possibly in maintaining the integrity of the U5 snRNP complex (Cloutier2017R2TPPrefoldinlike).
