# GNPTG

## Overview
The GNPTG gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase, which is integral to the lysosomal enzyme targeting process. This enzyme complex, a hexamer composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, is responsible for the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition markers on lysosomal hydrolases, facilitating their proper trafficking to lysosomes (Pohl2009Compensatory; Braulke2008Molecular). The gamma subunit, specifically encoded by GNPTG, is believed to enhance the catalytic activity of the complex and is involved in substrate recognition, although it does not directly interact with lysosomal enzymes (Di2021Pathogenic; Braulke2008Molecular). Mutations in GNPTG are linked to mucolipidosis type III gamma, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities and developmental delays, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Doğan2021Clinical; Pohl2009Loss).

## Structure
The GNPTG gene encodes a protein of 305 amino acids, located on chromosome 16p13.3. The mature GNPTG protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers after the cleavage of a 24-amino-acid signal peptide. It undergoes glycosylation at Asn 88 and Asn 115, which are common post-translational modifications (Braulke2008Molecular). The GNPTG protein is part of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex, a heterohexameric structure composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in a 2:2:2 molar ratio. The GNPTG gene specifically encodes the gamma subunit (Velho2019The; Braulke2008Molecular).

The role of the gamma subunit in the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex is not fully understood, but it is suggested to facilitate the proper folding of the alpha and beta subunits or maintain them in a conformation competent for enzyme recognition and binding (Braulke2008Molecular). The gamma subunit does not directly interact with lysosomal enzymes, as studies have shown that recombinant gamma subunits do not bind recombinant lysosomal arylsulfatase A, and overexpression of gamma subunits does not increase the secretion of lysosomal enzymes (Braulke2008Molecular). There are no known splice variant isoforms of the GNPTG protein mentioned in the available literature (Braulke2008Molecular).

## Function
The GNPTG gene encodes the gamma (γ) subunit of the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase, which plays a crucial role in the lysosomal enzyme targeting process. This enzyme is responsible for the initial step in the synthesis of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) recognition markers on lysosomal hydrolases. These markers are essential for the proper trafficking of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes, where they degrade macromolecules (Pohl2009Compensatory; Liu2014Three).

The GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex, in which the γ-subunit is a component, is a hexameric structure composed of α2, β2, and γ2 subunits. The α and β subunits provide catalytic activity, while the γ-subunit, encoded by GNPTG, is believed to enhance this activity and is involved in substrate recognition (Di2021Pathogenic; Ho2006Abnormal). The γ-subunit is thought to recognize conformational structures common to lysosomal enzymes, ensuring their proper sorting and delivery to lysosomes (Pohl2009Compensatory).

In healthy cells, the GNPTG gene product regulates the activity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex, maintaining the balance of its subunits and ensuring efficient lysosomal enzyme sorting and function (Pohl2009Compensatory). This process is vital for cellular homeostasis and the prevention of lysosomal storage disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GNPTG gene are associated with mucolipidosis type III gamma (MLIII gamma), a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by skeletal abnormalities, joint stiffness, and developmental delays due to impaired lysosomal enzyme trafficking. Mutations in GNPTG lead to reduced activity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase enzyme, resulting in the missorting of lysosomal enzymes and their secretion outside the cell, causing an intracellular deficiency of multiple hydrolases (Pohl2009Loss; Liu2014Three). Clinical manifestations of MLIII gamma include joint pain, stiffness, short stature, scoliosis, and mild coarsening of facial features (Doğan2021Clinical; Velho2016Enigmatic).

Specific mutations, such as the intronic mutation IVS7-10G>A, create cryptic splice sites leading to mRNA decay and absence of the gamma subunit protein (Pohl2009Loss). Other mutations, like c.477C>G (p.Y159*), are associated with severe forms of the disease, while intronic deletions can result in milder phenotypes (Doğan2021Clinical). The GNPTG gene has also been implicated in a familial form of scleroderma-like disease, expanding the mutation spectrum and understanding of phenotype-genotype correlations (Zrhidri2017Next).

## Interactions
The GNPTG gene encodes the γ-subunit of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex, which is crucial for the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal enzymes. This complex is a hexamer consisting of two α-, two β-, and two γ-subunits. The γ-subunit interacts directly with the α-subunit, specifically binding to a glycosylated region within the GNPTG binding (GB) domain, which comprises residues 535-698 of the α-subunit. This interaction is independent of the α-subunit's cysteine 70, which is involved in homodimerization (De2015Subunit).

The γ-subunit's interaction with the α-subunit is crucial for the catalytic activity of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex. Deletion of the γ-subunit-interacting domain on the α-subunit leads to a significant reduction in enzyme activity (De2015Subunit). The γ-subunit contains a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain, which is likely responsible for the selective interaction with glycosylated α-subunits (De2015Subunit).

The γ-subunit also forms disulfide-linked homodimers, which are essential for the assembly of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex. Dimerization involves cysteine 245 and is necessary for proper complex assembly, although it does not affect ER exit or trafficking through the secretory pathway (Encarnação2011Posttranslational).
