# ZNF461

## Overview
ZNF461 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 461, which is a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Additionally, zinc finger protein 461 contains a KRAB domain, known for its transcriptional repression capabilities. The protein's structure and function suggest its involvement in regulating gene expression, potentially influencing various biological processes and pathways. ZNF461 has been associated with several conditions, including asthma and evolutionary traits in certain species, indicating its significance in both health and development (Lyu2021Whole; Banerjee2021Network; Girirajan2008Sequencing; Dai2003Characterization).

## Structure
ZNF461 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2 type zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs stabilized by zinc ions. These motifs are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger motif is defined by a consensus sequence that includes cysteine and histidine residues, coordinating with a zinc atom to form the C2H2 structure (Dai2003Characterization).

In addition to the zinc finger motifs, ZNF461 contains a KRAB domain, which is a potent transcription repression domain. The KRAB domain is divided into KRAB A and KRAB B boxes, contributing to the protein's function in transcriptional repression (Dai2003Characterization). The molecular structure of ZNF461 likely includes these zinc finger motifs and KRAB domains, which are involved in DNA binding and transcriptional repression.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination may regulate the activity of ZNF461, although specific modifications for this protein are not detailed in the available context. Splice variants of ZNF461 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in distinct functions or cellular localizations (Dai2003Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF461 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of asthma, ZNF461 is associated with airway smooth muscle cells and shows increased connectivity in asthmatic conditions, suggesting a potential role in asthma pathophysiology (Banerjee2021Network). This indicates that ZNF461 may contribute to the regulation of genes involved in asthma-related cellular processes.

In gibbons, ZNF461 is disrupted due to chromosomal rearrangements, yet it appears to remain under purifying selection, suggesting its importance in maintaining certain functions despite these disruptions (Girirajan2008Sequencing). This disruption in gibbons highlights the gene's evolutionary significance, although the direct clinical implications in humans are not fully detailed.

The gene is also mentioned in studies of Japanese primitive dog breeds, where it is identified as being under selection pressure, indicating its potential involvement in traits such as body size (Lyu2021Whole). While this does not directly translate to human clinical significance, it underscores the gene's role in developmental processes.

Overall, ZNF461's involvement in these conditions suggests its importance in various biological pathways, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications in humans.
