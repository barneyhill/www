# HSPB8

## Overview
HSPB8 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein family B (small) member 8, also known as Hsp22. This protein is a member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, characterized by a conserved α-crystallin domain, which is essential for its chaperone activity (Kappé2001Characterization; Mymrikov2011Large). Hsp22 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins and facilitating their degradation through autophagy (Acunzo2012Small; Poletti2015Role). It forms a complex with the co-chaperone BAG3, enhancing the autophagic clearance of damaged proteins, which is vital for cell survival under stress conditions (Poletti2015Role; Carra2008HspB8). Mutations in the HSPB8 gene are associated with neuromuscular disorders such as distal hereditary motor neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; Bouhy2017A).

## Structure
HSPB8, also known as heat shock protein 22, is a small heat shock protein characterized by a conserved α-crystallin domain located in the COOH-terminal part of the protein. This domain is a hallmark of small heat shock proteins and is crucial for its chaperone activity (Kappé2001Characterization; Mymrikov2011Large). The primary structure of HSPB8 consists of 196 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 21.5 kDa (Kappé2001Characterization). The protein is enriched in β-strands and unordered structures, lacking the β2 strand found in many other small heat shock proteins (Mymrikov2011Large).

HSPB8 is resistant to thermal denaturation and is considered an intrinsically disordered protein, as indicated by its susceptibility to proteolysis and the presence of unordered regions (Mymrikov2011Large). The protein can form oligomers, with evidence suggesting it may exist as a monomer, dimer, or tetramer, although its exact oligomeric structure remains controversial (Mymrikov2011Large). Phosphorylation at sites such as Ser24, Ser(Thr)87, and Tyr118 affects its quaternary structure and chaperone-like activity, though the full impact of these modifications is not well understood (Mymrikov2011Large).

## Function
HSPB8, also known as Hsp22, is a small heat shock protein that plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis in human cells. It is involved in the proteostasis network by influencing both protein synthesis and degradation processes. HSPB8 is known for its chaperone-like activity, which helps prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins by facilitating their refolding or degradation through autophagy (Acunzo2012Small; Poletti2015Role).

HSPB8 forms a complex with the co-chaperone BAG3, which is crucial for its function in targeting misfolded proteins for autophagic degradation. This complex enhances the formation and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, promoting the clearance of damaged proteins and preventing their accumulation, which is vital for cell survival under stress conditions (Poletti2015Role; Carra2008HspB8).

HSPB8 also plays a role in modulating protein synthesis by inducing the phosphorylation of eIF2α, leading to a reduction in protein synthesis and the activation of autophagy. This mechanism helps manage the protein load within cells, particularly under conditions of proteotoxic stress (Poletti2015Role; Carra2009HspB8). HSPB8 is active in the cytoplasm and is recruited into stress granules, where it may help prevent irreversible protein aggregation (Poletti2015Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPB8 gene are linked to several neuromuscular disorders, including distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) type II and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2L (CMT2L). These conditions are characterized by a range of symptoms, including motor neuron degeneration and muscle weakness. The most common mutations in HSPB8 affect the Lys141 residue, leading to missense changes such as p.K141N and p.K141E, which are associated with a toxic gain-of-function effect (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; Bouhy2017A). These mutations can result in the formation of intracellular aggregates, impairing autophagy and leading to the accumulation of toxic proteins in muscle and nerve tissues (Kang2023PINK1; Bouhy2017A).

HSPB8 mutations have also been associated with distal myopathy, characterized by myofibrillar aggregates and rimmed vacuoles in muscle tissue. Specific mutations, such as c.421A>G (p.K141E) and c.515dupC (p.P173Sfs*43), have been linked to motor neuropathy combined with distal-onset myopathy (Sarparanta2020Neuromuscular; Ghaoui2016Mutations). Alterations in HSPB8 expression levels have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where its upregulation is considered protective against motoneuron degeneration (Rusmini2017The).

## Interactions
HSPB8, a small heat shock protein, interacts specifically with the protein Bag3 to form a stable stoichiometric complex. This interaction is crucial for HSPB8's chaperone activity and is not shared with other members of the HspB family or other Bag proteins (Carra2008HspB8a). The HSPB8-Bag3 complex is essential for stimulating macroautophagy, a process that aids in the degradation of misfolded proteins, such as polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (Htt43Q) (Carra2008HspB8a). The complex also includes other proteins like Hsc70 and CHIP, which facilitate the recognition and insertion of misfolded proteins into autophagosomes, highlighting its role in autophagic pathways (Crippa2010The).

HSPB8's interaction with Bag3 enhances the thermal stability of both proteins, as demonstrated by increased resistance to proteolytic cleavage when in complex (Shemetov2011Biochemical). This interaction is vital for the degradation of misfolded proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where HSPB8 helps in the autophagic removal of mutant proteins like SOD1 (Crippa2010A). The HSPB8-Bag3 complex is a key component in the cellular response to protein misfolding and stress, contributing to protein quality control mechanisms (Rusmini2017The).
