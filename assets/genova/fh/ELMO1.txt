# ELMO1

## Overview
The ELMO1 gene encodes the protein engulfment and cell motility 1, a cytoplasmic adapter protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and cytoskeletal reorganization. As a scaffold protein, ELMO1 is integral to the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase, through its interaction with Dock1, an unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). This interaction is essential for actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which underpins cell motility and the engulfment of apoptotic cells (Lee2014Arhgef16). ELMO1 is involved in the DOCK2-ELMO1-RAC1 ternary complex, adopting an elongated 'S'-like shape that facilitates its function in signal transduction (Chang2020Structure). The protein's involvement in cellular protrusions and neurite outgrowth underscores its importance in tissue development and immune responses (Arandjelovic2021ELMO1). Additionally, ELMO1's role in osteoclast function highlights its contribution to bone resorption and degradation, further emphasizing its significance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Structure
The ELMO1 protein is a scaffold protein involved in cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization. It is part of the DOCK2-ELMO1-RAC1 ternary complex, which adopts an elongated 'S'-like shape (Chang2020Structure). ELMO1 contains several domains, including an N-terminal RAS-binding domain (RBD), a non-canonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal poly-proline sequence (Chang2020Structure). The ELMO1 N-terminal domain (NTD) is composed of five pairs of anti-parallel α-helices, with helix 5B protruding into the ELMO domain (Chang2020Structure). The RBD at the N-terminus adopts a ubiquitin-like fold, which is solvent-exposed and accessible for interactions with other proteins such as RHOG and Arl4 (Chang2020Structure).

The ELMO1 PH domain is positioned in a groove between DOCK2 DHR2 and nucleotide-free RAC1, which is critical for DOCK2 GEF activity (Chang2020Structure). ELMO1 can adopt open and closed conformations, with the conformational change confined to a rotation about the hinge elbow connecting the ELMO1 ELMO and PH domains (Chang2020Structure). The structure of ELMO1 in the complex is predominantly in the open conformation, adopting an elongated, gently curved shape (Chang2020Structure).

## Function
The ELMO1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic adapter protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell migration, phagocytosis, and cytoskeletal reorganization. ELMO1 functions as a scaffold protein, interacting with other proteins to facilitate signal transduction to downstream molecules. It is particularly involved in the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase, through its interaction with Dock1, an unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1. This interaction is crucial for actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is essential for cell motility and the engulfment of apoptotic cells (Lee2014Arhgef16).

In healthy human cells, ELMO1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it participates in signaling pathways that regulate cell shape and movement. It is involved in the formation of cellular protrusions and neurite outgrowth, contributing to tissue development and immune responses (Lee2014Arhgef16). ELMO1 also plays a role in osteoclast function, influencing bone resorption and degradation by regulating actin polymerization and interacting with proteins involved in extracellular acidification and bone demineralization (Arandjelovic2021ELMO1). These activities highlight ELMO1's importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The ELMO1 gene has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in cell motility and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation. Alterations in ELMO1 expression are associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN), a common complication of diabetes. Studies have shown that increased ELMO1 expression in the kidneys of diabetic mice correlates with the overaccumulation of ECM proteins and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes, contributing to diabetic glomerulosclerosis (Shimazaki2005Genetic). Genetic variations in ELMO1, particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in introns 13 and 18, have been linked to DN susceptibility in various populations, including Japanese, African Americans, and American Indians (Omar2021Role; Leak2009Variants; Hanson2010ELMO1).

ELMO1 is also involved in chronic glomerular injury, where its overexpression leads to increased ECM protein production and reduced cell adhesion, factors that contribute to glomerulosclerosis (Shimazaki2006ELMO1). In cancer, ELMO1 has been studied for its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis, linking it to tumor mutation burden in hepatocellular carcinoma (Peng2019Intergrated). These findings suggest that ELMO1 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of both renal and cancer-related conditions.

## Interactions
ELMO1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell migration and phagocytosis. It forms a complex with DOCK2, which is involved in the activation of RAC1, a small GTPase essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization. This interaction is facilitated by the conformational change of ELMO1 from a closed to an open state, which exposes binding sites for RAC1 on DOCK2 (Chang2020Structure). ELMO1 also interacts with Dock180, another member of the DOCK family, to promote Rac-dependent cell migration. This interaction is critical for enhancing cell migration, as demonstrated by experiments with ELMO1 mutants (Grimsley2004Dock180).

In the context of breast cancer, ELMO1 interacts with the Gai2 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which is crucial for CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and invasion. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal portion of ELMO1 and is essential for the membrane translocation of ELMO1 and the activation of Rac1 and Rac2 (Li2013Association). ELMO1 also interacts with Arhgef16, a RhoG-specific GEF, promoting the clearance of apoptotic cells via RhoG-dependent Rac1 activation (Lee2014Arhgef16). Additionally, ELMO1 interacts with Cdc27, a component of the anaphase-promoting complex, through its C-terminal region (Lee2016Identification).
