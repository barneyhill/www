# EVA1A

## Overview
EVA1A, also known as TMEM166 or FAM176A, is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein eva-1 homolog A, which is a crucial regulator of programmed cell death. This protein is involved in both autophagy and apoptosis, two essential cellular processes that maintain homeostasis and regulate cell survival and death. The protein is localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes, with partial localization to the cis-Golgi, and plays a significant role in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, independent of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A). EVA1A's interaction with proteins such as ATG16L1 and MCL1 underscores its dual role in autophagy and apoptosis, making it a key player in cellular regulation and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various diseases, including cancer and cardiac conditions (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A; Liu2023EVA1A).

## Function
The EVA1A gene, also known as TMEM166 or FAM176A, encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in autophagy and apoptosis, crucial processes for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, EVA1A is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that sequester and degrade cellular components. It interacts with the autophagy-related protein ATG16L1, facilitating the recruitment of the ATG12-ATG5/ATG16L1 complex to the autophagic membrane, which is essential for autophagosome formation (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A).

EVA1A is expressed in a cell- and tissue-specific manner and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes, with partial localization to the cis-Golgi. It is associated with the autophagosomal membrane throughout its biogenesis, indicating its involvement in various stages of autophagosome development (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A). The protein's role in autophagy is independent of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, typically involved in autophagosomal precursor nucleation, highlighting its unique function in autophagic processes (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A).

EVA1A also plays a role in apoptosis, particularly under conditions of ER stress, where it interacts with MCL1 to regulate mitochondria-associated apoptosis (Liu2023EVA1A). This dual role in autophagy and apoptosis underscores EVA1A's importance in cellular regulation and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
EVA1A, also known as TMEM166 or FAM176A, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in autophagy and apoptosis. Alterations in EVA1A expression are linked to several cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EVA1A is downregulated, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This downregulation is mediated by miR-103a-3p, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration by targeting EVA1A (Xu2022Downregulation). In gastric, esophagus, and other cancers, decreased EVA1A expression correlates with tumor progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A).

In cardiac health, EVA1A deficiency leads to increased cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart failure due to impaired autophagy and increased apoptosis (Zhang2017Knockout; Zhao2021EVA1A). In liver diseases, EVA1A protects against acute liver failure by promoting autophagy, and its absence exacerbates liver injury (Lin2018Liverspecific). EVA1A also plays a role in chemoresistance in HCC, where its overexpression can reverse the effects of miR-125b, which suppresses tumor growth and autophagy (Ren2018MicroRNA125b). These findings highlight EVA1A's clinical significance in cancer, cardiac, and liver diseases.

## Interactions
EVA1A, also known as TMEM166 or FAM176A, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in autophagy and apoptosis. EVA1A interacts with MCL1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, which influences apoptosis by reducing the interaction between MCL1 and Bak, a pro-apoptotic protein. This interaction is significant in regulating mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome C, key steps in the apoptosis pathway (Liu2023EVA1A).

EVA1A also interacts with ATG16L1, a key component in autophagosome formation. This interaction is crucial for EVA1A's role in inducing autophagy, as it promotes the recruitment of the ATG12-ATG5/ATG16L1 complex to the autophagic membrane. The interaction with ATG16L1 occurs via EVA1A's C-terminal and is essential for autophagosome formation and maturation (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A).

EVA1A is also involved in autophagosome membrane formation, acting as a membrane anchor for ATG16L1, facilitating the homooligomerization of the ATG12-ATG5/ATG16L1 complex. This role is independent of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, highlighting a BECN1-independent mode of autophagy (Hu2016TMEM166EVA1A).
