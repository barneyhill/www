# NALF2

## Overview
NALF2 is a gene that encodes the NALCN channel auxiliary factor 2 protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of ion channels. The NALCN channel auxiliary factor 2 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in modulating the activity of the NALCN sodium leak channel, which is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. This protein is part of a complex that influences the flow of sodium ions across the cell membrane, thereby impacting various physiological processes, including neuronal signaling and muscle contraction. Mutations or dysregulation of the NALF2 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, affecting neurological and muscular functions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
