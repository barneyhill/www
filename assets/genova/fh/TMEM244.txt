# TMEM244

## Overview
TMEM244 is a gene that was initially believed to encode a transmembrane protein known as transmembrane protein 244. However, recent studies have reclassified TMEM244 as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with significant implications in various diseases. This lncRNA is particularly important in the context of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), where it is highly expressed in patients with Sézary syndrome, a rare and aggressive form of CTCL. The elevated expression levels of TMEM244 in these patients suggest its potential as a diagnostic marker and its involvement in cancer progression (Rassek2023TMEM244; Iżykowska2017Genetic). Beyond oncology, TMEM244 is implicated in other pathological conditions, including carotid atherosclerotic plaques in type 2 diabetes mellitus and parasitic infections such as alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, indicating its broader role in immune and inflammatory responses (Yu2022Identification; Liu2022Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM244 gene, initially thought to encode a transmembrane protein, is now identified as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) crucial for the growth of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells. Its expression is significantly higher in patients with Sézary syndrome, a rare form of CTCL, compared to healthy individuals, making it a potential diagnostic marker for the disease (Rassek2023TMEM244; Iżykowska2017Genetic). Alterations in TMEM244 expression are associated with poor overall survival in T-cell lymphoma patients, indicating its role in cancer progression (Rassek2023TMEM244).

In Sézary syndrome, TMEM244 expression is notably upregulated, with a fold change of 500.6, suggesting a strong association with the disease (Iżykowska2017Genetic). The gene's expression is also altered in patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques in type 2 diabetes mellitus, where it is part of a regulatory network involving immune and inflammatory responses (Yu2022Identification). Additionally, TMEM244 is upregulated in alveolar and cystic echinococcosis, indicating its involvement in these parasitic infections (Liu2022Analysis). These findings highlight the gene's potential involvement in various pathological conditions, although its exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.
