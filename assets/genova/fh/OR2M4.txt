# OR2M4

## Overview
OR2M4 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily M member 4, which is a part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is activated by specific odorants, such as estragole and cresyl methyl ether, which are associated with fruity odors (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR2M4 has also been identified in the human retina, indicating potential roles outside of smell perception, although these functions remain to be fully elucidated (Jovancevic2017Deep).

## Function
OR2M4 is an olfactory receptor that plays a role in the detection of specific odorants. It is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is involved in the transduction of odorant signals. OR2M4 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). 

The receptor is activated by certain odorants, such as estragole and cresyl methyl ether, which share similar chemical structures. This suggests that OR2M4 is tuned to detect odorants with common structural features, particularly ester odorants associated with fruity odors (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification). The activation of OR2M4 by these odorants leads to the accumulation of cAMP and activation of the CREB protein, which results in the expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a measure of OR activity (GonzalezKristeller2015Identification).

In addition to its role in the olfactory system, OR2M4 has been detected in the human retina, suggesting potential non-olfactory functions, although these roles are not yet fully understood (Jovancevic2017Deep).
