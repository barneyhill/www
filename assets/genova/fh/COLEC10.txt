# COLEC10

## Overview
The COLEC10 gene encodes the protein collectin liver 1 (CL-L1), a member of the collectin family, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system. CL-L1 is a pattern recognition receptor that participates in the lectin complement pathway, facilitating the recognition and clearance of pathogens through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Cedzyński2023Collectins). The protein is primarily synthesized in the liver, kidneys, and adrenals, and circulates in the bloodstream, where it can form heteromeric complexes with collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1) (Hansen2018CLL1). Beyond its immunological functions, CL-L1 is also involved in craniofacial development, acting as a chemoattractant for neural crest cells (Munye2017COLEC10). Mutations in COLEC10 are linked to 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, and alterations in its expression are associated with liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang2023The; Munye2017COLEC10).

## Structure
The COLEC10 gene encodes the collectin liver 1 (CL-L1) protein, which is a member of the collectin family involved in innate immunity. The primary structure of CL-L1 consists of 277 amino acids, featuring distinct regions: an N-terminal segment, a collagen-like region, an alpha-helical coiled-coil neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (BayarriOlmos2015Genetic). The collagen-like region includes 24 Gly-X-Y repeats, which are characteristic of collagenous structures (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

The secondary structure of CL-L1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, particularly in the CRD, which is crucial for its function in recognizing carbohydrate patterns on pathogens (BayarriOlmos2015Genetic). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the CRD, allowing it to interact with specific ligands such as D-mannose, L- and D-fucose, D-galactose, and D-GlcNAc (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

In terms of quaternary structure, CL-L1 typically forms trimers, which are stabilized by non-covalent interactions and inter-chain disulfide bonds in the collagen-like and neck regions (BayarriOlmos2015Genetic). These trimers can further oligomerize, forming complexes with other collectins like CL-K1, enhancing their role in the immune response (Cedzyński2023Collectins). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, influencing the protein's stability and function.

## Function
COLEC10 encodes collectin liver 1 (CL-L1), a protein that plays a significant role in the innate immune system. CL-L1 is involved in the lectin complement pathway, which is crucial for pathogen recognition and clearance. It binds to carbohydrates on microbial surfaces, facilitating opsonization and phagocytosis, thereby contributing to host defense mechanisms (Hansen2018CLL1). 

In healthy human cells, CL-L1 is primarily active in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream. It is synthesized in the liver, kidneys, and adrenals, and can form heteromeric complexes with collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1) in circulation (Hansen2018CLL1). These complexes are involved in complement activation, which is part of the body's innate immune response. 

CL-L1 also plays a role in craniofacial development by acting as a migratory chemoattractant during the development of the palate and jaw. It is expressed in the epithelium and mesenchyme of these structures, guiding neural crest cell migration and maintaining cellular adhesion (Munye2017COLEC10). Mutations in COLEC10 can disrupt these processes, leading to developmental disorders such as 3MC syndrome, which is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities (Munye2017COLEC10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COLEC10 gene are associated with 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, growth retardation, and cognitive impairment. Specific mutations such as c.25C>T; p.Arg9Ter, c.226delA; p.Gly77Glufs, and c.528C>G; p.Cys176Trp have been identified in patients with 3MC syndrome. These mutations lead to either truncated proteins or impair protein secretion, disrupting the normal function of the lectin complement pathway, which is crucial for craniofacial development (Munye2017COLEC10; Gajek2020Association).

Alterations in COLEC10 expression are also linked to liver fibrosis. Overexpression of COLEC10 in hepatic stellate cells is associated with increased collagen production and extracellular matrix alteration, contributing to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Serum COLEC10 levels are elevated in patients with chronic liver disease, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for liver fibrosis (Zhang2023The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), COLEC10 expression is significantly downregulated, correlating with poorer survival outcomes. Decreased expression of COLEC10 is associated with increased tumor invasiveness, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker in HCC (Zhang2018Decreased).

## Interactions
Collectin liver 1 (CL-L1), encoded by the COLEC10 gene, is a pattern recognition molecule that participates in the lectin complement pathway. CL-L1 forms heteromeric complexes with collectin kidney 1 (CL-K1), the product of the COLEC11 gene. These complexes, known as CL-LK, are stabilized by disulfide bridges and consist of two CL-K1 and one CL-L1 polypeptide chains (Gajek2020Association). The CL-LK complex can bind to carbohydrate structures on microorganisms in a calcium-dependent manner, facilitating the activation of the lectin complement pathway through interactions with mannan-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) (Munye2017COLEC10; Axelgaard2013Investigations).

CL-L1's interaction with MASP proteins is crucial for complement activation, which plays a role in immune response and embryological development (Munye2017COLEC10). The protein's carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) is responsible for binding to microbial surfaces, while the collagen-like domain forms complexes with MASP family proteins and interacts with cell receptors (Gajek2020Association). These interactions are essential for the protein's function in pathogen recognition and clearance, contributing to its role in the innate immune system.
