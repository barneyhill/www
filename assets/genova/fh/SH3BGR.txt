# SH3BGR

## Overview
The SH3BGR gene encodes the SH3 domain binding glutamate rich protein, which is a member of the small thioredoxin-like protein family characterized by the presence of SH3 domains. This protein is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Deshpande2021SH3Binding; Shi2024Methyltransferase). Although the precise function of SH3BGR in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated, it is known to be involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cytoskeletal integrity, particularly through its interactions with the serum response factor (SRF) signaling pathway (Deshpande2021SH3Binding). The protein's activity is modulated by m6A methylation, which affects its expression and stability, thereby influencing apoptosis and heart development (Shi2024Methyltransferase). SH3BGR's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, with potential implications in both cardiac health and disease.

## Function
The SH3BGR gene encodes a protein that is part of a family of small thioredoxin-like proteins with SH3 domains, primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (Deshpande2021SH3Binding; Shi2024Methyltransferase). In healthy human cells, the specific function of SH3BGR remains unclear, but it is known to be involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Shi2024Methyltransferase). SH3BGR is implicated in the regulation of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through its interaction with the serum response factor (SRF) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cardiomyocyte maturation and structural stability (Deshpande2021SH3Binding). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may play a role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and cellular viability, particularly in muscle cells (Deshpande2021SH3Binding). SH3BGR's involvement in these processes suggests its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, although its precise role in healthy tissues is not fully understood (Deshpande2021SH3Binding). The protein's activity is modulated by m6A methylation, which influences its expression and stability, impacting apoptosis and heart development (Shi2024Methyltransferase).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3BGR gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in SH3BGR expression are associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) in Down syndrome (DS) patients. Overexpression of SH3BGR, which mimics the Trisomy 21 condition, leads to activation of SRF signaling and cellular hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes, while its knockdown results in apoptosis via the Hippo signaling pathway. These disruptions in normal cardiomyocyte homeostasis suggest that SH3BGR dysregulation could contribute to CHD in DS patients (Deshpande2021SH3Binding).

SH3BGR is also involved in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. It suppresses cell migration and angiogenesis by interacting with and inhibiting STAT3 activation, a transcription factor involved in tumorigenic processes. KSHV miR-K6-3p targets SH3BGR, leading to STAT3 pathway activation, which enhances cell migration and angiogenesis, promoting tumor progression (Li2016The).

These findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of SH3BGR in therapeutic interventions for DS-related CHD and KSHV-associated tumors, emphasizing its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
The SH3 domain binding glutamate rich protein (SH3BGR) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. SH3BGR interacts with serum response factor (SRF) signaling in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, where it modulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through a RhoA-mediated pathway. This interaction enhances SRF activity, and the presence of RhoA further amplifies this effect, while inhibition of RhoA abrogates it (Deshpande2021SH3Binding). SH3BGR is also a transcriptional target of SRF, and its overexpression activates SRF signaling, leading to cellular hypertrophy. Conversely, SH3BGR knockdown results in apoptosis via the Hippo signaling pathway, indicating its role in maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis (Deshpande2021SH3Binding).

In the context of cancer, SH3BGRL, a related protein, interacts with the c-Src protein. In mice, SH3BGRL binds to the inactive form of c-Src, facilitating its activation through phosphorylation, which activates downstream signaling pathways like ERK and AKT, crucial for cancer metastasis (Wang2015Dualfaced). In breast cancer, SH3BGRL interacts with HER2, stabilizing its activation on the cell membrane and enhancing downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, contributing to drug resistance (Li2020SH3BGRL). These interactions highlight SH3BGR's role in both cardiac and cancer-related cellular processes.
