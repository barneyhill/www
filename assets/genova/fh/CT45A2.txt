# CT45A2

## Overview
CT45A2 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A2, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This protein is primarily expressed in cancerous tissues and testis, and it plays a significant role in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). CT45A2 is involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA damage repair and chemosensitivity, largely through its interaction with the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex, where it acts as an endogenous regulator of PP4 signaling (Coscia2018Multilevel). The gene's expression is often altered in cancer, contributing to disease progression and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhang2015DNA; Yang2019Ursolic). Additionally, CT45A2 has been implicated in leukemogenesis through novel gene fusions, further underscoring its clinical significance (Cerveira2010A).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The CT45A2 gene, part of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression. In non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with EGFR T790M mutations, CT45A2 is highly expressed in gefitinib-resistant cells, contributing to increased cell proliferation and motility. This suggests a role in resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, making CT45A2 a potential therapeutic target (Yang2019Ursolic). Ursolic acid has been shown to suppress CT45A2 expression, indicating its potential in overcoming drug resistance in NSCLC (Yang2019Ursolic).

In ovarian cancer, particularly epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), CT45A2 expression is associated with disease progression and reduced survival. Hypomethylation of the CT45 promoter correlates with increased expression, advanced clinical stages, and higher tumor grades, suggesting its role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Zhang2015DNA). The CT45A2 gene is also involved in a novel fusion with the MLL gene in a pediatric case of biphenotypic acute leukemia, indicating its potential role in leukemogenesis (Cerveira2010A). These findings highlight CT45A2's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CT45A2, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of ovarian cancer. It has been identified as a key player in chemosensitivity and DNA damage signaling through its interaction with the protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) complex. This interaction was confirmed in ovarian cancer cell lines, where CT45A2 co-immunoprecipitated with the regulatory subunits of the PP4 complex, including PP4R3a, PP4R3b, and PP4R2, as well as the catalytic subunit, PP4C. The interaction between CT45A2 and PP4R3b was validated through gel filtration and isothermal titration calorimetry, demonstrating a low micromolar interaction affinity. CT45A2 binding to PP4 reduces PP4 phosphatase activity, suggesting that CT45A2 acts as an endogenous regulator of PP4 signaling (Coscia2018Multilevel).

CT45A2 is also in close proximity to DNA repair factors 53BP1 and BRCA1, indicating a potential role in DNA damage repair. These interactions suggest that CT45A2 might influence the formation of platinum-DNA adducts, which are linked to increased chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer (Coscia2018Multilevel).
