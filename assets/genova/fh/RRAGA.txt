# RRAGA

## Overview
The RRAGA gene encodes the Ras-related GTP binding A protein, commonly referred to as RagA, which is a member of the Rag GTPase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is crucial for cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and autophagy in response to nutrient availability. RagA functions as a molecular switch, forming heterodimers with other Rag GTPases like RagC or RagD, to facilitate the recruitment and activation of mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface (Sekiguchi2019RagA; Brady2016Rags). The protein's structure, characterized by a GTPase domain, allows it to undergo conformational changes that are essential for its interaction with the mTORC1 complex and other cellular components (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). Mutations in the RRAGA gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cataracts, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Sambri2024Ragopathies; Chen2016Mutations).

## Structure
The RRAGA protein, part of the Rag GTPase family, plays a crucial role in mTORC1 signaling and amino acid sensing. It forms heterodimers with other Rag GTPases, such as RagC or RagD, which are essential for its function (Rogala2019Structural; Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). The primary structure of RRAGA includes a GTPase domain, which is vital for its activity and interaction with other proteins (Anandapadamanaban2019Architecture). 

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, RRAGA features conserved loops and switch regions typical of Ras-like GTPases, which engage with bound nucleotides (Anandapadamanabanaban2019Architecture). The protein's structure allows it to undergo conformational changes depending on its nucleotide-bound state, influencing its interaction with the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 (Anandapadamanabanaban2019Architecture).

The quaternary structure of RRAGA involves its heterodimerization with RagC or RagD, forming a complex that interacts with the Ragulator complex on lysosomes, crucial for mTORC1 activation (Yonehara2017Structural). This interaction is stabilized by the Ragulator complex, which acts as a scaffold for the Rag GTPases (Yonehara2017Structural). The RagA/RagC heterodimer adopts a pseudo-two-fold symmetry, with the GTPase domains positioned close to each other (Anandapadamanabanaban2019Architecture).

## Function
The RRAGA gene encodes the RagA protein, a member of the Rag GTPase family, which plays a critical role in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for regulating cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy in response to nutrient availability. RagA functions as a molecular switch, facilitating the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it becomes activated in the presence of amino acids (Sekiguchi2019RagA; Brady2016Rags). 

RagA forms heterodimers with RagC or RagD, and these complexes are crucial for mTORC1 activation. The active state of RagA, when bound to GTP, promotes mTORC1 localization to the lysosome, enabling its activation by Rheb, another GTPase (Brady2016Rags). This activation is vital for processes such as protein synthesis and cell growth under nutrient-rich conditions. Conversely, under nutrient deprivation, RagA helps inactivate mTORC1, leading to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (Brady2016Rags).

RagA is also involved in regulating lysosomal function and autophagy, with implications for cardioprotection. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, RagA influences lysosomal v-ATPase expression and autophagy flux, highlighting its role in maintaining lysosomal function (Kim2014Rag).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RRAGA gene have been linked to the development of autosomal dominant cataracts, particularly juvenile-onset posterior subcapsular cataracts. A specific heterozygous missense mutation, p.Leu60Arg, has been identified as a contributor to this condition. This mutation enhances the ability of RagA to bind GTP, leading to increased activation of the mTORC1 pathway, which is implicated in cataract formation (Sambri2024Ragopathies; Chen2016Mutations). The mutation also results in abnormal protein localization and altered lysosome function, which affects autophagy, a process crucial for lens development (Chen2016Mutations).

Another mutation, c.-16G>A, located in the 5'-UTR of the RRAGA gene, has been associated with congenital nuclear cataracts. This mutation reduces promoter activity, potentially affecting gene expression and contributing to cataract formation (Chen2016Mutations). The clinical presentations of cataracts due to RRAGA mutations are heterogeneous, with variations in severity and onset, indicating a complex relationship between these genetic alterations and cataract phenotypes (Chen2016Mutations). These findings suggest that targeting the mTORC1 pathway could be a potential therapeutic approach for cataract prevention and treatment (Chen2016Mutations).

## Interactions
RRAGA, also known as RagA, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the Ragulator complex, which serves as a scaffold to recruit Rag GTPases, including RagA, to the lysosomal membrane. This interaction is essential for the activation of mTORC1, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism (Zhang2017Structural). 

RRAGA also forms a complex with RagC or RagD, and this heterodimer is involved in mTORC1 signaling. The Ragulator complex may have guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards RagA, facilitating its role in mTORC1 activation (Zhang2017Structural). 

In addition to its role in mTORC1 signaling, RRAGA interacts with WDR35, a protein involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a potential role for RRAGA in cellular trafficking and signaling beyond its established functions (Sekiguchi2019RagA).

RRAGA is also implicated in the degradation of the CD47 protein in lung adenocarcinoma cells. It promotes CD47 degradation through the lysosome pathway, influencing tumor immune evasion by regulating macrophage phagocytosis (Zhang2023RAGA).
