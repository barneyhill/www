# CFAP77

## Overview
CFAP77, or cilia-and flagella-associated protein 77, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella in various organisms. The CFAP77 protein is characterized by its localization along the axoneme of motile cilia, particularly abundant in the middle piece, and is involved in stabilizing the outer junction of doublet microtubules. This stabilization is crucial for proper ciliary beating and coordination, as evidenced by studies in model organisms like Tetrahymena thermophila (Kubo2023Native). The protein contains unique GFG repeats that interact with tubulin, supporting the assembly and stability of the B-tubule (Andersen2024Uncovering). Although CFAP77 is not part of the human primary cilia proteome, its conservation across species suggests a similar functional role in human cells, highlighting its potential importance in maintaining ciliary activity and structural integrity (Kubo2023Native).

## Structure
CFAP77, also known as cilia-and flagella-associated protein 77, is a protein that localizes along the length of the axoneme in human airway cilia, with a higher abundance in the middle piece of the cilia. It consists of 320 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 36.5 kDa (Blackburn2017Quantitative). The protein contains GFG repeats, characterized by a conserved glycine-phenylalanine-glycine motif, which are repeated along the microtubule protofilament. These repeats are involved in specific interactions with tubulin, particularly at the outer junction of the B-tubule in motile cilia, suggesting a role in the assembly and stability of the B-tubule (Andersen2024Uncovering).

The molecular structure of these GFG repeats involves a short patch of approximately 31 residues, with the conserved phenylalanine residues making specific contacts to tubulin. This structural feature is considered a unique innovation within microtubule inner proteins to support tubulin interactions (Andersen2024Uncovering). While the primary structure of CFAP77 is well-defined, specific details about its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as any post-translational modifications or splice variants, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CFAP77, or cilia-and flagella-associated protein 77, is a protein involved in the structure and function of cilia in human cells. It localizes along the length of the axoneme, with a higher concentration in the middle piece of the cilia, suggesting a role in ciliary function (Blackburn2017Quantitative). Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully understood, CFAP77 is considered an integral component of the ciliary axoneme, as it is present in isolated axonemal preparations but absent in undifferentiated cell lysates (Blackburn2017Quantitative).

In studies involving Tetrahymena thermophila, CFAP77 has been shown to stabilize the outer junction of doublet microtubules, which is crucial for proper ciliary beating and coordination. Knockout studies in Tetrahymena indicate that the absence of CFAP77 leads to reduced ciliary beating frequency and coordination, suggesting its role in maintaining the tensile strength of the doublet microtubules (Kubo2023Native). Although CFAP77 is not found in the human primary cilia proteome, its conservation across species suggests a similar stabilizing role in human cells (Kubo2023Native). The protein's involvement in ciliary stability and function highlights its potential importance in maintaining proper ciliary activity.

## Interactions
CFAP77, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 77, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for the stability and function of cilia and flagella. In Tetrahymena thermophila, CFAP77 interacts with protofilaments A10, A11, B1, and B2 of doublet microtubules, stabilizing the outer junction by occupying taxane-binding sites on β-tubulin subunits of PF B2. Its helix-turn-helix motif is positioned on the β-tubulin C-terminus of PF A11, facilitating stable binding between the A- and B-tubules (Kubo2023Native). 

In mammalian sperm flagella, CFAP77 interacts with CCDC105, bridging the inner junction and stabilizing the structure by binding between FLATTOP and CCDC105. It also interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulin molecules, with the CTT of β-tubulin sandwiched between CFAP77 and ENKUR, indicating its role in maintaining structural integrity (Leung2022Unraveling). 

In the context of Trichomonas vaginalis, CFAP77 interacts with TvFAP35, a microtubule inner protein, to aid in B-tubule formation and tether A- and B-tubules together at the outer junction. The helix-turn-helix motif of CFAP77 is braced to PF A11 via electrostatic interactions with the coiled-coil of TvFAP35 (Zhou2024Structures).
