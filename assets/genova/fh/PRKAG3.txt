# PRKAG3

## Overview
The PRKAG3 gene encodes the protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 3, which is a regulatory component of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. AMPK is a critical enzyme involved in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis, acting as an energy sensor that responds to fluctuations in intracellular ATP and AMP levels. The gamma 3 subunit, specifically encoded by PRKAG3, is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, where it plays a significant role in regulating energy metabolism. The protein contains four cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains that form a Bateman domain, essential for binding AMP and ATP, thereby modulating AMPK activity. Variations in the PRKAG3 gene, such as the R225W mutation, have been linked to altered muscle metabolism and are of interest in both human health and animal breeding due to their impact on muscle energy dynamics and metabolic conditions (Costford2007GainofFunction; Crawford2010Naturally; Milan2000A).

## Structure
The PRKAG3 gene encodes the gamma 3 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a crucial component of the heterotrimeric AMPK complex involved in cellular energy regulation. The gamma subunit, including PRKAG3, contains four cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) domains, which form a Bateman domain. This domain is responsible for binding AMP and ATP, playing a significant role in the allosteric regulation of AMPK activity (Krishan2014Adenosine).

The PRKAG3 protein is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can influence its function in different tissues. In chickens, for example, the cPRKAG3 gene produces two transcript variants through alternative splicing at the 5′-end of exon 3, resulting in 'long' and 'short' forms. The 'long' form codes for a protein of 382 amino acids, while the 'short' form codes for a protein of 378 amino acids. Both forms contain four complete CBS domains (ProszkowiecWeglarz2006Molecular).

The gamma 3 subunit is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in white (fast-twitch, type IIb) muscle fibers, suggesting its specialized role in muscle energy metabolism (Park2003Molecular). The presence of conserved domains and the specific expression pattern highlight the functional importance of PRKAG3 in energy homeostasis.

## Function
The PRKAG3 gene encodes the gamma 3 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic alpha subunit and regulatory beta and gamma subunits. The gamma 3 subunit, encoded by PRKAG3, is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in fast-twitch glycolytic fibers (Costford2007GainofFunction; Crawford2010Naturally).

In healthy human cells, AMPK acts as an intracellular energy sensor, responding to changes in cellular energy status by activating catabolic pathways that generate ATP and inhibiting anabolic pathways that consume ATP. The gamma 3 subunit plays a crucial role in this process by detecting intracellular levels of ATP and AMP, thus influencing the activity of the AMPK complex (Crawford2010Naturally).

The R225W mutation in the PRKAG3 gene is a gain-of-function mutation that enhances AMPK activity, leading to increased oxidative capacity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This mutation is associated with higher mitochondrial content, increased glycogen storage, and reduced intramuscular triglyceride levels, which may improve muscle energy metabolism and exercise capacity (Costford2007GainofFunction; Crawford2010Naturally).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKAG3 gene, which encodes the gamma-3 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have been associated with various metabolic conditions. In pigs, a mutation known as the RN-allele leads to excessive glycogen storage in skeletal muscle, significantly affecting meat quality and processing yield (Milan2000A). This mutation results in a 70% increase in muscle glycogen content, which is economically significant in the pig breeding industry (Milan2000A).

In humans, the R225W mutation in the PRKAG3 gene is a gain-of-function mutation that enhances oxidative capacity and glucose uptake in muscle cells. This mutation is linked to increased mitochondrial content, oxidative capacity, and glycogen synthesis, potentially improving exercise performance and resistance to muscular fatigue (Crawford2010Naturally). The R225W mutation is homologous to the PRKAG3 R225Q mutation in pigs, which also causes high muscle glycogen content (Crawford2010Naturally).

While the PRKAG3 gene is primarily associated with skeletal muscle, its genetic variability may also influence lipid metabolism, particularly LDL-cholesterol levels, although no direct link to glucose metabolism has been established (Weyrich2007Role).
