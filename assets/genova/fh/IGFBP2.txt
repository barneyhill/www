# IGFBP2

## Overview
The IGFBP2 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, a member of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) family. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are involved in various physiological processes including growth, development, and metabolism. IGFBP2 is characterized by its ability to bind IGFs with high affinity, thereby regulating their interaction with IGF receptors and influencing downstream signaling pathways. Structurally, IGFBP2 contains a conserved N-terminal IGFBP domain and a C-terminal thyroglobulin type-1 domain, which are essential for its binding and regulatory functions (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The protein is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, and has been implicated in various pathological conditions such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Yau2015IGFBP2; Shen2012InsulinLike). As a multifunctional protein, IGFBP2's interactions with integrins and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) further underscore its significance in cellular signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2012InsulinLike; Schutt2004Integrinmediated).

## Structure
IGFBP2 is a protein that binds insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and is composed of 328 amino acids. It features a conserved N-terminal IGFBP domain and a C-terminal thyroglobulin type-1 domain. The N-terminal domain is characterized by six conserved disulfide bonds and a GCGCC motif, which is common among IGFBPs-1 to -5 (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The C-terminal domain contains three conserved disulfide bonds and adopts a thyroglobulin type 1 fold with some flexible regions (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). 

The protein has a central protease-sensitive and variable region, which is flanked by the globular and conserved cysteine-rich N- and C-terminal domains (Mark2005Diversity). The linker domain of IGFBP2 is intrinsically disordered and retains its disorder upon binding IGF-1, although it exhibits altered dynamics, particularly in the IGF binding region and protease cleavage sites (Jaipuria2022IGF‐dependent). 

IGFBP2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, which influence its function and stability. It can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and has splice variant isoforms that may alter its binding affinity and biological activity (Jaipuria2022IGF‐dependent).

## Function
IGFBP2 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2) plays a significant role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in various tissues and organs. It interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, cell surface proteoglycans, and integrin receptors, influencing IGF activity and contributing to growth, development, and metabolism (Yau2015IGFBP2). IGFBP2 is involved in regulating IGF-I-stimulated signaling pathways by interacting with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) and the IGF-I receptor, which modulates cellular responses such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Shen2012InsulinLike).

In healthy human cells, IGFBP2 enhances insulin sensitivity and inhibits adipogenesis, playing a crucial role in maintaining metabolic health (Yau2015IGFBP2). It is also involved in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation by enhancing AKT activation and interacting with RPTPβ, which is essential for osteoblast differentiation (Xi2014IGFBP2). IGFBP2's ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins and its presence in various cellular compartments, including the extracellular space and cytoplasm, highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes and organismal outcomes (Yau2015IGFBP2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGFBP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in metabolic disorders and cancer. In the context of obesity and insulin resistance, IGFBP2 expression is upregulated in obese adolescents with insulin resistance, suggesting a role in the dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism (Minchenko2019Expression). IGFBP2 is also linked to insulin sensitivity, with lower levels associated with higher insulin resistance in morbidly obese patients (Boughanem2021Potential).

In cancer, IGFBP2 is frequently overexpressed and is associated with tumor aggressiveness. It is involved in promoting proliferation and invasion in glioma cells and is linked to adverse outcomes in leukemia, particularly acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Yau2015IGFBP2). High levels of IGFBP2 are also observed in various other cancers, including lung and colon cancers, where it may influence tumor progression and metastasis (Yau2015IGFBP2).

IGFBP2's role in cancer is further highlighted by its interaction with the cell surface receptor RPTPβ, affecting PTEN activity, and its regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF-1α) under hypoxic conditions common in solid tumors (Yau2015IGFBP2). These interactions suggest that IGFBP2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in both metabolic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
IGFBP2 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to integrins, particularly the α5β1 integrin on A673 Ewing sarcoma cells, through an RGD (Gly-Arg-Asp) motif, affecting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and cell adhesion (Schutt2004Integrinmediated). IGFBP2 also interacts with the αvβ3 integrin in breast cancer cells, modulating IGF-mediated migration and tumor growth. This interaction is RGD-independent and can be disrupted by vitronectin and αvβ3-specific blocking antibodies (Pereira2004Bimolecular).

IGFBP2 binds to receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) via its unique heparin-binding domain (uHBD), leading to RPTPβ dimerization and inactivation. This interaction enhances IGF-I-stimulated signaling by affecting PTEN phosphorylation and AKT activation, crucial for cell migration and proliferation (Shen2012InsulinLike).

IGFBP2 can also translocate to the nucleus through a classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) sequence, interacting with importin-a. This nuclear import is essential for its pro-tumorigenic actions, such as activating the VEGF promoter, which is important for angiogenesis (Azar2013IGFBP2).
