# LIPK

## Overview
LIPK is a gene that encodes the protein lipase family member K, which is part of the lipase family of enzymes. These enzymes are primarily involved in the hydrolysis of lipids, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. Lipase family member K is characterized by its ability to catalyze the breakdown of triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol, a process essential for the mobilization of stored fats. This protein is particularly significant in the context of skin biology, where it contributes to the maintenance of the skin barrier and lipid composition. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in metabolic disorders and skin-related conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
