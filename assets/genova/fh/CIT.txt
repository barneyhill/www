# CIT

## Overview
The CIT gene encodes the protein citron rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase (CITK), which plays a pivotal role in cell division and genomic stability. CITK is a serine/threonine kinase that is crucial for cytokinesis, the process by which a single cell divides into two daughter cells. It is involved in the maturation of the midbody and the final abscission during cell division, interacting with various proteins to ensure proper assembly and function of the contractile ring and central spindle (Bassi2013Citron; Bianchi2017Citron). Beyond its role in cytokinesis, CITK is essential for maintaining chromosome integrity by facilitating DNA repair processes, such as the recruitment of RAD51 to DNA double-strand breaks (Bianchi2017Citron). Mutations in the CIT gene are linked to severe primary microcephaly, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopment and genomic stability (Shaheen2016Mutations; Bianchi2017Citron).

## Structure
The CIT gene encodes the Citron protein, which has two main isoforms: Citron-kinase (CIT-K) and Citron-N (CIT-N). CIT-K is the larger isoform with a molecular mass of 230 kD and features a modular organization similar to other AGC-kinases. It includes an amino-terminal kinase domain, an extended coiled-coil region, a phorbol-ester/DAG-type zinc finger, a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, and a Citron-Nik1 homology (CNH) domain. At its C-terminus, CIT-K has a putative SH3 partner domain and a PDZ partner domain (Bianchi2017Of). CIT-N, a shorter variant, lacks the kinase domain and is produced from an alternative transcription start site in the 10th CIT-K intron (Bianchi2017Of).

CIT-K interacts with various proteins and complexes, such as RhoA, actin filaments, and several kinesins, to localize at the cleavage furrow and midbody during cell division (Bianchi2017Of). CIT-K is also a substrate of Src, indicating phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism (Bianchi2017Of). CIT-N is crucial for dendritic spine maintenance, interacting with Golgi compartments and actin filaments, and forming complexes with proteins like Psd95, RhoA, RockII, actin, and TGN38 (Camera2008The).

## Function
The CIT gene encodes citron rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase (CITK), a protein crucial for cytokinesis and maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. CITK is involved in midbody maturation and cytokinetic abscission, processes essential for the final separation of dividing cells. It interacts with proteins such as KIF14, MKLP1, and PRC1 to regulate the assembly and function of the contractile ring and central spindle during cytokinesis (Bassi2013Citron). CITK's kinase activity is vital for these interactions, ensuring proper localization and function of these proteins (Bassi2013Citron).

Beyond its role in cytokinesis, CITK is essential for maintaining chromosome integrity. It binds to RAD51 and is required for its recruitment to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are critical for genomic stability. CITK deficiency leads to chromosomal instability and increased DNA damage, evidenced by elevated levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX) and 53BP1 foci (Bianchi2017Citron). In neural progenitor cells, CITK loss results in TP53-dependent apoptosis, highlighting its role in neural development and DNA repair (Bianchi2017Citron). CITK's functions in cytokinesis and DNA repair are interconnected, contributing to its role in maintaining genomic stability (Bianchi2017Citron).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CIT gene, which encodes citron rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase, are associated with severe primary microcephaly (PM), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly reduced head circumference and brain size at birth. This condition results from abnormal cortical brain development and is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities such as spasticity and failure to thrive (Basit2016CIT; Shaheen2016Mutations). Studies have identified homozygous splicing variants in the CIT gene in consanguineous families affected by PM, which disrupt the kinase domain essential for its biological functions (Basit2016CIT; Shaheen2016Mutations).

CIT mutations also lead to chromosomal instability and tp53-sensitive microcephaly, as observed in both human patients and animal models. The deficiency in CIT results in massive apoptosis due to cytokinesis failure, contributing to the microcephaly phenotype (Bianchi2017Citron). CIT is implicated in maintaining DNA integrity, and its loss is associated with increased DNA damage and impaired homologous recombination repair, further contributing to the pathogenesis of microcephaly (Bianchi2017Citron). These findings underscore the critical role of CIT in neurodevelopment and genomic stability, with its mutations leading to significant clinical consequences.

## Interactions
Citron kinase (CIT) is involved in several critical protein interactions during cytokinesis. It interacts with the small GTPase RhoA, which is essential for its localization and function at the cleavage furrow during cell division (Shandala2004Citron; Madaule1998Role). CIT also associates with KIF14, a kinesin motor protein, and this interaction is crucial for the proper localization of both proteins to the central spindle and cleavage furrow. The interaction between CIT and KIF14 is dependent on the kinase activity of CIT, as KIF14 is only detected in immune precipitates with the kinase-dead form of CIT (Gruneberg2006KIF14).

CIT is also known to phosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC), which is important for actomyosin contractility during cytokinesis (Yamashiro2003Citron). In Drosophila, CIT interacts with proteins such as Nebbish and Pavarotti, which are involved in midbody formation and proper localization of other spindle proteins (Bassi2013Citron). These interactions highlight CIT's role in organizing the molecular network required for successful cell division.
