# HECTD1

## Overview
HECTD1 is a gene that encodes the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, an enzyme that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes through its ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is involved in tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. HECTD1 is integral to cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis, and is involved in the assembly of branched ubiquitin linkages essential for mitotic progression. It also plays a crucial role in hematopoietic stem cell function by modulating ribosome assembly and protein synthesis rates. The gene's expression and function are implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions, including neural tube defects, congenital heart anomalies, cancer progression, and neurodegenerative diseases (Lv2021HectD1; Zohn2007The; Vaughan2022The).

## Structure
HECTD1 is a large protein consisting of 2,610 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its function. At its N-terminus, HECTD1 contains ankyrin repeat (AR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating the binding of HECTD1 to other cellular components (Singh2021Exploring; Kane2021Structural). The protein is predicted to have two ankyrin repeat motifs flanking four AR domains, with an atypical gap between AR domains 3 and 4, suggesting the possibility of an additional folded domain or an unrecognized AR sequence within this region (Kane2021Structural).

HECTD1 also includes a SADL/UNC1 (SUN) domain, a mind-bomb (MIB) domain, and a helical bundle located N-terminal to its HECT domain. The SUN domain is associated with nuclear envelope dynamics, while the MIB domain is linked to ubiquitin ligase activity (Singh2021Exploring). The C-terminal HECT domain is crucial for its ligase activity, characterized by a bilobed structure with a larger N-terminal lobe and a smaller C-terminal lobe, connected by a flexible linker essential for catalysis (Lorenz2017Structural).

HECTD1 contains eight nuclear localization sequences and four nuclear export signals, allowing it to translocate between the cytosol and the nucleus, mediated by exportin 1 (XPO1) (Kane2021Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are essential for its regulatory roles in cellular processes (Singh2021Exploring).

## Function
HECTD1 (HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its ubiquitin ligase activity. In healthy human cells, HECTD1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, particularly during mitosis. It contributes to cell cycle progression by assembling branched K29/K48 ubiquitin linkages, which are crucial for proper mitotic timing and progression (Vaughan2022The). HECTD1 interacts with components of the mitotic checkpoint complex, such as BUB3, and is implicated in the regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Vaughan2022The).

HECTD1 also plays a critical role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function by regulating ribosome assembly and protein synthesis. It is essential for maintaining a low protein synthesis rate in adult HSCs, which is crucial for their maintenance and function. Under stress conditions, HECTD1 facilitates increased ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, necessary for HSC expansion (Lv2021HectD1). The gene's involvement in ribosomal assembly ensures translation efficiency and fidelity, preventing diseases associated with hematopoietic dysfunction (Lv2021HectD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HECTD1 gene have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. In mouse models, mutations in HECTD1, such as the opm mutation, lead to defects in neural tube closure, resulting in conditions like exencephaly, where the cranial neural tube remains open (Zohn2007The). These mutations cause abnormal organization of the head mesenchyme, which is crucial for proper neural tube closure (Zohn2007The). HECTD1 is also involved in the development of the aortic arch, with mutations leading to congenital heart defects such as interrupted aortic arch type B and aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery (Sugrue2019The).

In cancer, HECTD1 influences cell migration and proliferation. It regulates the degradation of proteins involved in focal adhesion dynamics, and its depletion can enhance cell migration, potentially contributing to cancer progression (Singh2021Exploring). In glioblastoma, high HECTD1 expression is associated with decreased survival, suggesting its role in tumor proliferation (Vaughan2022The).

HECTD1 is also linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulation of HECTD1 expression is observed in conditions like spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, where it may act as a compensatory mechanism for protein accumulation (Persengiev2012Functional).

## Interactions
HECTD1, a human E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with BUB3, a component of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC), which plays a role in the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. This interaction is specific to BUB3, as HECTD1 does not interact with other MCC components like MAD2 or BUBR1. The interaction with BUB3 is consistent across different cell cycle stages and does not affect BUB3 protein levels (Vaughan2022The).

HECTD1 also interacts with ZNF622, a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is independent of HECTD1's E3 ligase activity and involves the ubiquitination of ZNF622, specifically through lysine 63 polyubiquitination, which regulates ZNF622's stability (Lv2021HectD1).

Additionally, HECTD1 binds to centriolin, a centrosome component, during mitosis. This interaction suggests a potential regulatory mechanism where HECTD1 may mediate the degradation of centriolin through ubiquitination, which could be crucial for normal cell cycle progression (Salas2023Centriolin).

HECTD1 also interacts with IQGAP1, a scaffold protein involved in cell motility, regulating its degradation and affecting focal adhesion dynamics (Shen2017HECTD1).
