# IVD

## Overview
The IVD gene encodes the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial flavoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of the essential amino acid leucine. This enzyme is classified as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, a critical step in the leucine degradation pathway (Vockley1992The; Mohsen2001Identification). Structurally, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase is a homotetramer, with each subunit containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Tiffany1997Structure). The proper function of this enzyme is crucial for preventing the accumulation of isovaleric acid, which can lead to the metabolic disorder isovaleric acidemia if not adequately metabolized (Matsubara1990Nucleotide). Mutations in the IVD gene can result in a deficiency of this enzyme, underscoring its importance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and energy production (Mohsen2001Identification).

## Structure
The human isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) is a tetrameric flavoprotein involved in leucine catabolism. Each monomer of IVD contains a molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and consists of three domains: an R-helical N-terminal domain, a β-sheet middle domain, and a second R-helical C-terminal domain (Tiffany1997Structure). The FAD is positioned between the middle and C-terminal domains of one monomer and the C-terminal domain of a neighboring monomer, contributing to the enzyme's quaternary structure (Tiffany1997Structure).

The IVD structure is similar to other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), but with distinct differences in the N-terminal segment and loop regions (Tiffany1997Structure). A notable structural feature is a bulge in helix E, which results in a shallower substrate binding cavity compared to MCAD (Tiffany1997Structure). The enzyme also contains a disulfide bond between residues C318 and C323, although its physiological relevance is unclear (Tiffany1997Structure).

IVD's catalytic base, E254, is located on helix G, which is unique compared to other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, allowing for efficient dehydrogenation of branched-chain substrates (Tiffany1997Structure). The enzyme's structure supports its substrate specificity and catalytic activity, distinguishing it from other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (Tiffany1997Structure).

## Function
The IVD gene encodes the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of leucine, an essential amino acid. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of isovaleryl-CoA to 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA, a key step in the leucine degradation pathway (Vockley1992The; Mohsen2001Identification). Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial flavoprotein that functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor (Tiffany1997Structure). The enzyme is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor with an extra leader peptide, which is then imported into the mitochondria and processed into its mature form (Matsubara1990Nucleotide).

In healthy human cells, the proper functioning of IVD is essential for preventing the accumulation of isovaleric acid, which can lead to isovaleric acidemia if not properly metabolized (Matsubara1990Nucleotide). The enzyme's activity is crucial for energy production and maintaining metabolic homeostasis, as it facilitates the transfer of electrons to the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) during the oxidative half-reaction (Mohsen2015Kinetic). Deficiency in IVD activity can result in metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism (Mohsen2001Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IVD gene, which encodes the enzyme isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase, are associated with isovaleric acidemia (IVA), a metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of isovaleryl-CoA. This accumulation can lead to severe metabolic crises, including symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, and a distinctive "sweaty feet" odor (Vockley2000Exon; Hertecant2012Clinical). IVA is an autosomal recessive disorder that can present with varying severity, from acute neonatal forms with high morbidity and mortality to milder phenotypes identified through newborn screening (Matalon2015Isovaleric).

The disorder is caused by a deficiency in the isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme, which is crucial for leucine catabolism. Mutations in the IVD gene can lead to abnormal splicing of IVD RNA, resulting in defective protein processing and activity (Vockley2000Exon). Over 40 mutations in the IVD gene have been documented worldwide, with specific mutations recurring in certain populations, such as the c.457-3_2CA>GG mutation in Korean patients (Lee2007Different; Hertecant2012Clinical). Early diagnosis and treatment, including dietary management and supplementation, can lead to normal development in affected individuals (Hertecant2012Clinical).

## Interactions
Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) interacts with several proteins, primarily within the mitochondrial matrix. One significant interaction is with the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), which is crucial for the enzyme's function in electron transfer during the catabolism of leucine. The binding of IVD to ETF is facilitated by a specific docking peptide, and this interaction can be competitively inhibited by a synthetic peptide that mimics the ETF docking site (Mohsen2015Kinetic).

IVD also interacts with mitochondrial import receptors, which are essential for its import into mitochondria. In the case of type II isovaleric acidemia, a splicing error results in a truncated IVD precursor that interacts poorly with these receptors, leading to inefficient mitochondrial import and processing (Vockley1992The). This impaired interaction is due to the deletion of a sequence that may play a direct role in receptor recognition or binding, or it may result from an altered protein structure (Vockley1992The).

Additionally, IVD's interaction with chaperonins like GroEL/ES has been noted, which aids in its expression and stability during recombinant production (Mohsen2015Kinetic). These interactions highlight the importance of IVD's structural integrity for its proper function and mitochondrial localization.
