# INSIG2

## Overview
The INSIG2 gene encodes the insulin-induced gene 2 protein, which is an integral membrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis. As a transmembrane protein, INSIG2 is involved in the inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), thereby controlling the synthesis of lipids and sterols. It achieves this by interacting with the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of key enzymes like 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), which are crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis. The gene and its protein product are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and bone health, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular lipid balance and overall metabolic regulation (Lee2005Identification; Watanabe2021Insulin-induced; Pirini2017INSIG2).

## Structure
The INSIG2 protein is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism and lipid homeostasis. The primary structure of INSIG2 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the INSIG2 gene. The secondary structure includes six transmembrane segments (TMs), which are organized into a helical bundle. This bundle is formed by TM1, TM2, TM5, and TM6, connected by a long segment and displaying internal pseudo twofold symmetry (Ren2015Crystal).

The tertiary structure of INSIG2 involves the folding of these transmembrane helices into a three-dimensional shape, forming a V-shaped cavity that can accommodate molecules such as 25-hydroxycholesterol. This cavity is crucial for the protein's function in sterol regulation (Ren2015Crystal). Specific residues, such as Phe115, are critical for the recognition of 25-hydroxycholesterol, while others mediate interactions with Scap, a protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis (Ren2015Crystal).

INSIG2 may form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, although it is suggested to be monomeric in solution. TM4 is potentially involved in hetero-oligomerization with Scap (Ren2015Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of INSIG2.

## Function
INSIG2 is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in human cells. It is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions by inhibiting the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are transcription factors that promote the synthesis of lipids and sterols. INSIG2 achieves this by binding to the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in a sterol-dependent manner, preventing the SCAP/SREBP complex from translocating to the Golgi apparatus. This action effectively traps SREBPs in the ER, reducing their nuclear content and subsequently decreasing the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids (Lee2005Identification; Dong2012Dual).

INSIG2 also plays a role in the feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. This regulation is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis within the cell (Dong2012Dual; Watanabe2021Insulin-induced). INSIG2 is constitutively active, providing a constant level of feedback control, and is involved in various signaling pathways, including those related to ER stress and antiviral functions (Lee2005Identification; Watanabe2021Insulin-induced).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the INSIG2 gene have been associated with various metabolic and health conditions. The gene is implicated in obesity, with certain polymorphisms like rs7566605 being linked to increased body mass index (BMI) and a higher probability of developing obesity in specific ethnic subgroups (Pirini2017INSIG2). In children, the SNP rs17047757 within INSIG2 is associated with overweight, while rs12464355 is linked to lower LDL cholesterol levels, suggesting a protective role against dyslipidemia (Kaulfers2015Association).

INSIG2 is also involved in cancer risk. The rs6726538 polymorphism has been associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in the Bangladeshi population, with the T allele being more frequent in patients (Hasan2021Polymorphic). Additionally, INSIG2 expression has been linked to the progression of colorectal and pancreatic cancers, indicating its potential role in various malignancies (Hasan2021Polymorphic).

In bone health, disruptions in INSIG2, along with INSIG1, affect cholesterol metabolism, leading to defects in bone formation and homeostasis. This is particularly evident in conditions resembling osteogenesis imperfecta, where altered cholesterol levels impact primary cilium formation and bone development (Suzuki2020Disruption).

## Interactions
INSIG2 is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cholesterol metabolism and lipid synthesis. It interacts with sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) in a sterol-dependent manner. This interaction retains the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing the activation of SREBPs and thus inhibiting cholesterol synthesis (Dong2012Dual; McFarlane2014Insig).

INSIG2 also binds to HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation. This process is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase gp78, which is crucial for the sterol-regulated degradation pathway (Song2005Gp78; Zhou2020Competitive). The Cys215 residue of INSIG2 is a significant site for ubiquitylation by gp78, and its oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) can stabilize the protein, affecting its degradation (Zhou2020Competitive).

INSIG2 also interacts with oxysterols, which are involved in the upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4. This interaction is crucial for activating the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, although INSIG2 does not directly bind to PERK (Watanabe2021Insulin-induced). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of INSIG2 in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis.
