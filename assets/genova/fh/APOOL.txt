# APOOL

## Overview
APOOL is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein O-like, which is a mitochondrial membrane protein involved in maintaining the structural integrity of mitochondria. This protein is a component of the Mitofilin/MINOS complex, a critical assembly for the regulation of cristae morphology within mammalian mitochondria (Weber2013APOOL). Apolipoprotein O-like is categorized as a cardiolipin-binding protein, indicating its role in lipid interactions, particularly with cardiolipin, within the mitochondrial inner membrane (Weber2013APOOL). These interactions are essential for mitochondrial function, influencing processes such as mitochondrial respiration and the organization of the F1FO ATP synthase (Weber2013APOOL).

## Function


## Interactions
APOOL, a mitochondrial membrane protein, is a component of the Mitofilin/MINOS complex, which is crucial for determining cristae morphology in mammalian mitochondria. It physically interacts with several proteins within this complex, including Mitofilin, MINOS1, and SAMM50. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against Mitofilin and APOOL, which demonstrated that APOOL is an integral part of the Mitofilin/MINOS complex (Weber2013APOOL).

APOOL is also characterized as a cardiolipin-binding protein, suggesting its role in lipid interactions within the mitochondrial inner membrane. This binding is specific to cardiolipin, as shown by lipid binding assays, and does not extend to other lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (Weber2013APOOL). The interaction with cardiolipin implies a potential role in the biogenesis or transport of this lipid, which could influence mitochondrial ultrastructure and the organization of the F1FO ATP synthase (Weber2013APOOL).

The study also suggests that APOOL's interactions may affect mitochondrial respiration and cristae morphology, as both overexpression and downregulation of APOOL lead to significant changes in these areas (Weber2013APOOL).
