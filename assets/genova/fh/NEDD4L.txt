# NEDD4L

## Overview
NEDD4L is a gene that encodes the NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for the regulation of protein degradation, stabilization, and relocalization within cells. The NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase is characterized by its modular structure, including a C2 domain, multiple WW domains, and a HECT domain, which facilitate its interactions with various substrates and its catalytic activity (Escobedo2014Structural; Staub1996WW). Functionally, the protein is involved in the regulation of several ion channels and membrane proteins, such as the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC), impacting physiological processes like sodium balance, blood pressure regulation, and neuronal excitability (Goel2015NEDD42). Additionally, NEDD4L has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, where its expression and activity are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Wang2019Decreased; Broix2016Mutations).

## Structure
NEDD4L is a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases, characterized by a modular structure that includes a C2 domain, multiple WW domains, and a HECT domain. The C2 domain, located at the N-terminus, is involved in calcium-dependent lipid binding and plays a role in the protein's subcellular localization and function (Escobedo2014Structural; Garrone2009A). The WW domains are responsible for substrate recognition and mediate interactions with proline-rich PY motifs in target proteins (Escobedo2014Structural; Staub1996WW). The C-terminal HECT domain is crucial for ubiquitin transfer and is composed of N- and C-terminal lobes connected by a flexible hinge, allowing necessary conformational changes for its catalytic activity (Escobedo2014Structural).

NEDD4L can exist in different isoforms, which are generated by alternative splicing. These isoforms may contain or lack the C2 domain, affecting their subcellular targeting and function. The presence of the C2 domain allows NEDD4L to shuttle between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, impacting processes like sodium absorption (Garrone2009A). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Escobedo2014Structural).

## Function
NEDD4L, also known as NEDD4-2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in regulating various membrane proteins in healthy human cells. It is involved in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. NEDD4L regulates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is critical for sodium balance and blood pressure maintenance. By binding to PY motifs on ENaC, NEDD4L facilitates its ubiquitination and removal from the membrane, preventing excessive sodium reabsorption and hypertension (Goel2015NEDD42; Garrone2009A).

NEDD4L also regulates other ion channels, such as the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC) and voltage-gated sodium channels, impacting processes like blood pressure regulation and neuronal excitability (Goel2015NEDD42). It interacts with proteins involved in tight junction integrity, such as occludin, influencing cellular homeostasis (Goel2015NEDD42).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm and can translocate to the plasma membrane in response to calcium stimuli, affecting the mobilization of ENaC subunits (Garrone2009A). NEDD4L's activity is modulated by interactions with deubiquitinating enzymes and adaptor proteins, which influence its role in ubiquitinating and degrading target proteins (Goel2015NEDD42).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEDD4L gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), mutations in the HECT domain of NEDD4L disrupt neurodevelopmental processes, leading to neuronal migration abnormalities. These mutations are associated with a range of phenotypes, including bilateral syndactyly, cleft palate, and neurodevelopmental delay (Kato2017A; Broix2016Mutations). The mutations in NEDD4L are thought to cause deregulation of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for brain development (Broix2016Mutations).

In cardiovascular diseases, NEDD4L is linked to salt-sensitive hypertension and Liddle syndrome. In these conditions, NEDD4L's role in regulating epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) is disrupted, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and hypertension (Li2022Research).

In cancer, NEDD4L expression is often downregulated. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low NEDD4L levels are associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor progression. NEDD4L acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis (Li2022Downregulation; Wang2019Decreased). In multiple myeloma, low NEDD4L expression correlates with reduced sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and poorer patient outcomes (Huang2022NEDD4L).

## Interactions
NEDD4L, also known as NEDD4-2, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular regulation. It is known to interact with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it mediates ubiquitination and removal from the membrane, a process important for sodium balance and blood pressure regulation (Goel2015NEDD42). NEDD4L also interacts with the Na+-Cl- cotransporter (NCC), affecting sodium absorption in the kidney, and with voltage-gated sodium channels, impacting neuronal excitability (Goel2015NEDD42).

In the context of cancer, NEDD4L is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of PIK3CA, a component of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and survival. This interaction suggests a tumor suppressor role for NEDD4L, as its decreased expression is linked to increased PIK3CA levels and potential tumor growth (Wang2016NEDD4L).

NEDD4L also targets the DNA repair enzyme OGG1 for ubiquitylation, specifically on lysine 341, modulating its activity in the base excision repair pathway. This interaction is significant for maintaining genome stability and responding to oxidative stress (Hughes2020The).
