# RRM1

## Overview
The RRM1 gene encodes the ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1, a critical component of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme complex. This enzyme is essential for DNA synthesis and repair, as it catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. The RRM1 protein is categorized as an enzyme subunit and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of nucleotide pools within the cell. It forms a heterotetrameric complex with other subunits, such as RRM2 or p53R2, to ensure the proper supply of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) necessary for DNA replication and repair (Taricani2014A; Shintaku2022RRM1). The activity of RRM1 is tightly regulated through allosteric mechanisms and post-translational modifications, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cell viability (Fairman2011Structural; Jordheim2011The). Alterations in the RRM1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where they can affect chemotherapy response and patient prognosis (Cao2013RRM1; Kim2008Efficacy).

## Structure
The RRM1 (ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1) is a crucial component of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme, which plays a vital role in DNA synthesis. The primary structure of RRM1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Ahmad2013The).

The tertiary structure of RRM1 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its catalytic activity. This structure includes specific domains such as the ATP-cone domain, which is involved in binding nucleotides like ATP and dATP. These nucleotides regulate the enzyme's activity through allosteric effects, influencing the oligomerization state of the protein (Fairman2011Structural; Ahmad2013The).

In terms of quaternary structure, RRM1 forms part of an αnβn complex, where it interacts with other subunits to form functional oligomers. The enzyme can transition between different oligomeric states, such as dimers and hexamers, depending on the concentration of nucleotides like dATP, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor (Fairman2011Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of RRM1, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of RRM1 may exist, potentially altering its function or regulation, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The RRM1 gene encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis and repair in healthy human cells. RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, which are the building blocks necessary for DNA replication and repair (Taricani2014A). The RRM1 subunit contains the catalytic site and is involved in substrate binding and allosteric regulation, playing a significant role in maintaining nucleotide pool homeostasis (Jordheim2011The).

RRM1 forms a heterotetrameric complex with RRM2 or p53R2 subunits, which is crucial for the enzyme's function. RRM2 is upregulated during the S phase of the cell cycle to provide deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) for nuclear DNA replication, while p53R2 ensures basal dNTP synthesis outside of the S phase and in postmitotic cells (Shintaku2022RRM1). The RNR complex is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it produces deoxyribonucleotides that are then transported to the nucleus for DNA synthesis (Engström1984Localization; Pontarin2008Ribonucleotide).

Proper regulation of RNR activity is vital for maintaining genetic fidelity and cell viability, as imbalances can lead to genomic instability (Specks2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RRM1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), polymorphisms in the RRM1 promoter region, specifically at positions -37 and -524, have been associated with varying responses to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Patients with the RR37AC-RR524CT allelotype showed a higher response rate to gemcitabine, although overall survival did not significantly differ by allelotype (Kim2008Efficacy). In pancreatic cancer, overexpression of RRM1 is linked to resistance to gemcitabine, with higher RRM1 expression correlating with poorer treatment responses and shorter survival times (Nakahira2006Involvement).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), specific RRM1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs1042919 and rs1561876 are associated with lower intracellular levels of ara-CTP, poor event-free survival, and increased relapse risk (Cao2013RRM1). These genetic variations can influence mRNA expression and chemotherapy response, highlighting the potential of RRM1 as a predictive marker for treatment outcomes (Cao2013RRM1).

RRM1 mutations also play a role in mitochondrial DNA maintenance disorders (MDDS), where missense variants can impair nucleotide synthesis, leading to clinical manifestations such as muscle weakness and multiple mtDNA deletions (Shintaku2022RRM1).
