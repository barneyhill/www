# COX19

## Overview
COX19 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor COX19, a small, soluble protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The COX19 protein is characterized by its conserved twin Cx9C motifs and is primarily localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it participates in redox-regulated interactions essential for mitochondrial function and copper homeostasis (Leary2013COX19). COX19 is involved in the transduction of mitochondrial redox signals and interacts with other proteins, such as SCO1 and Cox11, to facilitate the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase and maintain the redox state of critical cysteine residues (Leary2013COX19; Bode2015Redoxregulated). Through these interactions, COX19 plays a significant role in cellular copper regulation and the proper functioning of the electron transport chain, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial and cellular health (Leary2013COX19).

## Structure
The COX19 protein is characterized by a conserved twin CX9C motif, which is crucial for its function in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This motif includes conserved tyrosine-leucine (YL) residues that form a hydrophobic cavity essential for the protein's function (Bode2015Redoxregulated). The structure of COX19 has been modeled onto the Mia40 structure, suggesting a dish-like hydrophobic cavity similar to the substrate-binding pocket of Mia40 (Bode2015Redoxregulated). 

COX19 undergoes oxidative folding, involving the formation of disulfide bonds between its cysteine residues. The protein contains two disulfide bonds in its native state, which are important for its stability and function (Fraga2014The). The oxidative folding pathway of COX19 is facilitated by the mitochondrial intermembrane space oxidoreductase Mia40, which accelerates the formation of specific disulfide bonds (Fraga2014The). 

The secondary structure of COX19 includes two structured helices, with the rest of the protein being largely disordered (Fraga2014The). The presence of these helices is confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which shows a helical spectrum as the protein folds (Fraga2014The). The protein's folding involves transient non-native intermediates that are converted into native forms through catalysis by glutathione and protein-disulfide isomerase (Fraga2014The).

## Function
The COX19 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX19 is involved in the transduction of a mitochondrial redox signal from SCO1, which is essential for regulating ATP7A-mediated cellular copper efflux, thereby maintaining copper homeostasis in cells (Leary2013COX19). The protein is part of a family of small, soluble COX assembly factors that localize predominantly to the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria and contain conserved twin Cx9C motifs (Leary2013COX19).

COX19 interacts with other proteins, such as SCO1 and SCO2, to mediate the redox state of the SCO1 CxxxC motif, which is crucial for COX assembly and copper regulation (Leary2013COX19). It also interacts with Cox11, a copper-binding protein, to maintain the redox state of cysteine residues in Cox11, facilitating the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (Bode2015Redoxregulated). COX19's ability to partition between mitochondria and the cytosol in a copper-dependent manner underscores its involvement in copper-related processes and its essential role in maintaining copper homeostasis and proper mitochondrial function in healthy human cells (Leary2013COX19).

## Interactions
COX19 is known to interact with the protein Cox11 in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. This interaction is crucial for the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase, a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The interaction between COX19 and Cox11 is redox-regulated, with the binding being enhanced by oxidized glutathione and inhibited by reduced glutathione, indicating that the redox state of cysteine residues in Cox11 is critical for this interaction (Bode2015Redoxregulated).

COX19 has a hydrophobic cavity formed by twin Cx9C motifs, which is essential for its binding to Cox11. Mutations in this region, such as the Cox19 EE mutant, disrupt the interaction, highlighting the importance of the hydrophobic cavity for binding (Bode2015Redoxregulated). The interaction is not stable, as indicated by size exclusion chromatography experiments showing that COX19 and Cox11 do not form a stable complex in the IMS (Bode2015Redoxregulated).

COX19 also interacts with the mitochondrial intermembrane space oxireductase Mia40, which catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in COX19, crucial for its oxidative folding and function (Fraga2014The). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase.
