# P2RY8

## Overview
P2RY8 is a gene that encodes a member of the P2Y receptor family, specifically the P2Y receptor family member 8, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of B cell positioning within lymphoid tissues, particularly in germinal centers, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the confinement of B cells within follicles. The P2Y receptor family member 8 interacts with its ligand, S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione, to inhibit chemokine-mediated migration, thereby promoting the retention of B cells and follicular helper T cells within germinal centers (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione). The receptor's function is mediated through a Gα13-dependent mechanism, and it is down-regulated in memory B cells and plasma cells to facilitate their exit from germinal centers (Muppidi2015The; Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione). P2RY8 is conserved in vertebrates but absent in rodents, indicating a unique role in human immune function (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione). Additionally, mutations and alterations in P2RY8 have been implicated in various hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer progression (Vesely2016Genomic; Fang2022Recurrent).

## Function
The P2RY8 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of B cell positioning within lymphoid tissues, particularly in germinal centers (GCs). This receptor is involved in maintaining the confinement of B cells within the follicles, which are essential sites for antibody diversification and affinity maturation. The ligand for P2RY8, S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (Ggg), inhibits chemokine-mediated migration of human GC B cells and follicular helper T cells, thereby promoting their retention within the germinal centers (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione).

P2RY8 functions through a Gα13-dependent mechanism to inhibit cell migration, ensuring that B cells remain associated with the germinal centers. This process is facilitated by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which express gamma-glutamyltransferase-5 (Ggt5) that metabolizes Ggg, affecting its distribution and the positioning of P2RY8-expressing cells (Muppidi2015The; Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione). The receptor is down-regulated in memory B cells and plasma cells, aiding their exit from the germinal centers (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione). P2RY8 is conserved in vertebrates but absent in rodents, suggesting a unique role in human immune function (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RY8 gene have been implicated in various hematological malignancies, particularly B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In P2RY8-CRLF2-positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion is a significant genomic alteration. This fusion is often associated with mutations in the JAK/STAT and RTK/Ras pathways, which are common at diagnosis and increase at relapse, contributing to the clonal evolution and relapse of the disease (Vesely2016Genomic). The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion is considered a secondary event, often resulting from illegitimate V(D)J-mediated recombination in B precursor cells (Vesely2016Genomic).

In B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, recurrent novel P2RY8/IGH translocations have been identified, leading to the overexpression of P2RY8. This overexpression is associated with aggressive clinical courses and poor prognosis, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis or disease progression (Fang2022Recurrent). The P2RY8::CRLF2 fusion, particularly in the context of increased HMGN1 expression, is linked to increased proliferation and activation of signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, which are critical for leukemic survival (Page2023Gain). These findings highlight the clinical significance of P2RY8 alterations in the pathogenesis and progression of leukemia.

## Interactions
P2RY8, a member of the P2Y receptor family, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular responses. It acts as a receptor for S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (Ggg), a ligand that inhibits the migration of P2RY8-positive cells towards chemokines such as CXCL12 and CXCL13. This interaction is significant in the context of B cell confinement within germinal centers, as Ggg promotes the internalization of P2RY8, thereby affecting cell positioning and signaling pathways (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione).

P2RY8 is coupled with the G protein Gα13, which plays a crucial role in the clustering of activated B cells within follicles. This interaction is dependent on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which help maintain the confinement of B cells in the germinal centers (Muppidi2015The). The receptor's role in signaling pathways is further highlighted by its involvement in the regulation of Akt phosphorylation, a key signaling event in B cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma lines (Lu2019S-Geranylgeranyl-l-glutathione).

Mutations in P2RY8, along with GNA13 and ARHGEF1, are frequently observed in lymphomas derived from germinal center B cells, indicating its broader relevance in cancer progression (Muppidi2015The).
