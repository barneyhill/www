# INHBC

## Overview
The INHBC gene encodes the inhibin subunit beta C, a component of the inhibin and activin protein complexes, which belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. These protein complexes are pivotal in regulating a variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and hormone secretion. The inhibin subunit beta C is particularly significant in the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) homeostasis, which is essential for reproductive function (Barakat2012Activins). The protein can form both homodimers and heterodimers with other beta subunits, such as beta A and beta B, to create functional activin complexes that engage in signaling pathways influencing cell growth and differentiation (Antsiferova2012The). Notably, the INHBC gene is highly expressed in the liver, suggesting a specialized role in hepatic physiology, although the specific functions in this context remain to be fully elucidated (Frost2011Inhibinactivin).

## Structure


## Function
The INHBC gene encodes the inhibin beta C subunit, which is part of the inhibin and activin protein complexes within the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. These complexes play significant roles in regulating various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and hormone secretion. Inhibins and activins are particularly involved in the regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) homeostasis, which is crucial for reproductive function (Barakat2012Activins).

In healthy human cells, the INHBC subunit can form homodimers or heterodimers with other beta subunits, such as beta A and beta B, to create functional activin complexes. These complexes are involved in signaling pathways that influence cell growth and differentiation by binding to activin receptors, which then activate SMAD proteins to regulate gene transcription (Antsiferova2012The). The activin beta C protein is also noted for its presence in the nucleus of certain testicular cells, although the significance of this localization is not fully understood (Barakat2012Activins).

In the liver, INHBC is highly expressed, suggesting a role in liver physiology, although its specific functions in healthy liver cells are not well-documented (Frost2011Inhibinactivin). The expression of INHBC in the liver is significantly higher compared to other organs, indicating its potential importance in hepatic processes (Frost2011Inhibinactivin).
