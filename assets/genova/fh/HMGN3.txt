# HMGN3

## Overview
HMGN3 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 protein, a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) family. This protein is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression, playing a crucial role in transcriptional modulation. HMGN3 exists in two splice variants, HMGN3a and HMGN3b, with HMGN3a being the full-length variant that includes a chromatin-unfolding domain, which is absent in HMGN3b (West2001HMGN3a). The protein is known for its ability to bind specifically to nucleosome core particles, influencing histone acetylation and enhancing transcriptional activity, particularly in tissues such as the eye and brain (Barkess2012The; West2004Chromosomal). HMGN3 is implicated in various physiological processes, including glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells and neurotransmission in the central nervous system, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and neural functions (West2004Chromosomal; Ueda2009The).

## Structure
The HMGN3 protein is a member of the high mobility group nucleosome-binding (HMGN) family and exists in two splice variants: HMGN3a and HMGN3b. HMGN3a is the full-length variant, while HMGN3b is truncated at the C-terminal end due to a frameshift caused by an additional splice site (West2001HMGN3a). Both variants contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a nucleosome-binding domain, which are highly conserved across the HMGN family (West2001HMGN3a). HMGN3a includes a chromatin-unfolding domain with a net negative charge of -8, which is responsible for chromatin unfolding and transcriptional activation. This domain is less conserved compared to other HMGN proteins and is absent in HMGN3b (West2001HMGN3a).

HMGN3 proteins are known to bind specifically to nucleosome core particles, influencing chromatin structure and function. HMGN3a can stimulate histone acetylation, particularly at histone H3 lysine 14 (H3K14), enhancing transcriptional activity, while HMGN3b lacks this capability due to the absence of the regulatory domain (Barkess2012The). The protein is highly expressed in tissues such as the eye and brain, indicating its role in tissue-specific gene expression (West2004Chromosomal).

## Function
HMGN3 is a chromatin-binding protein that plays a significant role in modulating transcription by altering chromatin structure and enhancing transcriptional accessibility. It binds specifically to nucleosomes, promoting chromatin unfolding, which facilitates the binding of transcription factors to DNA and enhances gene expression (West2004Chromosomal; West2001HMGN3a). HMGN3 is particularly involved in the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in pancreatic β cells. It enhances the expression of the glucose transporter gene Glut2 by facilitating the recruitment of transcription factors to its promoter region, which is crucial for proper insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis (Ueda2009The; Nanduri2020Biological).

In addition to its role in pancreatic cells, HMGN3 is expressed in the central nervous system, where it regulates the expression of the glycine transporter 1 (Glyt1) gene. This regulation is important for neurotransmission, as Glyt1 controls glycine concentration in synaptic junctions (West2004Chromosomal). HMGN3's ability to stimulate histone acetylation, particularly H3K14 acetylation, further underscores its role in transcriptional activation by modifying chromatin structure (Barkess2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMGN3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic β cells, HMGN3 is crucial for proper insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Loss of HMGN3 expression leads to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and a diabetic phenotype in mice, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Ueda2009The). HMGN3 enhances the transcription of the Glut2 gene, which is essential for glucose uptake and insulin secretion, and its deficiency results in decreased Glut2 levels, contributing to diabetes (Ueda2009The; Nanduri2020Biological).

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cancer of the bile duct, HMGN3 is overexpressed and correlates with tumor invasion and progression. This overexpression is not observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker for distinguishing between these liver cancers. The expression of HMGN3 in CCA is also associated with the inflammatory cytokine TGF-β, suggesting a role in CCA development (Sorin2022Overexpression).

Additionally, a genome-wide association study identified the HMGN3 locus as being associated with spine bone size variation, indicating a potential role in bone health and the risk of osteoporotic fractures (Lei2011Genomewide).

## Interactions
HMGN3 interacts with nucleosomes and influences chromatin structure and gene expression. It binds to nucleosome core particles, as demonstrated by gel retardation assays, and affects histone modifications, particularly enhancing H3K14 acetylation, which is associated with active transcription (Barkess2012The). HMGN3's interaction with chromatin is crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation, as it facilitates the recruitment of transcription factors to specific gene promoters. For instance, HMGN3 enhances the binding of transcription factors such as PDX1 to the Glut2 promoter in pancreatic β cells, which is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Ueda2009The).

HMGN3 also interacts with histones, as shown by its significant interaction scores with HIST1H4A and HIST1H2AG, identified through protein-protein interaction network analysis (RodríguezOrtiz2021Spatial). These interactions suggest that HMGN3 plays a role in chromatin-related processes crucial for epigenetic regulation. The protein does not significantly alter chromatin structure but affects histone modification levels, indicating its role in modulating transcription through histone acetylation (Barkess2012The; Ueda2009The).
