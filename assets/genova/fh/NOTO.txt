# NOTO

## Overview
The NOTO gene encodes the notochord homeobox protein, a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the formation of the notochord. This protein is integral to the differentiation of mesendoderm progenitors into notochordal cells, which are precursors to the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc (Colombier2020NOTO). The notochord homeobox protein is involved in the regulation of key developmental pathways, including the stabilization of transcription complexes with FOXA2 and T, and the activation of notochordal markers such as Brachyury and SHH (Colombier2020NOTO; Diaz‐Hernandez2019Derivation). In addition to its role in notochord formation, NOTO is essential for proper ciliogenesis and the establishment of left-right asymmetry during embryogenesis, with mutations in the gene leading to significant developmental defects (Stauber2017Identification; Beckers2007The).

## Function
The NOTO gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in directing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesendoderm progenitors towards a notochordal fate. This process is crucial for the formation of the notochord, a transient embryonic structure essential for the development of the intervertebral disc, particularly the nucleus pulposus, which is vital for disc homeostasis (Colombier2020NOTO). NOTO functions by upregulating notochord-associated markers and stabilizing transcription complexes involving FOXA2 and T, which are critical for notochord formation (Colombier2020NOTO). 

In the context of human embryonic stem cells, NOTO is involved in the differentiation of notochordal cells, which are precursors to nucleus pulposus cells. This differentiation process includes the repression of pluripotency genes and the activation of notochordal markers such as Brachyury, FOXA2, and SHH (Diaz‐Hernandez2019Derivation). The NOTO gene is part of a complex regulatory network necessary for notochordal differentiation, and its expression is specific to notochordal cells, making it a critical component in identifying and characterizing these cells (Diaz‐Hernandez2019Derivation). NOTO's role in maintaining notochordal identity is also supported by its function in mouse models, where it is essential for node morphogenesis and ciliogenesis (Beckers2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NOTO gene can lead to significant developmental defects, particularly affecting the formation and function of cilia, which are essential for establishing left-right asymmetry in embryonic development. In mouse models, NOTO deficiency results in severe down-regulation of FOXJ1 target genes, leading to defects in nodal cilia similar to those observed in Foxj1 null mice. This results in shortened and immotile cilia, which are crucial for proper left-right patterning (Stauber2017Identification; Beckers2007The). 

Homozygous mutations in NOTO can cause defects in the caudal notochord and lead to laterality defects in visceral organs, such as heterotaxia, isomerism of the lung, and situs inversus, which are associated with high postnatal mortality (Beckers2007The). These mutations also result in abnormal cilia structure, with defects in the number and arrangement of microtubular doublets and missing dynein arms, leading to immotile cilia (Beckers2007The). 

The absence of NOTO affects the nascent notochord during development, leading to reduced expression of several cilia-associated genes. However, the expression of these genes can be restored by FOXJ1, indicating that FOXJ1 can compensate for the absence of NOTO in driving the expression of cilia-associated genes (Alten2012Differential).
