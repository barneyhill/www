# CARD16

## Overview
CARD16, also known as caspase recruitment domain family member 16, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its role in inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation. The protein, also referred to as COP/Pseudo-ICE, is characterized by its caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitates homotypic protein-protein interactions crucial for modulating inflammasome activation and NF-kB signaling (Matusiak2015CARD‐; Kao2014The). CARD16 acts as both an inhibitor and activator of cytokine maturation, depending on its interaction with caspase-1 and other proteins such as RIPK2 and ASC (Le2013Pyrin; Devi2020An). By functioning as a non-enzymatic decoy, CARD16 regulates caspase-1 activity, thereby influencing inflammatory responses and immune regulation (Le2013Pyrin).

## Structure
CARD16, also known as COP/Pseudo-ICE, is a protein primarily composed of a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), which is part of the death domain superfamily. This superfamily is characterized by a conserved secondary structure consisting of six or seven antiparallel alpha-helices, forming a six-helical bundle structure typical of CARD domains (Matusiak2015CARD‐; Kao2014The). CARD16 is a relatively short protein, approximately 100 amino acids in length, and shares a high sequence homology with caspase-1, with a protein sequence identity of 92% (Matusiak2015CARD‐).

The CARD domain in CARD16 facilitates homotypic protein-protein interactions, allowing it to self-associate and interact with other proteins such as caspase-1 and RIPK2. These interactions are crucial for modulating inflammasome activation and NF-kB signaling (Matusiak2015CARD‐). CARD16 contains specific amino acid residues, Asp27 and Arg45, which are important for stimulating NF-kB activation through interactions with RIPK2 and the inflammasome adapter ASC (Matusiak2015CARD‐). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a significant role in immune regulation by acting as a dominant negative regulator of caspase-1 activity (Kao2014The).

## Function
CARD16, also known as caspase recruitment domain family member 16, encodes a protein involved in the regulation of inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine maturation. The protein contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and is capable of self-oligomerizing, forming filament-like structures similar to those of caspase-1. CARD16 shares 97% amino acid sequence similarity with caspase-1 and can bind to its CARD, as well as to the CARD of ASC, co-localizing in perinuclear ASC-specks (Devi2020An).

CARD16 functions as both an inhibitor and an activator of IL-1β maturation and secretion, depending on its ability to bind, aggregate, and activate caspase-1. The non-filament forming mutants of CARD16 are less effective in inducing IL-1β secretion compared to the wildtype, indicating the importance of its structural conformation in its function (Devi2020An). CARD16 also plays a role in activating NF-κB signaling, as demonstrated in overexpression studies in HEK293 cells (Devi2020An).

In addition to its role in inflammasome regulation, CARD16 acts as a non-enzymatic decoy regulating caspase-1 activity by binding to caspase-1 and RIP-2, inhibiting RIP-2-mediated oligomerization of caspase-1, and blocking the activation of caspase-1 and the subsequent release of mature IL-1β (Le2013Pyrin).

## Interactions
CARD16, also known as COP/Pseudo-ICE, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins through its caspase recruitment domain (CARD). It shares high sequence identity with the CARD of caspase-1 and can bind to caspase-1 and RIP2, inhibiting RIP2-mediated oligomerization of caspase-1 and blocking the activation of caspase-1, which in turn prevents the release of mature IL-1β (Le2013Pyrin; Lee2001COP). CARD16 is capable of self-oligomerization, forming filament-like structures similar to those of caspase-1, and can bind to the CARD of ASC, co-localizing in perinuclear ASC-specks, suggesting a role in inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation (Devi2020An).

CARD16 also interacts with the IKK complex, enhancing TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Le2013Pyrin). It can self-associate and co-immunoprecipitate with both caspase-1 and RIPK2, reducing RIPK2 binding to caspase-1 and inhibiting RIPK2-mediated caspase-1 activation (Matusiak2015CARD‐). These interactions suggest that CARD16 acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of caspase-1 activation, modulating inflammatory responses (Matusiak2015CARD‐).
