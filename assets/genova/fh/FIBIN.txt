# FIBIN

## Overview
The FIBIN gene encodes the fin bud initiation factor homolog, a secretory protein primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its aggregation tendency. This protein is characterized by its unique primary structure, lacking amino acid homology with known proteins, which underscores its evolutionary distinctiveness (Lakner2011Characterization). FIBIN is involved in forming multimeric complexes through disulfide bonds and is implicated in various cellular interactions, particularly within cardiomyocytes, where it co-localizes with α-actinin at the sarcomeric z-disc (Petersen2023Fibin). Functionally, FIBIN acts as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by modulating SRF- and NFAT-dependent signaling pathways (Petersen2023Fibin). Despite its anti-hypertrophic effects, overexpression of FIBIN is associated with protein-aggregate-associated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its complex role in cardiac health and disease (Petersen2023Fibin).

## Structure
The FIBIN protein, encoded by the FIBIN gene, is characterized by its unique primary structure, with no amino acid homology to known proteins, indicating its evolutionary uniqueness (Lakner2011Characterization). The protein includes a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, which guides it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is retained due to its aggregation tendency (Lakner2011Characterization). 

FIBIN undergoes posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation at Asn 30, which is a conserved site (Lakner2011Characterization). The protein contains two conserved cysteine residues, Cys 52 and Cys 64, which form intermolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its dimeric and multimeric forms (Lakner2011Characterization). Under non-reducing conditions, FIBIN appears in both monomeric (26 kDa) and homodimeric (56 kDa) forms, with the dimeric form disappearing under reducing conditions (Lakner2011Characterization).

Despite being a secretory protein, FIBIN is mostly retained in the ER, suggesting it may require escort proteins or form heteromers with unknown partners for proper secretion (Lakner2011Characterization). The protein's quaternary structure involves non-covalent associations, as indicated by its presence in high molecular weight fractions during size exclusion chromatography (Lakner2011Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The FIBIN gene, also known as the fin bud initiation factor homolog, is implicated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. Alterations in FIBIN expression have been associated with cardiac conditions, particularly protein-aggregate-associated cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of FIBIN in transgenic mice has been shown to lead to the formation of protein aggregates in heart tissue, which are linked to the induction of the unfolded protein response, apoptosis, autophagy, and cardiac fibrosis (Petersen2023Fibin). These aggregates are associated with severe cardiac dysfunction, including reduced ejection fraction and fractional shortening, despite FIBIN's anti-hypertrophic effects (Petersen2023Fibin).

FIBIN is upregulated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy, suggesting its clinical relevance in these conditions (Petersen2023Fibin). While FIBIN acts as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, its overexpression in vivo can lead to heart failure and protein-aggregate-associated cardiomyopathy, drawing parallels to myofibrillar myopathies (Petersen2023Fibin). These findings highlight the complex role of FIBIN in cardiac health and disease, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiomyopathy.

## Interactions
The FIBIN protein, also known as fin bud initiation factor homolog, is involved in various interactions within the cell. It is known to form multimeric complexes, likely through disulfide bonds, when localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Lakner2011Characterization). Despite being a secretory protein, FIBIN does not show substantial secretion in COS-7 cells, possibly due to its aggregation tendency or the absence of necessary escort proteins (Lakner2011Characterization). Yeast two-hybrid experiments have suggested interactions with chaperones and exocyst complex component 3, although no specific protein partners were confirmed (Lakner2011Characterization).

In cardiomyocytes, FIBIN co-localizes with α-actinin at the sarcomeric z-disc, indicating a role in cardiac muscle structure and function (Petersen2023Fibin). It is involved in modulating gene expression by inhibiting SRF- and NFAT-dependent signaling pathways, which are crucial in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (Petersen2023Fibin). FIBIN overexpression leads to the downregulation of Tbx5, a transcription factor involved in SRF-dependent gene expression, and reduces NFAT-reporter activity even in the presence of active calcineurin (Petersen2023Fibin). These interactions suggest that FIBIN acts as a negative regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by affecting these signaling pathways (Petersen2023Fibin).
