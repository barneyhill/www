# TUSC3

## Overview
TUSC3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in magnesium uptake and homeostasis, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as ATP function and enzymatic activities. The protein encoded by TUSC3 is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the glycosylation of nascent proteins, a process essential for proper protein folding and stability. TUSC3 is expressed in various human tissues, including the ovary, placenta, and lung, and is crucial for vertebrate embryonic development. Its interactions with other proteins, such as STT3A and HRD1, underscore its involvement in cancer pathogenesis and the unfolded protein response. Alterations in TUSC3 expression are associated with several cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Zhou2009Mammalian; VAŇHARA2013Loss; Jeon2018miRNAmediated).

## Function
TUSC3 (tumor suppressor candidate 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in magnesium (Mg2+) uptake and homeostasis in human cells. TUSC3, along with MagT1, is essential for Mg2+ influx, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including ATP function and enzymatic activities. The expression of TUSC3 is upregulated in response to low extracellular Mg2+ levels, and its knockdown leads to significantly reduced intracellular Mg2+ concentrations, highlighting its role in maintaining Mg2+ homeostasis (Zhou2009Mammalian).

TUSC3 is expressed in multiple human tissues, such as the ovary, placenta, prostate, testis, adipose tissue, and lung. It shares 66% identity in amino acid sequences with MagT1 and has a similar predicted secondary structure, indicating a cooperative function in Mg2+ transport (Zhou2009Mammalian). The protein is part of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in transferring oligosaccharides to nascent proteins, a process critical for proper protein folding and stability.

In vertebrate embryonic development, TUSC3 is crucial, as its knockdown results in developmental arrest, which can be rescued by excess Mg2+ or supplementation with mammalian mRNAs (Zhou2009Mammalian). This underscores its importance in cellular health and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TUSC3 gene are implicated in various cancers and other conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TUSC3 is overexpressed in a significant portion of tumors, correlating with aggressive cancer characteristics and poorer patient survival outcomes (Ren2020TUSC3). In contrast, TUSC3 acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate and ovarian cancers, where its downregulation is linked to increased cancer cell proliferation and migration (Sheng2018Low; VAŇHARA2013Loss). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low TUSC3 expression is associated with adverse clinical features and poor prognosis, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Sheng2018Low).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TUSC3 deficiency, often due to miRNA-mediated downregulation, enhances metastatic potential by affecting the unfolded protein response and ER-associated degradation pathways (Jeon2018miRNAmediated). TUSC3 is also linked to non-syndromic autosomal recessive mental retardation, with specific mutations identified in affected families (Garshasbi2011A). These findings highlight the complex and context-dependent role of TUSC3 in cancer progression and other diseases.

## Interactions
TUSC3 is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence its role in cancer pathogenesis. It is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex and interacts with STT3A, a core catalytic protein of the OST complex, in ovarian cancer cells. This interaction is crucial for the glycosylation processes that TUSC3 facilitates (VAŇHARA2013Loss). TUSC3 also interacts with HRD1, a protein involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This interaction is important for regulating the degradation of proteins such as PERK and IRE1α, which are part of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway (Jeon2018miRNAmediated).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TUSC3 deficiency enhances HRD1-dependent ERAD activity, affecting the stability of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction suggests that TUSC3 modulates the affinity of HRD1 for its substrates, influencing p53 ubiquitination and stability (Jeon2018miRNAmediated). TUSC3 also interacts with the SMO protein in colorectal cancer, which is part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This interaction is linked to increased cellular stemness and drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells (Ren2020TUSC3). These interactions highlight TUSC3's role in modulating various cellular pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression.
