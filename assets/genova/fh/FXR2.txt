# FXR2

## Overview
The FXR2 gene encodes the FMR1 autosomal homolog 2 protein, a member of the fragile X-related protein family, which also includes FMR1 and FXR1. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein, characterized by the presence of KH domains, an RGG box, and tandem Tudor domains, which are crucial for its role in RNA metabolism and translation regulation (AdamsCioaba2010Structural; TAMANINI1999Oligomerization). FXR2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes, particularly the 60S subunits, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of protein synthesis, especially in neuronal cells (Siomi1996Specific). The protein plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes by modulating the translation of specific mRNAs, such as PSD95, in response to synaptic activity (Majumder2020Fragile). Although no hereditary diseases have been directly linked to FXR2 mutations, its interactions with proteins implicated in neurological disorders, such as ALS, underscore its potential clinical significance (Mueller2023The).

## Structure
The FXR2 protein is characterized by a tandem Tudor domain structure, which is a significant feature of its molecular architecture. The crystal structure of FXR2, specifically residues 13 to 136, was determined at a resolution of 1.92 Å, revealing a conserved architecture similar to that of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (AdamsCioaba2010Structural). The N-terminal Tudor domain (Tud1) spans residues 13 to 56 and forms a canonical Tudor barrel composed of five highly twisted antiparallel β-strands with a single 3_10 helix between strands β4 and β5 (AdamsCioaba2010Structural). The C-terminal Tudor domain (Tud2) also shows structural homology with other proteins, including the SMN protein and the HIV-1 integrase binding domain (AdamsCioaba2010Structural).

FXR2 contains KH domains and an RGG box, which are characteristic of RNA-binding proteins (TAMANINI1999Oligomerization). The protein can form homo-multimers and hetero-multimers with other family members, such as FXR1P and FMRP, contributing to its quaternary structure (TAMANINI1999Oligomerization). The coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region is important for oligomerization (TAMANINI1999Oligomerization). FXR2 is associated with ribosomes, particularly the 60S ribosomal subunits, indicating a potential role in translation regulation (Siomi1996Specific).

## Function
The FXR2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the fragile X-related protein family, which includes FMR1 and FXR1. These proteins are involved in RNA binding and regulation of mRNA stability, transportation, and translation, playing a crucial role in neuronal function and development (Fan2017FXR1; Majumder2020Fragile). FXR2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with ribosomes, particularly the 60S large ribosomal subunits, suggesting a role in translation regulation (Tamanini1997Differential; Siomi1996Specific).

FXR2 is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly in neuronal cells, by forming a ribonucleoprotein complex with mRNA, which is then transported to dendrites and spines for local translation in response to stimuli (AdamsCioaba2010Structural). The protein contains tandem Tudor domains that recognize trimethylated peptides, indicating a role in recognizing specific histone modifications, which could be important for chromatin organization and gene regulation (AdamsCioaba2010Structural).

In healthy human cells, FXR2 acts as a translational activator of the postsynaptic density protein PSD95, and its absence leads to reduced PSD95 mRNA translation in the hippocampus, affecting synaptic activity (Majumder2020Fragile). This function highlights its importance in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes.

## Clinical Significance
The FXR2 gene has been implicated in several neurological conditions, although no hereditary diseases have been directly linked to mutations in FXR2. Research suggests that FXR2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). FXR2 is involved in RNA editing processes in the central nervous system, interacting with ALS-related proteins such as TDP-43, FUS, and Ataxin-2. These interactions suggest a potential contribution to ALS pathogenesis, particularly in relation to RNA metabolism and protein aggregation, which are hallmarks of the disease (Mueller2023The).

In studies using Fxr2 knockout mice, the absence of FXR2 protein has been associated with behavioral abnormalities, including hyperactivity, impaired motor coordination, and deficits in learning and memory. These findings suggest that FXR2 may be involved in central nervous system functions that regulate behavior, and its absence could potentially lead to an autosomal recessive form of mental retardation in humans, although this has not been confirmed (Bontekoe2002Knockout).

Overall, while FXR2 is not directly linked to specific hereditary diseases, its involvement in neurological processes and potential compensatory roles in the absence of FMRP highlight its clinical significance.

## Interactions
FXR2, a protein homologous to FMR1, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms complexes with FMR1 and FXR1, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating strong interactions that are resistant to high salt concentrations (Zhang1995The). FXR2 can bind RNA homopolymers in vitro, suggesting a role in RNA binding and regulation (Zhang1995The). The protein is capable of self-association and can also associate with FXR1, which may influence the function of FMR1 by modulating its interaction with RNA targets (Zhang1995The).

FXR2 interacts with FMR1 through specific protein domains, as shown by in vitro binding assays using GST fusion proteins. The interaction is specific, with the highest affinity observed between FMR1 and FXR2 compared to other combinations of these proteins (Zhang1995The). FXR2 is also associated with ribosomal subunits, particularly the 60S large ribosomal subunits, suggesting a potential role in translation regulation (Siomi1996Specific). The protein's tandem Tudor domains recognize trimethylated histone peptides, indicating a specific interaction with post-translationally modified proteins (AdamsCioaba2010Structural). These interactions highlight FXR2's involvement in complex regulatory networks within the cell.
