# SLC14A2

## Overview
The SLC14A2 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 14 member 2, commonly referred to as the urea transporter UT-A. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family and is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which facilitate the passive transport of urea across cell membranes. The UT-A transporters, including isoforms such as UT-A1, UT-A2, and UT-A3, play a critical role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine by reabsorbing urea in the renal medulla, thereby contributing to the regulation of water balance and osmotic pressure in the body (Shayakul2004The; Shayakul2013The). The expression and function of these transporters are influenced by factors such as dietary protein intake and hormonal regulation, particularly by vasopressin (Shayakul2004The). Variations in the SLC14A2 gene have been associated with clinical conditions affecting blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Ran2014Clinical; Shayakul2013The).

## Structure
The SLC14A2 gene encodes the urea transporter UT-A, which is involved in the transport of urea across cell membranes. The protein structure of UT-A includes multiple transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of solute carrier proteins. Specifically, the UT-A family members, such as UT-A1 and UT-A6, have been characterized with distinct structural features. UT-A1 is a large protein with 920 amino acids and contains several phosphorylation sites, including those for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, and protein kinase C, which are important for its regulation and function (Bagnasco2001Cloning). 

UT-A6, a smaller isoform, consists of 235 amino acids and features a single hydrophobic core flanked by hydrophilic NH2 and COOH-terminal domains. It includes a unique 19-residue hydrophilic region introduced by alternative splicing, which results in a stop codon (Smith2004Characterization). The UT-A proteins are organized into two internal hydrophobic repeats, each with 10 transmembrane spanning domains, contributing to their structural homology and functional properties (Shayakul2013The). These structural elements facilitate the passive movement of urea, crucial for physiological processes such as the urinary concentrating mechanism in the kidney (Shayakul2013The).

## Function
The SLC14A2 gene encodes several isoforms of urea transporters, specifically UT-A1, UT-A2, and UT-A3, which are crucial for the facilitated transport of urea across cell membranes. This transport is essential for urinary concentration and maintaining urea equilibrium in non-renal tissues (Shayakul2004The). In the kidney, UT-A1 is located in the apical membrane of inner medullary collecting duct cells and is regulated by vasopressin through cAMP-mediated phosphorylation, which is vital for the acute response to antidiuretic hormone, affecting urea reabsorption (Shayakul2004The). UT-A2 is expressed in the descending thin limb of the loops of Henle and is also up-regulated by vasopressin (Shayakul2004The).

The SLC14A2 gene plays a significant role in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine by facilitating urea reabsorption in the renal medulla, contributing to the body's water balance and osmotic pressure regulation (Shayakul2013The). The transporters encoded by SLC14A2 are characterized by a unique structure with hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains and glycosylated extracellular loops, which are essential for their function and membrane localization (Shayakul2004The). The gene's expression and the function of its encoded transporters are influenced by dietary protein content and are independently regulated (Shayakul2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the SLC14A2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly affecting blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. Specific polymorphisms, such as Val227Ile and Ala357Thr, are associated with blood pressure variations, especially in Asian males, potentially due to decreased UT-A activity affecting urea and water reabsorption (Ran2014Clinical; Shayakul2013The). These polymorphisms have also been linked to the blood pressure response to the antihypertensive drug nifedipine GITS (Shayakul2013The).

The G465C variation in SLC14A2 is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, although its role in regulating albumin and contributing to metabolic syndrome is also suggested (Ran2014Clinical). Despite these associations, major dysfunctions of urea transport have not been widely reported in human diseases, although decreased UT-A expression and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) urea permeability have been observed in conditions with impaired urinary concentration or elevated plasma urea (Shayakul2013The).

In mouse models, the deletion of SLC14A2, along with other urea transporters, results in impaired urine concentration, increased urine output, and lower blood pressure, suggesting potential targets for diuretic drugs (Jiang2017Generation).
