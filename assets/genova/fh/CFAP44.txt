# CFAP44

## Overview
The CFAP44 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 44, which is integral to the function and structure of cilia and flagella. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its role in RNA binding and localization to cilia, respectively (Urbanska2018Ciliary; Drew2020A). CFAP44 is involved in the assembly of the inner dynein arm and tether/tether head complex in flagella, interacting with other proteins such as FAP43 and IDA f/I1 dynein motor domains (Beneke2019LAX28). It plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal organization, particularly in neuronal and gonadal tissues (Tanaka2017A). Mutations in CFAP44 are linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition associated with male infertility (Wu2019NovelCFAP43).

## Structure
The CFAP44 protein is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeat domains and coiled-coil domains. The WD40 domains are located between amino acids 400 and 1600 and are suggested to be involved in RNA binding, as indicated by homology modeling that shows strong similarity to the RNA-associated protein Gemin5 (Drew2020A). These domains are modeled from the Gemin5 crystal structure, highlighting conserved residues near the predicted RNA binding pocket (Drew2020A). The C-terminal region of CFAP44 contains coiled-coil domains, which are necessary and sufficient for its localization to cilia (Urbanska2018Ciliary). 

CFAP44 is part of a complex with FAP43 and FAP57p, and its localization to cilia is dependent on the presence of FAP43 (Urbanska2018Ciliary). The protein is involved in the assembly of the inner dynein arm l1 and tether/tether head complex in flagella, interacting with FAP43 and IDA f/I1 dynein motor domains (Beneke2019LAX28). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in ciliary and flagellar function, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CFAP44 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell movement and fluid flow across cell surfaces. CFAP44 is involved in the regulation of cellular trafficking and morphology by cleaving proteins such as β-tubulin, which may inhibit microtubule formation and impact microtubule dynamics (Tanaka2017A). This protein is predominantly expressed in neuronal and gonadal tissues, indicating its importance in these areas (Tanaka2017A).

CFAP44 is also implicated in the regulation of the secretory pathway through its enzymatic activity, which involves cleaving FtsZ and tubulin. This activity suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization, influencing cell morphology and the expression of tubulin proteins (Tanaka2017A). The protein's interaction with tau, a tubulin-binding protein, highlights its involvement in cellular trafficking processes, particularly in neural cells (Tanaka2017A).

In the context of reproductive health, CFAP44 is essential for the proper formation and function of sperm flagella. Mutations in CFAP44 have been linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition associated with male infertility (Wu2019NovelCFAP43).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP44 gene are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to male infertility due to severely impaired sperm motility. This condition is characterized by defects such as short, absent, coiled, bent, and irregular caliber flagella. Studies have identified several mutations in CFAP44, including homozygous nonsense and missense mutations, which result in lower expression levels of CFAP44 mRNA in affected individuals (Sha2019Novel; Wu2019NovelCFAP43). These mutations are linked to a loss-of-function effect, contributing to the pathogenesis of MMAF (Sha2019Novel).

Research has shown that CFAP44 mutations are less common than CFAP43 mutations in the Chinese population, but they still represent a significant cause of MMAF (Wu2019NovelCFAP43). The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutations being passed down from unaffected parents (Wu2019NovelCFAP43). Patients with CFAP44 mutations have been reported to have a higher fertilization rate following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) compared to those with DNAH1 mutations, indicating potential implications for assisted reproductive technologies (Sha2018Patients).

## Interactions
CFAP44, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 44, is involved in several interactions crucial for ciliary and flagellar function. It forms a complex with FAP43, and their localization to cilia is interdependent. This complex is positioned near the inner dynein arm I1, suggesting a regulatory role in dynein motor activity, although it is not required for the assembly or docking of the dynein arm (Urbanska2018Ciliary). CFAP44 also interacts with FAP57, which may act as a linker between the FAP43/44 complex and other axonemal structures (Urbanska2018Ciliary).

In addition to protein-protein interactions, CFAP44 has been identified as an RNA-associated protein. It shows a change in solubility upon RNA degradation, indicating potential interactions with RNA molecules. This interaction is suggested to be important for the assembly of dynein axonemal particles (DynAPs) and may play a role in tethering specific dynein arms within the axoneme (Drew2020A). The presence of WD40 domains in CFAP44 supports its capability for mediating these interactions (Drew2020A).
