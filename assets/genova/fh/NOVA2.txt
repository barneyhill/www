# NOVA2

## Overview
NOVA2 is a gene that encodes the NOVA alternative splicing regulator 2, a neuron-specific RNA-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of alternative splicing. This protein is characterized by its K-homology (KH) domains, which facilitate its interaction with RNA, particularly recognizing the UCAY motif. NOVA2 is crucial in various biological processes, including neuronal differentiation, synapse function, and vascular development. It is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, where it influences the splicing of mRNAs critical for synaptic structure and function, as well as in endothelial cells, where it regulates genes involved in angiogenesis and cell polarity. The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, where it modulates splicing events essential for cellular differentiation and plasticity. NOVA2's dysregulation is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Di2023Alternative; Meldolesi2020Alternative; Belloni2019Gene).

## Structure
The NOVA2 protein, known as the NOVA alternative splicing regulator 2, is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, primarily facilitated by its K-homology (KH) domains. The protein contains three KH domains, with the third KH domain (KH3) being extensively studied for its structural properties. The KH3 domain exhibits an α/β fold resembling an open-faced sandwich, consisting of three α helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet (Lewis1999Crystal). The arrangement of these secondary structures is crucial for its function, with the α helices and β sheet forming a compact, protease-resistant domain (Lewis1999Crystal).

The tertiary structure of the KH3 domain is stabilized by a hydrophobic core, where conserved hydrophobic residues are located, indicating that non-conservative substitutions are not tolerated (Lewis1999Crystal). The KH3 domain also forms tetramers with noncrystallographic 22 symmetry, suggesting potential quaternary interactions that may enhance RNA-binding capabilities (Lewis1999Crystal).

The KH3 domain specifically recognizes RNA sequences, such as the core sequence 5′-UCAY-3′, through a combination of hydrophobic, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with the invariant Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly loop playing a critical role in RNA binding (Yu2014Specific).

## Function
NOVA2 (NOVA alternative splicing regulator 2) is a critical splicing factor involved in the regulation of alternative splicing events in various cell types, including neurons and endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, NOVA2 plays a significant role in vascular development and angiogenesis by regulating the alternative splicing of key genes involved in cell polarity and lumen formation. It influences the splicing of genes such as Ppar-γ and Tfdp2, which are crucial for endothelial cell function and angiogenesis (Belloni2019Gene). NOVA2 also regulates the splicing of the FLT1 gene, affecting the levels of its soluble variants and maintaining endothelial function (Kremer2022Neurooncological).

In the nervous system, NOVA2 is predominantly expressed in the cortex and is essential for synapse structure and function. It regulates the splicing of mRNAs involved in localized protein synthesis at synapses, impacting cortical development and cerebellar function (Meldolesi2020Alternative). NOVA2's activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds to specific RNA sequences to modulate splicing events critical for neuronal differentiation and plasticity (Meldolesi2020Alternative). Its role extends to influencing the activity of phosphokinases like Erk, affecting endothelial cell polarity during vascular growth and differentiation (Meldolesi2020Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
NOVA2 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in alternative splicing. In gastric cancer (GC), NOVA2 overexpression in endothelial cells is linked to poor overall survival and lymph node metastases. It influences alternative splicing events that affect DNA repair, metabolic processes, and signaling pathways, including EGFR, potentially contributing to resistance against anti-cancer strategies targeting EGFR. High NOVA2 levels promote the inclusion of RapGEF6 exon 21A, altering its interaction with Rap1, which is crucial for vascular lumen formation and cancer progression. This splicing pattern is associated with an angiogenic signature and reduced survival in GC patients, suggesting that the NOVA2/RapGEF6 circuit contributes to vascular abnormalities in GC (Di2023Alternative).

In neurological disorders, NOVA2 is involved in the pathogenesis of conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, fronto-temporal dementia, and epilepsy. It interacts with voltage-gated Na+ channels, affecting neuronal function. The variability in NOVA2's effects, influenced by miRNAs and environmental factors, suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker in cancer (Meldolesi2020Alternative). In neural development, NOVA2 regulates alternative splicing of axon guidance-related genes, and its deficiency leads to severe neural defects, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, highlighting its critical role in central nervous system development (Saito2016NOVA2mediated).

## Interactions
NOVA2, a neuron-specific RNA-binding protein, plays a crucial role in regulating alternative splicing by interacting with specific RNA sequences. It contains K-homology (KH) domains that bind to RNA, particularly recognizing the tetranucleotide UCAY motif. This interaction is essential for the protein's binding specificity and is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing in neurons (Jensen2000The; Yu2014Specific).

The KH3 domain of NOVA2 forms specific interactions with RNA, stabilizing the RNA/KH3 complex through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The invariant Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly loop and a variable segment of the KH3 domain are critical for these interactions, forming stable contacts with RNA bases (Yu2014Specific).

NOVA2 also participates in complex networks of protein-RNA interactions, influenced by other RNA-binding proteins such as PTBP2 and RBFOX. In motoneurons, NOVA2's binding sites are enriched with pyrimidine-rich motifs, and its interactions are modulated by the presence of these proteins, which can either antagonize or facilitate NOVA2's binding to RNA (Yuan2018Cell).

These interactions highlight NOVA2's role in modulating splicing and polyadenylation, influencing cytoskeleton-related processes in neurons (Yuan2018Cell).
