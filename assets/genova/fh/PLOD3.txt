# PLOD3

## Overview
PLOD3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3, also known as lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3). This enzyme is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family and plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of collagen, a key structural protein in connective tissues. LH3 is unique among lysyl hydroxylases due to its dual functionality, possessing both hydroxylation and glycosylation activities, which are essential for the stability and cross-linking of collagen fibers. The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of various types of collagen, including types IV and VI, and is active in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular space. Mutations in the PLOD3 gene are linked to connective tissue disorders, while alterations in its expression are associated with cancer progression, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Valtavaara1998Primary; Ding2024PLOD3; Ewans2019Pathogenic).

## Structure
The PLOD3 gene encodes lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3), an enzyme involved in collagen biosynthesis. The primary structure of LH3 consists of 738 amino acids, with a high degree of identity to other lysyl hydroxylases, particularly in the conserved regions located in the carboxyl-terminal portion and the central part of the molecule (Valtavaara1998Primary). The enzyme includes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Valtavaara1998Primary).

The tertiary structure of LH3 has been modeled using crystallographic data, with molecular coordinates available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB IDs 6FXK, 6FXM, 6FXR, 6FXT). These models have been used to create dimeric ensembles, highlighting the dimerization interface defined by residues Arg714 and Leu715 (Scietti2019SiMPLOD). The enzyme's structure is further characterized by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are introduced at specific sites reported in UniProt (Scietti2019SiMPLOD).

LH3 is unique among lysyl hydroxylases as it is secreted and present in the extracellular space, where it interacts with type VII collagen (Vahidnezhad2019Mutations). The enzyme's activity is essential for the hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysyl residues, contributing to the stability and function of collagen fibers (Vahidnezhad2019Mutations).

## Function
The PLOD3 gene encodes the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH3), which plays a crucial role in collagen biosynthesis by catalyzing the hydroxylation of lysine residues in procollagen. This post-translational modification is essential for the stability and cross-linking of collagen fibers, impacting the structural integrity of connective tissues (Gong2021A; Ewans2019Pathogenic). PLOD3 is unique among the PLOD family because it also possesses glycosylation activity, allowing it to attach monosaccharides or disaccharides to collagen hydroxylysines. This activity is vital for collagen maturation and stability, contributing to the formation of covalent cross-links (Qi2018Roles).

In healthy human cells, PLOD3 is active in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the proper assembly and function of collagen by ensuring the correct hydroxylation and glycosylation of lysine residues (Qi2018Roles; Ewans2019Pathogenic). The enzyme's activity is particularly important for the biosynthesis of type IV and VI collagen, which are key components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes (Qi2018Roles). PLOD3's function is critical for maintaining the structural integrity and stability of tissues and organs, as it influences the stability and assembly of collagen fibers (Gong2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLOD3 gene, which encodes lysyl hydroxylase 3, are associated with a range of connective tissue disorders. These include a Stickler syndrome-like disorder characterized by ocular, auditory, skeletal, and skin abnormalities, as well as vascular complications (Ewans2019Pathogenic). Specific mutations, such as the homozygous missense variant c.809C>T; p.(Pro270Leu), have been linked to craniofacial dysmorphisms, skeletal and eye manifestations, and sensorineural hearing loss, overlapping with features of Stickler syndrome and other connective tissue disorders (Ewans2019Pathogenic).

Alterations in PLOD3 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high PLOD3 expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and liver metastasis, correlating with poor survival outcomes. PLOD3 influences the tumor microenvironment by affecting immune cell infiltration and the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for inflammation and tumorigenesis (Ding2024PLOD3). In lung cancer, PLOD3 acts as a pro-metastatic factor, with its knockdown inhibiting STAT3 activation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Baek2018PLOD3). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PLOD3 in both genetic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
PLOD3, or procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. In lung cancer, PLOD3 interacts with Protein Kinase C delta (PKCδ), modulating the PKC-delta signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for inducing apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathways, particularly involving caspase-2 and caspase-4, and is associated with increased phosphorylation of ER stress markers like IRE1α (Baek2019PLOD3).

PLOD3 also interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway, promoting lung cancer metastasis. It regulates STAT3 phosphorylation, enhancing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), which are essential for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The interaction between PLOD3 and STAT3 has been confirmed through proximity ligation and immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a direct interaction that correlates with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients (Baek2018PLOD3).

In ovarian cancer, PLOD3 interacts with COLGALT2, a protein associated with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis. This interaction is significant in mediating cancer cell invasiveness and is linked to poorer prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (Guo2021COLGALT2). Additionally, PLOD3 has been shown to interact with the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA1 protein, particularly in cancer-associated variants, suggesting a potential link between viral infection and cancer progression (Shire2021Characterization).
