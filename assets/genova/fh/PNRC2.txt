# PNRC2

## Overview
PNRC2, or proline rich nuclear receptor coactivator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator. This protein is characterized by its proline-rich sequence and SH3-binding motif, which facilitate interactions with various nuclear receptors, including SF1 and ERRα1, and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation (Zhou2001PNRC2). Beyond its role in transcription, PNRC2 is implicated in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), where it acts as an mRNA decapping enhancer by interacting with decapping factors such as DCP1A and DCP2 (Cho2012SMG5–PNRC2; Nicholson2018Dissecting). The protein's involvement in these processes suggests its significance in cellular regulation and gene expression, with potential implications in various tissues, including the heart and lung (Zhou2001PNRC2).

## Structure
PNRC2 is a 16 kDa protein composed of 139 amino acids, characterized by a proline-rich sequence at its C-terminus (amino acids 85-139) that includes an SH3-binding motif (SEPPSPS) crucial for its interaction with nuclear receptors (Zhou2001PNRC2). This motif is essential for binding to various nuclear receptors, including SF1 and ERRα1, and is involved in ligand-dependent and independent interactions (Zhou2001PNRC2).

The protein also contains an NR box-like sequence (LKTLL) that contributes to its interaction with nuclear receptors (Lai2024Structural). The proline-rich sequence adopts a polyproline II (PPII) helical conformation, which is typical for SH3-binding motifs, and this conformation is important for its binding to the EVH1 domain of hDcp1a, a protein involved in mRNA decapping (Lai2024Structural).

PNRC2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its interactions and functions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented in the provided context. The protein's interaction with hDcp1a suggests a role in mRNA decapping, indicating a potential quaternary structure involving complex formation with other proteins (Lai2024Structural).

## Function
PNRC2 (proline rich nuclear receptor coactivator 2) is a 16 kDa protein that functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator, enhancing the transcriptional activation of various nuclear receptors. It interacts with these receptors through an SH3-binding motif located in a proline-rich sequence at its C-terminus, which is unique among nuclear receptor coactivators (Zhou2001PNRC2). PNRC2 is involved in modulating transcriptional activity mediated by nuclear receptors such as SF1, ERRα1, and ERα, with its coactivation being ligand-independent for SF1 and ERRα1, but ligand-dependent for ERα (Zhou2001PNRC2).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, PNRC2 is implicated in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons. PNRC2 interacts with the protein Upf1 and is involved in linking hyperphosphorylated Upf1 to the decapping complex, promoting mRNA degradation (Cho2012SMG5–PNRC2). It is suggested to function as an mRNA decapping enhancer, interacting with decapping factors such as DCP1A and DCP2, although its role in NMD may be context-dependent or redundant with other pathways (Nicholson2018Dissecting).

PNRC2 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and lung, and is thought to play a role in modulating nuclear receptor activity in breast tissue, potentially affecting aromatase/estrogen biosynthesis (Zhou2001PNRC2).

## Interactions
PNRC2 (proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with nuclear receptors through a proline-rich sequence, engaging with orphan receptors such as steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) and estrogen receptor-related receptor α1 in a ligand-independent manner. PNRC2 also interacts with the ligand-binding domains of several other receptors, including estrogen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, thyroid, retinoic acid, and retinoid X receptors, in a ligand-dependent manner. These interactions require a functional activation function 2 domain in the nuclear receptors (Zhou2001PNRC2).

In the context of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), PNRC2 forms a preferential complex with SMG5, facilitating the interaction between SMG5 and Dcp1a, a component of the decapping complex. This interaction is crucial for mRNA degradation, highlighting PNRC2's role in linking Upf1 to the decapping complex (Cho2012SMG5–PNRC2). PNRC2 also interacts with the hyperphosphorylated form of Upf1, targeting Upf1-bound transcripts to P bodies where NMD occurs (Lai2024Structural). Additionally, PNRC2 interacts with the EVH1 domain of hDcp1a, which is essential for mRNA decapping (Lai2024Structural).
