# ELL2

## Overview
ELL2 is a gene that encodes the protein elongation factor for RNA polymerase II 2, which is a critical component of the super elongation complex (SEC). This protein plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation and preventing transient pausing of the polymerase. ELL2 is particularly important in plasma cells, where it is highly expressed and contributes to the production of secretory-specific immunoglobulin mRNA, essential for antibody secretion and immune function (Ali2018The; Swaminathan2015Variants). Structurally, ELL2 features a unique C-terminal domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, crucial for its function in transcription and DNA repair (Arumemi2013Shared; Qi2017Structural). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and prostate cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor (Pascal2017Conditional; Swaminathan2015Variants).

## Structure
The ELL2 protein is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) and plays a crucial role in transcription elongation. Structurally, the C-terminal domain of ELL2 has been crystallized, revealing an arch-shaped fold similar to the tight junction protein occludin. This domain is characterized by a three-helix fold, consisting of helices a1, a2, and a3, with helix a1 bending inward and packing against a2. Helices a2 and a3 are oriented at an angle of approximately 100° with respect to each other, packing along the length of the bent helix a1 (Qi2017Structural). The ELL2 C-terminal domain shares homology with occludin and forms a unique structure with a highly positively charged surface, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Arumemi2013Shared).

The ELL2 protein interacts with the AFF4 protein through a segment known as the ELLBow, which consists of an N-terminal helix followed by an extended hairpin. This interaction is crucial for promoting HIV-1 Tat-mediated proviral transcription (Qi2017Structural). The interface between AFF4 and ELL2 involves extensive hydrophobic interactions, with key residues contributing to binding affinity (Qi2017Structural). The ELL2 protein also contains a ubiquitination site acted on by Siah1, which controls its degradation, and interaction with AF4 blocks Siah1 binding, enhancing stability (Arumemi2013Shared).

## Function
The ELL2 gene encodes a component of the super-elongation complex (SEC), which is crucial for transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. This process is essential for the efficient synthesis of mRNA, particularly in plasma cells where ELL2 is highly expressed (Ali2018The; Swaminathan2015Variants). ELL2 facilitates the transition from transcription initiation to elongation, preventing transient pausing of RNA polymerase II, thereby enhancing the transcription of specific genes (Swaminathan2015Variants).

In plasma cells, ELL2 plays a significant role in the production of secretory-specific immunoglobulin mRNA, which is vital for antibody secretion. This function is critical for the differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells, where ELL2 expression is upregulated to promote the translation of immunoglobulin heavy chain mRNA into secreted immunoglobulins (Alexander2017Selective; Swaminathan2015Variants). ELL2 also influences the processing of a substantial portion of transcripts in plasma cells, including those related to plasma cell survival and oncogene expression (Swaminathan2015Variants).

ELL2 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other elongation factors to regulate transcription and maintain normal immune function by ensuring adequate antibody production (Swaminathan2015Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ELL2 gene have been linked to several diseases, most notably multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The ELL2 risk allele, particularly rs56219066, is associated with decreased levels of immunoglobulins IgA and IgG, which may contribute to the development of these conditions (Swaminathan2015Variants). This allele results in lower ELL2 expression in plasma cells, affecting the production of secreted immunoglobulins and potentially increasing the risk of MM and MGUS (Ali2018The).

The ELL2 gene is also implicated in an increased risk of bacterial meningitis, possibly due to its impact on immunoglobulin levels (Swaminathan2015Variants). In addition, the ELL2 risk allele is associated with altered immunoglobulin glycosylation and lower total serum protein levels, which may further influence disease susceptibility (Ali2018The).

In prostate cancer, ELL2 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its loss is linked to increased epithelial proliferation, vascularity, and the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, suggesting a role in prostate cancer pathogenesis (Pascal2017Conditional). The gene's interaction with EAF2, another tumor suppressor, highlights its significance in maintaining prostate homeostasis (Pascal2017Conditional).

## Interactions
ELL2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcription elongation and DNA repair. It is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC), where it interacts with pTEFb, a complex of cyclin T and CDK9, and other elongation factors such as AF4/aff1 (Arumemi2013Shared). ELL2 also interacts with ELL-associated factors 1 and 2 (EAF1 and EAF2), enhancing its elongation activity (Zang2018ELL2).

In the context of DNA repair, ELL2 physically interacts with the Ku70 and Ku80 proteins, which are essential for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. ELL2 co-accumulates with these proteins at sites of DNA damage, facilitating their recruitment and retention, which is critical for efficient DNA repair (Zang2018ELL2).

ELL2 also binds to HSP40 and Testin in its amino-terminal half, while PCNA binds to a region encompassing amino acids 186-344. The transcription factors HIF1α and ZNF622 interact with ELL2 in its central, proline-rich region (Arumemi2013Shared). These interactions suggest a role for ELL2 in mRNA processing and plasma cell development, potentially influencing exon skipping and alternative splicing (Arumemi2013Shared).
