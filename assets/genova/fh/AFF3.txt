# AFF3

## Overview
The AFF3 gene encodes the ALF transcription elongation factor 3, a protein that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. This protein is a component of the super elongation complex-like 3 (SEC-L3), which is involved in the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II, particularly influencing gene expression related to X chromosome inactivation (Zhang2018AFF3DNA). Structurally, ALF transcription elongation factor 3 is characterized by an AT hook motif and an RNA recognition motif, which facilitate its interactions with DNA and RNA, respectively, underscoring its function in transcription elongation. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and it is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with potentially distinct roles (Luo2012The). AFF3 is implicated in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, development, and neurodevelopment, and is associated with clinical conditions such as intellectual disability and cancer (Voisin2021Variants; Wang2024Integrated).

## Structure
The AFF3 gene encodes a protein involved in transcription regulation, characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes an AT hook motif, which is known for its ability to bind DNA, facilitating interactions with chromatin and influencing transcriptional activity. Additionally, the presence of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) suggests a role in RNA binding, which may be crucial for its function in transcription elongation.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to affect the function of the AFF3 protein. These modifications can alter the protein's activity, stability, or interactions with other molecules, thereby modulating its role in cellular processes.

AFF3 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. These splice variants may have distinct roles in different cellular contexts, potentially contributing to the regulation of diverse biological processes. The existence of these isoforms underscores the complexity of AFF3's function and its regulation at the molecular level. The specific structural details of the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of AFF3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The AFF3 gene, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 3, plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It is a component of the super elongation complex-like 3 (SEC-L3), which is involved in the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II. This complex is crucial for regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female cells. AFF3 binds to differentially methylated regions (DMRs) downstream of the XIST promoter, a key gene in XCI, and its activity is dependent on DNA methylation (Zhang2018AFF3DNA).

In terminally differentiated cells, AFF3 is essential for maintaining the mono-allelic expression pattern of XIST, thereby ensuring proper X chromosome inactivation. Knockdown of AFF3 leads to increased XIST expression, indicating its role in silencing this gene and maintaining the inactive state of the X chromosome (Zhang2018AFF3DNA). AFF3's function is not mediated by KAP1, a protein typically associated with genomic imprinting, highlighting its unique role in XIST regulation (Zhang2018AFF3DNA).

Overall, AFF3 is active in the nucleus and is implicated in processes like cell differentiation and development, contributing to the regulation of imprinted genes and maintaining genomic stability in female cells (Zhang2018AFF3DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AFF3 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions. Variants in the degron of AFF3 have been linked to intellectual disability, mesomelic dysplasia, horseshoe kidney, and epileptic encephalopathy. These conditions are part of a broader phenotypic spectrum that includes features reminiscent of CHOPS syndrome, such as distinctive facial dysmorphic features, short stature with obesity, and microcephaly (Voisin2021Variants). The distinct autosomal dominant disorder associated with these variants has been proposed to be named KINSSHIP syndrome, characterized by mesomelic dysplasia, short forearms, radial head dislocation, and other skeletal abnormalities (Voisin2021Variants).

The AFF3 gene is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders through mechanisms such as CGG repeat expansions, which lead to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. This silencing is associated with neurodevelopmental anomalies, including delays in motor and language skill acquisition (Metsu2014FRA2A). Additionally, GCC repeat expansions in AFF3 have been identified as significant contributors to intellectual disability and reduced educational attainment (Jadhav2023A).

In the context of cancer, AFF3 has been identified as a susceptibility gene for renal cancer, with higher expression levels observed in renal cancer tissues compared to normal controls (Wang2024Integrated).

## Interactions
AFF3, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 3, is involved in several protein interactions, primarily as part of transcriptional super elongation complexes (SECs). AFF3 forms complexes with P-TEFb, ENL, and AF9, but not with ELL family members such as ELL1, ELL2, or ELL3, which were not reproducibly detected in AFF3 complexes (Luo2012The). The AFF3-containing complex, known as SEC-L3, includes significant amounts of CDK9, cyclin T1/2, and AF9/ENL peptides, and exhibits strong in vitro kinase activity for the Pol II CTD, similar to other SECs (Luo2012The).

AFF3 also interacts with SIAH1, a ubiquitin-ligase, as demonstrated through 3D interaction modeling using Swiss-PdbViewer-DeepView. This interaction suggests a potential role in ubiquitin-ligase activity (Voisin2019Variants). In the context of neurodevelopment, AFF3, also referred to as Laf4, regulates the expression of Mdga2, a structural protein, by binding specifically to its locus, indicating a direct transcriptional regulatory role (Moore2014Laf4Aff3).

These interactions highlight AFF3's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in various biological processes, including neurodevelopment and disease contexts such as leukemia and intellectual disability.
