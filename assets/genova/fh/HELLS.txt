# HELLS

## Overview
HELLS, also known as LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase), is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SNF2 family of chromatin remodelers. The HELLS protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling, DNA methylation, and DNA repair processes. As a chromatin remodeler, HELLS is involved in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability by facilitating the access of transcription factors and repair proteins to DNA. It is particularly significant in the context of epigenetic regulation, where it influences cytosine methylation patterns across the genome. HELLS is also implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, contributing to the maintenance of genomic integrity. Clinically, mutations in the HELLS gene are associated with Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, while its overexpression is linked to various cancers, highlighting its importance in both genetic disorders and oncogenesis (Jenness2018HELLS; Peixoto2022The; Mjelle2015Cell).

## Structure
The HELLS protein, also known as LSH, is a member of the SNF2 family of chromatin remodelers and features several distinct structural domains. The N-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain that acts as an autoinhibitory element, unique to HELLS compared to its homolog DDM1, and is responsible for its inactivity in vitro (Nartey2023CryoEM). HELLS also includes a midloop region within its ATPase motor, which is absent in other chromatin remodelers like DDM1. This midloop is implicated in stimulating chromatin remodeling activity by interacting with the nucleosome's acidic patch (Nartey2023CryoEM).

The C-terminal motif of HELLS interacts with ATPase lobe 2 and is crucial for protein stability, with mutations in this region potentially leading to destabilization (Nartey2023CryoEM). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at S503 and S515, influence the protein's conformation and activity, potentially enhancing binding affinity and maintaining cancer stemness (Nartey2023CryoEM). HELLS is also subject to monomethylation at R309, which affects nucleosome binding and remodeling (Nartey2023CryoEM). Splice variants of HELLS have been identified, with some variants leading to frameshifts and premature translation termination (Yano2004Tumor‐specific).

## Function
The HELLS gene encodes a multifunctional putative helicase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, HELLS plays a significant role in DNA repair, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). It enhances the phosphorylation of H2AX to form γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, facilitating efficient repair mechanisms (Mjelle2015Cell). HELLS is also a key player in chromatin remodeling, forming a complex with CDCA7 known as CHIRRC, which is essential for nucleosome remodeling and DNA methylation processes. This complex is crucial for the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases like DNMT3b, necessary for de novo DNA methylation, particularly in the context of ICF syndrome (Jenness2018HELLS).

HELLS is involved in epigenetic regulation, influencing cytosine methylation across various genomic regions, including centromeric and pericentromeric repeats, which is vital for genomic stability (Yu2014Genome-wide; Unoki2018CDCA7). It also interacts with E2F transcription factors to promote cell cycle progression, particularly during the G1/S phase transition, by mediating the expression of genes that stimulate cell growth (Mjelle2015Cell). HELLS is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic integrity and proper cell function (Unoki2018CDCA7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HELLS gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. HELLS mutations are implicated in Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, particularly types 3 and 4. These mutations lead to defects in DNA methylation, resulting in hypomethylation of centromeric and pericentromeric repeats, which contributes to chromosomal instability and the clinical features of ICF syndrome (Thijssen2015Mutations; Unoki2018CDCA7). HELLS interacts with CDCA7 and DNMT3b, forming a complex essential for nucleosome remodeling and DNA methylation, and mutations in these genes disrupt this process, exacerbating the syndrome's pathology (Jenness2018HELLS).

In cancer, HELLS is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumorigenesis through genome instability and epigenetic alterations. It is implicated in various cancers, including leukemia, retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. HELLS overexpression can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and support cancer cell proliferation, often correlating with poor prognosis (Peixoto2022The; Robinson2019Upregulation). These findings highlight HELLS as a significant factor in both genetic disorders and cancer, underscoring its clinical importance.

## Interactions
HELLS, a chromatin remodeler, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. HELLS interacts with nucleosomes through its midloop, which binds to the nucleosome's acidic patch. This interaction involves a tyrosine anchor, arginine interactions, and proline constraints, which are essential for chromatin remodeling (Nartey2023CryoEM). HELLS is also monomethylated at R309 by PRMT5, affecting its interaction with nucleosomal DNA (Nartey2023CryoEM).

HELLS forms a bipartite nucleosome remodeling complex with CDCA7e, which is essential for its recruitment to chromatin. This interaction is conserved among different CDCA7 paralogs and is crucial for chromatin loading (Jenness2018HELLS). HELLS also interacts with E2F3, a transcription factor, and is found on E2F-promoters, indicating a role in transcription regulation (von2011The).

HELLS interacts with CtIP, contributing to its accumulation at IR-induced breaks, which is essential for DNA double-strand break repair within heterochromatin (Kollárovič2019The; Kollarovic2018The). These interactions highlight HELLS's multifaceted role in chromatin dynamics and genome stability.
