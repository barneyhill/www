# LRRC10B

## Overview
The LRRC10B gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeat containing 10B, which is part of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of LRR motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for various cellular processes. The specific biological functions of LRRC10B remain to be fully elucidated, but proteins in this family are often implicated in signal transduction, cell adhesion, and immune response. The LRRC10B protein is thought to play a role in these processes, although further research is needed to clarify its precise functions and mechanisms of action. Understanding the role of LRRC10B could have significant implications for elucidating pathways involved in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
