# METTL9

## Overview
The METTL9 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 9, His-X-His N1(pi)-histidine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is characterized by its seven-β-strand (7BS) methyltransferase architecture and is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through histidine methylation. METTL9 specifically targets histidine residues within His-x-His (HxH) motifs, catalyzing the formation of 1-methylhistidine, which plays a crucial role in modulating protein function and metal-binding properties. The protein is active in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and is implicated in essential cellular processes such as mitochondrial respiration and metal ion homeostasis. METTL9's activity is significant across different tissues, contributing to cellular homeostasis and influencing organismal growth and development. Alterations in METTL9 expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neuroinflammation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Huang2023Circular; Davydova2021The; Lv2021METTL9).

## Structure
The METTL9 protein is characterized by a canonical seven-β-strand (7BS) methyltransferase (MTase) architecture. This structure includes a seven-strand β-sheet composed of β4-β3-β2-β5-β6-β10-β9, which is a defining feature of its secondary structure (Wang2023Molecular). The crystal structure of a METTL9 variant, METTL9 M6, was resolved at a high resolution of 1.69 Å, revealing that the cofactor S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is buried in a deep groove formed by β2, β3, β5, α7, and α8. The peptide substrate SLC39A5 adopts an extended conformation and lies in a groove formed by loops and β-sheets of METTL9 M6, indicating specific interactions at the METTL9-SLC39A5 interface (Wang2023Molecular).

The METTL9 protein targets histidine residues within specific motifs, such as the His-x-His (HxH) motif, where 'x' is preferably a small amino acid. This specificity is crucial for its function as a methyltransferase, mediating 1-methylhistidine modifications in various proteins (Davydova2021The). The structure captures the premethyl transfer status, with a critical distance of 3.6 Å between His375 of the substrate and SAH, highlighting the precise molecular interactions necessary for its enzymatic activity (Wang2023Molecular).

## Function
METTL9 is a histidine methyltransferase that plays a significant role in the post-translational modification of proteins in mammalian cells. It specifically targets histidine residues within His-x-His (HxH) motifs, where it catalyzes the formation of 1-methylhistidine (1MH) (Davydova2021The; Wang2023Molecular). This methylation process is crucial for modulating protein function, particularly affecting metal-binding properties, as METTL9-mediated methylation reduces zinc binding affinity in its target proteins (Davydova2021The; Wang2023Molecular).

METTL9 is active in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and is involved in cellular processes such as mitochondrial respiration. It enhances mitochondrial Complex I-mediated respiration by methylating components like NDUFB3, which is essential for optimal ATP synthesis (Davydova2021The). The enzyme's activity is widespread across different tissues and is responsible for a significant portion of 1MH modifications in human and mouse proteomes (Davydova2021The).

The presence of METTL9 in healthy human cells suggests its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating metal ion transport, potentially influencing organismal outcomes like growth and development (Davydova2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the METTL9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. METTL9 is overexpressed in several types of cancer, including liver, pancreatic, prostate, and colorectal cancers, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Lv2021METTL9a; Zhang2024METTL). Its role in promoting tumor growth is linked to its function in N1-histidine methylation of zinc transporters, which affects zinc homeostasis and cell proliferation (Lv2021METTL9a). Deletion of METTL9 in tumor cells has been shown to suppress growth and enhance anti-tumor immunity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lv2021METTL9a).

In addition to its role in cancer, METTL9 is involved in neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The circular RNA derived from METTL9, circMETTL9, interacts with the protein SND1 to promote inflammatory responses in astrocytes, exacerbating neuroinflammation and secondary injury post-TBI (Huang2023Circular). Knockdown of circMETTL9 has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and improve functional recovery in TBI models (Huang2023Circular).

## Interactions
METTL9 is a histidine methyltransferase that interacts with various proteins, primarily through its role in methylating specific motifs. It targets proteins containing the His-x-His (HxH) motif, where the 'x' is preferably a small amino acid, allowing it to methylate a range of substrates. Notable interactions include the zinc transporter SLC39A7, where METTL9 methylates histidine residues, a process crucial for tumor growth (Lv2021METTL9). METTL9 also interacts with proteins such as S100A9 and NDUFB3, which contain similar motifs and can be methylated by METTL9 (Davydova2021The).

The enzyme's interaction with SLC39A5 involves extensive hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, particularly with the GHSH motif, where His375 is accommodated in a deep pocket of METTL9, forming hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (Wang2023Molecular). METTL9's methylation activity affects mitochondrial respiration and the binding affinity of zinc transporter peptides to Zn2+, indicating its role in regulating metal ion homeostasis (Davydova2021The). These interactions suggest that METTL9 plays a significant role in modulating protein function and cellular processes through its methylation activity.
