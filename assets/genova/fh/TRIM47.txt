# TRIM47

## Overview
TRIM47 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 47, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in the ubiquitination process that regulates protein degradation, signal transduction, and cellular homeostasis. TRIM47 is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, regulating synaptic development in the brain, and influencing cancer progression through its interactions with key proteins such as BRCA1, SMAD4, and p53. The protein's activity is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses. Alterations in TRIM47 expression and function have been implicated in several diseases, including colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2023Overexpression; Chen2021TRIM47; Chen2024Trim47).

## Structure


## Function
TRIM47 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, which regulates protein degradation, signal transduction, and cellular homeostasis. In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), TRIM47 plays a crucial role in maintaining quiescence and survival under stress conditions by regulating the MAVS-mediated innate immune pathway. It prevents excessive activation of immune signaling and inflammatory responses, which is essential for preventing stress-induced hematopoietic failure and maintaining HSC quiescence and self-renewal capacity (Chen2024Trim47).

In the brain, TRIM47 is developmentally regulated and facilitates hippocampal synapse development. It acts as a negative regulator of dendritic spine structure and excitatory synapse development in hippocampal neurons, influencing synaptic plasticity and potentially affecting memory and learning processes (Sharma2022Activityregulated). TRIM47 is also localized to brain blood vessel endothelial cells in adults, which may impact tumor growth by delivering oxygen and nutrients to tumors (DudleyFraser2023It’s).

TRIM47's activity is primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune response, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
TRIM47 is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TRIM47 is significantly overexpressed, with 76% of cases showing higher expression compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, increased tumor aggressiveness, and chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). TRIM47 promotes CRC progression by interacting with SMAD4, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation, which enhances tumor growth and invasion through the CCL15-CCR1 signaling pathway (Liang2019TRIM47).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), TRIM47 overexpression correlates with poor survival outcomes. It promotes malignant progression by degrading the tumor suppressor protein p53 through ubiquitination, contributing to cancer aggressiveness (Chen2021TRIM47).

TRIM47 also plays a role in ovarian cancer by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, which enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of TRIM47 reduces these oncogenic activities, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022TRIM47).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TRIM47 overexpression interferes with BRCA1-dependent DNA repair pathways, increasing sensitivity to PARP inhibitors like Olaparib. This suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients with high TRIM47 expression (Liu2023Overexpression).

## Interactions
TRIM47, a member of the TRIM protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), TRIM47 interacts with BRCA1, leading to its ubiquitin-ligase-mediated proteasome degradation. This interaction results in decreased BRCA1 protein levels, affecting DNA repair pathways and increasing sensitivity to PARP inhibitors like olaparib (Liu2023Overexpression). TRIM47's interaction with BRCA1 also impacts the expression of downstream genes such as p53, p27, and p21, which are reduced in TRIM47 overexpressing cells (Liu2023Overexpression).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TRIM47 interacts with SMAD4, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction leads to the upregulation of CCL15 expression, which enhances CRC cell growth and invasion through the CCL15-CCR1 signaling pathway (Liang2019TRIM47).

In pancreatic cancer, TRIM47 interacts with FBP1, leading to its ubiquitination and inhibition. This interaction stimulates the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, such as c-Myc and GLUT1, promoting tumor progression (Li2021TRIM47).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), TRIM47 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to its degradation through ubiquitination. This interaction contributes to RCC progression by enhancing cell proliferation (Chen2021TRIM47).
