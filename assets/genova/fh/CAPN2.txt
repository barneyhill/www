# CAPN2

## Overview
CAPN2 is a gene that encodes calpain 2, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease involved in numerous cellular processes. Calpain 2 is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including a large catalytic subunit and a smaller regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimer. This protease plays a critical role in cellular dynamics, such as cell cycle regulation, membrane protrusion, and signal transduction. It is particularly significant in modulating nuclear dynamics and cytoskeletal remodeling, impacting processes like mitosis and cell migration. Calpain 2 is activated through calcium binding and phosphorylation, with its activity being crucial for various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer metastasis and cardiovascular diseases (Rodríguez-Fernández2021Cleavage; Campbell2012Structure–function; Sorimachi2012Regulation).

## Structure
Calpain 2 (CAPN2) is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease with a complex multi-domain structure. The primary structure of CAPN2 includes a large catalytic subunit and a smaller regulatory subunit, forming a heterodimer. The catalytic subunit is approximately 80 kDa, while the regulatory subunit is about 28 kDa (Campbell2012Structure–function).

The secondary structure of CAPN2 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves a compact arrangement of these elements, with the protease core divided into two domains, PC1 and PC2, which undergo significant conformational changes upon calcium binding (Campbell2012Structure–function).

In terms of quaternary structure, CAPN2 forms a heterodimer with the small subunit, CAPNS1, through interactions involving the C-terminal penta-EF-hand (PEF) domains. These domains are crucial for dimerization and calcium binding, although they do not primarily regulate calpain activity (Campbell2012Structure–function).

CAPN2 contains several distinct domains, including the protease core, a β-sandwich C2L domain, and the PEF domain. The C2L domain, although similar to C2 domains, does not bind calcium due to differences in topology (Campbell2012Structure–function). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and autoproteolysis, which may influence its activation and function (Campbell2012Structure–function).

## Function
CAPN2, or calpain 2, is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CAPN2 is involved in the regulation of nuclear dynamics, particularly during the cell cycle. It modulates the phosphorylation and localization of cofilin 1 (CFL1), which is crucial for proper mitosis progression and cytokinesis. CAPN2 influences the activation of LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), which phosphorylates CFL1, affecting actin polymerization necessary for spindle positioning and mitotic congression. Depletion of CAPN2 can lead to altered mitosis, cell multinucleation, and defective chromosome alignment, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal cell division (Rodríguez-Fernández2021Cleavage).

CAPN2 is also essential for regulating membrane protrusion dynamics in fibroblasts. It is involved in the proteolysis of cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins such as talin, spectrin, FAK, and paxillin, which are crucial for efficient membrane extension and cell migration. CAPN2 activity is necessary for the formation of stabilized lamellipodia and efficient cell movement, acting as both a negative and positive regulator of membrane protrusion events (Franco2004Isoform).

In the context of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, CAPN2 is activated through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation, which is crucial for cell motility and deadhesion. This activation can occur independently of increased intracellular calcium levels, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms for CAPN2 activity (Glading2004Epidermal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CAPN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), CAPN2 is upregulated in patients with insulin resistance, suggesting its involvement in the condition's pathophysiology. The gene is part of a regulatory network involving lncRNA XIST and hsa-miR-433-3p, which may contribute to the molecular mechanisms underlying PCOS-related insulin resistance (Luo2024CAPN2).

In cancer, CAPN2 plays a significant role in tumor cell migration and metastasis. It is part of a proteolysis network in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its expression and proteolytic activity are associated with increased metastatic potential. CAPN2's involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling and signal transduction is crucial for cancer cell survival and migration (Shen2012Global).

In cardiovascular diseases, CAPN2 is linked to contractile dysfunction and apoptosis in cardiac ischemia. Its overactivation in atherosclerosis contributes to disease progression, and calpain inhibition has shown potential in reducing the severity of cardiovascular disorders (Sorimachi2012Regulation). These findings highlight CAPN2's clinical significance across various conditions.

## Interactions
Calpain 2 (CAPN2) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with TP53, a substrate of calpain, where CAPN2 modulates TP53's post-translational regulation. This interaction affects DNA damage response and apoptosis, as CAPN2 expression can desensitize cells to DNA damage by reducing TP53 nuclear levels, thereby influencing DNA damage recognition and repair pathways (Stillger2023Changes).

CAPN2 also interacts with LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), where it cleaves and activates LIMK1, a process crucial for nuclear dynamics and cytoskeleton remodeling. This interaction is facilitated by CAPN2's PDZ binding domain, essential for binding LIMK1. The cleavage of LIMK1 by CAPN2 results in fragments that retain phosphorylation activity, impacting processes like spindle positioning during mitosis (Rodríguez-Fernández2021Cleavage).

In pancreatic cancer cells, CAPN2 influences the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. This interaction is linked to CAPN2's role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its involvement in cancer metastasis (Peng2022Calpain2). These interactions underscore CAPN2's role in modulating cellular dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
