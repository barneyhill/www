# PDGFRA

## Overview
The PDGFRA gene encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling. This receptor is integral to various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration, particularly in mesenchymal cells. PDGFRA is involved in critical signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK, which are essential for cell growth and survival (Noskovičová2015PlateletDerived; Andrae2008Role). The receptor's activity is crucial during embryonic development, influencing the formation of organs like the lung and central nervous system, and it continues to be important in adult physiology for processes such as wound healing and tissue homeostasis (Demoulin2014PDGF; Andrae2008Role). Dysregulation of PDGFRA, often due to mutations, is associated with various pathological conditions, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors and certain myeloid neoplasms, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target (Corless2005PDGFRA; Savage2013Myeloid).

## Structure
The PDGFRA protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of 1089 amino acids, with key regions including the juxtamembrane (JM) domain and the kinase domain, spanning residues 555-953 (Liang2016Structural). The secondary structure features a bilobal kinase domain typical of type III receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising a five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet and an α helix in the N-terminal lobe, and a predominantly α-helical C-terminal lobe (Liang2016Structural).

The tertiary structure of PDGFRA includes unique features such as an additional 3_10 helix and an α helix (αDE) in the kinase insert domain, as well as a non-conventional α helix (αJ) in the C-terminal region (Liang2016Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is crucial for its activation. PDGFRA can form dimers in a ligand-free state, with ligand binding inducing dimerization of the extracellular and transmembrane regions, leading to asymmetric dimerization of the kinase domains (Polyansky2019Atomistic).

PDGFRA contains a transmembrane domain that plays a role in receptor dimerization and activation, with mutations in this domain, such as V536E, affecting its conformational dynamics and activation potential (Polyansky2019Atomistic). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is essential for its signaling function.

## Function
PDGFRA encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is crucial for various cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, PDGFRA is primarily active in mesenchymal cells, where it plays a significant role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The receptor is involved in several well-characterized signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, which are essential for cell growth, survival, and metabolism (Noskovičová2015PlateletDerived; Andrae2008Role).

PDGFRA signaling is vital for embryonic development, particularly in the formation of organs such as the lung, skeleton, and central nervous system. It is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, promoting the proliferation and spreading of mesenchymal cells in response to PDGF-A, which is expressed in epithelia and nervous tissue (Demoulin2014PDGF; Andrae2008Role). The receptor's activity is tightly regulated to ensure proper cellular function and prevent aberrant growth, which could lead to pathological conditions (Wu2008Comprehensive).

PDGFRA also plays a role in adult physiology, contributing to processes such as wound healing and tissue homeostasis. Its signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and migration, which are crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and function (Noskovičová2015PlateletDerived).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDGFRA gene are implicated in several diseases, most notably gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Approximately 7.2% of GISTs harbor PDGFRA mutations, with the D842V mutation in exon 18 being the most common. This mutation is resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, a standard treatment for GISTs, leading to challenges in managing these tumors (Corless2005PDGFRA; Indio2018Integrated). Alternative treatments, such as crenolanib and avapritinib, have shown promise in targeting the D842V mutation, with avapritinib demonstrating a high overall response rate in clinical trials (Heinrich2020Avapritinib; Indio2018Integrated).

PDGFRA mutations are also associated with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms characterized by eosinophilia. The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, resulting from a cryptic deletion, is a common cytogenetic abnormality in these neoplasms. Imatinib is effective in treating these conditions, although resistance can occur due to mutations like T674I and D842V (Savage2013Myeloid).

In pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), PDGFRA amplification and novel missense mutations have been identified, suggesting a role in tumor development and potential as a therapeutic target (Puget2012Mesenchymal).

## Interactions
PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its signaling pathways. It forms heterodimers with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) in glioblastoma cells, a process that is stimulated by EGF-ligand and can be inhibited by EGFR inhibitors like gefitinib (Chakravarty2017EGFR). This interaction is significant in glioblastoma signaling and can be visualized using proximity ligation assays (Chakravarty2017EGFR).

PDGFRA also interacts with EPHA2, another receptor tyrosine kinase, in glioblastoma cells. EPHA2 can be activated by PDGFA independently of PDGFRA, suggesting alternative pathways for PDGFA signaling. The interaction between PDGFRA and EPHA2 is crucial for mediating PDGFA activity, and their co-expression is associated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma (Gai2022EPHA2).

Mutations in PDGFRA, such as Y288C, lead to altered phosphorylation patterns and interactions with proteins like STATs, Src family members, PI3K, and SHP-2, activating various signaling pathways. These mutations can confer resistance to PDGFRA inhibitors, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies (Ip2018Neomorphic).
