# FBXO22

## Overview
FBXO22 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 22, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. F-box protein 22 is characterized by its N-terminal F-box domain, essential for its interaction with SKP1, and a unique C-terminal FIST domain, which is involved in substrate recruitment (Cao2024Distinct; Zhang2019FBXO22). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and tumor suppression, by targeting nuclear proteins such as BACH1, p57 Kip2, and PTEN for degradation (Nie2024Recruitment). Its dysregulation has been associated with the progression of several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2024FBXO22; Lin2022Fbxo22).

## Structure
FBXO22 is a protein that is part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, which plays a role in ubiquitination and protein degradation. The protein contains an F-box domain located at the N-terminal, spanning approximately the first 100 amino acids, which is crucial for its role in ubiquitination processes (Zhang2019FBXO22). 

FBXO22 also features a unique C-terminal FIST domain, which is involved in substrate recruitment. This domain is composed of three structural repeats, each consisting of a central four-stranded beta-sheet flanked by two alpha-helices and a beta-hairpin loop. These repeats form a compact globular fold with pseudo three-fold symmetry. The FIST-3 repeat has a longer beta-hairpin loop that is critical for recognizing the BACH1 BTB domain dimer (Cao2024Distinct).

The interaction between FBXO22 and its substrates involves a combination of polar and hydrophobic interactions, with specific amino acids contributing to the stability of these complexes (Cao2024Distinct). FBXO22 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
FBXO22 is an F-box protein that functions as a substrate recognition subunit within the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells (Nie2024Recruitment). FBXO22 is involved in the degradation of several nuclear proteins, including the proapoptotic transcription factor BACH1, the cell cycle inhibitor p57 Kip2, and the nuclear fraction of the tumor suppressor PTEN, indicating its role in regulating apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and tumor suppression (Nie2024Recruitment).

FBXO22 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cellular homeostasis and organismal development. It plays a significant role in the ubiquitination and degradation of CD147, a process important for reversing cisplatin resistance in tumor cells (Wu2017FBox). The protein's activity is dependent on specific interactions, such as the reversible covalent interaction with Cys326 in the FIST_C domain, which is crucial for the formation of ternary complexes with substrates like NSD2 (Nie2024Recruitment). FBXO22's ability to mediate the degradation of nuclear proteins highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Nie2024Recruitment).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO22 has been implicated in the progression of various cancers due to its role in protein ubiquitination and degradation. In glioblastoma, high expression of FBXO22 correlates with worse pathological features and shorter survival, as it promotes cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis by mediating the degradation of VHL, leading to increased HIF-1α and VEGFA expression (Shen2024FBXO22). In lung cancer, FBXO22 interacts with the tumor suppressor LKB1, promoting its polyubiquitination and inhibiting its kinase activity, which enhances cancer cell growth by disrupting the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway (Zhu2019FBXO22).

In breast cancer, particularly invasive lobular carcinoma, the absence of FBXO22 expression is associated with resistance to endocrine therapy and poorer prognosis in patients treated with selective estrogen receptor modulators (Nakagawa2024Potential). In cervical cancer, FBXO22 promotes tumor progression by targeting the tumor suppressor protein p57 Kip2 for degradation, correlating with worse overall and disease-free survival (Lin2022Fbxo22). Additionally, FBXO22 is upregulated in epithelial ovarian cancers, where it promotes growth and metastasis, potentially through the MAPK/ERK pathway (Li2021FBXO22). These findings suggest that FBXO22 could serve as a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
FBXO22, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression. It is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with SKP1 through its F-box domain, a crucial interaction for its function in promoting ubiquitination processes (Ge2020FBXO22). FBXO22 targets several proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, including p21, p53, and MDM2, which are involved in cellular senescence and cancer metastasis (Zhang2019FBXO22; Chen2022PanCancer). In hepatocellular carcinoma, FBXO22 mediates the ubiquitination of p21, leading to its degradation and affecting cell cycle regulation (Zhang2019FBXO22).

FBXO22 also interacts with nuclear PTEN, targeting it for degradation, which is significant in tumorigenesis, particularly in colon cancer (Ge2020FBXO22). In cervical cancer, FBXO22 interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 Kip2, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby facilitating tumor progression (Lin2022Fbxo22). These interactions highlight FBXO22's role in regulating protein stability and its impact on cancer development through various pathways.
