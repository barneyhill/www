# BRI3BP

## Overview
BRI3BP, or BRI3 binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of K-Ras4B membrane localization and signaling. The BRI3 binding protein is categorized as a Ras prenyl recognition protein, which selectively interacts with K-Ras4B and K-Ras4A, but not with H-Ras, playing a crucial role in the proper localization and function of K-Ras4B in cellular signaling pathways (McCabe2021Brain). This protein is essential for the activation of downstream effectors involved in cellular transformation and oncogenicity, making it a potential target for cancer therapies (McCabe2021Brain). Additionally, BRI3BP is implicated in viral replication processes and drug-induced apoptosis, highlighting its broader significance in cellular biology and clinical applications (Sourisseau2022Integrated; Yamazaki2007Augmentation).

## Function
BRI3BP (BRI3 binding protein) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of K-Ras4B membrane localization and signaling. It is identified as a novel binding partner for Ras proteins, specifically interacting with K-Ras4B and K-Ras4A, but not with H-Ras. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of K-Ras4B to the plasma membrane, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways (McCabe2021Brain). BRI3BP operates within the recycling endosomal compartment, facilitating the trafficking of K-Ras4B to the plasma membrane through interactions with the prenylated hypervariable region and the polybasic domain of K-Ras4B (McCabe2021Brain).

The protein's function is linked to its ability to regulate the membrane association of K-Ras, which is necessary for the activation of downstream effectors and signaling pathways involved in cellular transformation and oncogenicity (McCabe2021Brain). BRI3BP's role in K-Ras signaling is further supported by its identification as a genetic dependency in certain cancer cell lines, highlighting its potential as a target for therapies aimed at blocking oncogenic K-Ras without affecting H-Ras (McCabe2021Brain).

## Clinical Significance
BRI3BP has been implicated in the regulation of oncogenic signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with K-Ras4B, a protein involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Alterations in BRI3BP expression can affect the membrane localization and signaling of K-Ras4B, which is crucial for its oncogenic activity. The reduction of BRI3BP function has been shown to decrease the transforming activity of oncogenic K-RasV12, suggesting that BRI3BP is necessary for the full oncogenic potential of K-Ras4B (McCabe2021Brain). This indicates that dysregulation of BRI3BP may contribute to cancer progression, particularly in cancers where K-Ras mutations are prevalent, such as pancreatic, lung, and colon cancers (McCabe2021Brain).

BRI3BP also plays a role in drug-induced apoptosis, particularly in the context of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and chemotherapy. Overexpression of BRI3BP enhances apoptosis in response to ER stressors and chemotherapy drugs like etoposide, while its depletion reduces apoptosis. This suggests that BRI3BP may influence the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic treatments by modulating apoptosis pathways (Yamazaki2007Augmentation). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of BRI3BP in cancer treatment strategies and its role in mediating cell fate decisions under stress conditions.

## Interactions
BRI3BP (BRI3 binding protein) is known to interact with K-Ras4B and K-Ras4A, but not with H-Ras, indicating a selective interaction pattern. This interaction is dependent on the prenylation of K-Ras4B and is independent of its nucleotide state, binding equally to both GDP- and GTP-bound forms. BRI3BP shows a preference for K-Ras4B over H-Ras, attributed to the polybasic region in the hypervariable region of K-Ras4B, as mutations in these residues abolish binding. BRI3BP is suggested to function as a Ras prenyl recognition protein, regulating K-Ras4B membrane localization and is required for the transforming activity of oncogenic K-RasV12 in NIH3T3 cells (McCabe2021Brain).

BRI3BP also interacts with the FORCP protein, which plays a role in ER biology. This interaction was validated through co-transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a potential inhibitory interaction during ER stress (Li2020A). Additionally, BRI3BP has been identified as a dependency factor for the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), where its silencing negatively affects viral release, indicating its role in viral replication processes (Sourisseau2022Integrated).
