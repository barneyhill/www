# SYNGR3

## Overview
The SYNGR3 gene encodes the protein synaptogyrin 3, a synaptic vesicle protein that plays a critical role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. Synaptogyrin 3 is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its M-shaped topology, positioning the N- and C-terminal tails on the cytoplasmic side of the synaptic vesicle membrane (Kedra1998Characterization; Li2022Transcriptional). This protein is primarily involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and is essential for maintaining efficient synaptic transmission and plasticity. Synaptogyrin 3 interacts with various proteins, including the dopamine transporter and Tau, influencing dopaminergic transmission and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (McInnes2018Synaptogyrin3; Li2022Transcriptional). The gene's expression and function have significant implications for neurological health, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions involving synaptic dysfunction (LargoBarrientos2021Lowering).

## Structure
Synaptogyrin 3 (SYNGR3) is a synaptic vesicle protein characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its M-shaped topology. This structure positions the N- and C-terminal tails on the cytoplasmic side of the synaptic vesicle membrane (Kedra1998Characterization; Li2022Transcriptional). The protein is composed of 239 amino acids and is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, crucial for neurotransmitter delivery at neural synapses (Li2022Transcriptional).

The central portion of SYNGR3 is strongly conserved among synaptogyrin family members, encoded by exons 3 and 4, and corresponds to amino acid residues 34-161 in SYNGR1a (Kedra1998Characterization). The C-terminal end of SYNGR3 is variable, which likely conveys functional specificity (Kedra1998Characterization). The N-terminal domain of SYNGR3 is sufficient to interact with the dopamine transporter (DAT), although the function of the unstructured C-terminal remains unclear (Li2022Transcriptional).

SYNGR3 is known to interact with synaptophysin (SYP), a synaptic vesicle protein, as demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation and Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assays (Felkl2008Interaction). These interactions suggest a role in membrane trafficking and synaptic function.

## Function
Synaptogyrin-3 (SYNGR3) is a synaptic vesicular membrane protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, playing a crucial role in maintaining synaptic function and neural communication in healthy human cells (Li2022Transcriptional). It is particularly abundant in the brain and is one of four homologues in the synaptogyrin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains with cytoplasmic-exposed N-and C-terminal tails (Li2022Transcriptional). SYNGR3 is located on the vesicular membrane and interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) to facilitate dopamine uptake and synaptic dopamine turnover, which is essential for dopaminergic transmission (Li2022Transcriptional). This interaction is significant for maintaining normal dopaminergic function, as the N-terminal of the SYNGR3 protein is sufficient to interact with DAT (Li2022Transcriptional).

In addition to its role in dopamine regulation, SYNGR3 is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, which is vital for the delivery of neurotransmitters to the neural synapse (Li2022Transcriptional). The protein's activity is primarily located in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, contributing to efficient synaptic transmission and overall synaptic plasticity (Li2022Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SYNGR3 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), SYNGR3 is involved in the interaction with the Tau protein, which is known to mislocalize to presynaptic terminals and impair synaptic function. This interaction leads to synaptic vesicle mobility issues and reduced neurotransmitter release, contributing to synaptic dysfunction observed in AD (McInnes2018Synaptogyrin3; LargoBarrientos2021Lowering). Lowering SYNGR3 expression has been shown to rescue synaptic plasticity defects and memory decline in models of Tauopathy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (LargoBarrientos2021Lowering).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), decreased levels of SYNGR3 expression have been observed in the substantia nigra, which may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and dopaminergic transmission deficits (Li2022Transcriptional). SYNGR3 also interacts with the dopamine transporter, facilitating dopamine uptake and turnover, which is crucial for normal dopaminergic function (Li2022Transcriptional).

SYNGR3 has also been linked to cocaine use disorder, where it plays a role in enhancing dopamine function and preventing addiction-like behaviors, indicating its broader significance in dopamine-related conditions (Peck2024Synaptogyrin3).

## Interactions
Synaptogyrin-3 (SYNGR3) is a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in synaptic function. One of its key interactions is with Tau, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. SYNGR3 acts as a binding partner for Tau on synaptic vesicles, facilitating Tau's association with these vesicles and contributing to presynaptic dysfunction by impairing synaptic vesicle mobility and neurotransmitter release (McInnes2018Synaptogyrin3).

SYNGR3 also interacts with Synapsin 2a (Syn2a), a presynaptic vesicle-related protein. This interaction is significant in regulating fear extinction in mice. Syn2a binds to SYNGR3 via its H domain, which is essential for presynaptic inhibitory function. This interaction affects the anchoring of synaptic vesicles, influencing their release and playing a role in the excitation/inhibition balance within neural circuits (Shen2024The).

These interactions highlight SYNGR3's role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and its potential involvement in neurological conditions, making it a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating synaptic dysfunction in diseases like Alzheimer's and conditions involving impaired fear extinction (Shen2024The; McInnes2018Synaptogyrin3).
