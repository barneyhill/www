# CYB5B

## Overview
CYB5B is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome b5 type B, a membrane-bound hemoprotein involved in electron transfer processes. This protein is categorized as a cytochrome, which plays a critical role in various biochemical pathways, including fatty acid desaturation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. Cytochrome b5 type B is primarily located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates essential enzymatic reactions for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Murphy2010Constitutively). The protein's structure, characterized by a heme-binding core and a C-terminal hydrophobic region for membrane anchoring, enables its function as an electron transfer agent (Deng2011Structural). CYB5B's expression and activity are influenced by nutritional states, and its overexpression has been linked to certain cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Murphy2010Constitutively; Ding2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
Cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B) is a membrane-bound hemoprotein involved in electron transfer processes. The primary structure of CYB5B consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the heme-binding core composed of two helix-loop-helix motifs where the heme is sandwiched by two histidine residues (Deng2011Structural). The tertiary structure is a compact, globular form stabilized by heme binding, with the heme positioned between two helix-loop-helix motifs (Deng2011Structural). 

CYB5B is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the synthesis of androgens (Deng2011Structural). The protein contains a C-terminal hydrophobic region for membrane anchoring, which is a common feature among cytochrome b5 isoforms (Deng2011Structural). 

Post-translational modifications of CYB5B may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's structure allows it to function effectively as an electron transfer agent, maintaining its role in various biochemical pathways (Deng2011Structural).

## Function
Cytochrome b5 type B (CYB5B) is a membrane-bound hemoprotein involved in electron transfer processes essential for various cellular functions. It plays a crucial role in fatty acid desaturation and elongation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. CYB5B is primarily located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates enzymatic reactions necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Murphy2010Constitutively).

In healthy human cells, CYB5B is not typically expressed on the plasma membrane of normal lymphocytes or bone marrow precursor cells, indicating its primary activity is intracellular (Murphy2010Constitutively). The protein's involvement in electron transfer is critical for the reduction of various substrates, including cytoglobins, which are important for redox signaling reactions such as nitric oxide dioxygenation and nitrite reduction (Amdahl2019The). These processes are vital for cellular functions, including energy metabolism and lipid synthesis, linking CYB5B to broader metabolic pathways (Jakobs2014The).

CYB5B's activity is regulated by nutritional states, with fasting and high-fat diets influencing its expression and function, which may have implications for drug metabolism and energy metabolism in vivo (Jakobs2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CYB5B gene have been associated with certain types of lymphomas, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). CYB5B is overexpressed in these lymphomas, with the highest expression observed in the anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) line DEL. This overexpression is not due to gene amplification in all cases, suggesting alternative mechanisms may be responsible (Murphy2010Constitutively). The protein is expressed on the plasma membrane of lymphoma cells but not on normal lymphocytes or bone marrow precursor cells, indicating its potential as a target for antibody-based therapies (Murphy2010Constitutively).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CYB5B is also overexpressed, and high levels of its expression are associated with lower survival rates. This suggests that CYB5B expression may impact the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patients (Ding2022Comprehensive). 

While the context does not provide specific diseases directly caused by mutations in CYB5B, its altered expression and interactions in these cancers highlight its clinical significance. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of CYB5B alterations in these and potentially other conditions.

## Interactions
CYB5B, or cytochrome b5 type B, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in electron transfer processes. It interacts with cytochrome P450 enzymes, forming complexes that are either enthalpy-driven or entropy-driven. Enthalpy-driven complexes involve electrostatic interactions, salt bridges, and hydrogen bonds, as seen in interactions with microsomal CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP17A1 (Yablokov2017Thermodynamics). These interactions are crucial for the functioning of the P450 monooxygenase system, influencing protein clustering and activity regulation (Yablokov2017Thermodynamics).

CYB5B also interacts with cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R), playing a role in the reduction of cytoglobins in zebrafish, which is a process conserved across vertebrate evolution. This interaction is essential for maintaining the reduced state of cytoglobins, supporting their roles in redox signaling reactions (Amdahl2019The). In zebrafish, CYB5B shows efficient reduction of cytoglobins, particularly Cygb2, outperforming the human CYB5/CYB5R system (Amdahl2019The).

In the context of cancer, CYB5B is overexpressed in Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, where it is found at the plasma membrane of neoplastic cells, suggesting potential interactions that could be targeted for therapy (Murphy2010Constitutively).
