# ANKEF1

## Overview
The ANKEF1 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and EF-hand domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat and EF-hand motifs. These structural features suggest that the protein may play a role in protein-protein interactions and calcium binding, respectively. While the specific biological functions of ANKEF1 are not fully elucidated, proteins with similar domains are often involved in cellular signaling pathways and structural organization within the cell. The ankyrin repeat is a common protein motif known for mediating protein-protein interactions, while the EF-hand domain is a helix-loop-helix structural domain capable of binding calcium ions, which is crucial for various cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of ANKEF1 in cellular physiology and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
