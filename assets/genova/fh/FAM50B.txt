# FAM50B

## Overview
FAM50B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 50 member B. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and gene expression. FAM50B is characterized by its role in imprinting and exhibits monoallelic methylation patterns, which are crucial for placental function and development (Yuen2011Genomewide). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as congenital hypothyroidism, where it undergoes significant epigenetic mutations (Gentilini2022Stochastic). Additionally, FAM50B is recognized for its involvement in cancer biology, particularly in glioblastoma, where it serves as a prognostic marker due to its influence on alternative splicing events (Qiu2020Transcriptome). These diverse roles underscore the gene's importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FAM50B has been implicated in several clinical conditions through its role in epigenetic regulation and gene expression. In the context of congenital hypothyroidism (CH), FAM50B has been identified as having significant epigenetic mutations, specifically hypo-methylation, which may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis. This hypo-methylation has been observed in cases of CH, suggesting a potential association with the condition through epigenetic alterations (Gentilini2022Stochastic). 

FAM50B is also involved in imprinting, with studies indicating that it exhibits monoallelic methylation patterns with maternal origin. This pattern is consistent with its classification as a primary maternal differentially methylated region (DMR), which may have implications for placental function and development (Yuen2011Genomewide).

In cancer research, FAM50B has been identified as a significant factor in glioblastoma prognosis. It is considered a prognostic marker due to its involvement in alternative splicing events that correlate with survival outcomes in glioblastoma patients (Qiu2020Transcriptome). These findings highlight the gene's potential role in oncogenesis and its utility as a biomarker for cancer prognosis.
