# CLIP2

## Overview
The CLIP2 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2, a cytoplasmic protein that plays a pivotal role in microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, primarily involved in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating their polymerization, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Vandeweyer2012The). CLIP2 is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate microtubule dynamics, contributing to nervous system development and function (Larti2014A). Beyond its structural role, CLIP2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and chromosomal stability, and has been identified as a potential marker for radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma (Selmansberger2020Transcriptome). Its clinical significance is further underscored by its association with Williams-Beuren syndrome, although its haploinsufficiency alone may not be critical to the syndrome's pathology (Vandeweyer2012The).

## Function
The CLIP2 gene encodes the CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2, which plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics. CLIP2 is involved in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating intracellular transport by localizing to the plus ends of growing microtubules. This localization is crucial for the regulation of microtubule polymerization, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Vandeweyer2012The). CLIP2 interacts with other proteins, such as CLIP-170, to regulate microtubule dynamics, particularly in neurons, where it is involved in nervous system development and function (Larti2014A).

In healthy human cells, CLIP2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at microtubule plus-ends, where it may participate in dynein-mediated transport. It potentially acts as a cargo-loading site for cytoplasmic dynein, competing with other proteins like CLIP-170 and dynactin for binding to microtubule plus ends (Hoogenraad2004LIMK1). This competition is due to similar microtubule-binding motifs among these proteins, which might affect dynein motor regulation. CLIP2's role in microtubule dynamics is crucial for processes such as cell division, migration, and signaling, contributing to the overall maintenance of cellular and organismal health (Hoogenraad2004LIMK1).

## Clinical Significance
CLIP2 haploinsufficiency is associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, and cardiac defects. Although CLIP2 was initially thought to contribute significantly to the clinical manifestations of WBS, recent studies suggest that its haploinsufficiency alone may not be critical to the syndrome's pathology. Evidence from animal studies indicates that mice heterozygous for Clip2 exhibit phenotypic traits similar to WBS, such as mild structural brain abnormalities and growth retardation. However, studies of atypical deletions in patients have provided mixed evidence regarding the role of CLIP2 in WBS. Some families with deletions in the WBS region showed affected CLIP2 expression but did not exhibit the typical WBS cognitive profile, suggesting that while CLIP2 might contribute to some general aspects of WBS, the hemizygosity of other genes like GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 is necessary for the full phenotype (Vandeweyer2012The).

In some cases, individuals with a pure deletion of the CLIP2 gene did not display any clinical features associated with WBS, nor did they show the typical Williams syndrome cognitive profile, indicating that CLIP2 haploinsufficiency alone does not lead to the full spectrum of WBS symptoms (Vandeweyer2012The).

## Interactions
CLIP2, also known as CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CLIP2 has been identified as a potential marker for radiation-induced papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and is involved in biological processes such as DNA repair, chromosomal instability, and the promotion of proliferation and metastasis (Selmansberger2020Transcriptome). 

In the context of PTC, CLIP2 interacts with several genes associated with DNA repair and maintenance, including GADD45A, COPS2, AURKAIP1, and ANKRD52. GADD45A is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, while COPS2 is part of the COP9 signalosome complex, playing a role in DNA double-strand repair and apoptosis suppression (Selmansberger2020Transcriptome). 

The study by Selmansberger et al. also confirmed Peptidylprolyl Isomerase Like 3 (PPIL3) as a potential direct interaction partner of CLIP2 through co-expression at the transcript and protein levels (Selmansberger2020Transcriptome). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated co-expression of CLIP2 and PPIL3 proteins in tumor sections from PTC patients, suggesting a possible radiation-associated role for PPIL3 in conjunction with CLIP2 (Selmansberger2020Transcriptome).
