# ESF1

## Overview
ESF1 is a gene that encodes the ESF1 nucleolar pre-rRNA processing protein homolog, a crucial component in ribosome biogenesis. This protein is primarily involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, facilitating the maturation of rRNA precursors necessary for the assembly of functional ribosomes. ESF1 is associated with the early stages of pre-rRNA processing, particularly in the formation of pre-40S ribosomal particles, and plays a significant role in maintaining nucleolar architecture (Deryabin2024Human). The protein's interactions with other ribosomal RNA processing proteins and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) underscore its importance in the structural conformation and processing of pre-rRNA (Zhang2016Stepwise). Alterations in ESF1 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, where it is implicated in tumor cell proliferation and patient prognosis (Yu2024ESF1).

## Function
ESF1 is a nucleolar protein involved in the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis in human cells. It is associated with the early stages of pre-rRNA processing, particularly in the formation of pre-40S ribosomal particles. ESF1 assists in the conformational changes necessary for the cleavage of pre-rRNA, facilitating the proper maturation of rRNA precursors (Deryabin2024Human). In HEK293 cells, ESF1 knockdown leads to the accumulation of the 30S rRNA precursor, indicating its involvement in the cleavage of pre-rRNA at the A0 site within the 5′ ETS, although it does not significantly inhibit processing at the E site (Deryabin2024Human).

ESF1 is also involved in maintaining nucleolar architecture and the proper localization of nucleolar proteins. Its deficiency can induce nucleolar stress, leading to the translocation of nucleophosmin (NPM1) from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, although the overall nucleolar morphology remains unchanged (Deryabin2024Human). Despite its critical role in ribosome assembly, ESF1 knockdown does not completely disrupt translation activity, suggesting that while it is essential for ribosome biogenesis, other factors can compensate for its absence to maintain protein synthesis (Deryabin2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ESF1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, ESF1 is significantly upregulated, promoting tumor cell proliferation and negatively impacting patient prognosis. Knockdown of ESF1 in breast cancer cells results in decreased cell proliferation, reduced colony formation, and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer cell growth (Yu2024ESF1). ESF1 is also associated with luminal breast cancer, where its expression correlates with worse overall survival but may predict a better response to certain immunotherapies (Yu2024De).

In melanoma-prone patients, ESF1 has been identified as part of a rare germline copy number variation, suggesting a potential role in early disease onset (Fidalgo2016Role). Additionally, ESF1 has been mentioned in the context of anorexia nervosa, where novel variants were identified in a study involving affected individuals, although the specific impact of these variants remains unclear (Watson2021Genetics).

Overall, the dysregulation of ESF1 expression and its genetic alterations are linked to various pathological conditions, primarily through its role in cell proliferation and survival.

## Interactions
ESF1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids within the nucleolus. It is associated with the pre-40S ribosomal subunit, as demonstrated by its co-sedimentation with this subunit in sucrose gradient centrifugation experiments (Deryabin2024Human). ESF1 knockdown studies in human cells have shown that it plays a role in pre-rRNA processing, particularly affecting the cleavage at the A0 site within the 5′ ETS, leading to the accumulation of the 30S rRNA precursor (Deryabin2024Human).

In yeast, ESF1 is recruited to the 5′ domain of the 18S rRNA during the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, indicating its involvement in the early stages of ribosome assembly (Zhang2016Stepwise). The protein is part of a complex network of interactions, including associations with other ribosomal RNA processing proteins and snoRNAs, which are crucial for the maturation of the small ribosomal subunit (Zhang2016Stepwise). These interactions suggest that ESF1 is a key component in the structural conformation and processing of pre-rRNA, facilitating the proper assembly and function of ribosomes.
