# SUMO1

## Overview
SUMO1 is a gene that encodes the protein small ubiquitin-like modifier 1, which is a member of the ubiquitin-like protein family. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation, which is critical for regulating various cellular functions, including nuclear transport, transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. SUMO1 is characterized by its ubiquitin-like fold and ability to form isopeptide bonds with target proteins, thereby influencing their stability, localization, and activity (Zhao2007Sumoylation; Bayer1998Structure). The protein's structure includes a flexible N-terminal extension that facilitates specific protein-protein interactions, distinguishing it from ubiquitin (Bayer1998Structure). SUMO1 plays a vital role in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various congenital heart defects and other pathologies (Wang2023ParalogueSpecific; Wang2011Defective).

## Structure
The SUMO1 protein, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, is composed of approximately 101 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a sequence that allows for post-translational modifications, such as the formation of isopeptide bonds with target proteins, influencing their function and stability (Bayer1998Structure).

The secondary structure of SUMO1 is characterized by a combination of alpha-helices and beta-strands. It features a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet with mostly antiparallel strands, except for the connection between the first and fifth strands. The beta-strands are identified as follows: b1 from Tyr21 to Gly28, b2 from Ser32 to Lys39, b3 from Leu62 to Phe66, b4 from Gln69 to Ile71, and b5 from Glu85 to Gln92. The alpha-helices are located between Leu44 to Gln55 and Thr76 to Leu80 (Bayer1998Structure).

The tertiary structure of SUMO1 adopts a ubiquitin-like fold, with a root mean square separation value of 2.1 Å compared to ubiquitin, indicating a close structural resemblance despite only 18% sequence identity. A unique feature of SUMO1 is its flexible N-terminal extension, which is absent in ubiquitin and may facilitate specific protein-protein interactions (Bayer1998Structure).

SUMO1 can form quaternary structures through interactions with other proteins, such as the conjugation to thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which influences DNA repair processes (Baba2005Crystal).

## Function
SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in post-translational modification through a process known as SUMOylation. This modification affects various molecular processes by altering protein stability, localization, and activity. SUMO1 is involved in regulating nuclear transport, transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression, thereby maintaining genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis (Zhao2007Sumoylation).

In healthy human cells, SUMO1 is crucial for protein quality control (PQC). It promotes the solubility of misfolded proteins, preventing their aggregation and facilitating their recognition by cellular PQC machineries. This function is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing deleterious cellular outcomes (Wang2023ParalogueSpecific). SUMO1 also enhances the stability and abundance of certain proteins, such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is important for cellular function and disease prevention (Wang2023ParalogueSpecific).

SUMO1's activity is not limited to the nucleus; it also plays a role in cytosolic PQC by promoting the solubility and degradation of unstable cytosolic proteins, independently of other pathways (Wang2023ParalogueSpecific). This highlights its versatile role in different cellular compartments.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SUMO1 gene have been linked to several congenital heart defects (CHDs), including atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Studies have shown that both heterozygous and homozygous SUMO1 knockout mice exhibit these defects, which can be rescued by cardiac reexpression of the SUMO1 transgene, indicating the critical role of SUMO1 in cardiac development (Wang2011Defective). 

In humans, mutations in the promoter region of the SUMO1 gene, such as an A-1239G transition and a 16-base substitution, have been identified in patients with ASDs and cleft lip, suggesting that these genetic changes can decrease SUMO1 promoter activity and contribute to abnormal heart and craniofacial development (Wang2011Defective). 

The balance of SUMO1-mediated sumoylation is crucial for normal cardiac morphogenesis, as it regulates key transcription factors like Nkx2.5, GATA4, and SRF, which are essential for heart development. Disruption in this balance, whether due to genetic mutations or environmental factors, can lead to structural cardiac malformations (Wang2011Defective). 

SUMO1 also plays a role in cardiac stress adaptation, with enhanced SUMOylation providing protective effects against cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Mendler2016The).

## Interactions
SUMO1 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 1) is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. The intrinsically disordered N-terminus of SUMO1 acts as an intramolecular inhibitor, affecting its interactions with SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) by occluding the SIM-binding groove. This inhibition is mediated by electrostatic interactions between acidic residues in the N-terminus and basic residues in the SIM-binding groove, influencing the binding dynamics with proteins such as USP25 and TDP2 (Richter2024The).

SUMO1 interacts transiently with specific regions of its core, including the SIM-binding groove and the 70/80 region, as shown by NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. These interactions are dynamic, allowing SUMO1 to form 'fuzzy complexes' with SIMs, which are crucial for regulating SIM-dependent interactions (Richter2024The).

SUMO1 also participates in non-covalent interactions with various proteins, as identified by studies using techniques like yeast two-hybrid systems and NMR spectroscopy. These interactions are influenced by the presence of acidic residues and potential phosphorylation sites, which affect the binding strength to SUMO1 (Hecker2006Specification).
