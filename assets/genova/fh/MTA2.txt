# MTA2

## Overview
MTA2 (metastasis associated 1 family member 2) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex. This protein is predominantly nuclear and plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, impacting various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and cellular differentiation (Kumar2016Structure; Covington2014Role). The MTA2 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a BAH (bromo-adjacent homology) domain, an ELM2 domain, a SANT domain, and an atypical GATA Zinc finger domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and DNA (Covington2014Role; Yao2003The). MTA2 is involved in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells and is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is often associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (You2021Inhibition; Zhang2021MTA2).

## Structure
The MTA2 protein is composed of 668 amino acids and shares 58% sequence identity with MTA1, with the highest homology in the N-terminal half (Brasen2017Expression; Yao2003The). The N-terminal region of MTA2 includes several domains crucial for its function: a BAH (bromo-adjacent homology) domain, an ELM2 domain, a leucine zipper, and a SANT domain (Yao2003The). These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation, with the BAH domain linked to DNA methylation and the SANT domain important for protein complex assembly (Yao2003The).

MTA2 is predominantly nuclear and forms part of the NuRD complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation (Brasen2017Expression). The MTA2-RBBP7 complex, a sub-complex of NuRD, has been structurally characterized to reveal an elongated architecture capable of hinge-like motion, suggesting a central role in the initial assembly of the NuRD complex (Brasen2017Expression). The BAH domains of MTA2 protrude from the middle of the complex, which may be crucial for its interaction with chromatin (Brasen2017Expression).

MTA2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Multiple splice variants of MTA2 exist, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions.

## Function
MTA2 (metastasis associated 1 family member 2) is a critical component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. MTA2 is involved in modulating gene expression by influencing chromatin structure, thereby impacting various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and cellular differentiation (Kumar2016Structure; Covington2014Role).

In healthy human cells, MTA2 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate transcription. It contains several conserved domains, including a bromoadjacent homology (BAH) domain, an ELM2 domain, a SANT domain, and an atypical GATA Zinc finger domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and DNA binding (Kumar2016Structure; Covington2014Role). These interactions are crucial for the stability and function of the NuRD complex, directing histone deacetylase activity to specific target molecules (Covington2014Role).

MTA2 also plays a role in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Knockdown of MTA2 in hESCs leads to decreased expression of pluripotency markers and increased differentiation into endodermal and mesodermal lineages, indicating its role in preventing spontaneous differentiation (You2021Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the MTA2 gene are linked to various cancers, often correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MTA2 is highly expressed and associated with malignant phenotypes. Its high expression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival, making it a marker for HCC progression. MTA2 enhances cancer stemness by upregulating stem cell markers and forming a complex with HDAC2 and CHD4, which is linked to HCC stemness (Zhang2021MTA2).

In pancreatic cancer, MTA2 is overexpressed and contributes to aggressive phenotypes. It is involved in a reciprocal loop with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion by suppressing E-cadherin transcription. This interaction is crucial for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is associated with cancer metastasis (Zhu2018Reciprocal; Zeng2019LncRNAMTA2TR).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MTA2 is overexpressed and associated with lower survival rates. It plays a role in tumor metastasis and progression, particularly in the EMT process. The long noncoding RNA SNHG5 can trap MTA2 in the cytosol, reducing its expression and promoting its degradation, thereby suppressing EMT (Wei2020SNHG5).

## Interactions
MTA2 is a component of the NuRD complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with several proteins, including histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and histone chaperones RBBP4 and RBBP7, forming a core complex that associates with other proteins like MBD2/3, p66α/β, and CHD3/4 to constitute the full NuRD complex (Brasen2017Expression). MTA2 binds to the histone H3 tail, with its C-terminal region identified as a novel H3 binding domain (Wu2013The). This interaction is crucial for the NuRD complex's ability to bind the H3 tail in vitro, although the complex can associate with chromatin independently of MTA2's H3 binding activity (Wu2013The).

MTA2 also forms a stable complex with RBBP7, with a stoichiometry of 2:4, and this interaction is characterized using techniques like size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy (Brasen2017Expression). The MTA2-RBBP7 complex can be formed independently of other NuRD components, suggesting a central role in the assembly of the NuRD complex (Brasen2017Expression). MTA2's interactions with other proteins in the NuRD complex are crucial for its function, although specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context.
