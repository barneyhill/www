# OR2M7

## Overview
The OR2M7 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily M member 7, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The OR2M7 protein is specifically responsible for recognizing and transducing odorant signals, contributing to the sense of smell. Variations in the OR2M7 gene have been associated with differences in olfactory perception, such as the ability to detect certain odors, and have been implicated in conditions like extreme obesity, potentially through their influence on olfactory-driven behaviors (Mariman2015Olfactory; Ignatieva2014Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2M7 gene has been implicated in several conditions related to its role in olfactory perception. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of the OR2M7 gene, rs4481887, is associated with the ability to detect the odor of asparagus in urine. Individuals with the A allele of this SNP have a greater ability to detect this odor compared to those with the G allele. This genetic variation shows racial differences in allele frequency, with a minor allele frequency of 0.35 in Caucasian subjects and no variation observed in subjects of African descent. The nucleotide substitution at this position may alter transcription factor binding, potentially affecting OR2M7 gene expression levels (Ignatieva2014Genetic).

The OR2M7 gene is also linked to extreme obesity. Damaging missense variants in OR genes, including OR2M7, are more frequently found in extremely obese individuals, particularly when combined with variants in protocadherin (PCDH) genes. This suggests a synergistic effect on obesity risk, potentially influencing food selection and intake through altered olfactory perception (Mariman2015Olfactory). However, the specific clinical significance of OR2M7 gene expression alterations in obesity is not directly addressed (Mariman2015Olfactory).
