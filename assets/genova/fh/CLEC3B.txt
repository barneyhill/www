# CLEC3B

## Overview
CLEC3B is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 3 member B, commonly referred to as Tetranectin. This protein is a member of the C-type lectin family, characterized by its carbohydrate-recognition domain, and is primarily involved in immune response and tissue remodeling. Tetranectin is a trimeric Ca2+-binding protein found in the plasma and extracellular matrix, where it plays a crucial role in processes such as fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and osteogenesis. It interacts with plasminogen and other extracellular matrix components to facilitate these biological functions. The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including neuroprotection and bone mineralization, underscores its importance in maintaining tissue integrity and function. Additionally, CLEC3B has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for certain cancers (Tanisawa2016Exomewide; Guo2021CLEC3B; Sun2020CLEC3B).

## Structure
CLEC3B, also known as Tetranectin, is a protein that forms a disulfide-linked trimer with an approximate molecular weight of 26 kDa (Guo2021CLEC3B). It belongs to the C-type lectin domain family, characterized by a carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), which is typical for proteins involved in immune response and tissue remodeling (Guo2021CLEC3B). The protein's quaternary structure is a homotrimer, indicating that it consists of three identical subunits linked by disulfide bonds (Guo2021CLEC3B).

The secondary and tertiary structures of CLEC3B have been predicted, although specific details are not provided in the available context (Guo2021CLEC3B). The protein's ability to form a trimer and its involvement in various biological processes suggest that it may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which is common in lectins (Guo2021CLEC3B). These structural features contribute to its function as a cell surface receptor involved in infection, inflammation, and tumor immunity (Guo2021CLEC3B). The specific binding interactions of CLEC3B with aptamers, such as Apt-5, highlight its potential as a biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis (Guo2021CLEC3B).

## Function
The CLEC3B gene encodes tetranectin, a trimeric Ca2+-binding protein that is part of the C-type lectin family. Tetranectin is primarily located in the plasma and extracellular matrix, where it plays a significant role in various biological processes. It binds to plasminogen kringle 4, sulfated polysaccharides, and extracellular matrix proteins, facilitating plasminogen activation in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator. This interaction enhances fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling, which are crucial for processes such as tissue degradation and extracellular proteolysis (Tanisawa2016Exomewide).

Tetranectin is also involved in the mineralization process during osteogenesis, contributing to bone formation and repair. Animal studies have indicated that a deficiency in tetranectin can lead to delayed fracture healing due to impaired soft tissue and callus formation (Tanisawa2016Exomewide). In healthy human cells, CLEC3B is implicated in neuroprotection and is associated with the mineralization process, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cellular and tissue function (Xie2021CLEC3B). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of tissues in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
CLEC3B, also known as Tetranectin, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), decreased expression of CLEC3B is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and progression-free survival. This downregulation is linked to increased cell proliferation and decreased immune activation, suggesting a role in cancer progression through immune-related mechanisms (Sun2020CLEC3B).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CLEC3B is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor survival rates and increased tumor progression. Its low expression is associated with enhanced migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of tumor cells, mediated through AMPK and VEGF signaling pathways. This suggests that CLEC3B may function as a tumor suppressor by modulating immune interactions and inhibiting metastasis (Xie2021CLEC3B; Dai2019Downregulation).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CLEC3B is secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion. High levels of CLEC3B in the tumor stroma are linked to poor survival outcomes, indicating its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Zhu2019Cancer-associated). These findings highlight CLEC3B's potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
CLEC3B, also known as Tetranectin, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It has been identified as a target for the nucleic acid aptamer Apt-5, which binds with high affinity to CLEC3B, as demonstrated by a dissociation constant (Kd) of 23.9 ± 5.5 nM. This interaction is specific, as confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which showed a shift in electrophoretic mobility when CLEC3B was bound to Apt-5 (Guo2021CLEC3B).

CLEC3B also interacts with the kringle 4 domain of plasminogen, playing a role in plasminogen activation, which is crucial for fibrinolysis and tissue remodeling (Maguire2020Comparative). In colorectal cancer, CLEC3B secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts enhances cell migration and actin remodeling, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Zhu2019Cancer-associated).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CLEC3B is involved in regulating angiogenesis and metastasis through its influence on the AMPK signaling pathway and VEGF expression. It is associated with exosomes and affects the expression of proteins related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as E-cadherin and ZO-1 (Dai2019Downregulation).
