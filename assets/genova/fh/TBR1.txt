# TBR1

## Overview
TBR1 is a gene that encodes the T-box brain transcription factor 1, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development of the cerebral neocortex. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its involvement in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. TBR1 is crucial for the regional and laminar identity of postmitotic neurons, particularly influencing the differentiation and identity of neurons in the frontal cortex and layer 6 cell fates (Sollis2022Characterization; Bedogni2010Tbr1). The protein is highly expressed in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and deep cerebellar nuclei, where it controls neuronal identity and differentiation (Sollis2022Characterization). TBR1 interacts with several other proteins, such as CASK and FOXP2, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes (Sollis2022Characterization; Deriziotis2014De).

## Function
The TBR1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebral neocortex by regulating the regional and laminar identity of postmitotic neurons. In healthy human cells, TBR1 functions as both an activator and repressor of transcription, influencing the differentiation and identity of neurons, particularly in the frontal cortex and layer 6 cell fates (Sollis2022Characterization; Bedogni2010Tbr1). TBR1 is highly expressed in the brain, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and deep cerebellar nuclei, where it controls neuronal identity and differentiation (Sollis2022Characterization).

At the molecular level, TBR1 binds to DNA via its T-box DNA-binding domain and can function as both an activator and repressor of transcription. It interacts with other proteins, such as CASK, FOXP1/2/4, and BCL11A, which are also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Sollis2022Characterization). TBR1 is involved in the repression of Fezf2 in layer 6 corticothalamic projection neurons, which is important for the proper formation of the corticospinal tract (Deriziotis2014De). The protein is typically localized in the nucleus, consistent with its role as a transcription factor (Deriziotis2014De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBR1 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). De novo variants in TBR1, such as frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, have been linked to intellectual disability and autistic traits. These mutations often result in protein dysfunction, with missense variants exhibiting a dominant-negative effect and premature stop codon variants leading to haploinsufficiency (Nambot2020De). 

TBR1 mutations can disrupt its interactions with other proteins, such as FOXP2 and CASK, which are involved in neural development and associated with speech and language disorders. These disruptions can lead to altered transcriptional regulation and cellular localization, contributing to the pathology of ASD (Deriziotis2014De; den2018Functional). 

In mouse models, TBR1 haploinsufficiency results in defective axonal projections and impairments in social interactions, suggesting a role in ASD-related behaviors (Notwell2016TBR1). The TBR1-K228E mutation, specifically, affects DNA-binding affinity and is associated with increased inhibitory synaptic transmission and autistic-like behaviors in mice (Yook2019A). These findings underscore the critical role of TBR1 in brain development and its impact on neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
TBR1, a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopment, engages in several critical protein-protein interactions. It interacts with the FOXP2 transcription factor, a relationship that is crucial for normal speech and language development. This interaction is mediated through the T-box domain of TBR1 and is disrupted by certain de novo mutations in TBR1 and FOXP2, which can lead to speech and language deficits (Deriziotis2014De). TBR1 also interacts with FOXP1 and FOXP4, indicating a broader role in transcriptional regulation (Deriziotis2014De).

TBR1 forms a complex with CASK, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase, which translocates CASK from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. This interaction is essential for regulating TBR1 target genes involved in neural development and synaptic function. Mutations in TBR1 can disrupt this interaction, affecting CASK's nuclear localization (Deriziotis2014De; den2018Functional).

The TBR1 interactome includes several other proteins, such as GATAD2B, BCOR, ADNP, NR2F1, and NR2F2, which are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. These interactions are often disrupted by pathogenic TBR1 variants, highlighting their importance in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes (Sollis2022Characterization).
