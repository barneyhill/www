# NFASC

## Overview
The NFASC gene encodes neurofascin, a cell adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in the nervous system. Neurofascin is characterized by multiple immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains, which contribute to its function in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The protein exists in several isoforms, including Nfasc155 and Nfasc186, each with distinct roles in the organization and function of nodes of Ranvier and paranodal junctions in myelinated axons. Nfasc155 is primarily expressed in glial cells and is essential for the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions, while Nfasc186 is expressed in neurons and is crucial for the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier. These interactions are vital for rapid nerve impulse conduction and the maintenance of axonal integrity. Mutations in the NFASC gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper nervous system function (Sherman2005Neurofascins; FaivreSarrailh2013Neuroglial; Thaxton2010In).

## Structure
Neurofascin (NFASC) is a cell adhesion molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It contains multiple immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III domains. The protein undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, including Nfasc NF155 and Nfasc NF186, which have distinct roles in the nervous system (Thaxton2010In). 

The structure of NFASC includes specific domains that are crucial for its function. The ankyrin binding domain (ABD) is located in the cytoplasmic tail of the protein and is essential for binding to Ankyrin-G (AnkG) with a dissociation constant of approximately 0.22 μM (He2022AnkGNeurofascin). The interaction between NFASC and AnkG is mediated by the FIGQY motif and involves hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, with key residues such as F1202 and F1208 playing significant roles (He2022AnkGNeurofascin).

NFASC is also characterized by the presence of immunoglobulin domains 5 and 6, which are essential for the function of the Nfasc NF155 isoform in axonal domain organization. These domains facilitate the stable association with paranodal components, such as contactin and Caspr, which are crucial for the formation and stabilization of paranodal axo-glial junctions (Thaxton2010In). The deletion of these domains results in phenotypes similar to Nfasc NF155-null mice, indicating their critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of myelinated axons (Thaxton2010In).

## Function
Neurofascin (NFASC) is a cell adhesion molecule essential for the organization and function of nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons, which are critical for rapid nerve impulse conduction. NFASC has two main isoforms, Nfasc155 and Nfasc186, each playing distinct roles in the nervous system. Nfasc155, expressed in glial cells, is crucial for forming paranodal axoglial junctions by interacting with axonal proteins such as Caspr and Contactin. These junctions act as barriers that separate nodal and juxtaparanodal domains, facilitating action potential propagation (Sherman2005Neurofascins; FaivreSarrailh2013Neuroglial).

Nfasc186, expressed in neurons, is vital for the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier, which is necessary for efficient nerve conduction. It interacts with Gliomedin, a molecule secreted by Schwann cells, through its fibronectin type III domains, to mediate this clustering (Labasque2011Fibronectin; FaivreSarrailh2013Neuroglial). The absence of these isoforms in Neurofascin-null mice results in disrupted nodal and paranodal complexes, leading to impaired nerve conduction similar to unmyelinated axons (Sherman2005Neurofascins). Neurofascin's role in maintaining the structural integrity of nodes and paranodes is crucial for healthy nerve function (FaivreSarrailh2013Neuroglial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFASC gene, which encodes the neurofascin protein, are associated with several neurological disorders. Biallelic mutations in NFASC can lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by chronic demyelinating neuropathy, central white matter loss, and atrophy of the corpus callosum and brainstem. Affected individuals may exhibit severe demyelinating and axonal neuropathy, non-specific EEG abnormalities, and loss of cerebral white matter (Efthymiou2019Biallelic). 

Specific mutations, such as the p.V1122E variant, are linked to autosomal recessive ataxia with demyelinating neuropathy. This mutation affects a conserved residue in the neurofascin transmembrane domain, leading to a significant reduction in neurofascin protein levels and impaired stability and function (Monfrini2019Neurofascin). 

Another study identified a homozygous mutation affecting the glial isoform Nfasc155, resulting in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms like hypotonia, amimia, and areflexia. This mutation disrupts the paranodal axoglial junction, crucial for nerve function (Smigiel2018Homozygous). 

NFASC mutations also contribute to early-onset cerebellar ataxia and demyelinating neuropathy, with symptoms including cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy (Monfrini2019Neurofascin). These findings underscore the critical role of NFASC in maintaining neurological function.

## Interactions
Neurofascin (NFASC) is a cell adhesion molecule that participates in several critical interactions within the nervous system. It forms a heterophilic adhesion complex with contactin 1, which is essential for the formation and maintenance of paranodal myelin-axon junctions. This interaction is mediated by the Ig1-Ig2 domains and is stabilized by mannose-rich glycans on neurofascin 155, which enhance the interaction affinity with contactin 1 (Chataigner2022Structural). The complex plays a crucial role in maintaining the narrow intercellular spacing at paranodes, which is vital for proper nerve signal transmission (Chataigner2022Structural).

NFASC also interacts with ankyrin G (AnkG) at the axon initial segment (AIS), a critical interaction for maintaining AIS integrity. AnkG binds to neurofascin through the inner groove of its ANK repeats, which is essential for the localization and function of the AIS (He2022AnkGNeurofascin). The neuronal isoform, Nfasc186, is particularly important for stabilizing the AIS by anchoring proteins such as AnkyrinG, bIV-Spectrin, and NrCAM. The loss of Nfasc186 leads to the disintegration of the AIS complex and affects neuronal function (Zonta2011A).
