# SHISA6

## Overview
SHISA6 is a gene that encodes the protein shisa family member 6, which is a type-I single-pass transmembrane protein involved in the modulation of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function in the brain. The protein is characterized by its interaction with AMPAR subunits and PDZ-domain-containing scaffold proteins, such as PSD-95, which is crucial for its role in synaptic plasticity and the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission (Klaassen2016Shisa6; Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). SHISA6 is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, where it plays a significant role in maintaining AMPARs at postsynaptic sites, thereby influencing synaptic strength and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory (Klaassen2016Shisa6). The gene has also been implicated in cognitive impairment, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Ramos2022Genetic).

## Structure
SHISA6 is a type-I single-pass transmembrane protein that is part of native AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes. It features a signal peptide, an extracellular cysteine-rich domain, a single transmembrane region, and a proline-rich intracellular region with a C-terminal type II PDZ-ligand motif (EVTV) (Klaassen2016Shisa6; Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). The protein is glycosylated, and its molecular weight is reduced from approximately 73 kDa to 59 kDa upon treatment with PNGase-F, aligning with the predicted weight for its mature form (Klaassen2016Shisa6). 

SHISA6 interacts with AMPAR subunits GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3, and with PDZ-domain-containing scaffold proteins like PSD-95 through its C-terminal EVTV domain (Klaassen2016Shisa6; Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). This interaction is crucial for its role in modulating AMPAR function and synaptic plasticity, as it helps trap AMPARs at postsynaptic sites and prevents their desensitization during synaptic activity (Klaassen2016Shisa6). The protein's subcellular distribution shows high enrichment at dendritic spines and synaptic sites, with some extrasynaptic presence (Klaassen2016Shisa6). 

The exon structure of SHISA6 includes an alternative-splice region, exon 3, which is 32 amino acids long, leading to two mature protein variants with predicted molecular weights of 58.7 and 55.3 kDa (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

## Function
The SHISA6 gene encodes a protein that functions as an auxiliary subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. SHISA6 is a single transmembrane protein that directly interacts with AMPARs, modulating their trafficking and biophysical properties. It is enriched at postsynaptic membranes and co-localizes with AMPARs, playing a crucial role in constraining their mobility and confining them to postsynaptic densities (Klaassen2016Shisa6). SHISA6 interacts with the scaffolding protein PSD-95, which helps trap AMPARs at synaptic sites and prevents their desensitization during synaptic activity. This interaction is essential for maintaining AMPARs in an activated state in the presence of glutamate, thereby preventing synaptic depression during high-frequency synaptic transmission (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

SHISA6 affects the kinetics of AMPAR-mediated currents by prolonging decay times and decreasing desensitization, which is important for synaptic plasticity and the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain (Klaassen2016Shisa6). The presence of SHISA6 reduces the mobility of GluA2-containing AMPARs in both synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, stabilizing them at synaptic sites and enhancing steady-state conductance during prolonged glutamate application (Klaassen2016Shisa6). These functions contribute to synaptic strength and plasticity, which are essential for learning and memory processes (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

## Clinical Significance
The SHISA6 gene has been implicated in cognitive impairment, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A study identified a significant association between an intronic polymorphism in the SHISA6 gene, rs146729640, and the age at onset of cognitive impairment. The 'A' allele of this polymorphism is linked to an earlier onset of cognitive impairment, acting as a risk factor with a strong hazard ratio (Ramos2022Genetic). This suggests that genetic variants in SHISA6 may influence the progression of neurodegenerative diseases like AD.

Research involving Amish communities and a larger dataset from the NIA-LOAD family study of Alzheimer's disease found that certain genetic variants in SHISA6 are associated with delayed cognitive impairment, supporting the hypothesis that these variants can delay the development of cognitive impairment (Ramos2022Genetic). The study highlights the potential of SHISA6 as a candidate gene for interventions aimed at delaying the onset of AD symptoms (Ramos2022Genetic).

While the role of SHISA6 in synaptic function is well-documented, its direct association with specific diseases or conditions through mutations or expression alterations remains an area for further research (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

## Interactions
SHISA6, a member of the Shisa family of proteins, is known for its interactions with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and other synaptic proteins. It is a type-I single-pass transmembrane protein that interacts with AMPAR subunits GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3, without showing subunit preference (Klaassen2016Shisa6; Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). SHISA6 also interacts with PDZ-domain-containing scaffold proteins, such as PSD-95, through its C-terminal EVTV domain, which is crucial for its role in synaptic localization and function (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

The interaction with PSD-95 helps to constrain the mobility of AMPARs, confining them to postsynaptic densities and stabilizing them at synaptic sites (Klaassen2016Shisa6). This interaction is confirmed through various experimental approaches, including yeast two-hybrid assays and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in living neurons (Klaassen2016Shisa6). SHISA6 also interacts with other proteins such as TARP-gamma8 and SAP102, although these are not required for its interaction with AMPARs (Klaassen2016Shisa6).

SHISA6's role in modulating AMPAR dynamics and kinetics is significant, as it reduces AMPAR mobility and affects their biophysical properties, such as prolonging decay times and slowing desensitization kinetics (Klaassen2016Shisa6). These interactions are crucial for maintaining synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly during high-frequency synaptic activity (Klaassen2016Shisa6).
