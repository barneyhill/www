# RBM41

## Overview
RBM41 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 41, which is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns within the minor spliceosome. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and is distinct from other spliceosomal components due to its unique interactions and functions. Unlike its paralog U11/U12-65K, RBM41 associates with a U12 mono-snRNP complex and plays a role in the post-splicing steps of the minor spliceosome assembly and disassembly cycle. It interacts with the RNA helicase DHX8 and is implicated in the disassembly of the spliceosome, potentially cycling through Cajal bodies, which are nuclear structures involved in RNA processing (Norppa2023Distinct). Despite not being essential for cell viability, RBM41's evolutionary conservation suggests it may provide a selective advantage in specific cellular contexts (Norppa2023Distinct).

## Structure
RBM41 is a human protein with a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa. It features a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) located near its C-terminus, specifically between positions 309-387. This RRM is similar to that of the U11/U12-65K protein, a component of the minor spliceosome, and includes a specific amino acid substitution (F/Y352Q) in the RNP1 motif, which is also found in the U1A/U2Bâ€³/SNF family of spliceosome components (Norppa2023Distinct). The N-terminus of RBM41 is highly conserved among animal orthologs, lacks annotated domains, and is predicted to adopt a helical conformation (Norppa2023Distinct).

RBM41 binds to the 3' terminal stem-loops of U12 and U6atac snRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo, but with approximately two times lower affinity compared to U11/U12-65K. Unlike U11/U12-65K, which is part of the U11/U12 di-snRNP, RBM41 associates with a distinct U12 mono-snRNP (Norppa2023Distinct). The unique N-terminal domain of RBM41 is necessary for its association with complexes containing the RNA helicase DHX8, suggesting a role in post-splicing steps of the minor spliceosome assembly/disassembly cycle (Norppa2023Distinct).

## Function
RBM41 (RNA binding motif protein 41) is a protein involved in the splicing of U12-type introns within the minor spliceosome, a complex responsible for processing a specific subset of introns in pre-mRNA. Although RBM41 is not essential for cell viability, as knockout experiments in HEK293 cells show no significant growth defects, it plays a crucial role in the splicing of U12-type introns, affecting alternative splicing events and the selection of 3' splice sites (Norppa2023Distinct).

RBM41 functions primarily in the post-splicing steps of the minor spliceosome assembly and disassembly cycle. It binds to the 3' terminal stem-loops of U12 and U6atac snRNAs, albeit with lower affinity compared to its paralog U11/U12-65K, and is associated with the U12 mono-snRNP complex (Norppa2023Distinct). The protein is suggested to interact with excised U12-type intron lariats and the DHX8 helicase, indicating a role in the disassembly of the spliceosome and possibly cycling through Cajal bodies, which are nuclear structures involved in RNA processing (Norppa2023Distinct).

RBM41's evolutionary conservation suggests it may provide a selective advantage in specific cell types or organisms, potentially substituting for missing components in the minor spliceosome (Norppa2023Distinct).

## Interactions
RBM41 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the minor spliceosome. It specifically associates with minor spliceosomal snRNPs, including U12, U4atac, and U6atac snRNAs, but not with U11 snRNA. This specificity is mediated through its RNA recognition motif (RRM), and mutations in this domain result in a loss of interaction with these snRNAs (Norppa2023Distinct). RBM41 is part of the U12 mono-snRNP complex and interacts with U11/U12-31K, a relationship dependent on a functional RBM41-U12 snRNA interaction (Norppa2023Distinct).

RBM41 also interacts with the DEAH-box RNA helicase DHX8, a protein involved in the major spliceosome, suggesting a role in the late stages of minor splicing. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal region of RBM41 (Norppa2023Distinct). Additionally, RBM41 localizes to Cajal bodies through its interaction with coilin, a key scaffolding protein, which is dependent on U12 snRNA binding (Norppa2023Distinct). The protein remains associated with U12 snRNA during spliceosome disassembly and is involved in the reassembly of the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex in Cajal bodies (Norppa2023Distinct).
