# SPATA24

## Overview
SPATA24, or spermatogenesis associated 24, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the complex process of spermatogenesis, the development of sperm cells. The SPATA24 protein is primarily expressed in the testes and is thought to play a crucial role in the regulation of cellular processes necessary for the maturation and function of spermatozoa, impacting male fertility (Schack2022A). While the specific molecular functions and interactions of the SPATA24 protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in cytoplasmic movement and removal during spermatogenesis, a vital step for the development of functional sperm (McReynolds2014Toward). Despite its significant role in human fertility, studies in animal models suggest that SPATA24 may not be essential for male fertility, indicating potential species-specific differences in its function (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based). Further research is needed to fully understand the protein's role and its potential as a target for addressing male infertility.

## Structure


## Function
SPATA24 (spermatogenesis associated 24) is a gene involved in the process of spermatogenesis, which is the development of sperm cells. The protein encoded by SPATA24 is believed to play a role in the regulation of cellular processes critical for the maturation and function of spermatozoa. It is particularly active in the testes, where it contributes to the proper formation and motility of sperm, impacting male fertility (Schack2022A).

In healthy human cells, SPATA24 is involved in cytoplasm movement and removal during spermatogenesis, a crucial step for the development of functional sperm (McReynolds2014Toward). The gene's expression is associated with the differentiation of cells necessary for the production of mature sperm, indicating its importance in maintaining normal spermatogenic processes (Schack2022A).

Alterations in the expression of SPATA24 have been linked to issues in sperm function and embryo development, suggesting that its proper expression is essential for fertility (McReynolds2014Toward). Despite its significant role in spermatogenesis, studies in mice have shown that SPATA24 is individually dispensable for male fertility, highlighting potential differences in gene function between species (Sun2020CRISPRCas9based).

## Clinical Significance
SPATA24 is implicated in male infertility, particularly in cases of unexplained infertility associated with poor blastocyst development. Studies have shown that SPATA24 is underexpressed in sperm samples linked to poor embryo development, suggesting its critical role in spermatogenesis and sperm quality (McReynolds2014Toward). The decreased expression of SPATA24, along with other proteins involved in spermatogenesis, may contribute to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which negatively affect sperm quality and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes (McReynolds2014Toward).

The histone variant TH2B, associated with SPATA24, plays a role in regulating transcription during spermiogenesis, indicating that SPATA24 may be involved in critical spermatogenic events that escape protamination (Singh2021Heterogeneity). Although the specific clinical significance of SPATA24 mutations or expression changes is not fully detailed, alterations in its expression are linked to male infertility and poor embryo development outcomes (McReynolds2014Toward). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SPATA24 influences fertility and to determine its potential as a biomarker for reproductive health issues.

## Interactions
SPATA24, also known as spermatogenesis associated 24, is involved in the process of spermatogenesis, but specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented. The yeast two-hybrid screen conducted by Shi et al. identified SPATA24 as one of the proteins interacting with PKA-RIα during mouse spermiogenesis, suggesting a potential role in protein translation machinery and quality control systems (Shi2021Yeast). However, the specific interactions of SPATA24 with other proteins or its role in multiprotein complexes remain unexplored (Shi2021Yeast).

In a study by McReynolds et al., SPATA24 was found to be underexpressed in sperm samples associated with poor blastocyst development, indicating its potential involvement in spermatogenesis and embryo development. However, the study did not provide specific details on the interactions of SPATA24 with other proteins or molecules (McReynolds2014Toward). Similarly, Cai et al. reported the downregulation of SPATA24 in cattleyak, which is associated with male infertility, but did not detail specific protein interactions (Cai2017Comparative). Overall, while SPATA24 is implicated in spermatogenesis, its precise interaction networks remain to be elucidated.
