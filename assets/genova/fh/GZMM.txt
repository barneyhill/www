# GZMM

## Overview
Granzyme M (GZMM) is a gene that encodes the serine protease granzyme M, which is predominantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and certain cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This protease plays a critical role in the immune system's ability to target and eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells. Granzyme M is a unique member of the granzyme family, characterized by its distinct molecular structure, including a catalytic triad and specific post-translational modifications that influence its function and stability (Sattar2003Bioinformatics; Khurshid2010Granzyme). Functionally, granzyme M is involved in the granule-exocytosis pathway, where it is released into the immunological synapse and enters target cells to induce apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms (Hu2010Cleavage; de2014Granzyme). Its ability to cleave various substrates, such as the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), underscores its role in modulating immune responses and promoting cytolysis (Lu2006Granzyme).

## Structure
Granzyme M (GZMM) is a serine protease with a distinct molecular structure characterized by a single polypeptide chain that folds into two beta-barrels, each comprising six antiparallel strands (Khurshid2010Granzyme). The protein consists of 232 amino acids and features a catalytic triad composed of His41, Asp86, and Ser182, located at the junction of the two beta-barrels (Sattar2003Bioinformatics; Khurshid2010Granzyme). The N-terminal domain includes eight beta-sheets, while the C-terminal domain contains six beta-sheets and one alpha-helix (Sattar2003Bioinformatics).

Granzyme M has several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at Ser160, which may influence substrate binding, and myristoylation at Gly22, Gly117, and Gly131, which are important for membrane interaction and protein stability (Sattar2003Bioinformatics; Khurshid2010Granzyme). The protein also contains four disulfide bonds, contributing to its structural stability (Khurshid2010Granzyme).

The protein's surface features two helical elements: a 3_10 turn from Gly55 to Leu59 and a long C-terminal alpha-helix from Val221 to Ala232 (Khurshid2010Granzyme). These structural features, along with its unique substrate specificity, distinguish granzyme M from other proteases.

## Function
Granzyme M (GZMM) is a serine protease predominantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and certain cytotoxic T lymphocytes, playing a significant role in the immune response against virus-infected and tumor cells. It is part of the granule-exocytosis pathway, where it is released into the immunological synapse and enters target cells with the aid of perforin (Hu2010Cleavage; de2014Granzyme). Once inside, GZMM induces apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and independent pathways. It cleaves specific substrates such as the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), leading to DNA fragmentation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is involved in DNA repair (Lu2006Granzyme).

GZMM also inactivates proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI9), an endogenous inhibitor of granzyme B, thereby facilitating granzyme B's apoptotic function (Mahrus2004Granzyme). It cleaves Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, promoting the degradation of the Survivin-XIAP complex and enhancing caspase activation (Hu2010Cleavage). These activities underscore GZMM's role in modulating immune responses and promoting the cytolysis of target cells.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Granzyme M (GZMM) interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in apoptosis and immune responses. GZMM cleaves Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, disrupting the Survivin-XIAP complex. This cleavage frees caspase activity, promoting apoptosis in target tumor cells (Hu2010Cleavage). GZMM also targets topoisomerase II alpha (topoIIa), cleaving it at Leu 1280, which leads to cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. This interaction results in the relocalization of topoIIa's N-terminal fragment to the cytoplasm, affecting its nuclear functions (de2013Granzyme).

GZMM cleaves the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD), activating CAD and leading to DNA fragmentation, a key step in apoptosis (Lu2006Granzyme). It also degrades PARP, a DNA damage sensor, further promoting apoptosis (Lu2006Granzyme). GZMM's interactions are facilitated by its specific binding sites and post-translational modifications, which regulate its activity and stability (Khurshid2010Granzyme). These interactions highlight GZMM's role in modulating apoptotic pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
