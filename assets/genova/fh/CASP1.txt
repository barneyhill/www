# CASP1

## Overview
The CASP1 gene encodes the protein caspase-1, a cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammation and cell death. Caspase-1 is primarily involved in the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), which are crucial for the body's immune response (Gupta2001Direct; Luksch2012Naturally). This protein is activated by the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that responds to pathogenic and danger signals, leading to the induction of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Labbé2011Cellular; Kesavardhana2020Caspases). Beyond its role in inflammation, caspase-1 is also involved in apoptosis and is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress response (Gupta2001Direct). The CASP1 gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest in clinical research due to their implications in various inflammatory and autoinflammatory diseases, as well as their potential as therapeutic targets in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer (Peng2023Effect; Flores2021Therapeutic).

## Structure
Caspase-1 (CASP1) is a cysteine protease with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of CASP1 includes a polypeptide chain with a catalytic cysteine-histidine dyad, essential for its enzymatic activity (Walker1994Crystal). The secondary structure is characterized by a central 8-stranded β-sheet core flanked by α-helices, with specific contributions from the p20 and p10 subunits (Walker1994Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, CASP1 forms a homodimer of heterodimers, with each heterodimer consisting of one p20 and one p10 subunit, creating a single globular domain (Walker1994Crystal). The quaternary structure is a tetramer composed of two symmetrically arranged dimers, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Luksch2012Naturally). 

CASP1 contains a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and the initiation of apoptosis (Feng2004Caspase1ζ). Post-translational modifications include cleavage for activation, which is necessary for the enzyme to process proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (Feng2004Caspase1ζ). A splice variant, CASP1 zeta, lacks 39 amino acids at the N-terminal, resulting in a shorter CARD but retains proapoptotic activity (Feng2004Caspase1ζ).

## Function
Caspase-1, encoded by the CASP1 gene, is a crucial enzyme in the inflammatory response and cell death processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the proteolytic processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), converting them into their active forms. This activation is essential for amplifying the inflammatory response and is a key component of the innate immune system (Gupta2001Direct; Luksch2012Naturally).

Caspase-1 is activated by the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that assembles in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger signals. Once activated, caspase-1 induces pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, and facilitates the release of mature cytokines through membrane pores, bypassing conventional secretion pathways (Labbé2011Cellular; Kesavardhana2020Caspases).

In addition to its role in inflammation, caspase-1 is involved in some forms of apoptosis and is a transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates its expression in response to stress signals such as DNA damage (Gupta2001Direct). This regulation underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CASP1 gene, which encodes the proinflammatory enzyme caspase-1, are associated with several autoinflammatory and inflammatory conditions. CASP1 variants have been linked to recurrent febrile episodes and generalized inflammation, often beginning in early childhood. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as arthralgia, exanthema, abdominal pain, and lymphadenopathy. The presence of CASP1 variants is associated with reduced enzymatic activity of procaspase-1, leading to enhanced interaction with RIP2 and increased activation of NF-κB pathways, resulting in elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα (Luksch2015Current).

In breast cancer, lower CASP1 expression is observed in tumor tissues compared to surrounding tissues, and higher expression levels are associated with better overall survival and disease-specific outcomes. CASP1 expression correlates with ultrasound features, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for breast cancer prognosis (Peng2023Effect).

CASP1 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, where its activation is linked to cognitive decline. Genetic variants of CASP1 are associated with lower IL-1β levels and better cognitive performance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's-related cognitive impairment (Flores2021Therapeutic).

## Interactions
Caspase-1 (CASP1) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in inflammatory processes. CASP1 is a key component of the inflammasome, a multi-protein complex that includes NLR family members and the adaptor protein ASC. This complex facilitates the activation of CASP1 through CARD-CARD and PYD-PYD interactions, which are essential for the processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18 (Franchi2009The).

The HIPPI-HIP-1 heterodimer interacts with the CASP1 promoter, regulating its transcription. HIPPI requires HIP-1 for nuclear translocation, and their interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of CASP1. This complex is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and it can bind to the CASP1 promoter in vivo, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (Majumder2007Interaction; Banerjee2009Transcription).

CASP1 activation is also influenced by its interaction with the NALP1 inflammasome. NALP1, in the presence of ATP and other cofactors, can activate CASP1 through a two-step mechanism. ASC enhances this activation by linking NALP1 to procaspase-1, although it is not strictly necessary for the process (Faustin2007Reconstituted).
