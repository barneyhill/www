# SFTPA2

## Overview
The SFTPA2 gene encodes surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2), a crucial component of the pulmonary surfactant system, which plays a vital role in maintaining lung function and facilitating efficient gas exchange. SP-A2 is a member of the collectin family of proteins, characterized by its collagen-like domain and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which are essential for its function in reducing alveolar surface tension and participating in the innate immune response (Floros2021Human). The protein is primarily expressed in alveolar type II cells and is involved in the aggregation of phospholipids and bacterial lipopolysaccharides, contributing to the stability of the alveolar microenvironment (Floros2021Human). SP-A2 also enhances the phagocytosis of pathogens by alveolar macrophages and modulates proinflammatory cytokine production, underscoring its role in host defense (Floros2009Genetic). Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene have been linked to pulmonary conditions such as adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (van2021Genetic; Legendre2020Functional).

## Structure
Surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2), encoded by the SFTPA2 gene, is a crucial component of the pulmonary surfactant system. The protein consists of several domains, including a signal peptide, an N-terminal region, a collagen-like domain, a neck, and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (Floros2021Human). The collagen-like domain is characterized by 23 Gly-X-Y triplets, with a notable irregularity between triplets 13 and 14, which influences the protein's structure and function (Floros2021Human).

SP-A2's primary structure includes specific amino acid residues that affect its stability and function. For instance, the presence of arginine at position 85 introduces a trypsin digestion site, making SP-A2 more susceptible to degradation compared to SP-A1, which has cysteine at the same position (Floros2021Human). This difference also affects the protein's oligomerization patterns, with SP-A2 forming dimers, trimers, tetramers, and hexamers (Floros2021Human).

Post-translational modifications of SP-A2 include glycosylation, which is an N-linked addition, contributing to the protein's molecular mass and isoelectric points (Phelps1986Posttranslational). The protein's structure and modifications play a significant role in its function within the surfactant system and its interactions with alveolar macrophages (Floros2021Human).

## Function
The SFTPA2 gene encodes surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2), which is a critical component of the pulmonary surfactant system. This protein plays a vital role in reducing surface tension within the alveoli, thereby preventing lung collapse and facilitating efficient gas exchange (Floros2021Differential). SP-A2 is primarily active in alveolar type II cells, where it contributes to the stability of the alveolar microenvironment by aggregating phospholipids and bacterial lipopolysaccharides, which is essential for maintaining lung function (Floros2021Human).

SP-A2 is also involved in the innate immune response of the lungs. It enhances the phagocytosis of pathogens by alveolar macrophages and modulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thereby playing a significant role in host defense (Floros2009Genetic). The protein's ability to bind a wide variety of sugars and its higher biological activity compared to SP-A1 suggest that SP-A2 has specialized roles in immune defense activities (Floros2021Differential; Floros2009Genetic).

Additionally, SP-A2 influences the regulation of surfactant secretion and the formation of specific molecular phenotypes necessary for optimal lung function and survival (Floros2021Human). Its activity is crucial for the formation of tubular myelin, an extracellular structure of surfactant, indicating its importance in both surfactant-related functions and immune responses (Floros2009Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene are associated with several pulmonary conditions, most notably adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer. These mutations are typically found in exon 6, which encodes the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the protein. The mutations lead to protein destabilization, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and stress, and the absence of the mutated protein in the patient's lavage fluid. The inheritance pattern of these mutations is autosomal dominant, and they are linked to both pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer in affected families (van2021Genetic; Legendre2020Functional).

In individuals with SFTPA2 mutations, radiological features such as septal thickening and ground-glass opacities are common, often described as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Histologically, these mutations are most often associated with a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (van2021Genetic). The mutations also lead to a high prevalence of lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinomas, with a significant risk noted in patients over 40 years of age (Legendre2020Functional).

Alterations in SFTPA2 gene expression, such as increased methylation in the gene promoter, are observed in lung cancer tissues, correlating with reduced levels of SFTPA2 mRNA and protein. This suggests that methylation may interfere with transcription factor binding, affecting gene expression (Floros2021Differential).

## Interactions
Surfactant protein A2 (SP-A2), encoded by the SFTPA2 gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in the innate immune system. A significant interaction occurs between SP-A2 mRNA and the 14-3-3 protein family, particularly involving exon B (eB) of the SP-A2 mRNA. The 14-3-3 proteins, including the β/α and δ isoforms, bind to eB in a sequence-specific manner, which is essential for the regulation of SP-A2 expression. These interactions are influenced by the secondary structure of eB and involve two critical cis-elements within eB that facilitate protein binding (Noutsios2013Exon).

The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to eB enhances the translation and stability of SP-A2 mRNA, leading to more efficient protein synthesis. Knockdown experiments targeting the 14-3-3 β/α isoform result in decreased SP-A2 expression, highlighting the importance of these interactions in SP-A2 regulation (Noutsios2013Exon). These interactions also suggest a role for 14-3-3 proteins in modulating SP-A2 expression through pathways involving tyrosine kinases and potentially influencing immune signaling pathways, such as those involving Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (Noutsios2013Exon).
