# OVCA2

## Overview
The OVCA2 gene encodes a protein known as OVCA2 serine hydrolase domain containing, which is a member of the serine hydrolase family. This protein is characterized by a catalytic triad composed of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. OVCA2 is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism and detoxification of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol. The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, suggesting a broad biological role. OVCA2's interactions with proteins involved in cellular structure and apoptosis indicate its potential involvement in maintaining cellular integrity and regulating apoptotic pathways. Clinically, alterations in the OVCA2 gene have been associated with increased cancer susceptibility, particularly in cancers linked to alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking, due to its role in acetaldehyde detoxification (Sobh2019GenomeWide; Bun2020Comparative).

## Structure
The OVCA2 protein is a member of the serine hydrolase family and is characterized by a classic Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, specifically Ser117, His206, and Asp179, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bun2020Comparative). The primary structure of OVCA2 consists of 227 amino acids, with a sequence that includes a G-x-S-x-G motif, indicative of its serine hydrolase function (Azizi2006Mass; Bun2020Comparative). The secondary structure of OVCA2 is modeled to have an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, a common feature in this enzyme family, with the core regions showing excellent structural quality (Azizi2006Mass).

The tertiary structure of OVCA2 has been modeled using the LOOPP fold recognition server, based on a 25% sequence identity with the yeast protein YHR049W/FSH1, which also belongs to the serine hydrolase family (Azizi2006Mass). The model suggests a narrow, extended hydrophobic binding pocket suitable for accommodating straight-chain alkyl esters, aligning it closer to the lipase subclass of serine hydrolases (Bun2020Comparative). The potential for a disulfide bond between Cys11 and Cys41 is suggested, although not observed in related proteins (Azizi2006Mass).

OVCA2 is likely a functional monomer, as the contact surface in homologous dimers is typical for crystal contacts, and a deletion in the contact region reduces the possibility of effective dimeric packing (Azizi2006Mass). The protein is predicted to be non-secretory and localized in the cytoplasm, plasma membrane, or nucleus, with several predicted phosphorylation sites but no N-glycosylation or GPI anchor sites (Azizi2006Mass).

## Function
The OVCA2 gene encodes a serine hydrolase enzyme that is involved in hydrolytic processes within human cells. This enzyme is characterized by a catalytic triad composed of Ser117, Asp179, and His206, which is crucial for its hydrolysis reactions (Bun2020Comparative). OVCA2 shows a preference for unbranched, alkyl ester substrates with more than 10 carbons, suggesting its role in lipid metabolism or processing (Bun2020Comparative). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, indicating a general biological function (Bun2020Comparative).

OVCA2 is also implicated in the detoxification of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol. The gene plays a role in mitigating the genotoxic effects of acetaldehyde by potentially participating in the removal of acetaldehyde-derived DNA adducts or facilitating DNA repair processes (Sobh2019GenomeWide). Disruption of OVCA2 leads to increased sensitivity to acetaldehyde and accumulation of DNA adducts, highlighting its protective function against acetaldehyde-induced damage (Sobh2019GenomeWide). This function is supported by the yeast homolog FSH1, which also shows defective growth in ethanol-containing media, further suggesting a conserved role in acetaldehyde detoxification (Sobh2019GenomeWide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the OVCA2 gene, which encodes a serine hydrolase, have been implicated in various cancer-related processes. OVCA2 is located on chromosome 17, a region frequently deleted in several cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and ovarian cancer. This deletion is associated with increased cancer susceptibility, particularly in cancers linked to alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking, both major sources of acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol (Sobh2019GenomeWide). OVCA2 has been identified as a protective factor against acetaldehyde toxicity, and its disruption leads to increased sensitivity to acetaldehyde and accumulation of the DNA adduct N2-ethylidene-dG, suggesting a role in DNA repair or acetaldehyde metabolism (Sobh2019GenomeWide; Bun2020Comparative).

In cancer cell lines, OVCA2 is upregulated and interacts with apoptosis signals, indicating its involvement in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Bun2020Comparative). The gene's expression is downregulated during retinoid-induced apoptosis in certain lung cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in cell growth and differentiation (Prowse2002OVCA2). These findings highlight OVCA2's significance in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
OVCA2, a serine hydrolase, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes. The protein interaction maps for OVCA2 are limited but indicate interactions with general cell organization proteins such as myosin (Myh11), desmoplakin (Dsp), and phosphatidyl glycan anchor (Pigs) (Bun2020Comparative). These interactions suggest a role in maintaining cellular structure and organization.

In the context of apoptosis, OVCA2 has been shown to interact with components that influence mitochondrial function and integrity. In yeast, OVCA2 expression leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced membrane potential, indicating its involvement in apoptotic pathways (Gowsalya2021Human). This interaction is further supported by its ability to induce apoptosis in yeast cells, particularly in the absence of the FSH3 gene, by affecting mitochondrial integrity (Gowsalya2021Human).

OVCA2 also interacts with the BAG domain, part of the Bcl-2 associated anthogene family, which plays a role in apoptosis and stress response (Azizi2006Mass). This interaction highlights OVCA2's potential involvement in apoptotic regulation and cellular stress responses. Despite these findings, the detailed biological functions and interactions of OVCA2 remain largely uncharacterized, necessitating further research to elucidate its precise roles.
