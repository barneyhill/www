# KPNA1

## Overview
KPNA1 is a gene that encodes the protein karyopherin subunit alpha 1, also known as importin alpha 5, which is a crucial component of the nuclear import machinery. This protein functions as an adaptor in the importin complex, recognizing nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins and facilitating their transport through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. Karyopherin subunit alpha 1 is characterized by its N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain and multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which are essential for its interaction with importin beta and NLS-bearing proteins, respectively (Duan2016Nuclear; Park2012Identification). The protein plays a vital role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular function by ensuring the proper localization of proteins such as the cell cycle inhibitor p27 and components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Choo2016Karyopherin). KPNA1's involvement in various cellular processes, including muscle regeneration and cancer progression, underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Choo2016Karyopherin; Jiang2022Decreased).

## Structure
KPNA1, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 1, is a protein involved in the nuclear import of proteins bearing nuclear localization signals (NLS). The molecular structure of KPNA1 includes an N-terminal importin beta-binding (IBB) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with importin beta, facilitating the transport of cargo proteins into the nucleus (Duan2016Nuclear). The protein also contains multiple armadillo (ARM) repeats, which form a superhelical structure. These ARM repeats are responsible for binding to the NLS on cargo proteins, enabling their nuclear import (Park2012Identification).

KPNA1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its transport activity. The protein exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, allowing for functional diversity (Choo2016Karyopherin). The human homologue of KPNA1 shares high sequence similarity with its rat counterpart, with up to 98% identity, indicating a conserved structure across species (Wang2004Molecular). The protein's role in nuclear import is critical for various cellular processes, including the regulation of satellite cell proliferation and survival (Choo2016Karyopherin).

## Function
KPNA1, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 1, plays a critical role in the nuclear import of proteins by acting as an adaptor in the importin complex. It recognizes nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins, facilitating their transport through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. This process is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular function (Park2012Identification; OKA2018Importin).

KPNA1 is involved in the nuclear import of specific proteins, such as the cell cycle inhibitor p27. In the absence of KPNA1, p27 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm, leading to increased cell proliferation, highlighting KPNA1's role in controlling cell cycle progression (Choo2016Karyopherin). KPNA1 also influences the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival, by modulating the nuclear import of related proteins (Choo2016Karyopherin).

In muscle satellite cells, KPNA1 maintains the balance between quiescence and activation, preventing premature activation and apoptosis, which is vital for muscle regeneration (Choo2016Karyopherin). Its absence leads to satellite cell exhaustion, underscoring its importance in maintaining the satellite cell pool (Choo2016Karyopherin).

## Clinical Significance
KPNA1 (karyopherin subunit alpha 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In cervical cancer, KPNA1 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased malignancy, particularly in Grade III tumors, and is critical for the proliferation of HeLa cells. Upregulation of KPNA1 in these cells suppresses proliferation and enhances the nuclear transport of IRF3, a transcription factor involved in anti-tumor responses, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Jiang2022Decreased).

In gastric cancer, KPNA1 is overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and increased immune invasion, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Liu2022Mammalian). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, KPNA1 is upregulated and associated with higher tumor grades and immune infiltration, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and immune interactions (Chen2021Comprehensive).

KPNA1 has also been studied in the context of schizophrenia, but no significant rare variants were found in patients, suggesting it may not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to this disorder (Jouan2013Investigation). Overall, KPNA1's altered expression and interactions are significant in cancer progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
KPNA1, also known as importin alpha 5, is involved in nuclear transport by mediating the import of proteins into the nucleus. It interacts with nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins and forms a complex with importin beta (KPNB1) to facilitate translocation through the nuclear pore complex. KPNA1 interacts with various proteins, including transcription factors and viral proteins, influencing cellular processes and viral replication.

KPNA1 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for nuclear import. It has been shown to interact with KPNB1, TNPO1, and TNPO3, with the KPNA1-KPNB1 complex being the most stable based on total stabilization energy (-183.6 kcal/mol) (Rathod2021Decoding). KPNA1 also interacts with the prototype foamy virus transactivator Bel1, facilitating its nuclear import through binding to its NLS (Duan2016Nuclear). In porcine tissue, KPNA1 interacts with proteins such as SP17, which shows strong nuclear localization and is likely a cargo for karyopherin α proteins (Park2012Identification). These interactions highlight KPNA1's role in nuclear import processes, where it binds to proteins with NLS, aiding their transport into the nucleus.
