# MUC4

## Overview
MUC4 is a gene that encodes the protein mucin 4, a cell surface-associated glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the protection and lubrication of epithelial surfaces. Mucin 4 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its complex structure, which includes a large tandem repeat domain and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. These structural features facilitate extensive glycosylation and interactions with other proteins, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (HER2), influencing cell signaling pathways. MUC4 is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the trachea, stomach, and colon, and is involved in cellular processes such as epithelial renewal and differentiation. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic and breast cancers, where MUC4 is often overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression and metastasis (Chaturvedi2007Structure; Carraway2009Muc4MUC4; Jonckheere2012The).

## Structure
The MUC4 protein is a large, complex glycoprotein encoded by the MUC4 gene, characterized by a highly polymorphic structure. Its primary structure includes a central tandem repeat domain rich in serine, threonine, and proline, facilitating extensive O-glycosylation, which contributes to its protective function on epithelial surfaces (Chaturvedi2007Structure; Moniaux2000Alternative). The protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide and is predicted to be cleaved into two functional subunits: MUC4α, which is mucin-like, and MUC4β, a transmembrane growth factor-like subunit (Chaturvedi2007Structure).

The secondary structure of MUC4 includes several important domains, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which are involved in protein interactions and may act as ligands for membrane receptors like the ErbB family (Jonckheere2013Membranebound). The tertiary structure of MUC4β is characterized by EGF-like domains with β folds and a von Willebrand factor domain, which appears as a random coiled structure with some α-helix and β-strands (Kshirsagar2021Characterization).

MUC4 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants, including secreted, membrane-tethered, and growth factor-like forms, with some lacking the tandem repeat domain (Chaturvedi2007Structure; Moniaux2000Alternative). These variants are expressed in various tissues and are implicated in cancer, highlighting their potential significance in disease processes (Moniaux2000Alternative).

## Function
The MUC4 gene encodes a large glycoprotein that is a component of the mucus covering epithelial surfaces, playing a crucial role in protecting epithelial cells and potentially in epithelial renewal and differentiation (MONIAUX1999Completea). MUC4 is a heterodimeric bifunctional cell-surface glycoprotein, similar to the rat sialomucin complex, and may function as a ligand for ErbB2 in cell signaling (MONIAUX1999Completea). The protein contains two epidermal growth factor-like domains, a transmembrane sequence, and a potential phosphorylated site, suggesting its involvement in cell signaling pathways (MONIAUX1999Completea).

In healthy human cells, MUC4 provides lubrication and protection to ducts and luminal surfaces, being expressed in various epithelial tissues such as the trachea, bronchial area, cervix, stomach, small intestine, and colon (Chaturvedi2007Structure; MONIAUX1999Completea). It is expressed in different types of epithelial cells, including simple, stratified squamous, and nonkeratinizing epithelia (Chaturvedi2007Structure). The transmembrane forms of MUC4 offer localized protection to the cell surface, while the secretory forms aid in lubrication and provide broad protection by trapping foreign particles and pathogens (Chaturvedi2007Structure). MUC4's structure, which includes a large tandem-repeat domain and a C-terminus with potential N-glycosylation sites, suggests a role in cell-cell interactions and signaling (MONIAUX1999Completea).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MUC4 gene are significantly associated with various cancers, particularly pancreatic cancer. MUC4 is overexpressed in pancreatic tumors, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis by modulating cell signaling pathways, such as those involving the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (HER2) (Srivastava2011MicroRNA-150; Singh2004Inhibition). This overexpression is linked to enhanced tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as resistance to apoptosis (Chaturvedi2007Structure; Singh2007Emerging).

In breast cancer, MUC4 is upregulated in metastatic lesions, suggesting a role in promoting metastasis, although it is not typically overexpressed in primary tumors (Carraway2009Muc4MUC4). In ovarian cancer, MUC4 is overexpressed in early stages, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker (Singh2007Emerging).

MUC4's interaction with HER2 is crucial in cancer progression, as it stabilizes HER2 expression and enhances its signaling, which can affect the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab (Carraway2009Muc4MUC4; Singh2007Emerging). The gene's expression is regulated by various factors, including retinoic acid and interferon-γ, which can synergistically upregulate MUC4 in cancer cells (Chaturvedi2007Structure; Carraway2009Muc4MUC4).

## Interactions
MUC4, a transmembrane mucin, is known to interact with the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (also known as HER2). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, where MUC4 and ErbB2 form a complex that influences various cellular processes. MUC4 contains EGF-like domains that facilitate its binding to ErbB2, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as the phosphoinositol 3-kinase and Akt pathways (Jonckheere2012The; Carraway2002Muc4sialomucin).

In pancreatic cancer cells, MUC4 colocalizes with HER2, stabilizing the oncoprotein and enhancing its expression by increasing its stability rather than affecting its transcription. This stabilization is crucial for the progression of pancreatic cancer, as demonstrated by decreased HER2 expression and reduced half-life in MUC4-knockdown cells (Chaturvedi2008MUC4).

The interaction between MUC4 and ErbB2 is also implicated in the modulation of cell signaling pathways. MUC4 activates the JNK pathway, while ErbB2 influences the MAPK pathway, affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor growth (Jonckheere2012The). These interactions highlight the potential of MUC4 and ErbB2 as therapeutic targets in cancer treatment.
