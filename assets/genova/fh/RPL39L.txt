# RPL39L

## Overview
RPL39L is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L39-like, which is a component of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. This protein plays a pivotal role in the process of translation, facilitating protein synthesis and contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. RPL39L is particularly active in the cytoplasm, where it supports ribosomal function and is involved in mitochondrial activity, influencing cellular energy metabolism. The gene is expressed in various cell types, including proliferative and cancerous cells, and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular growth. Notably, RPL39L can partially compensate for the loss of its paralog, RPL39, although its expression is generally lower. The protein's involvement in cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinomas, underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, as alterations in its expression and methylation status are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Zou2021Deletion; Yan2019A).

## Function
RPL39L is a ribosomal protein that is part of the large 60S subunit, playing a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the assembly and function of ribosomes. It is involved in the translation process, contributing to cellular growth and proliferation. RPL39L is typically active in the cytoplasm where ribosomes are located.

RPL39L is involved in cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial activity. It is expressed in proliferative cells, including cancerous cells, and plays a role in regulating cellular growth. In NIH3T3 cells, RPL39L contributes to cell proliferation, although its expression is lower than that of its paralog RPL39. The deletion of RPL39L impairs protein synthesis and mitochondrial function, which are essential for cell proliferation. This impairment is more pronounced under stress conditions, such as low serum, where compensatory mechanisms are compromised (Zou2021Deletion).

RPL39L can compensate for the loss of RPL39, although not completely, indicating a dose-dependent function influenced by external signals. The protein's role in mitochondrial activity is significant, as its deletion leads to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, affecting cellular energy metabolism (Zou2021Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPL39L gene have been implicated in the progression of various cancers. In lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs), RPL39L is often hypomethylated, leading to its overexpression, which is associated with poorer overall survival. This suggests a potential tumor-promoting role for RPL39L in lung ADCs, making it a candidate for targeted therapies (Yan2019A). The hypomethylation and overexpression of RPL39L have been proposed as part of a CpG island methylation panel that could serve as a prognostic biomarker for lung ADCs (Yan2019A).

In addition to lung cancer, RPL39L is aberrantly activated in various other carcinomas, indicating its involvement in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Zou2021Deletion). The gene's expression is particularly noted in proliferative cells, including cancer cell types, suggesting its role in ribosomal heterogeneity and cellular metabolism in cancer (Zou2021Deletion).

The study of RPL39L in the context of cancer highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Its expression levels and methylation status could be used to stratify patients for personalized treatment approaches, particularly in lung adenocarcinomas, where its expression correlates with patient prognosis and tumor aggressiveness (Yan2019A).
