# USH1C

## Overview
The USH1C gene encodes harmonin, a scaffold protein that plays a pivotal role in the Usher syndrome type 1 protein network. Harmonin is characterized by its PDZ domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and coiled-coil domains that aid in the assembly of protein complexes. It is integral to the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells, particularly in the inner ear and retina, where it contributes to mechanotransduction and cellular organization. Mutations in USH1C are linked to Usher syndrome type 1C, a genetic disorder marked by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and progressive vision loss. Harmonin's interactions with other proteins, such as cadherin 23 and MYO7A, underscore its essential role in maintaining sensory cell function and highlight its involvement in both auditory and visual pathways (Reiners2005Scaffold; Verpy2000A; Ebermann2007Deafblindness).

## Structure
Harmonin, encoded by the USH1C gene, is a scaffolding protein integral to the Usher syndrome type 1 protein network. It is characterized by the presence of PDZ domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, and coiled-coil domains that facilitate the assembly of protein complexes. Harmonin exists in three major isoforms: a, b, and c. Isoform a contains three PDZ domains and one coiled-coil domain, while isoform b includes an additional coiled-coil domain and a PST region rich in proline, serine, and threonine. Isoform c is shorter, with two PDZ domains and one coiled-coil domain (Verpy2000A; Li2016Mechanistic).

The N-terminal domain of harmonin adopts an α-helical fold, forming a compact five-helix-bundle structure. This domain is involved in specific protein-protein interactions, such as binding to cadherin 23, which is essential for the formation of stable tip link complexes in auditory hair cells (Pan2009Assembling; Pan). Harmonin's PDZ domains are involved in noncanonical interactions, such as binding to the SAM domain of Sans, contributing to the stability of the harmonin/Sans complex (Yan2010The). Harmonin's interactions are crucial for the organization of the USH1 protein complex, impacting auditory and vestibular functions.

## Function
The USH1C gene encodes the protein harmonin, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells, particularly in the inner ear and retina. Harmonin acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between various proteins involved in the Usher syndrome (USH) network, which is essential for the differentiation and function of hair cells in the inner ear and photoreceptor cells in the retina (Reiners2005Scaffold). 

In the inner ear, harmonin is involved in the organization of the brush border microvilli tip-link complex, linking cadherins with actin bundles, which is crucial for mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals (Li2016Mechanistic). In the retina, harmonin is expressed in photoreceptor cells and Müller glia cells, where it interacts with rhodopsin and other proteins to maintain cellular structure and function (NagelWolfrum2022Expression).

Harmonin also plays a role in regulating the canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling pathway by binding to β-catenin, acting as a suppressor of this pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and differentiation (Schäfer2023The). This regulatory function is significant for normal cellular function and organismal outcomes, such as hearing and vision.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USH1C gene are primarily associated with Usher syndrome type 1C (USH1C), a severe genetic disorder characterized by congenital profound sensorineural deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and progressive retinitis pigmentosa leading to blindness (Verpy2000A; Ebermann2007Deafblindness). The USH1C gene encodes harmonin, a protein crucial for the function of sensory hair cells in the inner ear. Mutations such as IVS5-2delA and 238-239insC disrupt harmonin's function, leading to the clinical manifestations of USH1C (Zwaenepoel2000Identification; Verpy2000A).

In the French Canadian population, a founder mutation, c.216G>A, known as the 'Acadian allele,' is a significant cause of USH1C, accounting for 40% of USH1 disease alleles in Quebec (Ebermann2007Deafblindness). This mutation is linked to congenital deafness and progressive retinal degeneration, leading to legal blindness.

USH1C mutations can also cause non-syndromic forms of deafness, such as DFNB18, highlighting the gene's role in auditory function without affecting vision (Ouyang2002Mutations; Verpy2000A). A novel heterozygous missense variant, c.667G>T (p.Gly223Cys), has been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, affecting harmonin's interaction with cadherin-related 23 (Song2020A).

## Interactions
USH1C, also known as harmonin, is a scaffold protein that plays a critical role in the Usher syndrome type 1 protein network. It interacts with various proteins to form complexes essential for cellular function. Harmonin interacts with MYO7A and USH1G to form a stable tripartite complex at the upper tip-link density in stereocilia, crucial for mechanotransduction in hair cells (He2019Myosin). It also forms a complex with MYO7B and ANKS4B in microvilli, known as the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which is analogous to the stereocilia tip-link complex (He2019Myosin).

The PDZ3 domain of USH1C interacts with the C-terminal MyTH4-FERM (CMF) domains of Myo7a and Myo7b, with Myo7b showing a stronger affinity (Li2017Structure). Mutations in Myo7a that affect this interaction are linked to Usher syndrome type I (Li2017Structure). USH1C also interacts with ANKS4B through its NPDZ1 tandem, forming a strong binary complex that can bind to MYO7B, facilitating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (He2019Myosin).

Harmonin's interactions extend to other proteins such as DOCK4, which suggests a potential signaling pathway involving Rac-DOCK4-harmonin that may regulate the actin cytoskeleton in stereocilia (Yan2006An). Harmonin also interacts with USH2A, NBC3, and VLGR1b through its PDZ1 domain, linking Usher syndrome types 1 and 2 (Reiners2005Scaffold).
