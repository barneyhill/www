# NOL7

## Overview
NOL7 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar protein 7, which is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation. The protein is a component of the small subunit (SSU) processome and plays a critical role in pre-rRNA transcription and processing, particularly in the stabilization and function of U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) (McCool2022Human; Zhou2010Identification). Nucleolar protein 7 is localized in the nucleolus and interacts with various ribonucleoproteins, contributing to the assembly and function of ribosomes. Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cell cycle progression (McCool2022Human). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in different cancer types, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Doçi2012Characterization; Li2020Nucleolar).

## Function
NOL7 is a crucial gene involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation in human cells. It plays a significant role in pre-rRNA transcription and pre-18S rRNA processing, essential steps in ribosome assembly. NOL7 is a component of the SSU processome, interacting with various components such as the 5'ETS, t-UTPs, and the U3 snoRNP methyltransferase Nop1/fibrillarin, which are critical for early pre-rRNA stability (McCool2022Human). The depletion of NOL7 leads to a decrease in 45S pre-rRNA levels and mature 18S rRNA, resulting in reduced protein synthesis and induction of the nucleolar stress response, characterized by increased TP53 levels and cell cycle arrest (McCool2022Human).

NOL7 is also involved in maintaining the stability and function of U3 snoRNA, which is necessary for the proper processing of the 5'ETS region of pre-rRNA (McCool2022Human). Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it participates in nucleolar rRNA biogenesis and interacts with ribonucleoproteins (Zhou2010Identification). NOL7's function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cell cycle progression, highlighting its critical role in human cell biology (McCool2022Human).

## Clinical Significance
NOL7 has been implicated in various cancers, with its role differing depending on the cancer type. In melanoma, NOL7 acts as an oncogene, with its expression significantly elevated in primary and metastatic melanoma compared to normal skin and nevi. This upregulation is associated with melanoma progression and metastasis, facilitated through the HIF-1ɑ/PI3K/AKT/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of NOL7 in melanoma cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020Nucleolar).

Conversely, in cervical cancer, NOL7 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression decreases progressively from normal cervical mucosa to cervical cancer, correlating with increased angiogenesis and tumor growth. Mutations in NOL7, particularly in intron 5 and the 3'UTR, may affect splicing and contribute to its inactivation in cervical cancer. These genetic alterations, along with loss of heterozygosity, align with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressor genes (Doçi2012Characterization).

In a broader pancancer context, NOL7 expression levels and genetic alterations are linked to patient prognosis in several cancers, with its role varying as either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive depending on the cancer type (Liu2022Pancancer).

## Interactions
NOL7 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is part of a large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex within the nucleoplasm, interacting with mRNA-processing factors. NOL7 specifically associates with several proteins, including SR proteins SF2-ASF and SRp40, RNA-processing factor NCL, and 3' processing and decay factors XRN2, CNOT3, and CPSF2, in both RNA-dependent and independent manners (Doçi2012The). It also interacts with multifunctional RNA-binding proteins such as HuR, NPM, and EXOSC10, but only in the presence of RNA (Doçi2012The).

NOL7 binds specifically to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNA, enhancing its stability and expression, which is crucial for its tumor-suppressive functions (Doçi2012The). This interaction is specific to mRNA, as demonstrated by experiments using oligo(dT) beads and western blotting, and is abolished by RNase treatment (Doçi2012The).

In the context of ribosome biogenesis, NOL7 interacts with the U3 snoRNP complex, which is essential for pre-rRNA processing. It is required for U3 snoRNP-mediated 5'ETS pre-rRNA processing, crucial for the production of the small subunit rRNA (McCool2022Human).
