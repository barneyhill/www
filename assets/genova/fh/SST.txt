# SST

## Overview
The SST gene encodes the peptide hormone somatostatin, which is a critical regulator of the endocrine system and various cellular processes. Somatostatin is categorized as a peptide hormone and functions primarily by inhibiting the secretion of other hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining homeostasis in hormone secretion and cellular growth (Ballian2006Somatostatin; Patel1999Somatostatin). The gene is located on chromosome 3q27.3 in humans and is expressed in multiple tissues, including the hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract (Günther2018International). Somatostatin exists in two main bioactive isoforms, somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28, which are involved in neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and hormonal regulation (Pradayrol1980N‐terminally; Günther2018International). The hormone exerts its effects through interactions with G protein-coupled receptors, influencing intracellular signaling pathways that modulate hormone secretion and cell proliferation (Günther2018International; Patel1999Somatostatin). Alterations in SST expression have been linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Fee2017SomatostatinPositive; Song2021The).

## Structure
The somatostatin (SST) gene encodes a peptide hormone that exists in two main bioactive isoforms: somatostatin-14 (SRIF-14) and somatostatin-28 (SRIF-28). SRIF-14 is a tetradecapeptide with a highly conserved primary structure across vertebrates, while SRIF-28 is an N-terminally extended form consisting of 28 amino acids (Pradayrol1980N‐terminally; Günther2018International). The primary structure of SRIF-14 is H-Ala-Gly-Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Cys-OH, featuring a cyclic conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds between two cysteine residues (Tostivint2019Revisiting; Brazeau1973Hypothalamic).

The secondary structure of somatostatin includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its bioactive form (Tostivint2019Revisiting). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and amidation are common, affecting the peptide's stability and activity (Ampofo2020Regulatory).

Somatostatin acts as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and hormone, with its expression regulated by growth factors, cytokines, and glucocorticoids (Günther2018International). The SST gene is located on chromosome 3q27.3 in humans and is expressed in various tissues, including the hypothalamus and gastrointestinal tract (Günther2018International).

## Function
The SST gene encodes somatostatin, a peptide hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating the endocrine system and various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, somatostatin primarily functions by inhibiting the secretion of several hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone (GH), which are vital for cell growth and metabolism (Ballian2006Somatostatin; Patel1999Somatostatin). This inhibition is essential for controlling cell proliferation, particularly in the pancreas, where somatostatin regulates the development and differentiation of endocrine cells during embryonic development (Ballian2006Somatostatin).

Somatostatin is active in various tissues, including the brain, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract, where it modulates neurotransmitter release and digestive processes (Patel1999Somatostatin). It acts through somatostatin receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that mediate its effects by reducing intracellular cAMP levels and calcium concentrations, thereby inhibiting hormone secretion and cell proliferation (Günther2018International; Patel1999Somatostatin). The SST gene's expression is regulated by multiple factors, including insulin and various cytokines, which influence its transcription and activity in a tissue-specific manner (Ballian2006Somatostatin; Patel1999Somatostatin). These regulatory mechanisms ensure that somatostatin maintains homeostasis in hormone secretion and cellular growth.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SST gene, which encodes the peptide hormone somatostatin, are implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Reduced SST expression is a common finding in major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). These deficits are associated with disrupted microcircuit information processing in cortical regions, leading to altered emotionality, cognitive deficits, and neuroendocrine changes (Fee2017SomatostatinPositive; Song2021The).

In Alzheimer's disease, a significant reduction in SST expression is observed in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, particularly in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and is linked to amyloid accumulation, suggesting a role in AD pathogenesis (Song2021The). In Parkinson's disease, decreased SST levels in cortical regions are associated with cognitive impairments, and mutations such as PARK2 may contribute to reduced SST transcripts and mitochondrial dysfunction (Song2021The).

In major depressive disorder, decreased SST levels correlate with elevated cortisol levels and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, with normalization upon recovery (Lin2015Somatostatin; Song2021The). SST deficits are also linked to hyperactivity of the HPA axis and behavioral changes in animal models, suggesting a causal role in mood dysregulation (Lin2015Somatostatin).

## Interactions
Somatostatin (SST) is a peptide hormone that interacts with various proteins in the human brain, influencing several physiological processes. SST binds to five G protein-coupled receptors (SSTR1 to SSTR5), inhibiting the release of hormones and neurotransmitters (Solarski2019The). Beyond these interactions, SST has been shown to bind selectively to members of the P-type ATPase family, particularly the sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase). This interaction involves the alpha and beta subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase, with a tryptophan residue within SST being critical for binding (Solarski2019The). SST28, a form of somatostatin, binds to multiple subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase, including alpha-1, alpha-2, alpha-3, and beta-1, as well as isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+-transporting ATPase (Solarski2019The).

SST also interacts with proteins involved in synaptic vesicle fusion, such as syntaxin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin, and with calcineurin, a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase (Solarski2019The). These interactions suggest that SST may play roles in modulating synaptic plasticity and intracellular calcium levels, potentially affecting conditions like Alzheimer's disease and hypertension (Solarski2019The). SST's interaction with these proteins highlights its broader physiological roles beyond receptor-mediated effects.
