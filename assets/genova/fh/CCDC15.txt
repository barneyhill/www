# CCDC15

## Overview
CCDC15, or coiled-coil domain containing 15, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of centrioles within human cells. The CCDC15 protein is categorized as a structural protein, specifically localizing to the centriole inner scaffold, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining centriole integrity and facilitating ciliogenesis. Throughout the cell cycle, CCDC15 is consistently present at the centrosome, indicating its involvement in centriole assembly and stability, which are crucial for proper cell division and the formation of primary cilia. The protein interacts with other centriolar proteins, such as POC5, POC1B, and FAM161A, forming a complex network essential for centriole function. These interactions underscore its role in maintaining centriole architecture and function, with implications for cellular processes and potential links to various cancers (Arslanhan2023CCDC15).

## Function
CCDC15 is a protein that localizes to the centriole inner scaffold and plays a crucial role in maintaining centriole integrity and ciliogenesis in human cells. It is consistently found at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle, with its presence marked by two foci in interphase and four foci from G2 through mitosis. CCDC15 is recruited to the centrioles during the later stages of centriole duplication, specifically to the central core of elongated centrioles, and its levels increase from early S phase until mitosis. This recruitment and expression pattern suggests that CCDC15 is involved in the assembly and stability of centrioles, which are essential for proper cell division and ciliogenesis (Arslanhan2023CCDC15).

CCDC15 interacts with other centriolar proteins such as POC5, Centrin-2, POC1B, and FAM161A, but not with SASS6, indicating its specific role in the centriole's inner scaffold. It affects centriole length and structure, as its centriolar coverage changes with the depletion of other scaffold proteins like POC5, POC1B, and FAM161A. CCDC15 and POC1B rely on each other for centriolar localization, and their co-depletion leads to increased centriole architecture abnormalities (Arslanhan2023CCDC15). CCDC15 is also essential for the assembly of signaling-competent primary cilia. Depletion of CCDC15 results in a reduced percentage of ciliated cells and shorter cilia (Arslanhan2023CCDC15).

## Clinical Significance
CCDC15 has been implicated in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) through its role in RNA splicing. The inclusion of exon 9 in the CCDC15 gene is repressed by ADAR1-mediated editing, which is associated with a less aggressive tumor phenotype. High expression of ADAR1 in ESCC tumors correlates with decreased inclusion of exon 9, suggesting that the exon 9-included isoform of CCDC15 may have oncogenic properties. Experiments have shown that knockdown of this isoform in EC109 cells results in reduced tumor aggressiveness, while its overexpression promotes tumorigenesis, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Tang2020Cis-).

In the context of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), CCDC15 is part of a nine-gene signature prognostic model that is associated with overall survival and clinical characteristics. This model highlights the significance of CCDC15 in predicting prognosis and its potential association with drug sensitivity, although specific diseases or conditions related to mutations in CCDC15 are not directly discussed in this context (Ye2020Bioinformatics).

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), CCDC15 was identified as having two targetable variants, suggesting potential clinical relevance, although specific conditions associated with these mutations are not detailed (Rodrigues2021Targeted).

## Interactions
CCDC15 is a protein that localizes to the centriole inner scaffold and plays a crucial role in maintaining centriole integrity and ciliogenesis. It interacts with several other centriole proteins, including POC5, POC1B, and FAM161A, indicating its involvement in a complex network of protein interactions essential for centriole function. CCDC15 partially co-localizes with these proteins and co-precipitates with them, suggesting physical interactions (Arslanhan2023CCDC15). The interaction between CCDC15 and POC1B is particularly significant, as they rely on each other for centriolar localization, and their co-depletion leads to increased centriole architecture abnormalities (Arslanhan2023CCDC15).

CCDC15 also influences the recruitment of other proteins to the centriole. Its depletion affects the recruitment of POC1B to the central core of centrioles and decreases the distal end localization of Centrin-2 and SFI1, suggesting that CCDC15 acts as a dual regulator of these proteins (Arslanhan2023CCDC15). Despite its central role in the centriole, CCDC15 does not interact with SASS6, a protein that does not localize to the inner scaffold (Arslanhan2023CCDC15). These interactions highlight CCDC15's role in maintaining centriole structure and function.
