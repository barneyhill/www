# HOXB1

## Overview
The HOXB1 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors critical for early developmental processes. The protein encoded by HOXB1, homeobox B1, is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development of the hindbrain and craniofacial structures. It is particularly significant in the specification and identity of facial motor neurons within rhombomere 4 (r4) of the developing hindbrain, where it ensures the proper formation of the facial nerve and associated structures (Arenkiel2004Hoxb1; Philippidou2013Hox). The HOXB1 protein functions through complex interactions with other proteins, such as Prep1 and Pbx1, forming ternary complexes that are essential for its regulatory activity (Ferretti2005Hoxb1). Mutations in the HOXB1 gene have been linked to congenital disorders, including hereditary congenital facial paresis, highlighting its clinical significance (Vogel2016Homozygous).

## Function
The HOXB1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of the hindbrain and craniofacial structures. It is specifically expressed in rhombomere 4 (r4) of the developing hindbrain, where it is essential for the proper specification and identity of facial motor neurons (MNs). In the absence of HOXB1, these neurons may acquire characteristics of other motor neurons, such as trigeminal MNs, leading to developmental defects like the loss of the facial nerve (Philippidou2013Hox).

HOXB1 is involved in the autoregulatory loop that maintains its expression in r4, a process dependent on cofactors such as exd/pbx proteins. These interactions are crucial for the spatially restricted expression of HOXB1, which is necessary for its role in specifying regional identity within the hindbrain (Pöpperl1995Segmental). The gene's expression is tightly regulated by both positive and negative regulatory regions, ensuring its precise function during development (Pöpperl1995Segmental).

In addition to its role in the central nervous system, HOXB1 also influences the development of peripheral tissues, including the neural crest derivatives that contribute to facial branchiomotor circuitry (Arenkiel2004Hoxb1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXB1 gene have been associated with several congenital disorders. Hereditary congenital facial paresis (HCFP) is linked to a homozygous loss-of-function mutation in HOXB1, which results in a truncated protein lacking the DNA-binding homeodomain. This mutation is associated with facial nerve palsy and external ear malformations, as the second pharyngeal arch contributes to the development of both the facial nerve and the external ear (Vogel2016Homozygous). The genetic heterogeneity of HCFP is noted, with only a small percentage of individuals carrying a HOXB1 mutation (Vogel2016Homozygous).

HOXB1 mutations have also been studied in relation to ventricular septal defect (VSD), a type of congenital heart defect. While variations in HOXB1, including a missense substitution and an intragenic duplication, have been identified in patients with VSD, these mutations are not considered the sole cause of the condition. The study suggests that VSD could be a characteristic of HOXB1 mutations but not an isolated manifestation (Pinard2018Analysis).

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), HOXB1 variants have been investigated, but studies have not found a significant association between these variants and ASD risk (Song2011An; Muscarella2010Candidate).

## Interactions
The HOXB1 protein is involved in complex interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in embryonic development. It forms ternary complexes with Prep1 and Pbx1, which are essential for its regulatory activity in the vertebrate hindbrain, particularly in the rhombomere 4 (r4) region (Ferretti2005Hoxb1). These interactions are mediated by specific binding sites within the Hoxb1 enhancer, including PM1, PM2, and R3, which facilitate the formation of these complexes (Ferretti2005Hoxb1).

The R3 site is particularly important for in vivo activity, while the R2/PM3 site can inhibit ternary complex formation, suggesting a modulatory role in the interaction between PM1 and R3 (Ferretti2005Hoxb1). The presence of these binding sites and their interactions with Prep1 and Pbx1 are crucial for the spatial restriction and modulation of Hoxb1 expression (Ferretti2005Hoxb1).

HOXB1 also interacts with chromatin regulators and the transcription machinery, influencing gene regulation by modulating chromatin conformation and interacting with factors like the Mediator complex (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of HOXB1 in transcriptional regulation during development.
