# SALL1

## Overview
SALL1 is a gene that encodes the spalt like transcription factor 1, a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various developmental processes. The SALL1 protein is characterized by multiple zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating differentiation pathways. SALL1 interacts with key pluripotency factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, influencing gene expression and protein stability. Mutations in the SALL1 gene are associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome, a disorder marked by congenital malformations. The gene's function and its mutations' impact on development underscore its significance in both normal physiology and disease (Marlin1999TownesBrocks; Karantzali2011Sall1; Kohlhase2000SALL1; Giordano2021SALL1).

## Structure
The SALL1 protein is a zinc finger transcription factor characterized by multiple zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein structure includes four highly conserved C2H2 double zinc finger domains distributed throughout the protein, with an additional single C2H2 motif attached to the second domain and a C2HC motif located at the amino terminus (Kohlhase2000SALL1). These zinc finger domains are believed to have DNA-binding properties, supporting SALL1's role as a developmental regulator (Kohlhase2000SALL1).

SALL1 also contains a glutamine-rich region and a conserved twelve-amino-acid domain at the N-terminal region responsible for repression activity (Álvarez2021SALL). The protein interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes such as NuRD, which is crucial for its function in development and cancer (Álvarez2021SALL). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate SALL1's interaction with these complexes, influencing its role in processes like kidney development and cancer cell growth inhibition (Álvarez2021SALL).

The SALL1 gene consists of three coding exons, with exon 2 being the largest and containing most known mutations (Kohlhase2000SALL1). These mutations often lead to truncated proteins, affecting the protein's function and localization (SakakiYumoto2006The).

## Function
SALL1 (spalt like transcription factor 1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a significant role in embryonic development and cellular differentiation. In healthy human cells, SALL1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by binding to DNA. It is involved in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and regulating differentiation pathways, particularly in the context of stem cell biology and organ development (Karantzali2011Sall1).

SALL1 interacts with key pluripotency factors such as Nanog and Sox2, forming part of a regulatory network that contributes to pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic stem cells. It enhances the transcriptional activity of Nanog, acting as a co-activator, despite its known repressor functions (Karantzali2011Sall1). SALL1 also modulates the stability and function of the CBX4 protein, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which is involved in transcriptional repression during development. By reducing the ubiquitination of CBX4, SALL1 stabilizes it, preventing its degradation and enhancing its transcriptional repression capacity (Giordano2021SALL1).

SALL1's role in regulating gene expression and protein stability is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes and development, particularly in the formation of organs such as limbs, kidneys, and the nervous system (Giordano2021SALL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SALL1 gene are primarily associated with Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a range of congenital malformations, including anal, thumb, ear, and renal anomalies (Marlin1999TownesBrocks; Liberalesso2017Phenotypic). The majority of SALL1 mutations result in premature termination codons, leading to truncated proteins that disrupt normal development (Kiefer2008SALL1). These mutations often occur in exon 2 and are associated with a classical TBS phenotype, including congenital heart defects (Botzenhart2005SALL1).

The pathogenesis of TBS is complex, with evidence suggesting both haploinsufficiency and dominant-negative effects of truncated proteins (Kiefer2008SALL1; Borozdin2006Detection). Some mutations escape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), leading to the production of truncated proteins that may exert dominant-negative effects, contributing to the severity of the phenotype (Furniss2007Nonsense‐mediated). The clinical presentation of TBS is highly variable, with some cases exhibiting additional features such as cryptorchidism and dorsal hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (Botzenhart2005SALL1). Understanding the molecular mechanisms of SALL1 mutations is crucial for interpreting genotype-phenotype relationships in TBS (Miller2012Implications).

## Interactions
SALL1, a zinc finger transcription factor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in developmental processes. SALL1 interacts with CBX4, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), in a SUMOylation-independent manner. This interaction occurs in the nucleoplasm and is not dependent on the SUMOylation status of SALL1, as demonstrated by various experimental approaches including CBX4-BioID and GFP-Trap-based pulldown assays (Giordano2021SALL1). SALL1 stabilizes CBX4 by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This stabilization leads to an increase in the number and size of CBX4-containing Polycomb bodies, enhancing the repression of CBX4 target genes (Giordano2021SALL1).

SALL1 also interacts with RUNX2, a key transcription factor in bone development, to regulate odontoblastic differentiation. This interaction involves remodeling open chromatin regions, although SALL1 does not directly bind to chromatin. Instead, it forms a complex with RUNX2, influencing the expression of genes related to odontoblast development (Lin2020SALL1). These interactions highlight SALL1's role in modulating protein stability and gene expression through its interactions with other transcription factors.
