# PRKD3

## Overview
PRKD3 is a gene that encodes the protein kinase D3, a serine/threonine kinase involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and survival. The protein kinase D3 is integral to the regulation of the Golgi apparatus and vesicle trafficking, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting and secretion (Baker2018Protein). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to external stimuli and contributes to the regulation of gene expression (Baker2018Protein). PRKD3 is also implicated in the modulation of matrix metalloproteinases, which are crucial for tissue remodeling and repair (Baker2018Protein). Beyond its physiological roles, PRKD3 has been associated with various cancers, where it interacts with multiple proteins to influence cancer cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2021Inhibition; Varga2023Protein).

## Structure


## Function
Protein kinase D3 (PRKD3) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, PRKD3 plays a crucial role in regulating the Golgi apparatus and vesicle trafficking, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting and secretion (Baker2018Protein). PRKD3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to external stimuli and contributes to the regulation of gene expression (Baker2018Protein).

PRKD3 is also involved in the modulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP1 and MMP13, in human chondrocytes. These enzymes are critical for the breakdown of extracellular matrix components, a process that is vital for tissue remodeling and repair (Baker2018Protein). PRKD3's activity is linked to the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as STAT3 and AP-1 complexes, which are important for the expression of MMPs (Baker2018Protein). This kinase is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its role in mediating inflammatory responses and maintaining tissue integrity under normal physiological conditions (Baker2018Protein).

## Clinical Significance
PRKD3 (protein kinase D3) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In melanoma, PRKD3 inhibition has been shown to sensitize cells to RAF and MEK inhibitors, particularly in those with the BRAF (V600E) mutation. This suggests that targeting PRKD3 could be a strategy to overcome resistance to these inhibitors by preventing the reactivation of MAPK signaling, a common resistance mechanism (Chen2011Protein).

In prostate cancer, PRKD3 expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA PCA3, which is activated by the transcription factor Snail. This interaction affects PRKD3 expression through the sponging of microRNA-1261, leading to increased invasion and migration of cancer cells. High PRKD3 expression is associated with aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes (He2016Snailactivated).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PRKD3 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the CLU protein by inhibiting its lysosomal degradation. This stabilization promotes tumor growth, and PRKD3 is highly expressed in TNBC tumors. Targeting the PRKD3-CLU axis has shown potential in suppressing tumor growth, highlighting PRKD3 as a therapeutic target in TNBC (Liu2021Inhibition). 

Overall, PRKD3's role in cancer progression underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various malignancies.

## Interactions
Protein Kinase D3 (PRKD3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. PRKD3 interacts with Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90), which is essential for its stability and function in promoting prostate cancer cell migration. This interaction is not due to sequence homology with PKD2 but rather the thermodynamic instability of PRKD3, which Hsp90 stabilizes (Varga2023Protein). In prostate cancer, PRKD3 also interacts with proteins such as Akt, Erk1/2, and MMPs, affecting cell migration and potentially other cancer-related processes like cell invasion and proliferation (Varga2023Protein).

In breast cancer, PRKD3 is involved in the ERK1/c-MYC axis, where it mediates the phosphorylation of ERK1, which in turn phosphorylates c-MYC at Ser62. This stabilizes c-MYC and upregulates its target genes, promoting cell proliferation (Liu2020Protein). PRKD3 also interacts with Clusterin (CLU) in triple-negative breast cancer, stabilizing CLU and preventing its lysosomal degradation, which is crucial for tumor growth (Liu2021Inhibition). These interactions highlight PRKD3's role in oncogenic signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
