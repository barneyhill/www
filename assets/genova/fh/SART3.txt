# SART3

## Overview
The SART3 gene encodes the spliceosome-associated factor 3, a protein integral to the recycling of U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) within the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing. This protein, characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities and involvement in protein-protein interactions, plays a pivotal role in the assembly and disassembly of spliceosomal complexes, thereby ensuring efficient splicing and cell cycle progression (El2022A; Song2010The). SART3 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing RNA processing and spliceosome dynamics (Sherman2019The). Mutations in the SART3 gene have been linked to spliceosomopathy, a condition marked by developmental and neurological defects, highlighting its clinical significance (Ayers2023Variants).

## Structure
The SART3 protein, encoded by the SART3 gene, is composed of 963 amino acids and features several critical domains that contribute to its function in spliceosome recycling and RNA binding. It contains 12 half-a-tetratricopeptide (HAT) repeats, which are essential for protein-protein interactions and splicing activity (Ayers2023Variants). The protein also includes two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), located at positions 706-777 and 803-873, which are involved in RNA binding (Harada2001Binding). Additionally, SART3 has a nuclear localization signal (NLS) around positions 612-615 and 641-647, facilitating its transport into the nucleus (Harada2001Binding).

The C-terminal region of SART3, spanning residues 660-963, is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as TUT1, and plays a role in deubiquitination processes (Kim2020USP15). SART3 also interacts with ubiquitin-specific proteases USP15 and USP4, with specific residues like p.Arg493Trp being involved in these interactions (Ayers2023Variants). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its function (Harada2001Binding). SART3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its role in spliceosome assembly and function (Song2010The).

## Function
SART3, also known as spliceosome-associated factor 3, plays a critical role in the splicing of pre-mRNA by facilitating the recycling of U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) within the spliceosome. It acts as a substrate targeting factor for the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp4, promoting the deubiquitination of Prp3, a component of the U4 snRNP. This process is essential for the proper rearrangement and recycling of spliceosomal components, ensuring efficient splicing and cell cycle progression (Song2010The).

SART3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and disassembly of spliceosomal complexes. It interacts with U6 snRNA, playing a role in U6 biogenesis, splicing function, and recycling. SART3's interaction with U6 is crucial for unwinding the U6 internal stem-loop and annealing U4 to U6, which is vital for spliceosome function (El2022A).

The protein also influences cell cycle regulation, as its depletion can lead to chromosome missegregation and spindle defects. This indicates its importance in maintaining proper cell cycle progression and cellular function (Song2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SART3 gene are associated with a condition termed spliceosomopathy, characterized by failure of testis development and neuronal defects. This condition, also referred to as INDYGON syndrome, includes symptoms such as intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and gonadal dysgenesis in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype (Ayers2023Variants). The SART3 gene encodes an RNA-binding protein crucial for spliceosome function, and its variants can lead to significant developmental and neurological issues (Ayers2023Variants).

Bi-allelic variants in SART3 have been identified in individuals with intellectual disability, brain anomalies, and gonadal dysgenesis, indicating its role in both the male reproductive and central nervous systems (Ayers2023Variants). The mutations disrupt differentiation into neural and gonadal lineages, affecting the expression of key genes involved in these processes (Ayers2023Variants). Studies using induced pluripotent stem cells with SART3 variants have shown disrupted signaling pathways and aberrant differentiation into gonadal and neuronal cells (Ayers2023Variants).

The clinical significance of SART3 mutations is underscored by their potential to inform early diagnosis and guide treatment to prevent comorbidities such as ataxia and intellectual disability (Ayers2023Variants).

## Interactions
SART3, also known as spliceosome-associated factor 3, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and spliceosome dynamics. SART3 specifically interacts with pre-miR-34a, influencing miRNA regulation and potentially affecting cell cycle arrest in lung cancer cells. This interaction is mediated by its C-terminal RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for specific binding to pre-miR-34a (Sherman2019The).

SART3 also interacts with the pre-mRNA splicing factor RNPS1. This interaction involves the C-terminal domains of SART3 and the N-terminal domain of RNPS1, which contains a serine-rich region. The complex formation between SART3 and RNPS1 is implicated in the regulation of mRNA splicing (Harada2001Binding).

SART3 is known to interact with ubiquitin-specific proteases USP15 and USP4, affecting the stability of proteins involved in NF-kB signaling. It acts as a substrate targeting factor for the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp4, facilitating the deubiquitination of the U4 component Prp3, which is crucial for spliceosome recycling (Ayers2023Variants; Song2010The).

Additionally, SART3 forms a complex with the long non-coding RNA LASTR, which modulates its interactions with U4 and U6 snRNPs, influencing spliceosome assembly and disassembly (De2020Stressinduced).
