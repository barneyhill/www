# CD207

## Overview
CD207 is a gene that encodes the protein langerin, a type-II transmembrane C-type lectin receptor predominantly expressed on Langerhans cells, which are specialized dendritic cells found in the epidermis and mucosal tissues. Langerin plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the recognition and internalization of pathogens through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which binds to mannose-rich and other complex glycans in a calcium-dependent manner (Plzák2002AnalysisofbindingofmannosidesinrelationtoLangerin(CD207); van2019A page 0 of 4). This protein is integral to the formation of Birbeck granules, unique organelles within Langerhans cells that facilitate antigen processing and presentation (Valladeau2000Langerin; Figdor2002Ctype). Despite its critical functions, the absence of langerin does not completely impair antigen presentation, suggesting compensatory mechanisms exist within the immune system (Kissenpfennig2005Disruption). Mutations in the CD207 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), highlighting its importance in both health and disease (RodriguezGalindo2020Langerhans).

## Structure
The CD207 protein, also known as langerin, is a type-II transmembrane protein belonging to the C-type lectin family. It is encoded by a 1565-bp cDNA sequence, which includes a 993-bp open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 331 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37.5 kDa (Valladeau2002Identification). The primary structure of CD207 includes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with a glutamate-proline-asparagine motif, indicating mannose-type specificity (Valladeau2002Identification). The protein also features a hydrophobic signal anchor and two potential N-glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications (Valladeau2002Identification).

The secondary structure of CD207 is suggested to involve alpha-helices and beta-sheets, particularly within the CRD (Valladeau2002Identification). The neck domain, encoded by a single exon, contains heptad repeats that may form an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure, facilitating dimerization or multimerization (Takahara2002Identification). This oligomerization is crucial for the protein's function, as it allows for efficient sugar binding and receptor activity (Riedl2004Identification).

An alternatively spliced isoform, DE3Langerin, lacks the neck domain, which is essential for trimerization and efficient oligosaccharide binding (Riedl2004Identification). This isoform does not induce Birbeck granule formation or bind mannan, highlighting the functional importance of the neck domain (Riedl2004Identification).

## Function
The CD207 gene encodes langerin, a C-type lectin receptor specifically expressed on Langerhans cells, a subset of dendritic cells located in the epidermis and mucosal epithelium. Langerin plays a crucial role in the immune system by facilitating the recognition and uptake of pathogens through its carbohydrate recognition domain, which binds to various ligands, including mannose-rich glycoproteins, sulfated glycans, and complex bacterial glycans, in a calcium-dependent manner (Plzák2002AnalysisofbindingofmannosidesinrelationtoLangerin(CD207)inLangerhanscellsofnormalandtransformedepithelia page 0 of 2; van2019A page 0 of 4).

Langerin is involved in the formation of Birbeck granules, unique organelles within Langerhans cells that are implicated in the internalization and processing of antigens. These granules facilitate the endocytosis of pathogens, such as bacteria and yeast, and their subsequent routing to intracellular compartments for antigen presentation (Valladeau2000Langerin; Figdor2002Ctype). Despite its role in Birbeck granule formation, studies have shown that the absence of langerin does not significantly impair the antigen-presenting function of Langerhans cells, indicating that other mechanisms can compensate for its loss (Kissenpfennig2005Disruption).

Langerin's ability to bind and internalize pathogens is essential for immune surveillance and response, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms against infections (van2019A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD207 gene, which encodes the protein langerin, have significant clinical implications. Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a condition associated with the abnormal proliferation of CD207+ cells. This disease is characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid precursors that differentiate into CD1a+/CD207+ cells, leading to lesions with systemic involvement and potential long-term complications (RodriguezGalindo2020Langerhans). The pathogenic cells in LCH are marked by constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, often involving mutations such as BRAFV600E (Lim2020Circulating).

In addition to LCH, genetic variations in the CD207 gene can affect immune responses to pathogens. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the langerin gene, such as N288D and K313I, alter the receptor's ligand binding and internalization capabilities. These SNPs reduce the receptor's affinity for certain ligands and compromise the uptake of Staphylococcus aureus by Langerhans cells, potentially increasing susceptibility to infections (van2019A). These findings highlight the role of CD207 in both disease pathology and immune function, emphasizing the clinical significance of its genetic and functional alterations.

## Interactions
CD207, also known as langerin, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of immune responses. Langerin is a C-type lectin receptor that can bind to mannose and related sugars, facilitating the internalization and processing of pathogens. It is known to interact with glycosylated proteins and pathogens, such as Shigella sonnei and Staphylococcus aureus, through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (van2017Staphylococcus; Wu2021Loss).

Langerin can also physically interact with other proteins in the cell culture environment. For instance, studies have shown that the extracellular domain of mouse Langerin can bind to various proteins in the CHO cell culture supernatant, indicating potential physical interactions (Cheong2007Production). However, specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.

In addition to its role in pathogen recognition, langerin is involved in the formation of Birbeck granules, which are unique organelles in Langerhans cells. These granules are associated with antigen presentation and may involve interactions with other lectins, such as galectin-3, which becomes a constituent of Birbeck granules and interacts with glycan chains of laminin, tetraspanins, or integrins (Plzák2002AnalysisofbindingofmannosidesinrelationtoLangerin(CD207)inLangerhanscellsofnormalandtransformedepithelia page 0 of 2).
