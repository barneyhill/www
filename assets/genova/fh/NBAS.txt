# NBAS

## Overview
The NBAS gene encodes a multifunctional protein that is a subunit of the NRZ tethering complex, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as vesicular transport and mRNA surveillance. The NBAS protein is integral to the syntaxin 18 complex, facilitating Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrograde transport, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein secretion (Longman2020Identification). Additionally, NBAS is involved in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, where it interacts with the core NMD factor UPF1 to regulate the degradation of mRNAs with premature termination codons, thus ensuring the quality control of ER-translated mRNAs (Longman2020Identification). Beyond its cellular functions, NBAS is crucial for immune cell activity, particularly in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, where it influences the degranulation pathway (Bi2022NBAS). Mutations in the NBAS gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including recurrent acute liver failure and Short Stature, Optic Nerve Atrophy, and Pelger-Huët Anomaly (SOPH) syndrome, highlighting its significance in human health (Haack2015Biallelic; Carli2019NBAS).

## Structure


## Function
The NBAS gene encodes a protein that plays a dual role in human cells, primarily involved in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway and Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrograde transport. As a component of the Syntaxin 18 complex, NBAS is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the ER, a process essential for proper protein secretion and organelle integrity (Longman2020Identification).

In the NMD pathway, NBAS interacts with the core NMD factor UPF1, recruiting it to the ER membrane to regulate the degradation of mRNAs with premature termination codons. This function is vital for preventing the accumulation of truncated proteins and ensuring the quality control of ER-translated mRNAs, particularly those involved in the cellular stress response (Longman2020Identification).

NBAS also plays a significant role in immune cell function, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, where it is involved in the degranulation pathway. This process is critical for the transport and recycling of cytotoxic vesicles, impacting the immune response (Bi2022NBAS). Overall, NBAS is essential for maintaining cellular function and response to stress (Longman2020Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NBAS gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions affecting multiple systems. One of the primary conditions linked to NBAS mutations is recurrent acute liver failure (RALF) with onset in infancy. This condition is characterized by episodes of liver failure triggered by febrile illnesses, with symptoms such as elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, jaundice, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. Despite the severity of these episodes, liver function typically recovers completely between crises (Haack2015Biallelic; Jiang2021Case).

NBAS mutations are also implicated in Short Stature, Optic Nerve Atrophy, and Pelger-Huët Anomaly (SOPH) syndrome, which involves skeletal, ocular, and immune system abnormalities without hepatic involvement (Carli2019NBAS). Additionally, NBAS mutations can cause a multisystem disorder affecting bone, connective tissue, liver, immune system, and retina, with symptoms resembling congenital disorders of glycosylation (Segarra2015NBAS).

The gene is also linked to atypical osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by bone fragility, developmental delay, and immunodeficiency. This is due to NBAS's role in collagen expression and bone mineralization (Balasubramanian2017Compound; Segarra2015NBAS). The phenotypic spectrum of NBAS deficiency is broad, encompassing skeletal, hepatic, metabolic, and immunologic aspects (Segarra2015NBAS).

## Interactions
The NBAS protein is a component of the syntaxin 18 complex, which is involved in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum retrograde transport. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including p31 (also known as USE1), Sec22b, BNIP1, Sly1, ZW10, and RINT1 (Granata2023Modulation). These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the syntaxin 18 complex in vesicle trafficking.

NBAS also plays a role in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, where it interacts with core NMD factors and participates in a feedback mechanism that regulates endogenous RNA targets (Longman2013DHX34). This interaction is part of an autoregulatory circuit that is conserved across different organisms.

In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, NBAS has been shown to co-localize with the viral N and S proteins. The co-localization with the N protein remains stable over 24 hours post-infection, while the co-localization with the S protein decreases over time. This suggests that NBAS may interact with these viral proteins during infection, potentially influencing the host-pathogen interface (Granata2023Modulation).
