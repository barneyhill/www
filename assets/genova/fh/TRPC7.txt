# TRPC7

## Overview
TRPC7 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 7, a protein that belongs to the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family. This protein functions as a non-selective cation channel, primarily facilitating the influx of calcium ions into cells, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as signal transduction and calcium homeostasis (Numaga2007TRPC7). TRPC7 is characterized by its structure of six transmembrane segments and a pore region, allowing it to form both homomeric and heteromeric assemblies with other TRPC subfamily members (Dietrich2005Functional). The channel is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and is involved in receptor-operated calcium entry (ROC), playing a significant role in maintaining intracellular calcium levels (Dietrich2005Functional). TRPC7 is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system and peripheral organs, suggesting its involvement in diverse physiological roles (Numaga2007TRPC7). Its interactions with proteins such as calmodulin and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) further underscore its importance in calcium signaling pathways (Asghar2020Transient).

## Structure
The TRPC7 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel family, characterized by its structure comprising six transmembrane segments and a pore region, with intracellular N- and C-terminal domains (Numaga2007TRPC7). The protein is encoded by the TRPC7 gene, which consists of 12 exons and produces a protein of 862 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 100 kDa (Numaga2007TRPC7). TRPC7 shares high sequence homology with TRPC3 and TRPC6, including a conserved selectivity filter crucial for ion discrimination (Bacsa2020Mechanisms).

The TRPC7 protein can form homomeric and heteromeric assemblies with other TRPC subfamily members, contributing to its quaternary structure (Dietrich2005Functional). It is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and is involved in receptor-operated Ca2+ entry (ROC) (Dietrich2005Functional). There are two splice variants of the mouse TRPC7, which involve deletions in the transmembrane segment S1 region, although specific details on human splice variants are not provided (Numaga2007TRPC7). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which can regulate channel activity (Dietrich2005Functional).

## Function
TRPC7, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, functions as a non-selective cation channel that facilitates the influx of calcium and other cations into cells. It is activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and calcium homeostasis (Numaga2007TRPC7). In healthy human cells, TRPC7 plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for numerous physiological processes such as muscle contraction and neuronal signaling (Numaga2007TRPC7).

TRPC7 is primarily active in the plasma membrane of cells, where it contributes to the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis. The channel's activity is modulated by extracellular calcium, which can negatively regulate its function, highlighting its role in fine-tuning calcium entry into cells (Numaga2007TRPC7).

The expression of TRPC7 varies across different tissues, with high levels observed in the central nervous system, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, and in peripheral tissues such as the pituitary gland and kidney. These expression patterns suggest that TRPC7 may have distinct physiological roles in different tissues (Numaga2007TRPC7).

## Clinical Significance
The TRPC7 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In the context of skin health, TRPC7 is associated with UVB-induced skin aging and tumorigenesis. Studies have shown that TRPC7 knockout mice exhibit reduced UVB-induced senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) activation and fewer tumors, suggesting that TRPC7 contributes to skin cancer development by promoting genomic instability and mutations in genes like the p53 family (Hsu2019Nociceptive).

In bipolar-I disorder (BD-I), altered TRPC7 expression has been observed. Patients with BD-I and high intracellular calcium levels show significantly reduced TRPC7 mRNA levels, indicating a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology. This reduction in TRPC7 expression may be linked to abnormal calcium homeostasis, a known factor in BD (Yoon2001Altered).

A specific mutation, Trpc7 K810Stop, identified in mice, results in distinct morphological and behavioral changes, suggesting a dominant negative effect. This mutation leads to a truncated protein affecting the conserved cytoplasmic C terminus, although its clinical significance in humans remains unclear (Rathkolb2021Distinct). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of TRPC7 in various conditions, particularly those involving calcium homeostasis and genomic stability.

## Interactions
TRPC7, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. It interacts with calmodulin and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R), which are crucial for its role in calcium signaling pathways (Asghar2020Transient). TRPC7 also forms complexes with other TRP channels, such as TRPC1 and TRPC3, to function as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels in certain cell types (Asghar2020Transient). 

In the context of cellular adhesion and motility, TRPC7 interacts with proteoglycans like syndecan-1 and syndecan-4. These interactions are part of focal adhesions that facilitate dynamic cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Syndecan-4 specifically regulates TRPC7 channel function and TRPC7-mediated calcium entry through regulatory phosphorylation at Ser714 (Curcic2019TRPCmediated). 

These interactions highlight TRPC7's role in modulating calcium signaling and its involvement in cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, and potentially in pathological conditions like cancer and cardiac function. The regulation of TRPC7 through these interactions underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological stimuli.
