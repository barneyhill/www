# OR51F1

## Overview
The OR51F1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily F member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are typically involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. The protein encoded by OR51F1 is a transmembrane receptor, characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a hallmark of GPCRs. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, emerging research has implicated OR51F1 in various clinical contexts, including autism spectrum disorder, kidney transplant rejection, and certain cancers, suggesting a broader biological significance beyond olfaction (Li2017Wholegenome; Tylee2016Blood; Pineda2017Novel).

## Clinical Significance
The OR51F1 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its altered expression and genetic variations. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OR51F1 is notably under-expressed in individuals with the condition. This finding aligns with previous meta-analyses, suggesting a consistent pattern of differential expression in ASD cases (Tylee2016Blood).

In the context of kidney transplants, OR51F1 has been associated with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). The gene contains multiple variants, including non-synonymous ones, which may alter mRNA and protein expression, potentially triggering an immune response that leads to renal allograft rejection. This highlights the gene's potential role in transplant outcomes, emphasizing the importance of non-HLA mismatched variants in predicting AMR risk (Pineda2017Novel).

In cancer research, OR51F1 has been identified with somatic non-synonymous coding variations in metastatic small-cell gallbladder neuroendocrine carcinoma (GB-SCNEC). However, the specific role of these variations in cancer progression remains unclear, as the study primarily focuses on other genes with more pronounced effects (Li2017Wholegenome).
