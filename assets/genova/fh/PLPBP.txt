# PLPBP

## Overview
The PLPBP gene encodes the pyridoxal phosphate binding protein, a crucial component in the regulation of vitamin B6 metabolism. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining the homeostasis of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6, which is essential for numerous enzymatic reactions, particularly those related to amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Structurally, PLPBP is characterized by a modified TIM barrel fold typical of type III PLP-dependent enzymes, allowing it to form a Schiff base with PLP, which is vital for its biological activity (Tremiño2018Insight; Fux2019Biochemical). Functionally, PLPBP acts as a transporter and storage protein for PLP, preventing its degradation and side reactivity within the cell (Ahmed2020Vitamin). Mutations in the PLPBP gene are linked to vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, underscoring its importance in neurological health (Tremiño2022The). The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal proteins further suggest a role in cellular structure and division, highlighting its multifaceted functions within the cell (Fux2019Biochemical).

## Structure
The human PLPBP (pyridoxal phosphate binding protein) is involved in vitamin B6 metabolism and exhibits a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PLPBP consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that facilitate its function in binding pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) (Tremiño2018Insight). The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Tremiño2018Insight).

The tertiary structure of PLPBP is characterized by a modified TIM barrel fold typical of type III PLP-dependent enzymes, which is crucial for its role in PLP homeostasis (Tremiño2018Insight). This structure allows PLPBP to form a Schiff base with PLP, a key interaction for its biological activity (Fux2019Biochemical).

PLPBP predominantly exists as a dimer, although it can also be found in a monomeric form. The dimerization is independent of disulfide bonds and the presence of PLP, suggesting a structural role in protecting the PLP binding site (Fux2019Biochemical). The protein's quaternary structure, therefore, involves the assembly of these dimeric units, which may influence its functional properties in cellular processes (Fux2019Biochemical).

## Function
The pyridoxal phosphate binding protein (PLPBP) plays a crucial role in maintaining pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) homeostasis in human cells. PLP, the active form of vitamin B6, is essential for numerous enzymatic reactions, particularly those involved in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis (Ahmed2020Vitamin). PLPBP is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it functions as a transporter of PLP to apo-enzymes, preventing its side reactivity and degradation (Ahmed2020Vitamin).

PLPBP is primarily dimeric, which may influence cofactor accessibility and suggest a role as a PLP storage protein (Fux2019Biochemical). The protein interacts with cytosolic proteins, especially those associated with the cytoskeleton and cell division, indicating its involvement in these cellular processes (Fux2019Biochemical). Knockout studies in HEK293 cells have shown that the absence of PLPBP leads to the upregulation of proteins related to cytoskeleton organization and cell division, and the downregulation of enzymes important for hydrogen sulfide synthesis, such as cystathionine γ-lyase and cystathionine β-synthase (Fux2019Biochemical).

Mutations in the PLPBP gene can lead to vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, highlighting its importance in neurological health (Tremiño2022The). These mutations often result in decreased PLP binding, reduced protein levels, or decreased thermal stability, leading to a loss of function (Tremiño2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLPBP gene are associated with vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy, a condition characterized by seizures that are resistant to standard antiepileptic drugs but respond to vitamin B6 supplementation, such as pyridoxine or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) (Heath2020Early‐onset; Shiraku2018PLPBP). This condition often presents in early infancy with refractory seizures and can lead to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, intellectual disability, and other neurological impairments if not treated promptly (Heath2020Early‐onset; Shiraku2018PLPBP).

PLPBP mutations can result in a variety of phenotypes, including microcephaly, structural brain abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis (Heath2020Early‐onset; Pal2021A). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg241Gln, have been linked to milder phenotypes, while others, like p.Leu175Pro, lead to severe protein misfolding and absence of the PLPHP protein, contributing to more severe disease manifestations (Tremiño2018Insight; Heath2020Early‐onset).

The PLPBP gene is crucial for maintaining PLP homeostasis, and its dysfunction can disrupt vitamin B6 metabolism, affecting neurological health (Fux2019Biochemical). Early diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B6 are essential to manage symptoms and improve neurological outcomes (Pal2021A; Shiraku2018PLPBP).

## Interactions
The pyridoxal phosphate binding protein (PLPBP) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily associated with cytoskeleton organization and cell division. Studies have shown that PLPBP interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, including those necessary for microtubule nucleation and actin filament growth (Fux2019Biochemical). These interactions suggest a role for PLPBP in maintaining cellular structure and function, which may be linked to its involvement in vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy (Fux2019Biochemical).

PLPBP predominantly exists as a dimer, which is stabilized by chemical cross-linking, and this dimerization is crucial for its function. The dimeric form of PLPBP has been shown to have reduced solvent exposure of its cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), which may indicate a regulatory mechanism in its interactions (Fux2019Biochemical). The dimerization involves the PLP-binding site K47, which may shield the cofactor during transport or storage (Fux2019Biochemical).

Despite its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, PLPBP does not appear to deliver PLP to apo-enzymes as previously thought. Instead, its interactions are more aligned with cytoskeletal organization and cell division, similar to another PLP-binding protein, chronophin (PLPP) (Aleshin2023Protein–Protein).
