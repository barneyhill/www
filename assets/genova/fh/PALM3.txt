# PALM3

## Overview
The PALM3 gene encodes the protein paralemmin 3, a member of the paralemmin family, which is involved in membrane dynamics and signaling. Paralemmin 3 is a lipid-anchored membrane protein, characterized by its anchorage to the plasma membrane through prenylation and di-palmitoylation of a C-terminal cysteine cluster. This protein is distinct from other paralemmin isoforms due to its unique structural features, such as the absence of the MIF motif. Functionally, paralemmin 3 plays a significant role in the inflammatory response, particularly within the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, where it interacts with key adaptor proteins to facilitate the formation of signaling complexes. These interactions are crucial for the activation of transcription factors that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The expression of PALM3 is notably upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, underscoring its involvement in immune responses and its potential clinical significance in inflammatory lung conditions such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Chen2017Downregulation; Chen2017Paralemmin3).

## Structure
The PALM3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the paralemmin family, which is involved in membrane dynamics and signaling. PALM3 is a lipid-anchored membrane protein, anchored to the plasma membrane through prenylation and di-palmitoylation of a C-terminal cysteine cluster known as the CaaX motif (Hultqvist2012Evolution; Li2016Silencing). This post-translational modification is crucial for its membrane association and function.

The primary structure of PALM3 includes a longer amino acid sequence compared to other paralemmin isoforms, due to an earlier start of its last large exon (Hultqvist2012Evolution). Unlike other paralemmin proteins, PALM3 lacks the MIF motif, a conserved sequence found in other family members, indicating a unique structural feature (Hultqvist2012Evolution).

PALM3 is involved in the inflammatory response, particularly in the context of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced signaling pathways. It interacts with key adaptor proteins in the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway, such as TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and TICAM-2, suggesting a role in linking membrane proteins to intracellular signaling components (Chen2017Paralemmin3). The protein's expression is upregulated in response to LPS, highlighting its involvement in immune responses (Chen2017Paralemmin3).

## Function
Paralemmin-3 (PALM3) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes related to membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. It is a lipid-anchored membrane protein, anchored to the plasma membrane through prenylation and di-palmitoylation of a C-terminal cysteine cluster (Li2016Silencing). PALM3 is speculated to function as an adaptor protein, linking intrinsic membrane proteins to each other, to the cytoskeleton, or to motor proteins, which suggests a role in maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport (Chen2017Paralemmin3).

In the context of inflammation, PALM3 is involved in the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, which is crucial for the immune response to bacterial infections. It interacts with key adaptor proteins such as MyD88, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6, facilitating the formation of signaling complexes that lead to the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB and IRF3 (Chen2017Paralemmin3). These interactions result in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting PALM3's role in modulating inflammatory responses (Chen2017Paralemmin3). The protein's activity is primarily observed in alveolar macrophages, where it influences cytokine secretion and inflammatory signaling pathways (Chen2017Paralemmin3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PALM3 gene have been implicated in inflammatory lung conditions, particularly acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Studies have shown that PALM3 expression is upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which is a model for inducing inflammation in lung tissues. This upregulation is associated with increased inflammatory responses, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-β, and decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Chen2017Paralemmin3).

Downregulation of PALM3 has been shown to ameliorate LPS-induced ALI by reducing the formation of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complexes, which are critical in the inflammatory signaling pathway. This downregulation leads to decreased activation of transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3, resulting in reduced inflammation and improved survival rates in animal models (Chen2017Downregulation). The therapeutic potential of targeting PALM3 to manage excessive inflammation in ALI and ARDS is highlighted by these findings, suggesting that modulating PALM3 expression could be a viable strategy for reducing lung injury and improving clinical outcomes (Chen2017Downregulation; Li2016Silencing).

## Interactions
Paralemmin-3 (PALM3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in inflammatory signaling pathways. PALM3 interacts with key adaptor proteins in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, including TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and TICAM-2. These interactions are ligand-dependent and occur after LPS stimulation, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (Chen2017Paralemmin3). PALM3 is also identified as a binding partner of the single immunoglobulin IL-1 receptor-related molecule (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of TLR signaling. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells (Chen2011A).

The downregulation of PALM3 has been shown to reduce the formation of TLR4/MyD88 and TLR4/TRIF complexes, which are crucial for TLR4 signaling, suggesting that PALM3 may act as a bridge linking TLR4 to these adaptor proteins (Chen2017Downregulation). These interactions highlight PALM3's role in modulating inflammatory responses, particularly in the context of acute lung injury (ALI) (Chen2017Downregulation).
