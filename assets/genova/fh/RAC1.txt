# RAC1

## Overview
RAC1 is a gene that encodes the Rac family small GTPase 1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. This protein functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. As a small GTPase, Rac1 is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell morphology, motility, and adhesion. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cell polarity, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidases. The RAC1 protein is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, impacting signal transduction pathways that contribute to immune responses and development (Ridley1992The; Abdrabou2018PostTranslational). Dysregulation of RAC1 is implicated in several diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (De2019RAC1; Scala2021Pathophysiological).

## Structure
RAC1 is a small GTPase belonging to the Rho family, characterized by its ability to cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. The primary structure of RAC1 includes three functional regions: Switch I, Switch II, and the Insert region. Switch I (residues 26-45) is crucial for interactions with downstream effectors, while Switch II (residues 59-74) interacts with activating proteins. The Insert region (residues 124-135) is unique to the Rho subfamily and plays a role in mitogenesis and apoptosis (Kumar2013Molecular).

The tertiary structure of RAC1 is a compact, globular form that includes a GTP-binding domain, essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways. RAC1's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as the WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC), where it binds to distinct sites to activate the complex (Chen2017Rac1).

Post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, are crucial for RAC1's membrane association and function. Splice variants of RAC1 can lead to different isoforms, potentially altering its interactions and functions within the cell (Kumar2013Molecular). The RAC1 F28L mutation, located in the Switch I region, has been implicated in cancer, affecting the protein's conformation and function (Kumar2013Molecular).

## Function
RAC1 (Rac family small GTPase 1) is a small GTPase that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is a member of the Rho family of GTPases and functions as a molecular switch, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, which is essential for effective signal transduction (Abdrabou2018PostTranslational). RAC1 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, promoting the formation of lamellipodia by stimulating the polymerization of branched actin at the leading edge of the cell. This process involves RAC1 binding to WAVE proteins through its downstream effector IRSp53, which then activates the Arp2/3 complex to enhance actin polymerization (Abdrabou2018PostTranslational).

RAC1 also influences cell morphology, motility, and adhesion by affecting the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in membrane trafficking and cell polarity (Abdrabou2018PostTranslational). It plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidases, which is significant in various physiological processes (Acevedo2018Crosstalk). RAC1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane, impacting signal transduction pathways and contributing to immune responses and development (Ridley1992The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the RAC1 gene are implicated in a variety of diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. In neurodevelopmental disorders, de novo missense variants in RAC1 are associated with Mental Retardation autosomal dominant 48 (MRD48), characterized by intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, and brain malformations. These variants often cluster near the Switch 1 and 2 domains of the RAC1 protein, affecting its activation state and leading to diverse clinical phenotypes (Scala2021Pathophysiological). RAC1 mutations are also linked to autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological conditions, where they impact neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity (Scala2021Pathophysiological).

In cancer, RAC1 is frequently hyperactivated, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis. The RAC1 P29S mutation is notably prevalent in melanomas, particularly those exposed to UV radiation, and is associated with increased cell proliferation and altered cell migration (De2019RAC1). RAC1 is also upregulated in breast cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis and is necessary for cell cycle activation and survival (De2019RAC1). Additionally, RAC1 mutations and overexpression are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key process in cancer metastasis (CasadoMedrano2018The).

## Interactions
RAC1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC) through two distinct binding sites, known as the A Site and the D Site. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the WRC, which promotes actin polymerization by interacting with the Arp2/3 complex. The D Site has a higher affinity for RAC1, and both sites are necessary for full activation of the WRC (Chen2017Rac1).

RAC1 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, scaffold proteins that regulate various cellular functions. This interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation of RAC1 at serine 71 (S71) by Akt, which enhances the binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction is important for regulating RAC1's activity and subcellular localization (Abdrabou2019Rac1).

In pancreatic β-cells, RAC1 interacts with a large number of proteins, including those involved in actin cytoskeletal signaling, calcium signaling, and Rho GTPase pathways. These interactions are significant for β-cell function and insulin secretion, particularly under hyperglycemic conditions (Damacharla2019Quantitative).
