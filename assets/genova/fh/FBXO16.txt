# FBXO16

## Overview
FBXO16 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 16, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that mediates protein-protein interactions. F-box protein 16 is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in targeting specific proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes by regulating the degradation of nuclear β-catenin, a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor. The activity of F-box protein 16 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it maintains cellular homeostasis and prevents oncogenesis by controlling the levels of nuclear β-catenin and interacting with other proteins such as hnRNPL. Its function is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where it has been shown to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppress oncogenic pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in breast and ovarian cancers (Unknownauthors2020ANewPlayerinanOldStory:FBXO16PreventsBreastCancerTumorigenesisthroughDisruptingCellularFunctionofNuclear?Catenin; Khan2019Attenuation; Ji2021FBXO16mediated).

## Function
FBXO16 is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, FBXO16 functions as a tumor suppressor by mediating the degradation of nuclear β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This degradation process is independent of the GSK-3β kinase and involves K48-linked polyubiquitination, leading to proteasomal degradation of β-catenin (Khan2019Attenuation).

FBXO16's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it regulates the levels of nuclear β-catenin, thereby maintaining Wnt signaling in an 'off' state. This regulation is essential for controlling cell proliferation, migration, and survival, as well as preventing tumor formation (Khan2019Attenuation; Unknownauthors2020ANewPlayerinanOldStory:FBXO16PreventsBreastCancerTumorigenesisthroughDisruptingCellularFunctionofNuclear?Catenin). FBXO16 also promotes the expression of E-cadherin and restricts oncogenic factors such as cMyc and Cyclin D1 by controlling nuclear β-catenin levels, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenesis (Unknownauthors2020ANewPlayerinanOldStory:FBXO16PreventsBreastCancerTumorigenesisthroughDisruptingCellularFunctionofNuclear?Catenin).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO16 has been implicated in various cancers, notably breast and ovarian cancer, due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In breast cancer, FBXO16 is overexpressed in luminal A and B subtypes, where it interacts with the C-terminal domain of nuclear β-catenin, promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation. This action inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by reducing β-catenin levels, which is associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer patients (Liu2021Systematica; Liu2021Systematic). FBXO16's ability to degrade nuclear β-catenin is independent of the Wnt signaling pathway, making it a unique target for therapeutic development in breast cancer (Unknownauthors2020ANewPlayerinanOldStory:FBXO16PreventsBreastCancerTumorigenesisthroughDisruptingCellularFunctionofNuclear?Catenin).

In ovarian cancer, FBXO16 is overexpressed in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels of FBXO16 mRNA are linked to improved overall survival. It functions by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of hnRNPL, a protein that, when accumulated, enhances oncogenic pathways such as MAPK, RAS, and Wnt. The absence of FBXO16 leads to increased hnRNPL levels, promoting tumor growth and malignancy (Ji2021FBXO16mediated). These findings suggest that FBXO16 plays a critical role in suppressing multiple carcinogenic signaling pathways, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
FBXO16, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its role in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. One significant interaction is with hnRNPL, an RNA-binding protein involved in tumor-related processes. FBXO16 interacts with the RRM3 domain of hnRNPL via its C-terminal region, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of hnRNPL. This interaction is crucial for suppressing oncogenic pathways in ovarian cancer (Ji2021FBXO16mediated).

FBXO16 also interacts with nuclear β-Catenin, a key modulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. It promotes the lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of β-Catenin, independent of the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reducing oncogenic factors such as cMyc and Cyclin D1. This interaction is significant in breast cancer, where FBXO16 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating β-Catenin levels (Liu2021Systematic; Unknownauthors2020ANewPlayerinanOldStory:FBXO16PreventsBreastCancerTumorigenesisthroughDisruptingCellularFunctionofNuclear?Catenin). These interactions highlight FBXO16's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
