# C6orf163

## Overview
C6orf163 is a gene located on chromosome 6 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 6 open reading frame 163. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling or transport processes across the cell membrane. The precise biological functions of C6orf163 remain under investigation, but it is hypothesized to play a role in various cellular pathways due to its structural characteristics. Research into the gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies exploring its potential interactions and implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
