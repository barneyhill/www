# FREY1

## Overview
The FREY1 gene encodes the Frey regulator of sperm-oocyte fusion 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in reproductive biology by regulating sperm-oocyte fusion. This protein functions as a transmembrane inhibitor of the intramembrane protease SPPL2c, which is part of the aspartic intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLIPs) family. By inhibiting SPPL2c, Frey1 ensures proper sperm motility and acrosome formation, both of which are essential for successful fertilization. The protein's inhibitory action is mediated through its transmembrane domain, which interacts with the active site of SPPL2c, preventing substrate cleavage. Frey1 is specifically expressed in round spermatids, underscoring its specialized role in the reproductive process (Contreras2023The).

## Function
The FREY1 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of sperm-oocyte fusion, a critical process in fertilization. In healthy human cells, the Frey1 protein functions as an inhibitor of the intramembrane protease SPPL2c, which is part of the aspartic intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLIPs) family. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining proper sperm motility and acrosome formation, which are essential for successful fertilization (Contreras2023The).

Frey1 achieves its inhibitory function by occupying the active site of SPPL2c, thereby preventing the protease from cleaving its substrates. This interaction is facilitated by the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Frey1, which docks into the catalytic center of SPPL2c, stabilizing the protease and blocking substrate access (Contreras2023The). The TMD of Frey1 contains specific amino acid motifs, such as the PR motif, which are critical for its inhibitory activity (Contreras2023The).

The Frey1 protein is expressed exclusively in round spermatids, highlighting its specialized role in reproductive cells. Its function as an inhibitor of SPPL2c underscores its importance in the regulation of proteolytic processes that are vital for reproductive success (Contreras2023The).

## Interactions
The FREY1 protein, known as the Frey regulator of sperm-oocyte fusion 1, interacts with the intramembrane protease SPPL2c, acting as a competitive inhibitor. This interaction involves the transmembrane domain (TMD) of FREY1, which occupies the active site of SPPL2c, thereby blocking substrate access and preventing proteolytic turnover of SPPL2c substrates such as Syntaxin-8, phospholamban (PLN), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and RAMP4-2 (Contreras2023The). The TMD and juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of FREY1 are crucial for this inhibition, with specific residues like R30 playing a significant role through electrostatic interactions with the catalytic aspartates of SPPL2c (Contreras2023The).

The PR motif within the N-terminus of the FREY1 TMD is identified as a key inhibitory sequence, which can be transplanted into other proteins to generate novel inhibitors of SPPL2c (Contreras2023The). This motif, along with other specific residues, contributes to the binding and inhibition of SPPL2c, highlighting the potential of FREY1's TMD as a versatile inhibitory tool against aspartic intramembrane-cleaving proteases (Contreras2023The).
