# LTN1

## Overview
LTN1 is a gene that encodes the protein listerin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, a crucial component of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) system. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting aberrant nascent polypeptides for degradation. Listerin is primarily associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit, where it identifies and ubiquitinates stalled polypeptides, marking them for proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for preventing the accumulation of defective proteins that could disrupt cellular functions. The protein's activity extends beyond the cytosol, operating on organelle surfaces such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, thereby ensuring the proper import and degradation of nuclear-encoded proteins. Dysregulation of LTN1 has been implicated in various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in neuronal homeostasis (Farhang2021Expression; Joazeiro2019Mechanisms; Bengtson2010Role).

## Structure
The LTN1 protein, also known as listerin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is characterized by its involvement in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) system. It is a 180-kDa protein composed of 1562 amino acids and features several distinct domains. The N-terminal region (residues 18-322) is responsible for binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit, facilitating its role in protein quality control (Sung2014Direct). The C-terminal region contains the catalytic RING domain, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, enabling the ubiquitination of aberrant polypeptides (Sung2014Direct).

The central M-domain of LTN1 is involved in recognizing polylysine residues of nonstop proteins, which are critical for ribosome stalling and subsequent ubiquitylation. This domain is characterized by a HEAT/ARM repeat structure, which may facilitate protein-protein interactions (Sung2014Direct). The protein's flexible nature, as revealed by electron microscopy, allows it to adopt multiple conformations based on substrate geometry and the context of the ribosomal exit tunnel (Ghosh2020Cooperativity).

LTN1 interacts with ribosomal components and the ribosome-associated chaperone Ssb/RAC, which enhances its ubiquitination activity on nascent polypeptides (Ghosh2020Cooperativity). The protein's structure and interactions are integral to its function in maintaining protein quality control.

## Function
The LTN1 gene encodes the protein Listerin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in the ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway. In healthy human cells, Listerin is predominantly associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit, where it recognizes and ubiquitylates nascent polypeptides that stall during translation. This ubiquitylation marks the defective polypeptides for degradation by the proteasome, preventing the accumulation of aberrant proteins that could disrupt cellular functions (Joazeiro2019Mechanisms).

Listerin's function is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting stalled nascent chains for degradation, thus preventing the formation of toxic protein aggregates. This process is particularly important in the context of ribosome stalling, which can occur due to translation errors or mRNA defects (Joazeiro2019Mechanisms; Bengtson2010Role). Listerin's activity is not limited to the cytosol; it also operates on the surfaces of organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, ensuring the proper import and degradation of nuclear-encoded proteins (Joazeiro2019Mechanisms). The protein's role in the RQC pathway is vital for cellular homeostasis and has implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases (Joazeiro2019Mechanisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LTN1 gene, also known as listerin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, have been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In mice, mutations in the LTN1 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative phenotypes, suggesting that defective protein quality control due to LTN1 mutations may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases (Martin2020NEMF; Bengtson2010Role). 

In humans, altered expression levels of LTN1 have been associated with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, LTN1 expression is significantly higher in female patients with schizophrenia compared to controls, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Farhang2021Expression). Similarly, in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), LTN1 expression is suggestively higher, particularly in males, which may contribute to the disorder's pathogenesis (Shiva2021Expression). These findings highlight the importance of LTN1 in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and suggest that its dysregulation can lead to various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
LTN1, also known as listerin E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a key component of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) system. It interacts with ribosomal subunits, particularly the 60S subunit, and is involved in the ubiquitination of nascent polypeptides that are stalled during translation (Bengtson2010Role; Ghosh2020Cooperativity). LTN1 is associated with both 60S and fully assembled 80S ribosomes, indicating its role in ubiquitinating polypeptides in different ribosomal contexts (Ghosh2020Cooperativity).

LTN1 interacts with the ribosomal protein Rpl3, which is part of the 60S subunit, facilitating its role in protein quality control (Bengtson2010Role). It also cooperates with the ribosome-associated chaperone Ssb/RAC, which promotes LTN1's recruitment to ribosomal complexes, particularly the 80S ribosome, enhancing its ubiquitination activity (Ghosh2020Cooperativity). This interaction is crucial for the efficient degradation of aberrant nascent chains (Ghosh2020Cooperativity).

LTN1's function is dependent on its RING domain, which is necessary for its E3 ligase activity, allowing it to tag defective proteins for degradation (Bengtson2010Role). This interaction network is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful proteins.
