# CALR

## Overview
The CALR gene encodes calreticulin, a multifunctional calcium-binding chaperone protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calreticulin is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, protein folding, and quality control within the ER. Structurally, calreticulin is characterized by three main domains: the N-terminal globular domain, the proline-rich P-domain, and the acidic C-terminal domain, which contribute to its diverse functional roles (Houen2021Structural). The protein plays a critical role in the calreticulin/calnexin cycle, interacting with other ER proteins to ensure proper glycoprotein folding (Michalak2009Calreticulin). Beyond its ER functions, calreticulin is implicated in immune responses and cell adhesion, interacting with integrins and components of the complement system (Michalak2009Calreticulin). Mutations in the CALR gene are notably associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms, highlighting its clinical significance in hematological disorders (Klampfl2013Somatic; Nangalia2013SomaticCALRMutations).

## Structure
Calreticulin (CALR) is a multifunctional protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, characterized by a complex structure comprising three main domains: the N-terminal globular domain, the proline-rich P-domain, and the acidic C-terminal domain. The primary structure of CALR includes an N-terminal domain of approximately 200 amino acids, a proline-rich domain of about 100 amino acids, and a C-terminal domain that is highly acidic and ends with an ER retrieval sequence (KDEL in human CALR) (Houen2021Structural).

The secondary structure features a stable globular core with a β-sheet sandwich and an α-helix. The β-sheet sandwich consists of two β-sheets, with the N-terminal contributing to the upper and lower sheets, and additional β-strands from the C-terminal domain (Houen2021Structural). The tertiary structure includes a carbohydrate-binding site on the upper β-sheet, which can accommodate a tetrasaccharide and has affinity for terminal glucose residues (Houen2021Structural). The P-domain exhibits a hinge motion, allowing for conformational changes (Houen2021Structural).

The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as MHC-I, Pdia3, and tapasin, in the peptide-loading complex (Houen2021Structural). CALR's structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds in the proline-rich domain, with three sets of repeat sequences (Houen2021Structural). The protein is known to undergo non-degrading retro-translocation from the ER to the cytosol, regulated by the acidic C-domain (Houen2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CALR gene are significantly associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), particularly essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). These mutations, primarily insertions and deletions in exon 9, lead to a frameshift and a novel C-terminal peptide, which alters the protein's function and contributes to disease pathogenesis (Klampfl2013Somatic; Nangalia2013SomaticCALRMutations). CALR mutations are found in a substantial proportion of patients with ET and PMF who do not have JAK2 or MPL mutations, highlighting their role as a distinct genetic marker in these conditions (Klampfl2013Somatic; Nangalia2013SomaticCALRMutations).

Patients with CALR mutations often exhibit higher platelet counts and lower hemoglobin levels compared to those with JAK2 mutations. In ET, these mutations are associated with a lower risk of thrombosis, while in PMF, they correlate with longer overall survival (Tefferi2014An; Klampfl2013Somatic). The mutations also lead to cytokine-independent growth by activating the STAT5 pathway, contributing to increased megakaryocyte colony formation and spontaneous growth in ET patients (luo2015calreticulin). CALR mutations are typically mutually exclusive with JAK2 and MPL mutations, occurring early in the clonal development of MPNs (Klampfl2013Somatic; Nangalia2013SomaticCALRMutations).

## Interactions
Calreticulin (CALR) is a multifunctional protein that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing numerous cellular processes. Within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), CALR is a key component of the calreticulin/calnexin cycle, where it interacts with calnexin and ERp57 to ensure proper folding of glycoproteins (Michalak2009Calreticulin). CALR binds to monoglucosylated carbohydrates on newly synthesized glycoproteins, facilitating their proper folding and assembly, particularly in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Venkatesan2021Roles; Michalak2009Calreticulin).

CALR also interacts with integrins, specifically binding to the sequence KXGFFKR in the cytoplasmic tail of α-integrins, suggesting a role as a cytoplasmic activator of integrins and a signal transducer between integrins and Ca2+ channels (Michalak2009Calreticulin). In the immune system, CALR acts as an auto-antigen in autoimmune diseases and interacts with components of the complement system, such as C1q, to activate the classical complement pathway (Michalak2009Calreticulin).

In cancer, CALR translocates to the cell surface in a preapoptotic manner, co-translocating with ERp57, which is crucial for immunogenic cell death and the subsequent immune response (Michalak2009Calreticulin). CALR's interactions with proteins like PDIA3 and its role in calcium signaling further underscore its involvement in immune functions and cellular homeostasis (Venkatesan2021Roles).
