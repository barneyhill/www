# ZNF207

## Overview
ZNF207 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 207, also known as BuGZ, which is a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including the maintenance of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells and mitotic spindle assembly. As a zinc finger protein, ZNF207 is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins, facilitating its role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. The protein is particularly significant in the regulation of pluripotency genes through its interactions with key transcription factors such as OCT4 and SOX2, and it plays a crucial role in mitosis by interacting with mitotic kinase Aurora A and spindle checkpoint proteins like Bub3 (Fang2018A; Toledo2014BuGZ; Huang2017Aurora). ZNF207's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including various cancers and genetic syndromes (Hermawan2020Integrative; Tritto2024Geneticepigenetic).

## Function
ZNF207, or zinc finger protein 207, plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It is a part of the core pluripotency network, interacting with key transcription factors such as OCT4 and SOX2 to regulate the expression of pluripotency genes and ensure proper cell proliferation and self-renewal (Fang2018A). ZNF207 is also involved in ectoderm differentiation by maintaining the expression of early ectoderm genes like OTX2 (Fang2018A).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to the OCT4 promoter-enhancer region, a critical element for maintaining pluripotency (Fang2018A). ZNF207's function is mediated through its ability to form complexes with transcription factors and regulate gene transcription, as evidenced by its binding to approximately 8000 sites across the genome (Fang2018A). Isoform C of ZNF207 is particularly important in hESCs, switching to isoform B in differentiated and cancer cells, suggesting a role in cell type-specific functions (Fang2018A). This isoform switching may allow ZNF207 to perform distinct roles in different cellular contexts (Fang2018A).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF207 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic spindle assembly. In breast cancer, particularly trastuzumab-resistant cases, alterations in ZNF207 have been associated with poor prognosis. Genetic alterations in ZNF207 were found in 2.9% to 3% of breast cancer samples, and these alterations correlate with significantly worse overall survival (Hermawan2020Integrative). The gene's overexpression is also linked to poor outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma and is implicated in trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer (Hermawan2020Integrative).

In colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), ZNF207 is associated with advanced stages of the disease. Its expression correlates with immune profiles and tumor aggressiveness, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Wang2023Transcriptomic). Functional studies have shown that overexpression of ZNF207 in COAD cell lines leads to reduced cell migration and proliferation, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Wang2023Transcriptomic).

ZNF207 is also involved in NF1 microdeletion syndrome, where it is hypo-expressed in patients compared to controls. This downregulation may contribute to the clinical phenotype observed in these patients, potentially due to changes in chromatin structure affecting gene expression (Tritto2024Geneticepigenetic).

## Interactions
ZNF207, also known as BuGZ, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) by directly binding to its kinase domain through its zinc fingers, promoting AurA activation and phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for the incorporation of AurA into BuGZ coacervates, enhancing its activity during mitosis (Huang2017Aurora).

BuGZ also interacts with Bub3, a spindle checkpoint protein, stabilizing it through a GLE2p-binding sequence (GLEBS) domain. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of Bub1 and BubR1 to kinetochores, which are necessary for proper chromosome alignment and tension during mitosis (Toledo2014BuGZ). The interaction between BuGZ and Bub3 is highly conserved among higher eukaryotes (Toledo2014BuGZ).

In human embryonic stem cells, ZNF207 forms complexes with key transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2, and P300, playing a significant role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal. It binds to the OCT4 promoter/enhancer region, influencing the expression of pluripotency genes (Fang2018A).
