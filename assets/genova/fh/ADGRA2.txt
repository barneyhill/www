# ADGRA2

## Overview
ADGRA2, also known as GPR124, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A2, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven-span transmembrane domain and a large extracellular domain (ECD) that includes leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains. ADGRA2 plays a pivotal role in cerebrovascular development, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), by facilitating Wnt7-dependent Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This signaling is crucial for brain vascular invasion and blood-brain barrier regulation. The receptor forms complexes with the glycoprotein RECK and interacts with Frizzled receptors and Lrp5/6 coreceptors to transduce Wnt7 signals. ADGRA2 is expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for CNS angiogenesis, acting as a WNT7A-/WNT7B-specific costimulator of β-catenin signaling. Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in various diseases, including breast cancer, autism, and pancreatic cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Morgan2019The; Yin2024Genomic; Doctor2023Automated).

## Structure
ADGRA2, also known as GPR124, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. It features a seven-span transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, although its function in Wnt7 signaling does not rely on this structure (Morgan2019The). The protein includes a large extracellular domain (ECD) that is involved in increasing the bioavailability of Wnt7 for Frizzled receptors, potentially through conformational remodeling of the RECK/Wnt7 complex (Morgan2019The). The ECD contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domains, which are involved in its interaction with RECK (Morgan2019The). However, ADGRA2 does not undergo autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) due to the lack of a conserved critical residue (Morgan2019The).

The intracellular domain (ICD) of ADGRA2 interacts with Dishevelled (Dvl) to promote brain angiogenesis, highlighting its role in intracellular signaling (Morgan2019The). ADGRA2 is expressed in endothelial cells and plays a crucial role in CNS angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier regulation (Doctor2023Automated). The protein's structure allows it to form higher-order receptor complexes with Frizzled receptors and Lrp5/6 coreceptors in a Wnt7-dependent manner (Morgan2019The).

## Function
ADGRA2, also known as GPR124, is an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in cerebrovascular development in vertebrates. It is involved in Wnt7-dependent Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is essential for promoting brain vascular invasion in an endothelial cell-autonomous manner (Morgan2019The; Bostaille2016Molecular). ADGRA2 forms a complex with the glycoprotein RECK, which confers ligand specificity by binding directly to Wnt7, facilitating the vascularization of the forebrain and ventral neural tube (Morgan2019The). This complex interacts with Frizzled receptors and Lrp5/6 coreceptors to transduce Wnt7 signals, ensuring that only blood-brain barrier-forming vessels penetrate the brain parenchyma (Morgan2019The).

The protein is specifically expressed in the vessels of the brain and spinal cord, as well as in arteries outside the central nervous system (CNS) (Musa2016Heart). ADGRA2 is crucial for CNS angiogenesis, acting as a WNT7A-/WNT7B-specific costimulator of β-catenin signaling in brain endothelium (Musa2016Heart). Its function is critical in tip cells leading the sprouts, ensuring a high signal-to-noise ratio for WNT7a and WNT7b signaling, which is essential for normal development and function (Musa2016Heart).

## Clinical Significance
ADGRA2, also known as adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A2, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In breast cancer, ADGRA2 is associated with poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and worse prognosis. High expression levels of ADGRA2 correlate with reduced disease-free survival (DFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) analyses have identified an amplification peak at 8p11.23, which includes ADGRA2, in nonresponsive breast cancer samples, indicating its role in chemotherapy resistance (Yin2024Genomic).

In the context of autism, ADGRA2 is involved in pathways relevant to the condition, such as arginine and proline metabolism, protein farnesylation, and GTPase binding. It plays a role in the migration of Purkinje cells and brain morphology, which are pertinent to autism pathophysiology (Agarwala2021Risk).

ADGRA2 is also linked to pancreatic cancer, where its expression is associated with worse overall survival. This suggests a potential role in the progression of this cancer type (Du2022Molecular). These findings highlight ADGRA2 as a significant biomarker and potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
ADGRA2, also known as GPR124, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in Wnt7-specific signaling, particularly in cerebrovascular development. ADGRA2 forms a receptor complex with RECK, a GPI-anchored glycoprotein, which is essential for endothelial cells to respond to Wnt7 ligands. This complex is suggested to form higher-order receptor complexes with Frizzled receptors and Lrp5/6 coreceptors, facilitating the transduction of Wnt7 signals. The interaction between ADGRA2 and RECK involves the cystine knot motifs of RECK and the LRR/GAIN domains of the ADGRA2 ectodomain. RECK binds directly and selectively to Wnt7, maintaining it in an active state suitable for Frizzled receptor activation. ADGRA2 is crucial for increasing the bioavailability of Wnt7 for Frizzled signaling on the cell surface (Morgan2019The).

The intracellular domain (ICD) of ADGRA2 binds to Dishevelled (Dvl), which is essential for promoting brain angiogenesis by assembling higher-order receptor complexes. However, some ADGRA2 variants lacking the ICD can still trigger Wnt7 signaling, suggesting that the ICD may not always be required. The ADGRA2 ECD might initiate signaling through conformational remodeling of the RECK/Wnt7 complex, while the ICD recruits Frizzled through Dvl (Morgan2019The).
