# REST

## Overview
The REST gene encodes the RE1 silencing transcription factor, a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to the RE1 motif on DNA and recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes, such as histone deacetylases, to alter chromatin structure. REST is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of neural stem cells and regulating neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of histone modifications and interactions with non-coding RNAs, which influence neuronal differentiation. REST's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications and interactions with cofactors, allowing it to coordinate complex chromatin remodeling. Clinically, REST is implicated in several diseases, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in different contexts, and is associated with neurological disorders such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases (Baldelli2015The; Zheng2009Profiling; Meyer2019REST).

## Structure
The human REST (RE1-Silencing Transcription factor) protein is a 1097 amino acid transcription factor with a molecular weight of 116 kDa. It features a toroidal (doughnut-like) shape, which facilitates central DNA binding, a common characteristic among transcription factors (Veverka2022Electron). REST contains nine zinc finger domains, with eight specifically involved in DNA binding, crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Veverka2022Electron; CortésSarabia2019Production). These zinc fingers are part of the DNA binding domain (DBD), which is central to REST's ability to bind to the NRSE sequence with high affinity (Veverka2022Electron).

The protein also includes N-terminal and C-terminal repressor domains that recruit corepressors and histone deacetylases, leading to chromatin condensation and gene repression (Veverka2022Electron). REST's structure is influenced by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and interactions with partners like Sin3a/b and CoREST (Veverka2022Electron).

REST has several splice variants, including REST-N62, which lacks four zinc fingers and the C-terminal repressor domain. This variant is generated by alternative splicing and modulates the function of full-length REST during neurogenesis (Veverka2022Electron).

## Function
The REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor) gene encodes a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor, primarily known for its role in repressing neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues. REST binds to the RE1 motif on DNA, recruiting various chromatin-modifying complexes, including histone deacetylases (HDACs), demethylases, and methyltransferases, to alter chromatin structure and regulate gene expression (Martin2017The; Zheng2009Profiling). This activity is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of neural stem cells and regulating neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Rockowitz2014Comparison).

In healthy human cells, REST is involved in modulating histone modifications, such as reducing histone acetylation and methylation associated with gene activation, while increasing methylations linked to gene repression (Zheng2009Profiling). REST's regulatory network includes interactions with non-coding RNAs and feedback loops, influencing the expression of microRNAs that promote neuronal differentiation (Zheng2009Profiling). REST also plays a protective role against oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in the aging brain, with its levels increasing in hippocampal and cortical neurons during healthy aging, correlating with the upregulation of protective genes (Cavadas2016REST; Baldelli2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the REST gene are implicated in various diseases. In hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF), novel truncation mutations in REST lead to a loss of repressor activity, resulting in excessive gingival tissue growth. These mutations cause truncated proteins that exhibit a dominant negative effect, impairing the function of the wild-type REST protein and contributing to the pathogenesis of HGF through altered gene expression regulation (Chen2021Novel).

In cancer, REST acts as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. It functions as a tumor suppressor in epithelial cells, with deletions on chromosome 4q12 frequently observed in colon cancer. A frameshift mutation in REST has been identified in colorectal adenocarcinoma, leading to a truncated protein that contributes to cancer development (Westbrook2005A; Ooi2007Chromatin). In gliomas, REST is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, acting as an oncogene by promoting cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2023Systematic; Perycz2024Comprehensive).

REST is also involved in neurological disorders. In Huntington's disease, its interaction with mutant huntingtin protein results in altered gene repression, contributing to neuronal degeneration (Ooi2007Chromatin). In Alzheimer's disease, reduced nuclear REST levels and binding are linked to premature neuronal differentiation and reduced neural progenitor cell renewal, potentially contributing to disease onset (Meyer2019REST).

## Interactions
The RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids to exert its repressive functions. REST forms multiprotein complexes by recruiting cofactors such as SIN3A, SIN3B, CoREST, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are crucial for chromatin modification and gene repression (Yu2011Coassembly; Rockowitz2014Comparison). These interactions allow REST to coordinate complex genome-wide chromatin remodeling, influencing histone modifications like the removal of acetyl groups on H3K9 and the demethylation of H3K4 (Zheng2009Profiling).

REST also interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) and other histone modification enzymes, such as LSD1, SMCX, and G9a, to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Rockowitz2014Comparison; Zheng2009Profiling). In embryonic stem cells, REST's recruitment to DNA is not uniform, and its ability to repress genes depends on the recruitment of these corepressor complexes (Yu2011Coassembly).

In addition to protein interactions, REST regulates non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs like mir-9 and mir-124, which are involved in neuronal differentiation (Zheng2009Profiling). REST's interaction with these elements highlights its role in fine-tuning gene expression and integrating gene networks in response to various cues.
