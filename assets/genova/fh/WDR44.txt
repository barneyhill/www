# WDR44

## Overview
The WDR44 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 44 protein, which is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its WD40-repeat domains that form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions. WDR44 is primarily involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis, acting as a negative regulator by modulating RAB11-dependent vesicle trafficking. The protein's function is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by kinases like SGK3 and Akt, which affect its interaction with RAB11 and other effector proteins. Variants in the WDR44 gene have been associated with ciliopathy-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in developmental and neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics; Walia2019Akt; Accogli2024Variants).

## Structure
The WDR44 protein is characterized by its WD40-repeat domains, which form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure at the carboxy end of the protein. This structure is typical of the WD40-repeat family, known for their radially arranged β-propeller structures that create a central channel, often described as having a donut-like appearance. Each blade of the β-propeller is formed from highly conserved repeats that fold into a 4-stranded β-sheet with strands labeled A-D. The central channel, or "donut hole," serves as a binding pocket or interaction hub, crucial for the protein's function in protein-protein interactions (Accogli2024Variants).

The core WD40 domain of WDR44 spans residues 480-858 and 887-913, with residues 859-886 omitted in structural models due to their distal location from mutation sites and low confidence prediction (Accogli2024Variants). Variants in the WD40-repeat domain can lead to structural changes that affect protein stability and folding, often resulting in enhanced proteasomal degradation due to misfolding (Accogli2024Variants).

WDR44 is also a substrate for phosphorylation by SGK3, with Ser344 identified as a phosphorylation site within the RXRXXS/T motif, a consensus sequence for Akt and SGK phosphorylation (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). This post-translational modification may influence its role in vesicular membrane trafficking and ciliogenesis.

## Function
The WDR44 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is essential for the proper functioning of many organ systems. In healthy human cells, WDR44 functions as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis by modulating RAB11-dependent vesicle trafficking. Under non-ciliating conditions, WDR44 is phosphorylated by Akt, enhancing its binding to RAB11. This phosphorylation is reduced under ciliating conditions, promoting a switch to a RAB11-FIP3 effector complex with RABIN8, facilitating the docking of preciliary vesicles to the mother centriole, which is essential for the removal of CP110 and CEP97, allowing axoneme formation (Walia2019Akt; Accogli2024Variants).

WDR44 contains a WD40-repeat domain that is important for its function, particularly in protein-protein interactions with RAB11, a protein that regulates vesicle trafficking. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance between open and closed conformations that regulate RAB11 binding affinity, affecting ciliogenesis (Accogli2024Variants). WDR44 is also involved in other vesicular membrane trafficking processes, such as the transport of transferrin, E-cadherin, CFTR, and matrix metalloproteinases-14, through interactions with RAB11 and other membrane trafficking regulators like VAPA and GRAF2 (Accogli2024Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR44 gene are linked to a spectrum of ciliopathy-related disorders, which are characterized by defects in cilia formation and function. These disorders can affect multiple organ systems, leading to a range of developmental and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Patients with WDR44 variants often exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, distinct craniofacial features, and various organ abnormalities, including renal and heart defects (Accogli2024Variants).

The WDR44 gene is involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis initiation, primarily through its interaction with RAB11, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking. Variants in the WD40-repeat domain of WDR44 can lead to a gain-of-function effect, enhancing RAB11 binding and disrupting normal ciliogenesis. This disruption is associated with impaired ciliary signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt, which are crucial for development (Accogli2024Variants).

Specific missense variants, such as p.D648G and p.S764F, have been shown to impair ciliogenesis initiation and are linked to more severe disease phenotypes. These variants can lead to protein misfolding, enhanced proteasomal degradation, and altered protein-protein interactions, contributing to the clinical manifestations of ciliopathy (Accogli2024Variants).

## Interactions
WDR44, also known as Rabphillin11 and Rab11BP, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and intracellular trafficking. It interacts with Rab11, a small GTPase, to regulate the recycling of endocytosed transferrin receptors back to the plasma membrane. This interaction is modulated by Akt phosphorylation, which stabilizes the WDR44-Rab11 complex, preventing ciliogenesis by inhibiting the association of Rab11 with other effectors like Rabin8 (Walia2019Akt).

WDR44 also interacts with VAPA and VAPB through a putative FFAT motif, which is essential for binding. This interaction is significant for the protein's role in vesicular trafficking and cellular signaling (Baron2014VAPBALS8). Variants in WDR44 can enhance its binding affinity to Rab11, which is associated with impaired ciliogenesis initiation and is linked to ciliopathy-related disorders (Accogli2024Variants).

The phosphorylation of WDR44 by kinases such as SGK3 and Akt at specific sites, like Ser344, enhances its binding to Rab11, further influencing its role in ciliogenesis (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). These interactions highlight WDR44's critical role in regulating vesicular trafficking and ciliogenesis through its interactions with Rab11 and other proteins.
