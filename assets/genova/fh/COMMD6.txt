# COMMD6

## Overview
COMMD6 is a gene that encodes the protein COMM domain containing 6, a member of the COMMD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of the conserved copper metabolism gene MURR1 (COMM) domain, which is integral to protein-protein interactions and the formation of oligomeric complexes. The COMMD6 protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as endosomal transport and transcription regulation, particularly through its involvement in the regulation of NF-κB signaling. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular responses to environmental changes. COMMD6 is also a component of the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, which is essential for endosomal sorting and copper metabolism. The gene's expression levels have been linked to various cancers, affecting patient prognosis differently depending on the tumor type (Healy2018Structural; Burstein2005COMMD; You2023COMMD).

## Structure
The COMMD6 protein is part of the COMMD family, characterized by the presence of a conserved copper metabolism gene MURR1 (COMM) domain. This domain is a leucine-rich sequence, approximately 70-85 amino acids long, predicted to form a β-sheet structure, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Burstein2005COMMD). The COMM domain facilitates the formation of oligomeric complexes, allowing COMMD proteins to interact with each other and form heteromeric assemblies (Healy2018Structural). 

COMMD6, like other COMMD proteins, is involved in forming obligatory dimers through its COMM domain, which is essential for its function in cellular processes such as endosomal transport and transcription regulation (Healy2018Structural). The protein is highly conserved among mammals, indicating its evolutionary importance (Yang2019Prognosis). 

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of COMMD6 are not provided, the presence of the COMM domain suggests a specific functional region within the protein. The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-κB signaling (Yang2019Prognosis).

## Function
COMMD6 is a member of the COMMD protein family, which is characterized by the presence of the COMM domain. This domain facilitates interactions among COMMD proteins and is crucial for their function. In healthy human cells, COMMD6 plays a significant role in regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity. It interacts with NF-κB subunits, particularly showing a preference for RelA-containing complexes, and inhibits NF-κB-mediated transcription. This regulation is important for controlling the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses (Burstein2005COMMD).

COMMD6 is also involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its participation in the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, which is essential for endosomal sorting and copper metabolism. The CCC complex is involved in the proper sorting and relocalization of copper-transporting ATPases, such as Atp7a, and affects the transport of receptors like the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), thereby influencing cholesterol homeostasis. Knockout of COMMD6 can destabilize the CCC complex, leading to reduced LDLR levels on the cell surface and elevated plasma cholesterol (You2023COMMD).

COMMD6 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular responses to environmental changes. Its activities are crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
COMMD6 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels influencing patient prognosis. High expression of COMMD6 is observed in 20 types of tumors, including colon cancer and brain lower grade glioma (LGG), and is associated with shorter survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), cholangiocarcinoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) patients. Conversely, in LGG, uveal melanoma, testicular germ cell tumors, thyroid carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, high COMMD6 expression correlates with longer survival, indicating its role may vary depending on the tumor type (You2023COMMD).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), COMMD6, along with other COMMD family members, shows significantly increased mRNA expression levels in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This elevated expression is linked to more advanced cancer stages and higher tumor grades, suggesting a role in tumor progression (Wang2021Transcriptional).

COMMD6 is also involved in maintaining copper and cholesterol homeostasis. Its deletion affects the transport of copper-transporting ATPases and LDL receptors, leading to copper accumulation and elevated plasma cholesterol levels, although specific diseases directly linked to these alterations are not detailed (You2023COMMD).

## Interactions
COMMD6 is a protein that participates in several interactions within the cell, primarily through its COMM domain. It interacts directly with COMMD1, another member of the COMMD protein family, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses. This interaction is specific and occurs throughout the cell, including the nucleus (de2006Characterization). COMMD6 can also form homomultimers, although it does not bind to its isoform a (de2006Characterization).

COMMD6 is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it acts as a repressor. It binds to the NF-κB subunit RelA but does not interact with IκBα, unlike COMMD1 (de2006Characterization). Mutations in COMMD6, specifically W24A and P41A, do not affect its ability to bind to COMMD1 or itself, but a double mutation (W24A/P41A) abolishes its ability to repress NF-κB signaling, indicating the importance of these residues for its function (de2006Characterization).

COMMD6 is also part of the Commander complex, a multiprotein complex involved in endosomal protein trafficking. Within this complex, COMMD6 interacts with other COMMD proteins through COMMD1 (Mallam2017Systemswide).
