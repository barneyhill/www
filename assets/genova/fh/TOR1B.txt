# TOR1B

## Overview
The TOR1B gene encodes the protein torsin family 1 member B (torsinB), which is a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. TorsinB is primarily involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope, where it plays a crucial role in protein folding, processing, and trafficking. This protein is characterized by its glycoprotein nature and is ubiquitously expressed across various cell types, except neurons, where it shares functional overlap with TorsinA. TorsinB's activity is modulated by interactions with specific cofactors such as LAP1 and LULL1, which enhance its ATPase activity. These interactions are vital for its role in regulating nuclear envelope integrity and dynamics, influencing processes such as nuclear division and chromatin organization. Alterations in TOR1B expression have been linked to significant clinical implications, including cancer progression and potential impacts on neurological disorders (Rose2015Torsins:; Zhang2024Prognostic; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

## Structure
TorsinB, encoded by the TOR1B gene, is a member of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily, characterized by its involvement in various cellular activities. TorsinB is a glycoprotein with two glycosylation sites and is ubiquitously expressed across all cell types (Rose2015Torsins:). It shares significant sequence similarity with TorsinA, being 68% identical and 85% similar at the primary sequence level (Rose2015Torsins:). TorsinB is more basic than TorsinA, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.6 compared to TorsinA's pI of 6.8, which may influence its interaction with cellular partners (Rose2015Torsins:).

Structurally, TorsinB forms higher-order assemblies consistent with a stereotypical AAA+ hexamer, although it is unclear if these are homooligomers or hetero-oligomers with other Torsin proteins (Rose2015Torsins:). TorsinB can associate with both wild-type TorsinA and the TorsinA ΔE variant, indicating potential interactions within the Torsin family (Rose2015Torsins:). The protein's role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane morphology is suggested by its ability to form sinusoidal organized smooth ER structures when overexpressed as a Walker B mutant (Rose2015Torsins:). Despite these structural insights, the exact molecular configuration and functional implications of TorsinB's oligomerization remain to be fully elucidated.

## Function
The TOR1B gene encodes the torsinB protein, which is part of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. TorsinB is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in protein folding, processing, and trafficking. This function is vital for protein quality control, ensuring that misfolded proteins are either correctly refolded or degraded, thus maintaining cellular function (Zhang2024Prognostic).

TorsinB also plays a significant role in regulating the integrity and dynamics of the nuclear envelope, which influences nuclear division and chromatin organization. This regulation is essential for normal cellular operations and stress adaptation, allowing cells to manage and respond to various stressors effectively (Zhang2024Prognostic). The protein is expressed in all tissues except neurons, where it provides functional overlap with TorsinA, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism in non-neural tissues (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

TorsinB's activity is modulated by its interaction with NE- and ER-specific cofactors, LAP1 and LULL1, which stimulate its ATPase activity. Unlike other AAA+ proteins, torsins lack the conserved aromatic-hydrophobic pore loops, affecting their role in substrate engagement and translocation (Rampello2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TOR1B gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, high TOR1B expression is associated with poor prognosis in several types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lower grade glioma, acute myeloid leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Specifically, in breast cancer, elevated TOR1B levels are linked to decreased overall survival and disease-free survival, especially in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) subtypes. This overexpression is also correlated with increased risk of bone metastasis in breast cancer patients, particularly those with estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive subtypes (Zhang2024Prognostic; Nguyen2023TOR1B:).

TOR1B expression is also implicated in cellular adaptations to hypoxia, a condition that enhances tumor aggressiveness and resistance to therapies. Under hypoxic conditions, TOR1B expression increases, potentially through its interaction with HIF-1α, a transcription factor that regulates hypoxia response. This interaction suggests that TOR1B may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing hypoxia tolerance in cancer cells (Zhang2024Prognostic).

In neurological disorders, while the context does not provide specific details on TOR1B's role, it is noted that alterations in TOR1B expression may impact cellular stress responses and protein folding, which are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2024Prognostic).

## Interactions
TOR1B, a member of the AAA+ protein family, is involved in various cellular interactions, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. It acts as a molecular chaperone, maintaining ER integrity and homeostasis, which is crucial in aggressive tumor microenvironments (Nguyen2023TOR1B:). TOR1B is known to interact with LAP1, a regulator at the nuclear envelope, influencing its chromatin interaction. This interaction is crucial for mitotic processes, as mutations in TOR1B can impair LAP1 removal from chromatin during mitosis, leading to chromosome segregation errors (Luithle2020Torsin). 

TOR1B also interacts with other proteins such as TOR1A, with which it shares a protein complex and similar functions, suggesting a potential functional relationship (Nguyen2023TOR1B:). The interaction between TOR1B and LAP1 is not typical of classical enzyme-substrate mechanisms, as LAP1's luminal domains mimic the ATPase fold and bind laterally to Torsins, activating ATP hydrolysis (Luithle2020Torsin). These interactions highlight TOR1B's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in cancer progression through its influence on nuclear envelope dynamics and chromatin interactions.
