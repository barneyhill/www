# CH25H

## Overview
CH25H, or cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the same name, which is integral to cholesterol metabolism and immune regulation. The enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and is primarily involved in the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC), a process that plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and modulating immune responses. CH25H is an integral membrane protein characterized by its three transmembrane domains and conserved histidine boxes, which are essential for its catalytic activity. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and macrophages, and its expression is upregulated by interferons, highlighting its role in antiviral defense mechanisms. CH25H's interactions with viral proteins underscore its significance as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor. Clinically, alterations in CH25H expression have been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and viral infections, where it can influence inflammatory pathways and disease progression (Holmes2011Genomics; Liu201825Hydroxycholesterol; Takahashi2021Cholesterol).

## Structure
The human CH25H protein is characterized by a primary structure that includes three conserved histidine boxes essential for its catalytic activity. These histidine boxes are involved in binding iron atoms necessary for the hydroxylation reaction. The specific sequences and locations of these histidine boxes are: box 1 (Trp-His-Leu/Val-Leu-Val-His-His) at residues 142-148, box 2 (Phe/Ile-His-Lys-Val/Met/Leu-His-His) at residues 157-162, and box 3 (His-His-Asp-Leu/Met-His-His) at residues 238-244 (Holmes2011Genomics).

The CH25H protein is an integral membrane protein with three predicted transmembrane domains. The N-terminus of the protein starts outside the endoplasmic reticulum, while the active site histidine boxes are located inside the membrane, where catalysis occurs (Holmes2011Genomics). The tertiary structure likely involves the arrangement of these transmembrane domains and histidine boxes to facilitate its enzymatic function.

CH25H is known to form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure. This dimerization is important for its function in catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (Holmes2011Genomics). The gene encoding CH25H is intronless and located on human chromosome 10, near the LIPA gene (Holmes2011Genomics).

## Function
CH25H (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC), an oxysterol involved in various biological processes. This enzyme plays a significant role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and enhancing cholesterol esterification. It achieves this by inhibiting the transport of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and its cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) complex to the Golgi, which is necessary for the activation of SREBP as a transcription factor, thereby downregulating key metabolic enzymes required for cholesterol biosynthesis (Takahashi2021Cholesterol).

CH25H is predominantly expressed in the liver and peritoneal macrophages, indicating these tissues as primary sites for 25OHC production (Liu201825Hydroxycholesterol). The enzyme is also highly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it co-localizes with HSPA5, a marker of the ER (Liu201825Hydroxycholesterol). In immune responses, CH25H is upregulated by interferons and acts as an inhibitor of viral infections, demonstrating its role in antiviral defense (Liu201825Hydroxycholesterol). It also modulates immune cell functions, such as impairing the viability and proliferation of activated T cells by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, while sparing metabolically quiescent naïve cells (Takahashi2021Cholesterol).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CH25H gene, which encodes cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, have been implicated in several diseases. In X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), particularly the cerebral form (CCALD), CH25H is significantly upregulated, leading to increased production of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). This upregulation is associated with cerebral inflammation through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Jang201625hydroxycholesterol).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CH25H expression is elevated in the brain, particularly in microglia, and is linked to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. This suggests a role for CH25H in neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis, with some studies indicating that CH25H promoter polymorphisms may influence AD risk (Wong202025Hydroxycholesterol).

CH25H is also involved in tauopathy, a condition related to AD. In mouse models, CH25H deficiency reduces neurodegeneration and inflammation, indicating that CH25H and 25-HC contribute to these pathological processes (ToralRios2024Cholesterol).

In the context of viral infections, CH25H has antiviral properties, but its role in amplifying inflammatory responses can lead to increased immune-mediated damage, as observed in influenza infection models (Liu2013InterferonInducible; Gold201425Hydroxycholesterol).

## Interactions
CH25H (cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) is known to interact with several viral proteins, playing a significant role in its antiviral activity. One notable interaction is with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS5A. CH25H binds to NS5A, disrupting its dimer formation, which is crucial for HCV RNA synthesis and replication. This interaction occurs through the TM and FA domains of CH25H binding to domain I of NS5A, and it is a key mechanism by which CH25H inhibits HCV replication (Chen2014InterferonInducible).

CH25H also interacts with the PRRSV-encoded protein nsp1α. This interaction, confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, leads to the degradation of nsp1α via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, inhibiting PRRSV replication. The interaction is independent of CH25H's enzymatic activity (Ke2017Cholesterol).

In the case of Senecavirus A (SVA), CH25H interacts with and degrades the viral 3A protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is part of CH25H's enzyme activity-independent antiviral mechanism (Zhu2021Cholesterol).

These interactions highlight CH25H's role as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor, capable of directly interacting with viral proteins to inhibit their replication.
