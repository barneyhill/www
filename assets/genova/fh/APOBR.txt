# APOBR

## Overview
The APOBR gene encodes the apolipoprotein B receptor (apoB48R), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism. This receptor is primarily responsible for the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in macrophages, facilitating the internalization of dietary lipids and contributing to lipid accumulation within cells (Haraguchi2003PPARα; Brown2000A). ApoB48R is distinct in its ability to bind specifically to apolipoprotein B48, a component of TRLs, and is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the lung and placenta (Brown2000A). The receptor's function is crucial in the formation of lipid-laden foam cells, which are implicated in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (Brown2000A). Additionally, the activity of apoB48R is modulated by dietary factors, highlighting its role in metabolic processes influenced by nutritional intake (Varela2013The). Genetic variations in the APOBR gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, such as ketosis in dairy cows, suggesting broader implications for lipid metabolism and associated diseases (Tetens2015Polymorphisms).

## Function
The APOBR gene encodes the apolipoprotein B-48 receptor (apoB48R), which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by mediating the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in macrophages. This receptor binds specifically to apolipoprotein B48, a component of dietary TRLs, facilitating their internalization and subsequent lipid accumulation within cells (Haraguchi2003PPARα; Brown2000A). ApoB48R is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and placenta, with the highest expression levels observed in the lung and placenta (Brown2000A).

In macrophages, apoB48R is involved in the formation of lipid-filled foam cells, a process that contributes to the development of atherosclerotic lesions (Haraguchi2003PPARα; Brown2000A). The receptor's activity is independent of apoE, distinguishing it from other lipoprotein receptors (Brown2000A). ApoB48R is not regulated by sterol levels or the differentiation state of the cell, which sets it apart from other receptor families (Brown2000A).

The receptor's function is also influenced by dietary factors, as its expression and activity can be modulated by the type of fatty acids present in the diet, affecting lipid accumulation in monocytes and macrophages (Varela2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APOBR gene, which encodes the apolipoprotein B receptor, have been associated with various metabolic disorders. In dairy cows, polymorphisms within the APOBR gene are significantly linked to ketosis, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated ketone bodies due to negative energy balance during early lactation (Tetens2015Polymorphisms). These genetic variations influence the levels of glycerophosphocholine and the glycerophosphocholine-to-phosphocholine ratio in milk, suggesting a role in metabolic stability (Tetens2015Polymorphisms).

The APOBR gene's interaction with low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and its involvement in phospholipid metabolism may also have implications for energy metabolism and ketosis (Tetens2015Polymorphisms). Although the study primarily focuses on dairy cows, the findings suggest that similar mechanisms might be relevant in other species, including humans, potentially affecting conditions related to lipid metabolism such as hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis (Tetens2015Polymorphisms). However, the specific clinical significance of APOBR mutations in humans is not detailed in the provided context (Tetens2015Polymorphisms).
