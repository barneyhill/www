# WWC3

## Overview
WWC3 is a gene that encodes the WWC family member 3 protein, which is part of the WWC protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of WW domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, a C2 lipid-binding domain, and a PDZ-binding motif. The WWC3 protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hippo and Wnt pathways, which are essential for regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and organ growth. Through its interactions with various proteins, WWC3 modulates these pathways to maintain normal cellular functions and prevent abnormal cell growth. The protein is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, kidney, liver, and lung, indicating its potential involvement in diverse physiological processes. Alterations in WWC3 expression have been linked to several cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2018WWC3; Höffken2021WWC; Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

## Structure
The WWC3 protein is a member of the WWC protein family, which includes WWC1 and WWC2. It shares a highly conserved structure characterized by two amino-terminal WW domains, a C2 lipid-binding domain, and a PDZ-binding motif in the C-terminal region (Wang2018WWC3; Höffken2021WWC). The WW domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with proline-rich motifs, while the C2 domain aids in membrane localization by binding to phospholipids (Höffken2021WWC). Unique to WWC3 is a proline-rich region at the amino-terminus, which may facilitate interactions with specific binding partners (Höffken2021WWC).

WWC3 can form homo- and heterodimeric complexes, providing a platform for large multiprotein assemblies (Höffken2021WWC). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are conserved across the WWC family, regulating protein activity (Höffken2021WWC; Wennmann2014Evolutionary). These modifications include phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues by various kinases (Höffken2021WWC). The evolutionary conservation of these structural features across species underscores their functional importance (Höffken2021WWC). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of WWC3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
WWC3 is a member of the WWC protein family, which plays a significant role in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway, a crucial mechanism for controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, WWC3 interacts with proteins such as FRMPD1 to enhance the phosphorylation of LATS1, thereby activating Hippo signaling and inhibiting the transcription of YAP target genes. This interaction helps maintain normal cell growth and prevents excessive cell proliferation (Höffken2021WWC).

WWC3 also acts as a connector between the Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways. It competes with CK1ε for binding to DVL2, which can modulate Wnt signaling, helping to balance these pathways and prevent abnormal cell growth (Höffken2021WWC). Additionally, WWC3 is involved in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis, promoting the expression of apoptosis-related molecules and increasing the activity of caspases 3 and 7, which are important for programmed cell death (Höffken2021WWC).

WWC3 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, liver, and lung, suggesting it may have similar roles in these tissues (Wennmann2014Evolutionary). Its expression pattern and involvement in the Hippo pathway imply a role in organ growth and cell proliferation regulation (Wennmann2014Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WWC3 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, highlighting its clinical significance. In glioma, a type of brain cancer, WWC3 is downregulated, which is associated with increased malignancy. This downregulation leads to enhanced activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Wang2018WWC3; Yang2020Interaction). Overexpression of WWC3 in glioma cells has been shown to inhibit these processes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wang2018WWC3).

In gastric cancer, WWC3 downregulation correlates with poor prognosis and advanced cancer stages. It is associated with increased cell proliferation and invasion, likely due to the inhibition of the Hippo signaling pathway, which WWC3 normally activates to suppress tumor growth (Hou2017WWC3).

In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), WWC3 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis. Reduced WWC3 expression is associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis, as it affects the Hippo pathway and EMT markers (Han2018WWC3). These findings suggest that WWC3 could be a potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
WWC3 interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in various signaling pathways. In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, WWC3 interacts with large tumor suppressor kinase 1 (LATS1) through its WW domain. This interaction enhances LATS1 phosphorylation, which is essential for the activation of the Hippo pathway and the suppression of YAP nuclear import, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and migration (Chen2018WWC3; Han2018WWC3). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), WWC3 interacts with WBP2, which binds to the WW domain of WWC3. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of LATS1 and modulates the Hippo pathway, influencing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Han2021WBP2). 

WWC3 also interacts with Dishevelled 2 (DVL2) to connect Hippo signaling with the Wnt pathway, promoting lung cancer cell proliferation (Höffken2021WWC). In glioma, WWC3 interacts with T cell factor 4 (TCF4), inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and reducing cell proliferation and migration (Wang2018WWC3). 

Additionally, WWC3 is involved in a regulatory axis with BACH2, FUS, and miR-10b-5p, which influences its expression and activity in glioma (Yang2020Interaction).
