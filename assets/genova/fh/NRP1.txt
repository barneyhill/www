# NRP1

## Overview
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as neuropilin-1, which functions as a versatile co-receptor involved in various biological processes, including angiogenesis, neuronal development, and immune responses. The protein neuropilin-1 is characterized by its ability to bind multiple ligands, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorins, thereby modulating key signaling pathways that influence cell migration, proliferation, and survival (Jubb2011Neuropilin‐1; Zachary2011How). As a transmembrane protein, neuropilin-1 is integral to the formation of receptor complexes that facilitate cellular communication and response to environmental cues. Its role in pathological conditions, such as cancer and infectious diseases, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Dong2021Role; Fu2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane protein with a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and neuronal development. The extracellular region of NRP1 is composed of several distinct domains: two complement-binding (CUB) domains, a1 and a2, which are involved in semaphorin binding and contain calcium-binding sites; two coagulation factor V/VIII homology domains, b1 and b2, which are essential for binding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and heparin; and a MAM domain, which is important for receptor dimerization (Appleton2007Structural; Gu2002Characterization).

The b1 domain is particularly significant for its interaction with the basic tail of VEGF, and the presence of heparin enhances this interaction by promoting dimerization of the b1b2 domains (Mamluk2002Neuropilin1; Vander2007Structural). The structure of the b1 domain exhibits a typical coagulation factor fold, and specific loops within this domain are responsible for ligand binding (Vander2007Structural).

NRP1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function. Additionally, NRP1 has splice variant isoforms that may influence its role in cellular processes (Mota2018Architecture). These structural features make NRP1 a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and other diseases.

## Function
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorins, playing a significant role in angiogenesis and neural development. In endothelial cells, NRP1 enhances VEGF165 binding to the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which is crucial for endothelial cell migration, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis (Soker1998Neuropilin-1; Lampropoulou2014Neuropilin). NRP1 is involved in the internalization and recycling of α5β1 integrin, a process essential for cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and endothelial cell spreading on fibronectin (Valdembri2009Neuropilin1GIPC1). This function is mediated through its interaction with the endocytic adaptor GIPC1 and the motor protein Myo6, facilitating integrin traffic and maintaining cell-ECM contacts (Valdembri2009Neuropilin1GIPC1).

In the nervous system, NRP1 acts as a receptor for semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), guiding axon pathfinding and nerve fasciculation, and is essential for normal neural development (Raimondi2013Neuropilin). NRP1-null mice exhibit defects in both vascular and neural systems, underscoring its critical role in these processes (Jubb2011Neuropilin‐1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NRP1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, NRP1 is highly expressed in several types, including bladder cancer, where it influences tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and signaling pathways such as the ERK/MAPK and JNK/MAPK pathways (Dong2021Role). High NRP1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in most cancers, although in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, low expression correlates with shorter survival (Fu2023Comprehensive). NRP1 also plays a role in ocular diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, where its expression in choroidal neovascular membranes affects treatment responses (Raimondi2016NRP1).

In the context of infectious diseases, NRP1 facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, potentially enhancing infectivity and disease severity in cancer patients (Fu2023Comprehensive). Additionally, rare variants in NRP1 have been implicated in lymphedema, affecting the stability and function of the protein, which is crucial for lymphatic valve development (Michelini2020Segregation). These findings highlight NRP1 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and vessel-associated diseases, with ongoing research into inhibitors and antibodies to modulate its activity (Jubb2011Neuropilin‐1).

## Interactions
Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in angiogenesis and neuronal development. NRP1 interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), particularly VEGF-A 165, enhancing its signaling by forming complexes with VEGFR2. This interaction is essential for angiogenic signaling and endothelial cell migration (Neufeld2002The; Zachary2011How). NRP1 also binds to semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), forming receptor complexes with PlexinA1, which are critical for neuronal axon guidance and growth cone collapse (Smith2022From; Roth2008Transmembrane).

NRP1's transmembrane domain contains a GxxxG motif that mediates dimerization and oligomerization, necessary for effective semaphorin signaling (Roth2008Transmembrane). Additionally, NRP1 interacts with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), acting as a co-receptor to enhance signaling pathways involved in cell migration and proliferation (Zachary2011How; Sulpice2008Neuropilin1). These interactions highlight NRP1's role as a versatile co-receptor, influencing various cellular processes through its ability to form multiprotein complexes and modulate signaling pathways.
