# RAB14

## Overview
RAB14 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular membrane trafficking. The RAB14 protein plays a pivotal role in both endocytic and exocytic pathways, primarily localizing to early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. It is crucial for vesicle transport and membrane fusion processes, including the fusion of early endosomes with phagosomes and lysosomal fusion, which are essential for maintaining endosomal function (Yamamoto2010Functional). In epithelial cells, RAB14 is integral to cell polarity and apical membrane specification, interacting with proteins such as Arf6 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (Lu2016Rab14). The protein's interactions with various effectors, including Rab coupling protein (RCP) and Rab11 family interacting proteins (FIPs), underscore its role in endosomal tethering and trafficking (Lall2015StructureFunction). RAB14's involvement in cancer pathogenesis, particularly in gastric and bladder cancers, highlights its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chao2019RAB14; Guo2017Rab14).

## Function
Rab14, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is a small GTPase involved in intracellular membrane trafficking, playing a crucial role in both endocytic and exocytic pathways. It is primarily localized to early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, where it regulates vesicle transport between these organelles (Yamamoto2010Functional). Rab14 is essential for the fusion of early endosomes with phagosomes during phagocytosis and in lysosomal fusion, highlighting its role in maintaining endosomal function and membrane trafficking (Yamamoto2010Functional).

In epithelial cells, Rab14 is critical for establishing and maintaining cell polarity. It is involved in apical membrane specification by regulating lipid localization and interacting with proteins such as Arf6 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase α (Lu2016Rab14). Rab14 also affects the activity and localization of Cdc42, a component of the polarity complex, which is essential for proper epithelial cyst morphogenesis (Lu2016Rab14).

Rab14's interaction with RUFY1/Rabip4, a Rab4 effector, is crucial for efficient recycling of endocytosed transferrin, indicating its role in endosomal tethering and fusion (Yamamoto2010Functional). This protein is also involved in the trafficking of podocalyxin to the apical domain, which is vital for normal lumen formation in epithelial cells (Lu2016Rab14).

## Clinical Significance
RAB14, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and migration. In gastric cancer, RAB14 acts as an oncogene, promoting tumor growth through the AKT signaling pathway. Overexpression of RAB14 in gastric cancer cells leads to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Guo2017Rab14).

In bladder cancer, RAB14 is highly expressed and associated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression through the MAPK/ERK and autophagy-dependent AKT signaling pathways. Knockdown of RAB14 in bladder cancer cells reduces migration, invasion, and tumorigenicity, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter (Chao2019RAB14; Deng2023RAB14).

RAB14's involvement in cancer is further supported by its regulation through miRNAs with tumor-suppressive activities, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Yong2021Cancerdriving). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RAB14 in cancer pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RAB14, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking. RAB14 interacts with Rab coupling protein (RCP) and Rab11 family interacting proteins (FIPs), particularly class I FIPs such as FIP2 and Rip11. These interactions occur at the C-terminal region containing the Rab11-binding domain (RBD) (Lall2015StructureFunction). RAB14 forms a complex with RCP in a noncanonical 1:2 stoichiometry, which is distinct from the 1:1 stoichiometry observed with Rab11 and Rab25 (Lall2015StructureFunction).

RAB14 also interacts with RUFY1/Rabip4, a protein initially identified as a Rab4 effector. This interaction is GTP-dependent and is essential for recruiting RUFY1 onto endosomal membranes, facilitating endosomal tethering and fusion (Yamamoto2010Functional). RAB14's interaction with RUFY1 is specific, as it does not interact with other Rab proteins in their GTP-bound forms (Yamamoto2010Functional).

In the context of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trafficking, RAB14 interacts with Rab11-FIP1C, playing a critical role in directing the envelope glycoprotein to the plasma membrane assembly site, which is essential for viral particle incorporation (Qi2013Rab11FIP1C).
