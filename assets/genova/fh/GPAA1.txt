# GPAA1

## Overview
The GPAA1 gene encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment 1 protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex. This protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins by facilitating the attachment of GPI anchors. These anchors are essential for the proper localization and function of various proteins on the cell surface, impacting processes such as cell signaling, adhesion, and immune response (Xu2022Molecular; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). As a metalloenzyme, GPAA1 is part of the M28 family of metalloproteases, although it exhibits unique structural features that distinguish it from typical Zn2+-proteases (Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). Mutations in the GPAA1 gene have been linked to several pathologies, including neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2019GPAA1; Fontana2023A).

## Structure
The GPAA1 protein is a subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is involved in the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins in eukaryotes. The protein contains an N-terminal transmembrane region followed by six additional transmembrane helices, indicating its integral membrane nature (Saw2013Lowresolution; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). The luminal domain of GPAA1 is approximately 300 amino acids in length and is characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold, featuring a central 8-strand β-sheet surrounded by 7 α-helices, with a secondary structure content of about 28% α-helix and 27% β-sheet (Saw2013Lowresolution; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase).

The GPAA1 protein is a metalloenzyme, likely containing a single zinc ion coordinated by conserved polar residues, such as Asp153, Asp188, Glu226, and Tyr328 in humans, which align with those in other M28-type peptidases (Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). The tertiary structure is predicted with high confidence, suggesting a conserved fold among M28-type peptidases, despite low sequence identity with known structures (Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). The quaternary structure involves its participation in a larger transamidase complex, interacting with other subunits like PIG-K, PIG-S, and PIG-T, which are crucial for its function (Saw2013Lowresolution; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase).

## Function
The GPAA1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is responsible for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins in eukaryotic cells. This process occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane, impacting their localization, stability, and function (Xu2022Molecular; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase). The GPAA1 protein is part of the M28 family of metalloproteases and is characterized by a metallo-peptide synthetase activity, although it lacks a fully conserved zinc-binding motif typical of Zn2+-proteases (Xu2022Molecular; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase).

GPAA1 plays a role in presenting an amino group in the 'bridging EtNP' of the mature GPI precursor for nucleophilic attack, facilitating the attachment of GPI's ethanolamine phosphate to the ω amino acid via an amide bond (Kinoshita2016Thematic). This function is vital for the proper expression and function of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, which are involved in various cellular processes, including fertilization, neurogenesis, and immunity (Xu2022Molecular). Disruption of GPAA1 can lead to reduced surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins, affecting cellular functions and potentially leading to pathologies such as neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers (Xu2022Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GPAA1 gene are associated with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis defect 15, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. This condition results from biallelic loss of function of GPAA1, leading to abnormal or insufficient GPI anchors, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Fontana2023A). Patients with this disorder often present with severe developmental delays and neurological abnormalities, including spasticity, ataxic gait, and nystagmus (Fontana2023A).

In addition to neurological disorders, GPAA1 mutations have been linked to inherited vascular anomalies. A specific missense variant, c.968A > G, has been associated with vascular anomalies in a family, affecting endothelial cell behavior and leading to vascular structure instability (Li2020A). This variant causes reduced expression and altered localization of GPAA1, contributing to increased proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (Li2020A).

GPAA1 is also implicated in cancer, particularly gastric cancer, where it is overexpressed due to chromosomal amplification. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and promotes cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation and metastasis through the ERBB2 signaling pathway (Zhang2019GPAA1).

## Interactions
GPAA1 interacts with the RNA-binding protein SF3B4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is significant for the regulation of GPAA1 mRNA stability, as SF3B4 binds to and stabilizes GPAA1 mRNA, which has been confirmed through RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The expression levels of GPAA1 and SF3B4 are positively correlated, and both are associated with poor overall survival in HCC patients. Knockdown of SF3B4 reduces the mRNA and protein stability of GPAA1, suggesting that SF3B4 modulates the progression of HCC by interacting with GPAA1. Overexpression of SF3B4 can reverse the effects of GPAA1 knockdown on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, indicating a functional interaction between these two proteins (Ge2022GPAA1).

GPAA1 is also a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which includes other proteins such as PIGT, PIGU, PIGK, and PIGS. Within this complex, GPAA1 interacts with PIGT and PIGU, contributing to the assembly and function of the complex. The GPI transamidase complex is crucial for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins, a key post-translational modification (Xu2022Molecular; Eisenhaber2014Transamidase).
