# SETD5

## Overview
SETD5 is a gene that encodes the SET domain containing 5 protein, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of a SET domain, typically associated with histone methyltransferase activity, although its catalytic function remains debated due to structural differences that affect cofactor binding (Kuechler2014Lossoffunction; Nakagawa2023Neurobehavioral). SETD5 is involved in forming co-repressor complexes and is implicated in transcriptional regulation by influencing histone methylation, particularly at the H3K36 residue (Li2023Structure; Sessa2019SETD5). The protein's interactions with various complexes and transcription factors underscore its role in cellular differentiation and development, as well as its involvement in cancer progression (Cho2023SETD5; Matsumura2021Spatiotemporala). Clinically, mutations in the SETD5 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its significance in normal brain development and function (Grozeva2014De; Sessa2019SETD5).

## Structure
The SETD5 protein is composed of 1442 amino acids and contains a SET domain, which is typically associated with histone methyltransferase activity. However, the SET domain of SETD5 differs from those of active methyltransferases at several key residues, which disrupts the binding of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cofactor necessary for catalysis, leaving its catalytic activity unclear (Kuechler2014Lossoffunction; Nakagawa2023Neurobehavioral). Despite this, some studies have reported intrinsic methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting the H3K36 residue on histones, although this is debated (Sessa2019SETD5).

SETD5 is predicted to contain a putative PHD domain, which has not been previously described for this protein, suggesting a potential role in chromatin modification (Kuechler2014Lossoffunction). The protein is involved in forming a co-repressor complex with HDAC3, NCoR, G9a, and PAF1, which are involved in selective deacetylation and methylation processes (Li2023Structure). SETD5's main role is gene activation through trimethylation of H3K36, utilizing SAM as a methyl group donor, and it can also induce methylation of H3K9 independently of its SET domain (Li2023Structure). The protein is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex, intestine, and eye (Kuechler2014Lossoffunction).

## Function
SETD5 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin modification and gene regulation, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by influencing histone methylation. In healthy human cells, SETD5 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it regulates chromatin methylation states and maintains transcriptional fidelity during brain development and neuronal wiring (Sessa2019SETD5). It specifically targets histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36), a modification associated with active transcription, ensuring proper transcription elongation and co-transcriptional processing (Sessa2019SETD5).

SETD5 is associated with the polymerase-associated factor 1 (PAF1) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) complexes, which are involved in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation (Nakagawa2020The). It plays a significant role in neural cell proliferation by promoting rDNA expression, necessary for ribosomal RNA production and protein synthesis (Nakagawa2020The). SETD5's activity is essential for maintaining normal levels of H3K36me3, and its loss results in decreased methylation, affecting transcription elongation and gene expression programs that regulate neural stem cell proliferation and synaptic transmission (Sessa2019SETD5). The gene's function is conserved across species, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Sessa2019SETD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SETD5 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SETD5, which encodes a methyltransferase, have been identified as a significant cause of ID, often presenting with additional features such as congenital heart defects, skeletal anomalies, and distinctive facial morphology (Grozeva2014De; Kuechler2014Lossoffunction). These mutations are frequently de novo and lead to haploinsufficiency, contributing to the core phenotype of microdeletion 3p25.3 syndrome (Kuechler2014Lossoffunction).

Individuals with SETD5 mutations may exhibit a spectrum of clinical features, including moderate to severe intellectual impairment, speech and language delays, and behavioral problems such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and ASD-like behaviors (Sessa2019SETD5). The phenotypic expression can vary, as seen in familial cases where affected individuals show different levels of intellectual impairment and physical anomalies (Szczałuba2016SETD5).

SETD5 mutations are also linked to specific syndromes like KBG syndrome, characterized by learning difficulties and neurobehavioral problems (Nakagawa2023Neurobehavioral). The gene's role in chromatin modification and gene regulation is crucial, and its disruption can lead to the observed clinical manifestations (Nakagawa2020The).

## Interactions
SETD5 is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in chromatin modification and gene regulation. It interacts with the NCoR-HDAC3 complex, which is crucial for maintaining enhancers in a hypoacetylated, primed state during adipogenesis. This interaction restricts the accessibility of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to enhancer chromatin, thereby regulating the timing of enhancer activation (Matsumura2021Spatiotemporala). SETD5 also interacts with transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which are important for its recruitment to enhancers during early differentiation stages (Matsumura2021Spatiotemporala).

In the context of cancer, SETD5 interacts with OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase) and RNA polymerase II, facilitating the O-GlcNAcylation of RNA Pol II. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with cancer stemness, particularly in colorectal cancer cells (Cho2023SETD5). SETD5 also binds to EP300 and HIF1α, which are involved in glycolysis regulation in breast cancer stem-like cells, highlighting its role in metabolic reprogramming under hypoxic conditions (Yang2020SETD5). These interactions underscore SETD5's multifaceted role in both normal cellular differentiation and cancer progression.
