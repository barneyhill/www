# CARD11

## Overview
CARD11, or caspase recruitment domain family member 11, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein integral to the adaptive immune system, particularly in T and B lymphocytes. The protein, also known as CARMA1, is categorized as a multi-domain scaffold protein and plays a pivotal role in mediating signal transduction from antigen receptors to downstream signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor kB (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. CARD11 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), coiled-coil (CC) domains, and a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, facilitating its function in immune cell signaling (Lork2019Ubiquitination; Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic). The protein's activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation, which modulates its interactions with other signaling molecules, ensuring proper immune responses and preventing pathological conditions such as immunodeficiencies and lymphomas (Lenz2008Oncogenic; Bedsaul2018Mechanisms).

## Structure
CARD11, also known as CARMA1, is a multi-domain scaffold protein involved in immune cell signaling. It is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a LATCH domain, coiled-coil (CC) domains, and a C-terminal membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) domain, which includes PDZ, SH3, and GUK domains (Lork2019Ubiquitination; Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic). The CARD domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions necessary for signaling pathways such as NF-κB activation (Dadi2018Combined).

The coiled-coil domains facilitate oligomerization, which is essential for downstream signaling (Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic). The MAGUK domain is involved in membrane association and the formation of microclusters at the immunological synapse (Lork2019Ubiquitination). CARD11 is maintained in an autoinhibited state through intramolecular interactions involving the CARD and CC regions, which are released upon phosphorylation (Lork2019Ubiquitination).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of CARD11, regulating its transition from an inactive to an active state, allowing it to recruit signaling partners (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms). Specific serine residues within the inhibitory domain (ID) are phosphorylated to neutralize repressive elements, facilitating cofactor binding (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms). The protein's structure and function are tightly regulated to prevent dysregulated signaling, which can lead to diseases such as immunodeficiencies and lymphomas (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms).

## Function
CARD11, also known as caspase recruitment domain family member 11, is a crucial scaffold protein in the adaptive immune system, primarily active in T and B lymphocytes. It plays a significant role in linking antigen receptor engagement to downstream signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor kB (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways (Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic; Zhao2021Identification). 

In healthy human cells, CARD11 is involved in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for lymphocyte activation, proliferation, and survival (Lenz2008Oncogenic). Upon antigen receptor stimulation, CARD11 undergoes a conformational change, allowing it to interact with signaling partners such as Bcl10 and MALT1, forming the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. This complex is critical for the activation of the IKK complex, leading to the degradation of inhibitory IκB proteins and the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus to activate target genes (Turvey2014The; Bedsaul2018Mechanisms).

CARD11 also supports mTOR activation, independent of the IKK complex, and is involved in JNK signaling activation, highlighting its role in regulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms). The protein's oligomerization is necessary for its function, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes that lead to the activation of downstream pathways (Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CARD11 gene are associated with a range of immunological disorders. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in CARD11 can lead to B-cell expansion with NF-κB and T-cell anergy (BENTA) disease, characterized by lymphoproliferative disorders and hyperproliferative B cells (Wei2019Pathogenic; Urdinez2022Expanding). These mutations are also linked to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with CARD11 mutations found in about 10% of DLBCL cases (Wei2019Pathogenic).

Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in CARD11 can result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other immune dysregulation conditions, such as CARD11-associated atopy with dominant interference of NF-κB signaling (CADINS) (Urdinez2022Expanding; Lu2018The). These mutations often lead to severe atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, elevated serum IgE levels, and eosinophilia (Ma2017Germline).

Hypomorphic mutations in CARD11 are linked to a broader spectrum of diseases, including common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), neutropenia, and cutaneous viral infections (Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic). These mutations can disrupt TCR-induced NF-κB activation, leading to impaired immune responses (Dorjbal2019Hypomorphic).

## Interactions
CARD11, also known as CARMA1, is a scaffolding protein that plays a crucial role in the NF-κB signaling pathway by forming the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex. This complex is essential for NF-κB activation following antigen receptor stimulation in T and B cells (Turvey2014The; Lork2019Ubiquitination). CARD11 interacts with BCL10 through CARD-CARD interactions, facilitating the recruitment of MALT1, which is constitutively associated with BCL10 (Lork2019Ubiquitination). 

CARD11 also interacts with other signaling cofactors such as TRAF6, TAK1, IKKγ, and caspase-8. These interactions are regulated by the inhibitory domain (ID) of CARD11, which is neutralized upon phosphorylation, allowing CARD11 to transition from an inactive to an active scaffold (McCully2008The). The coiled-coil domain of CARD11 is crucial for the recruitment of TRAF6, IKKγ, and caspase-8, while the CARD domain is necessary for TAK1 binding (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms). 

Phosphorylation of CARD11 at serine 893 by PKCθ impairs the formation of the CBM complex by reducing its binding to BCL10, MALT1, and TRAF2, highlighting the importance of phosphorylation in modulating CARD11 interactions (Kutzner2022Phosphorylation). These interactions are critical for the assembly of signaling complexes that lead to the activation of the IKK complex in the NF-κB pathway (Bedsaul2018Mechanisms).
