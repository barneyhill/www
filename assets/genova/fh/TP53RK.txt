# TP53RK

## Overview
TP53RK is a gene that encodes the TP53 regulating kinase, a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the KEOPS complex, TP53RK plays a critical role in tRNA modification, specifically in the synthesis of N-6-threonyl-carbamoyl adenosine (t6A), which is essential for translational efficiency and accuracy (Chen2023Novel; Braun2017Mutations). The protein kinase is also implicated in the DNA damage response pathway, where it interacts with proteins such as PARP1 to maintain genomic stability and regulate the tumor suppressor protein p53, influencing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (davis2016comparative; Braun2017Mutations). TP53RK's activity is crucial for cellular growth and survival, with its dysfunction linked to disorders such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome and various cancers (Li2021Crystal; Chen2023Novel).

## Structure
The TP53RK gene encodes a protein kinase that adopts a bilobate kinase domain structure, consisting of an N-lobe and a C-lobe. A cleft between these lobes harbors the ATP analog, AMP-PNP, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Chen2023Novel). The protein structure includes specific amino acid residues that play significant roles in its function. For example, Arg62 is located near the ATP binding pocket, and its substitution can disrupt hydrogen bonds essential for catalytic activity. Tyr112, part of strand β4, interacts with TPRKB, and mutations here can affect spatial stability through changes in π-π stacking interactions. Arg249 is situated in the PRPK helix αH, close to the OSGEP catalytic center, and mutations can disrupt interactions with OSGEP (Chen2023Novel).

TP53RK is a component of the KEOPS complex, which is essential for tRNA modification, transcription control, and telomere regulation. The KEOPS complex consists of five subunits: LAGE3, OSGEP, PRPK, TPRKB, and C14orf142/GON7 (Chen2023Novel). The protein has two potential isoforms, but the clinical significance of each is unknown (Chen2023Novel). The structure of TP53RK, also known as PRPK, is crucial for its interactions within the KEOPS complex, particularly with TPRKB and OSGEP (Li2021Crystal).

## Function
TP53RK, also known as TP53 regulating kinase, is a protein kinase that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes. It is a component of the KEOPS complex, which is essential for the modification of tRNA, specifically the synthesis of N-6-threonyl-carbamoyl adenosine (t6A). This modification is critical for enhancing translational efficiency and accuracy, impacting protein synthesis in healthy human cells (Chen2023Novel; Braun2017Mutations).

TP53RK is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, where it can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis if DNA damage is severe. It interacts with the DNA repair protein PARP1 and is implicated in maintaining genomic stability (Braun2017Mutations). The protein also plays a role in actin cytoskeleton organization, interacting with the ARP2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin remodeling and cell migration (Braun2017Mutations).

In addition to its role in the KEOPS complex, TP53RK is involved in the regulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. It phosphorylates p53, stabilizing and activating it, which can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, particularly in response to stress signals such as viral infection (davis2016comparative). TP53RK is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell growth and survival (Braun2017Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TP53RK gene are associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by early-onset nephrotic syndrome and primary microcephaly. The KEOPS complex, which includes TP53RK, plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as DNA damage response, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Disruptions in these processes due to TP53RK mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome and microcephaly (Braun2017Mutations).

A specific mutation, c.194A > T (p.Lys65Met), has been identified in a Korean family with GAMOS, leading to early-onset nephrotic syndrome, microcephaly, and early fatal outcomes (Hyun2018A). In contrast, some novel TP53RK variants have been found in Chinese patients with GAMOS who did not exhibit nephrotic syndrome, highlighting the clinical variability associated with these mutations (Chen2023Novel).

The TP53RK gene is also involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is important for podocyte function. Mutations in TP53RK can impair cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, and lead to genomic instability, contributing to the disease's clinical manifestations (Braun2017Mutations).

## Interactions
TP53RK, also known as TP53 regulating kinase, is a component of the KEOPS/EKC complex, which is essential for tRNA modification. Within this complex, TP53RK interacts with several proteins, including TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3, and GON7. These interactions are crucial for the complex's function in cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation and DNA damage response (Li2021Crystal; Braun2017Mutations).

TP53RK forms a direct interaction with TPRKB, which is significant for maintaining the active conformation of TP53RK. This interaction involves extensive contacts, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, which help stabilize the complex (Li2021Crystal). The PRPK-TPRKB complex also exhibits autophosphorylation activity, which is enhanced by TPRKB, suggesting a regulatory role in TP53RK's kinase activity (Li2021Crystal).

Mutations in TP53RK can disrupt its interactions within the KEOPS complex, particularly with TPRKB, leading to impaired protein functionality and cellular defects. For instance, the truncating mutation p.Lys60Serfs*61 and the missense mutation p.Thr81Arg in TP53RK abrogate its interaction with TPRKB, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Braun2017Mutations). These interactions and their disruptions are linked to diseases such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome and various cancers (Li2021Crystal; Chen2023Novel).
