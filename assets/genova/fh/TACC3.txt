# TACC3

## Overview
TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in cell division by regulating microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle assembly. The TACC3 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a conserved C-terminal TACC domain, which is essential for its localization to the centrosome and interaction with other proteins during mitosis. As a microtubule-associated protein, TACC3 interacts with the microtubule polymerase chTOG and clathrin, facilitating proper chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability. The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, which influences its recruitment to the mitotic spindle. TACC3 is highly expressed in proliferative tissues and is crucial for normal cell proliferation and survival. Its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where it is often overexpressed or involved in oncogenic fusion events, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Thakur2014The; Saatci2022Targeting; Hood2013Coordination).

## Structure
The TACC3 protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes a variable N-terminal region, a central serine-proline-glutamate-rich repeat region, and a highly conserved C-terminal TACC domain. The TACC domain, approximately 200 amino acids long, is crucial for centrosomal localization and protein-protein interactions, and it is divided into two coiled-coil subdomains, CC1 and CC2 (Thakur2014The; Thakur2013Role). The N-terminal region contains binding sites for the mitotic kinase Aurora-A, which phosphorylates specific serine residues, affecting the protein's localization during cell division (Thakur2013Role).

The central region of TACC3 includes seven conserved serine-proline-glutamate-rich repeats, each 24 amino acids long, which are crucial for intramolecular interactions (Thakur2014The). The protein's structure is polydisperse, ranging from dimeric to hexameric forms, and exhibits an elongated, fiber-like appearance, consistent with its ability to form ordered polymers that interact with microtubules (Thakur2014The; Thakur2013Role).

TACC3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Aurora-A kinase, which is essential for its recruitment to the mitotic spindle and interaction with clathrin (Hood2013Coordination). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during mitosis (Gimenez2024Constrained).

## Function
TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3) is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle assembly during cell division. It interacts with the microtubule polymerase chTOG, a member of the XMAP215 family, through specific C-terminal subdomains, facilitating proper chromosome segregation (Thakur2014The). TACC3 is highly expressed in proliferative tissues, with its expression peaking during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, where it maintains centrosomal integrity and spindle microtubule stability (Thakur2014The).

The protein localizes to the centrosome and mitotic spindle in mitotic cells, colocalizing with α-tubulin on spindle microtubules and γ-tubulin in the centrosomal region (Piekorz2002The). TACC3 functions as an engagement factor for the C terminus of XMAP215/chTOG, ensuring a dynamic balance between microtubule rescue and catastrophe, which is vital for shifting the equilibrium toward microtubule polymerization during the G2/M transition and metaphase (Thakur2014The).

TACC3's role extends to regulating kinetochore-microtubule connections and central spindle assembly during mitosis, contributing to genomic stability and normal cell proliferation (Thakur2014The). Its deficiency can lead to severe growth retardation and embryonic lethality, underscoring its importance in cell proliferation and survival (Thakur2014The).

## Clinical Significance
TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3) is implicated in several cancers due to its role in chromosomal stability and cell division. In aggressive cancers characterized by centrosome amplification (CA), such as breast cancer, TACC3 is often overexpressed, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Inhibition of TACC3 in these cancers disrupts its interaction with KIFC1, leading to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Saatci2022Targeting).

TACC3 is also involved in oncogenic fusion events, notably with FGFR3 in glioblastoma. The FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein exhibits constitutive kinase activity, contributing to chromosomal segregation defects and aneuploidy, which drive tumorigenesis. This fusion is present in a subset of glioblastomas and is associated with distinct genetic profiles. Targeted FGFR inhibitors have shown efficacy in preclinical models and some clinical cases, highlighting the fusion's potential as a therapeutic target (Singh2012Transforming; Mata2020Genetic; Di2015Detection).

Overall, TACC3's involvement in cancer is marked by its overexpression in tumors with CA and its participation in oncogenic fusions, making it a significant focus for targeted cancer therapies.

## Interactions
TACC3 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for mitotic spindle assembly and stability. TACC3 interacts with the microtubule polymerase chTOG through its C-terminal region, specifically the CC1 domain, which is crucial for targeting chTOG to spindle poles in an Aurora-A-independent manner. This interaction shifts the equilibrium toward microtubule polymerization during mitosis (Thakur2014The).

TACC3 also forms a complex with clathrin and chTOG, which is vital for its function during mitosis. The interaction with clathrin is mediated by the clathrin-interacting domain (CID) and the TACC domain of TACC3, and is regulated by Aurora A kinase phosphorylation at serine 558. This phosphorylation is necessary for the recruitment of TACC3 and clathrin to the mitotic spindle (Hood2013Coordination).

The TACC3-clathrin interaction results in a composite microtubule interaction surface, promoting microtubule bundling. The interaction between TACC3 and clathrin is facilitated by specific regions, including the CHC ankle and TACC3 CID, which are crucial for their localization to the spindle (Hood2013Coordination).
