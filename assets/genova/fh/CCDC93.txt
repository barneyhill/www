# CCDC93

## Overview
CCDC93 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 93 protein, which is a critical component of the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex. This protein is involved in endosomal trafficking, a process essential for the recycling of cell surface receptors and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The CCDC93 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, which facilitate its interactions within the CCC complex and with other proteins such as CCDC22 and COMMD proteins (Healy2018Structural; Yong2023Commanding). Functionally, CCDC93 plays a significant role in cholesterol and copper homeostasis by regulating the trafficking of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the copper transporter ATP7A, respectively (Kleber2019LDL; PhillipsKrawczak2015COMMD1). Mutations in the CCDC93 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including hypercholesterolemia and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in human health (Healy2023Structure; Bartuzi2016CCC).

## Structure
The CCDC93 protein is a component of the CCC complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal trafficking. It contains an N-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, connected by a long linker. These domains are essential for its function within the CCC complex, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Healy2018Structural; Yong2023Commanding). The coiled-coil regions of CCDC93, specifically CC1 to CC4, enable it to form a heterodimer with CCDC22, resulting in two V-shaped structures. The first V-shape interacts with DENND10, while the second associates with the Retriever complex via VPS35L (Yong2023Commanding).

In terms of post-translational modifications, specific lysine residues on CCDC93 are involved in binding interactions, as revealed by cross-linking experiments (Healy2018Structural). The protein's structure is conserved across species, although the Arabidopsis homologue lacks the N-terminal CH domain, indicating some structural divergence (Lewis2022CCDC22). The interaction of CCDC93 with COMMD proteins, particularly Commd9, is mediated through the NN-CH domain, highlighting its role in protein-protein interactions within the CCC complex (Healy2018Structural).

## Function
CCDC93 is a component of the evolutionarily conserved COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal trafficking and cellular organization. This complex is involved in the recycling of cell surface receptors, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which is essential for maintaining plasma cholesterol levels. The recycling process ensures the availability of LDLR on the cell surface, thereby regulating plasma LDL cholesterol levels and contributing to cholesterol homeostasis (Kleber2019LDL; Lüscher2020Understanding).

CCDC93 also interacts with the WASH complex, particularly through its binding with FAM21, which is crucial for the proper localization and function of the copper transporter ATP7A. This interaction is essential for the endosomal trafficking of ATP7A, affecting copper homeostasis in cells (PhillipsKrawczak2015COMMD1). The CCC complex, including CCDC93, is necessary for the retrograde transport of ATP7A to the trans-Golgi network and its trafficking to the plasma membrane, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular copper levels (PhillipsKrawczak2015COMMD1).

In summary, CCDC93 is integral to the regulation of endosomal trafficking, impacting both cholesterol and copper homeostasis, which are vital for cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCDC93 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. The CCDC93 gene is part of the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, which plays a crucial role in the endosomal trafficking of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Mutations affecting the CCC complex, including CCDC93, can lead to hypercholesterolemia due to impaired LDLR function, resulting in elevated plasma LDL cholesterol levels (Bartuzi2016CCC).

The CCDC93 gene is also linked to cardiovascular health. A common variant, p.Pro228Leu, is associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol levels and a decreased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality. This variant enhances the recycling of LDLR, contributing to its protective effect against cardiovascular diseases (Rimbert2019A).

Additionally, mutations in CCDC93 are implicated in developmental disorders such as X-linked intellectual disability and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. These conditions are characterized by altered craniofacial features, cerebellar hypoplasia, and cardiovascular development issues. The mutations often affect the structural integrity of the Commander complex, which includes CCDC93, leading to significant loss of protein levels and associated clinical phenotypes (Healy2023Structure).

## Interactions
CCDC93 is a component of the Retriever-CCC endosomal recycling complex and the Commander complex, where it plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions. It forms a heterodimer with CCDC22, which acts as a scaffold connecting various components, including the Retriever subcomplex and DENND10 (Boesch2023Structural; Yong2023Commanding). The CCDC22-CCDC93 dimer binds to VPS35L, a process dependent on VPS29, and this interaction is essential for the binding to the CCC complex (Boesch2023Structural).

CCDC93 also interacts with COMMD proteins, including COMMD2, COMMD4, COMMD7, and COMMD9, primarily through its N-terminal calponin homology-like (NN-CH) domain. These interactions are mediated by the COMM domain of the COMMD proteins, with specific lysine residues involved in the binding process (Healy2018Structural; Laulumaa2023Structure). The interaction with COMMD proteins forms a complex resembling 'tweezers' pinching into a 'donut', with CCDC93 making extensive contacts with the COMMD ring (Boesch2023Structural).

CCDC93's interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the complexes it is part of, affecting processes such as endosomal trafficking and cellular signaling (Boesch2023Structural; Laulumaa2023Structure).
