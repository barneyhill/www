# UBASH3B

## Overview
UBASH3B, also known as TULA-2, is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing B protein, which is a ubiquitin receptor involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its domain architecture, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain, a central Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a C-terminal histidine phosphatase domain. These domains facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and phosphatase activity, which are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. UBASH3B is particularly significant in mitotic processes, such as chromosome segregation, and in the regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is essential for genomic stability. Additionally, it plays a role in BCR-ABL signaling, influencing cellular signaling pathways in leukemia. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as CBL and Aurora B kinase, underscore its importance in cell proliferation and cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers (Goyama2015UBASH3BSts1CBL; Lee2013Protein; Krupina2016Ubiquitin).

## Structure
UBASH3B, also known as TULA-2, is a protein encoded by the UBASH3B gene and is characterized by a unique domain architecture. The protein is 649 amino acids long with a molecular mass of 72,696 Daltons (Vukojević2024The). It contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain (UBA), a centrally located Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a C-terminal histidine phosphatase domain, also referred to as a phosphoglycerate mutase-like domain (Vukojević2024The). The SH3 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, such as binding to CBL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Vukojević2024The). The histidine phosphatase domain is involved in hydrolyzing low-molecular-weight phosphatase substrates (Vukojević2024The).

UBASH3B is involved in cellular signaling and may undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (Vukojević2024The). The protein's phosphatase activity is crucial for its function, as demonstrated in studies where a phosphatase-dead mutant of UBASH3B failed to promote cell invasion and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer models (Lee2013Protein). Splice variant isoforms of UBASH3B may exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Vukojević2024The).

## Function
UBASH3B, also known as TULA-2, is a ubiquitin receptor protein that plays a critical role in mitotic processes, particularly in chromosome segregation during cell division. It interacts with ubiquitylated Aurora B kinase, a key mitotic factor, facilitating its relocalization from centromeres to microtubules. This relocalization is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and is independent of changes in Aurora B protein levels (Krupina2016Ubiquitin). UBASH3B forms a complex with the mitotic kinesin MKlp2, which is necessary for targeting Aurora B to microtubules, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Krupina2016Ubiquitin).

UBASH3B is also involved in the regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is essential for maintaining genomic stability. Overexpression of UBASH3B can lead to premature SAC silencing, resulting in erroneous chromosome segregation and aneuploidy (Krupina2017UBASH3Bmediated). The protein's interaction with microtubules and its role in tethering Aurora B to these structures highlight its importance in mitotic progression and fidelity (Krupina2016Ubiquitin).

In addition to its role in mitosis, UBASH3B is involved in BCR-ABL signaling, particularly in the context of leukemia. It acts as a tyrosine phosphatase, modulating the phosphorylation status of key signaling molecules, thereby influencing cellular signaling pathways (Cutler2019Integrative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UBASH3B gene have been implicated in various cancers. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), UBASH3B is overexpressed and contributes to malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Lee2013Protein).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), UBASH3B expression is downregulated, correlating with poor overall survival. Its role in LUAD involves the dephosphorylation of MRPL12, impacting mitochondrial metabolism and tumor suppression. This suggests a potential tumor-suppressive role for UBASH3B in LUAD (Ji2024UBASH3Bmediated).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in AML1-ETO-induced leukemia, UBASH3B is upregulated and interacts with the CBL gene to sustain leukemic cell growth. This interaction suggests that UBASH3B could be a target for therapeutic intervention in leukemia (Goyama2015UBASH3BSts1CBL).

These findings highlight the diverse roles of UBASH3B in cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can either promote or suppress tumor development depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
UBASH3B, also known as TULA-2, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with CBL, a ubiquitin ligase, and modulates its phosphorylation, which affects CBL's activity and promotes cell proliferation in AML1-ETO leukemia cells (Goyama2015UBASH3BSts1CBL). UBASH3B also binds constitutively to CBL, impacting its phosphorylation pattern and function (Goyama2015UBASH3BSts1CBL). In the context of BCR-ABL signaling, UBASH3B interacts with the p210 variant of the BCR-ABL oncogene, affecting the phosphorylation and interaction of several proteins, including c-CBL, SHIP1, and STAT5 (Cutler2019Integrative). 

UBASH3B forms a complex with the microtubule motor protein MKlp2, facilitating the relocalization of Aurora B kinase from chromosomes to microtubules, which is crucial for mitotic progression (Krupina2017UBASH3Bmediated). In triple-negative breast cancer, UBASH3B interacts with EGFR and CBL, enhancing EGFR protein stability by inhibiting CBL-mediated degradation (Lee2013Protein). These interactions highlight UBASH3B's role in regulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in various cancers.
