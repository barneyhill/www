# TPRN

## Overview
The TPRN gene encodes the protein taperin, which is integral to the structural organization and function of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. Taperin is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, playing a pivotal role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton at the base of stereocilia, a region known as the taper. This modulation is essential for maintaining the stability and proper function of these sensory structures, which are crucial for auditory perception. Taperin interacts with a variety of proteins, including GRXCR2, Fam65b, PTPRQ, CLIC5, radixin, and MYO6, forming a multiprotein complex that stabilizes membrane-cytoskeletal linkages. Mutations in the TPRN gene are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically at the DFNB79 locus, underscoring its importance in auditory function and its potential impact on hearing impairments (Liu2018GRXCR2; Salles2013CLIC5; Rehman2010Targeted).

## Structure
The TPRN gene encodes the protein taperin, which is implicated in the structure and function of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. Taperin is composed of 711 amino acids, although a shorter isoform of 650 amino acids is also predicted (Rehman2010Targeted). The protein lacks conserved domains or motifs as identified by SMART or BLAST against the CDD database, but it contains regions of low complexity and intrinsic disorder. A low-probability predicted coiled-coil domain is located towards the C terminus (Rehman2010Targeted).

Taperin shares some similarity with phostensin, an actin filament pointed-end-capping protein, with a specific region showing 56% identity and 76% similarity (Rehman2010Targeted). This suggests a potential role in actin dynamics, although taperin itself does not have a well-defined quaternary structure or known post-translational modifications detailed in the available literature.

Mutations in the TPRN gene, such as the c.1056G>A (p.W352X) mutation, result in a truncated protein of 412 amino acids, which may lead to nonsense-mediated RNA decay or a nonfunctional protein (Rehman2010Targeted). The first exon of TPRN is particularly significant, as it encodes a critical sequence for taperin function, with all mutations linked to human deafness found in this region (Liu2018GRXCR2).

## Function
The TPRN gene encodes the protein taperin, which plays a crucial role in the structural organization of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. Taperin is localized at the base of stereocilia, a region known as the taper, where it contributes to the stability and proper function of these sensory structures essential for hearing (Stelma2014Nonsyndromic; Rehman2010Targeted). Taperin is involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for maintaining the morphology of stereocilia. This modulation is crucial for the structural integrity of hair cells, as taperin interacts with other proteins such as GRXCR2, Fam65b, PTPRQ, CLIC5, radixin, and MYO6, which are also linked to deafness (Salles2013CLIC5; Liu2018GRXCR2).

In healthy cells, taperin's proper localization is essential for maintaining the structure and function of stereocilia. Mislocalization of taperin can lead to stereocilia elongation and hearing loss, highlighting its role in regulating actin dynamics at the pointed end of hair cells (Liu2018GRXCR2). Taperin's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton and its localization at the stereocilia base are critical for auditory function, and disruptions in these processes can result in hearing impairments (Pacentine2020Stereocilia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPRN gene, which encodes the protein taperin, are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically linked to the DFNB79 locus on chromosome 9q34.3. This condition is characterized by prelingual, bilateral, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss without other clinical findings or vestibular dysfunction (Rehman2010Targeted). The TPRN gene mutations lead to a disruption in the normal auditory function due to their impact on the structure and function of taperin in the inner ear, particularly affecting the hair cell stereocilia in the organ of Corti (Rehman2010Targeted).

Research has identified several pathogenic mutations in the TPRN gene, including homozygous truncating mutations in affected individuals from consanguineous families in Pakistan, Morocco, and the Netherlands (Duman2012Autosomal). A specific mutation, c.1056G>A, introduces a premature stop codon, potentially resulting in a truncated protein or nonsense-mediated RNA decay, which has been observed in several DFNB79-linked pedigrees (Rehman2010Targeted). These genetic alterations underscore the critical role of TPRN in maintaining normal hearing function and highlight its significance in genetic studies of hearing loss.

## Interactions
The TPRN gene encodes the protein taperin, which is involved in the structural integrity and function of hair cell stereocilia in the inner ear. Taperin is a component of a multiprotein complex that includes radixin (RDX), myosin VI (MYO6), and chloride intracellular channel 5 (CLIC5). This complex is crucial for stabilizing membrane-cytoskeletal linkages at the base of stereocilia, which are essential for hearing and balance (Salles2013CLIC5).

Taperin interacts with CLIC5, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that these proteins are part of a complex that connects the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton (Salles2013CLIC5). The interaction between taperin and CLIC5 is crucial for the proper localization of proteins at the base of stereocilia, and deficiencies in these proteins can lead to structural defects such as fusion and elongation of stereocilia, which are linked to hearing impairments (Salles2013CLIC5).

Additionally, taperin has been implicated in genetic studies of nonsyndromic deafness, specifically DFNB79, where mutations in the TPRN gene result in auditory dysfunction (Rehman2010Targeted). These interactions highlight the importance of taperin in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of hair cell stereocilia.
