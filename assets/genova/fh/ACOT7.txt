# ACOT7

## Overview
ACOT7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, which is a type II acyl-CoA thioesterase involved in lipid metabolism. The enzyme is characterized by its tandem hotdog domains, forming a hexameric structure that is essential for its function in hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA. This activity is crucial for regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, impacting energy production and lipid signaling (Forwood2007Structural; Ellis2013Acyl). ACOT7 is predominantly expressed in the brain and macrophages, where it plays significant roles in fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal health (Forwood2007Structural; Swarbrick2020Structure). The enzyme's involvement in the PKCζ-p53-p21 signaling pathway also links it to cell cycle regulation and cancer progression (Jung2017AcylCoA). Given its diverse roles, ACOT7 is a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and neurological disorders.

## Structure
The ACOT7 protein, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, is characterized by its tandem hotdog domains, which are essential for its enzymatic activity. The protein is a type II acyl-CoA thioesterase, featuring a double hotdog fold structure. Each domain consists of an alpha-helix wrapped by a beta-sheet, forming a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounding an α-helix, with an additional C-terminal α-helix (Forwood2007Structural). The N- and C-domains of ACOT7 are structurally similar, with a root mean square deviation of 1.28 Å for 124 Cα atoms in the monomer (Forwood2007Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, ACOT7 forms a hexameric assembly in solution, described as a 'trimer of double hotdog dimers' (Swarbrick2020Structure). This hexameric arrangement is consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography results (Forwood2007Structural). The protein's structure includes two non-identical putative active sites, with one site responsible for catalysis, involving residues Asn-24 and Asp-213 (Swarbrick2020Structure). ACOT7 is highly expressed in the brain and macrophages, where it plays a role in fatty acid metabolism and inflammation (Forwood2007Structural; Swarbrick2020Structure).

## Function
The ACOT7 gene encodes acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, an enzyme that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism by hydrolyzing acyl-CoA thioesters into free fatty acids and CoA. This activity is crucial for regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoA and free fatty acids, impacting energy production and lipid signaling (Forwood2007Structural; Ellis2013Acyl). ACOT7 is primarily active in the cytosol and mitochondria, where it influences processes such as fatty acid oxidation and cellular energy homeostasis (Hunt2007Alternative).

In healthy human cells, ACOT7 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, where it regulates neuronal fatty acid metabolism. It is responsible for the majority of long-chain thioesterase activity in the brain, maintaining fatty acid homeostasis and preventing neurotoxicity (Ellis2013Acyl). ACOT7 also plays a role in inflammation by regulating the production of arachidonic acid, a precursor for pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. This regulation affects the synthesis of prostaglandins, linking ACOT7 to inflammatory processes (Kirkby2010Functional; Forwood2007Structural).

Additionally, ACOT7 is involved in cell cycle progression through the PKCζ-p53-p21 signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Jung2017AcylCoA). Its activity is modulated by cellular energy status, highlighting its role in maintaining lipid metabolism balance in neurons (Kirkby2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ACOT7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In cancer, ACOT7 is associated with cell cycle regulation and tumor progression. Its depletion in breast and lung carcinoma cells leads to cell cycle arrest through the activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a target for enhancing tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Jung2017AcylCoA). High expression levels of ACOT7 are linked to poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis and ferroptosis (Zhang2019Expression).

In neurological contexts, ACOT7 plays a protective role against neurotoxicity. Loss of ACOT7 in mice leads to increased seizure susceptibility and metabolic dysfunction, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal lipid homeostasis and preventing toxic lipid overload (Bowman2019Loss). These findings suggest that ACOT7 is crucial for both cancer progression and neurological health, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in these conditions.

## Interactions
ACOT7, also known as acyl-CoA thioesterase 7, is involved in lipid metabolism and has been studied for its structural and functional interactions. The enzyme is composed of tandem hotdog domains, which are necessary for its enzymatic activity. These domains form a trimer of hotdog fold dimers, with only one of the two potential active sites in the dimer being functional. The catalytic residues involved in its activity are Asn-24 and Asp-213 (Forwood2007Structural).

The structural analysis of ACOT7 revealed that its N-domain forms a dimer with a double-hotdog structure, which associates into a hexamer in solution. This hexameric arrangement is similar to other bacterial thioesterases. The N-domain binds CoA molecules through specific interactions involving residues such as Ser-90, His-92, Tyr-152, Lys-156, and Arg-159. The C-domain, although structurally similar, forms a dimer in solution and does not bind CoA in the crystal structure. The functional activity of ACOT7 requires both thioesterase domains to associate cooperatively (Forwood2007Structural).

ACOT7's role in inflammation has been noted, with its upregulation in activated macrophages and its ability to cleave arachidonoyl-CoA, a precursor for proinflammatory eicosanoids. Overexpression of ACOT7 in macrophages has been shown to suppress prostaglandin production, suggesting its involvement in arachidonate metabolism (Forwood2007Structural).
