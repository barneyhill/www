# LRCH4

## Overview
LRCH4, or leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing 4, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in immune response and cytoskeletal regulation. The LRCH4 protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is involved in regulatory functions rather than actin binding (Rivière2020Structure). Additionally, the protein contains a transmembrane domain, suggesting its role in sensing external stimuli (Rivière2020Structure). Expressed predominantly in the spleen and thymus, LRCH4 is associated with the plasma membrane and plays a critical role in leukocyte biology, particularly in the capture and transport of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to lipid rafts, facilitating immune signaling (Rivière2020Structure; Yin2020Structural). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as Coro1A and HLA-A, underscore its involvement in complex protein networks that modulate immune functions and cytoskeletal dynamics (Singh2022Identification; Rivière2020Structure).

## Structure
The LRCH4 protein is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a calponin homology (CH) domain. The LRR domain typically consists of nine repeats, forming a horseshoe-shaped, superhelical structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Rivière2020Structure). The CH domain, specifically a type 3 CH domain, is located at the C-terminus and is involved in regulatory functions rather than actin binding (Rivière2020Structure). 

LRCH4 also contains a transmembrane domain, suggesting a role in sensing external stimuli (Rivière2020Structure). The protein is expressed in the spleen and thymus and is associated with the plasma membrane (Yin2020Structural). The CH3 domain in LRCH4 does not interact with the FERM domain of ERM proteins in Drosophila S2 cells, indicating a unique functional role (Yin2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested to regulate LRCH4, particularly during cell cycle phases (Rivière2020Structure). The protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could influence its function and interactions (Rivière2020Structure).

## Function
LRCH4, or leucine-rich repeats and calponin homology domain containing 4, is a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and immune responses. The protein contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is associated with actin binding (Rivière2020Structure). LRCH4 plays a critical role in leukocyte biology, where it is involved in the capture and transport of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to lipid rafts, facilitating its binding to TLR4 clusters. This process is essential for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in response to LPS stimulation (Rivière2020Structure).

LRCH4 also interacts with Coro1A, an actin-binding protein, linking β2 integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for neutrophil adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis (Rivière2020Structure). The protein is suggested to act as a signaling or scaffold protein, potentially regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics through an LRCH-DOCK axis, although its precise functions in various cell types and conditions remain under investigation (Rivière2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
LRCH4 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer, LRCH4 expression increases with cancer progression, suggesting a role in tumor development (Rivière2020Structure). In acute myeloid leukemia, higher LRCH4 expression is associated with decreased mortality, indicating a potential protective effect (Rivière2020Structure). In Alzheimer's disease, LRCH4 is significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of patients, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathology (Wang2020Identification).

LRCH4 is also involved in immune responses. It acts as a Toll-like receptor accessory protein, influencing TNFα secretion and the innate immune response. Its expression is upregulated in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated dendritic cells, highlighting its role in inflammation (Yin2020Structural). LRCH4 interacts with HLA-A, a major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, which may influence immune regulation (Singh2022Identification).

In the context of inflammatory conditions, LRCH4 expression is regulated, and its mRNA levels are downregulated in human platelets exposed to E. coli and macrophages stimulated with LPS, indicating its role in host defense mechanisms (Rivière2020Structure). These findings suggest that LRCH4 is a critical effector in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
LRCH4 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune responses and cytoskeletal regulation. It interacts with Coro1A, an actin-binding protein that links β2 integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for neutrophil adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis (Rivière2020Structure). LRCH4 also plays a role in the immune response by facilitating the capture and transport of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to lipid rafts, where it binds to TLR4 clusters, influencing TLR signaling (Rivière2020Structure).

In addition, LRCH4 has been identified as a binding partner of MDN1, interacting with its AAA domains, dynein-like linker domain, and probable MIDAS domain. This interaction is specific to the HLA-A molecule, as no similar interactions were observed with HLA-B or HLA-C (Singh2022Identification). The interaction between HLA-A and the disordered N-terminal tail of LRCH4 suggests a role in regulating TLR4 activation and cytokine induction, contributing to innate immune responses (Singh2022Identification). These interactions highlight LRCH4's involvement in complex protein networks that modulate immune functions and cytoskeletal dynamics.
