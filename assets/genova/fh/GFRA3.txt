# GFRA3

## Overview
GFRA3, or GDNF family receptor alpha 3, is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor protein involved in the signaling pathways of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands. The protein, GDNF family receptor alpha 3, primarily interacts with the neurotrophic growth factor artemin and forms a complex with the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, playing a crucial role in neuronal survival, differentiation, and axonal growth (Jing1997GFRα2; Yang2006Distribution). GFRA3 is expressed in various human tissues, including the nervous system and epithelial cells of the digestive and reproductive systems, indicating its potential involvement in diverse physiological processes (Yang2006Distribution). While its expression pattern suggests a role in pancreatic islet and nervous system development, functional studies have not identified a specific role, possibly due to redundancies with other GDNF family ligands and receptors (Nivlet2015Expression). Additionally, GFRA3 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast and gastric cancers, where its expression and methylation status may influence tumor growth and serve as a prognostic marker (Eftang2016GFRA3; Ito2017Identification).

## Structure


## Function
GFRA3 (GDNF family receptor alpha 3) is a receptor involved in the signaling pathways of the GDNF family ligands, primarily functioning in the nervous system. It forms a complex with the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, which is crucial for initiating downstream signaling cascades that promote neuronal survival, differentiation, and axonal growth (Jing1997GFRα2). In humans, GFRA3 is expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the digestive and reproductive systems, suggesting a potential role in mediating physiological effects in these tissues (Yang2006Distribution).

In the pancreas, GFRA3 is expressed in embryonic α and β-cells and adult α-cells, as well as in parasympathetic and sympathetic intra-islet neurons and glial cells. Despite its expression, studies indicate that GFRA3 is not essential for islet formation, innervation, or function, as GFRA3-deficient mice show normal islet organization and glucose homeostasis (Nivlet2015Expression). The receptor's expression pattern suggests a potential role in pancreatic islet and nervous system development, although functional studies have not revealed a specific role, indicating possible redundancies with other GDNF family ligands and receptors (Nivlet2015Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The GFRA3 gene, encoding the GDNF family receptor alpha 3, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In gastric cancer, hypermethylation of the GFRA3 promoter is associated with poor postoperative survival. This epigenetic change correlates with several clinicopathological factors, including gastric atrophy and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that GFRA3 promoter hypermethylation may serve as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer (Eftang2016GFRA3). The study by Eftang et al. highlights that GFRA3 promoter hypermethylation is a significant predictor of survival, independent of other factors such as age and tumor size (Eftang2016GFRA3).

In contrast, investigations into the role of GFRA3 in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) have not identified traditional germline mutations in this gene as significant contributors to the condition. The study by Borrego et al. found no association between sequence variants in GFRA3 and HSCR, suggesting that GFRA3 does not play a major role in the genetic susceptibility to this disease (Borrego2003Investigation). These findings indicate that while GFRA3 is not a major factor in HSCR, its altered methylation status is clinically significant in the context of gastric cancer.

## Interactions
GFRA3 (GDNF family receptor alpha 3) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor that primarily interacts with the neurotrophic growth factor artemin. This interaction facilitates the formation of a complex with the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, which is crucial for signal transduction involved in neuronal survival and development (Nivlet2015Expression; Yang2006Distribution). The artemin-GFRA3-RET complex mediates downstream signaling pathways, including the ERK/MAPK pathway, which is important for cell survival and development (Li2009Autocrine).

In the context of cancer, GFRA3 is identified as a direct target of the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-34a. miR-34a binds to the coding region of GFRA3 mRNA, leading to its downregulation. This interaction is significant in breast cancer, where miR-34a overexpression reduces GFRA3 levels, thereby inhibiting tumor growth (Ito2017Identification). The regulation of GFRA3 by miR-34a highlights a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated gene regulation, as miRNAs typically target the 3′ UTR of mRNAs (Ito2017Identification).
