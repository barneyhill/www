# DRD1

## Overview
The DRD1 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D1, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is integral to the modulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including motor control, cognition, and reward pathways. The dopamine receptor D1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha helices, a structural feature typical of GPCRs, which facilitate its interaction with ligands and G proteins (Zhuang2021Mechanism; Teng2022Structural). The receptor's activation leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which are crucial for its signaling functions (MISSALE1998Dopamine). Beyond the central nervous system, DRD1 is also involved in peripheral functions, such as regulating renal sodium transport and vascular tone (MISSALE1998Dopamine). The receptor's structure and function have been extensively studied, providing insights into its role in health and disease, and offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention (Xiao2021Ligand; Zhuang2021Structural).

## Structure
The DRD1 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in neurotransmission. The primary structure of the D1 receptor consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor protein. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane alpha helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, which span the cell membrane and create a ligand-binding pocket on the extracellular side (Zhuang2021Mechanism; Teng2022Structural).

The tertiary structure of the D1 receptor involves the arrangement of these helices within the cell membrane, forming a specific conformation that allows for ligand binding and G protein interaction. The orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) for dopamine is composed of residues from transmembrane helices TM3, TM5, TM6, and TM7, and is capped by extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Zhuang2021Mechanism). Key interactions within this pocket include ionic contacts and hydrogen bonds that stabilize dopamine binding (Zhuang2021Mechanism).

The D1 receptor does not typically form quaternary structures, as it functions primarily as a monomer. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, influencing receptor function and localization (Zhuang2021Mechanism). The receptor's structure is further stabilized by interactions with cholesterol, which are found surrounding the extracellular half of the transmembrane domains (Xu2023Structural).

## Function
The DRD1 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. In the CNS, DRD1 is involved in regulating reward, motor activity, and cognition by activating Gs/Golf proteins, which stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) production (Xiao2021Ligand; MISSALE1998Dopamine). This receptor is highly expressed in brain regions such as the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle, where it modulates neurotransmission and influences psychomotor stimulation (MISSALE1998Dopamine).

DRD1 also plays a crucial role in peripheral tissues, particularly in the kidney, where it regulates sodium homeostasis and contributes to renal vasodilation, diuresis, and natriuresis. This is achieved through the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, which affects sodium transport in the proximal tubule (MISSALE1998Dopamine). The receptor's activation leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels, which are essential for its physiological functions (MISSALE1998Dopamine). The structural insights into DRD1 reveal its interactions with various ligands, providing a basis for developing selective agonists for therapeutic purposes (Xiao2021Ligand; Zhuang2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DRD1 gene, which encodes the dopamine receptor D1, have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. A notable mutation, NM_000794.4:c.110C>A, p.T37K, has been associated with infantile parkinsonism-dystonia. This variant results in a loss of receptor function, as evidenced by reduced cyclic AMP production and impaired ligand binding, contributing to symptoms such as developmental delay and severe dystonia (Reid2023LossofFunction). The study highlights the role of DRD1 in motor control and its potential involvement in dopamine deficiency-related conditions (Reid2023LossofFunction).

In the context of cancer, DRD1 expression is significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to normal tissues. Low DRD1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, affecting progression-free survival and overall survival rates. This suggests that DRD1 could serve as a biomarker for HCC and potentially other cancers (Wang2021Dopamine).

Additionally, rare missense variants in DRD1 have been linked to dystonia, particularly tardive-like dystonia. These variants are more prevalent in dystonia patients compared to controls, indicating a potential genetic risk factor for the condition (Groen2014DRD1).

## Interactions
The dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) is involved in several key interactions with proteins, particularly in the context of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. DRD1 primarily interacts with the Gs protein, which is crucial for its role in activating adenylyl cyclase and increasing cAMP levels. The interaction between DRD1 and Gs involves the insertion of the C-terminal α5 helix of Gαs into the transmembrane bundle of DRD1, as well as multiple contacts between the intracellular loop 1 (ICL1) of the receptor and the Gβ subunit (Xiao2021Ligand). Specific residues in DRD1, such as F129 in ICL2, form a hydrophobic pocket with Gs, contributing to the selectivity of G protein coupling (Xiao2021Ligand).

DRD1 also interacts with positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) like LY3154207, which bind near the intracellular loop 2 (IL2) and affect the receptor's conformation and interactions with G proteins. This binding enhances interactions between IL2 of DRD1 and the αN region of Gαs, suggesting an allosteric pathway that influences receptor activation and G protein coupling (Goldberg2023The). These interactions are critical for understanding the receptor's signaling mechanisms and potential therapeutic targeting.
