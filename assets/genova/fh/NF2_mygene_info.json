proteins in the cell membrane. The encoded protein is involved in regulation of contact-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and functions in cell-cell adhesion and transmembrane signaling. The encoded protein has been shown to interact with cell-surface proteins, proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, and proteins involved in regulating ion transport. Disruption of this protein's function has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with neurofibromatosis type II which is characterized by nervous system and skin tumors and ocular abnormalities.
