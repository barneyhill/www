# VPS4A

## Overview
VPS4A is a gene that encodes the vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog A, a member of the AAA ATPase family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular membrane dynamics. The VPS4A protein is integral to the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway, where it facilitates the disassembly and recycling of the ESCRT-III complex, crucial for endosomal sorting and exosome secretion. This ATPase is characterized by its ability to transition between monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric states, driven by its nucleotide-binding status, and is activated through interactions with ESCRT-III proteins. VPS4A's function is essential for various cellular processes, including cytokinesis and membrane trafficking, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the VPS4A gene have been associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and syndromic congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Seu2020VPS4A; Rodger2020De).

## Structure
The VPS4A protein is a member of the AAA ATPase family, playing a crucial role in membrane deformation processes. Its primary structure is encoded by the VPS4A gene, and the protein includes several key domains. The N-terminal MIT (Microtubule Interacting and Trafficking) domain is essential for substrate docking, specifically interacting with ESCRT-III proteins through MIT Interacting Motifs (MIM1 and MIM2) (Hill2012Structure; Scott2005Structure). The MIT domain forms an antiparallel three-helix bundle, with helices 1 and 3 parallel and helix 2 antiparallel, facilitating unique binding interactions (Scott2005Structure).

The ATPase cassette of VPS4A consists of large and small AAA ATPase domains, a β domain, and a C-terminal helix. The large domain features a beta sheet flanked by alpha helices, while the small domain contains an antiparallel four-helix bundle. ATP binds at the interface between these domains, and mutations in key residues can impair ATP binding and hydrolysis (Hill2012Structure). The β domain, unique to eukaryotic Vps4 proteins, interacts with the Vps4 activator LIP5/Vta1 (Hill2012Structure).

VPS4A functions as a hexameric assembly, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to translocate and unfold ESCRT-III protein substrates through its central pore (Han2019Structure). The protein's quaternary structure is dynamic, transitioning between monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric states depending on its nucleotide-binding state (Hill2012Structure).

## Function
The VPS4A gene encodes a protein that functions as an ATPase, playing a crucial role in the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway. This protein is essential for the disassembly and recycling of the ESCRT-III complex, a critical step in the endosomal sorting pathway, which is vital for proper protein and lipid trafficking within the cell, as well as for exosome secretion (Seu2020VPS4A). VPS4A is involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, where it is recruited to sites of membrane remodeling and vesicle formation, and is concentrated at spindle poles during metaphase and at the midbody during the abscission stage of cytokinesis (Seu2020VPS4A).

VPS4A's ATPase activity is facilitated by specific structural features, such as arginine fingers that interact with ATP to promote hydrolysis, which is necessary for the release of the ESCRT-III protein lattice from membranes, allowing for multiple rounds of protein sorting and vesicle formation (Scott2005Structure). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and endosomes, contributing to cellular homeostasis and membrane trafficking (Scheuring2001Mammalian). In healthy human cells, VPS4A's role in maintaining normal endosomal sorting and exosome secretion is critical for cellular function and organismal development (Seu2020VPS4A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS4A gene are linked to a multisystem disorder characterized by severe neurodevelopmental delay, structural brain abnormalities, cataracts, growth impairment, and anemia. These mutations primarily affect the ATPase domain of VPS4A, leading to disruptions in cellular processes such as centrosome number regulation, primary cilium morphology, nuclear membrane morphology, chromosome segregation, mitotic spindle formation, and cell cycle progression (Rodger2020De).

Specific mutations, such as p.Arg284Trp and p.Arg284Gly, have been identified as hotspots and are associated with severe phenotypic manifestations, including microcephaly, profound neonatal hypotonia, and global developmental delay (Rodger2020De). These mutations result in dominant-negative effects on endosomal morphology, causing vacuolar endosomal structures and enlarged endosomal compartments (Rodger2020De).

VPS4A mutations are also linked to syndromic congenital dyserythropoietic anemia due to defects in cytokinesis and trafficking. This condition is characterized by transfusion-dependent anemia and other hematologic abnormalities, with mutations disrupting the function of the ESCRT-III complex (Seu2020VPS4A). The mutations lead to defective CD71 trafficking in erythroid cells and abnormal erythropoiesis, as evidenced by binucleated erythroblasts and erythroblasts with cytoplasmic bridges (Seu2020VPS4A).

## Interactions
VPS4A is a human AAA ATPase that interacts with several proteins, primarily within the ESCRT-III complex, to facilitate membrane remodeling processes. VPS4A is activated by ESCRT-III proteins, which include CHMP2A, CHMP1B, and CHMP3, through interactions involving MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs) and adjacent sequences. These interactions are crucial for relieving VPS4A's autoinhibition and enhancing its ATPase activity (Merrill2010Activation).

The activation of VPS4A involves acidic residues, such as those found in poly-L-glutamic acid, which significantly increase its ATPase activity. This suggests that acidic sequences in ESCRT-III proteins play a role in VPS4A activation (Merrill2010Activation). The interaction between the MIT domain of VPS4A and the MIM motifs of ESCRT-III proteins is essential for VPS4A to associate with and act upon additional sequences in the C-terminal halves of these proteins, driving the disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex (Merrill2010Activation).

VPS4A also forms transient oligomers, likely hexameric rings, which are necessary for its function. These oligomers are assembled upon interaction with ESCRT-III proteins, facilitating the disassembly and recycling of ESCRT-III subunits (Merrill2010Activation).
