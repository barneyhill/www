# CLEC2B

## Overview
CLEC2B is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 2 member B, which is a transmembrane receptor involved in immune system processes. The protein is primarily expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells, where it plays a critical role in cell signaling and recognition. As part of the NKR-P1:CLR recognition system, CLEC2B is essential for distinguishing between healthy and pathological cells, thereby modulating immune responses, particularly in pathogen recognition and inflammatory contexts (Kirkham2014Complexity). The expression of CLEC2B can be influenced by cellular stress, infection, or transformation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker in various diseases (Niu2023Discovery).

## Function
CLEC2B, also known as AICL, is a member of the C-type lectin domain family and plays a role in immune cell interactions. It is expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells and other immune cells, where it participates in cell signaling and recognition processes. CLEC2B is involved in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses (Kirkham2014Complexity). 

The gene is part of a complex system of receptor-ligand interactions, known as the NKR-P1:CLR (KLRB1:CLEC2) recognition system, which is crucial for distinguishing between healthy and pathological cells. This system contributes to the immune response by shifting the balance from NK cell tolerance to activation (Kirkham2014Complexity). Although specific details about the function of CLEC2B in healthy cells are not extensively documented, it is known to be induced upon activation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting a role in immune cell activation and signaling (Kirkham2014Complexity). 

CLEC2B's expression can be modulated during cellular stress, infection, or transformation, indicating its involvement in adaptive immune responses and its potential as a biomarker in certain diseases (Niu2023Discovery).
