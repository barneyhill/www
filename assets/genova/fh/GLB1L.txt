# GLB1L

## Overview
The GLB1L gene encodes the galactosidase beta 1-like protein, which is involved in various biological processes, including immune response modulation and regulatory networks. Although the precise biochemical functions of the GLB1L protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in sperm capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis, as well as in the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and ischemic stroke. The protein is part of a competing endogenous RNA network, suggesting a role in gene regulation rather than direct enzymatic activity (Swegen2018The; Zhao2021Exploration; Duan2020Identification). Despite its potential clinical significance, detailed studies on the physical interactions and broader functional roles of GLB1L are still needed (Söderholm2016Exome; Granzow2015Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The GLB1L gene has been implicated in the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Studies have shown that the expression level of GLB1L is positively correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, immature dendritic cells, MDSCs, activated B cells, natural killer cells, and central memory CD4+ T cells. This suggests that GLB1L may influence NPC prognosis by modulating the immune response, potentially serving as a prognostic biomarker. Increased GLB1L expression is associated with higher immune cell infiltration, which can stratify NPC patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, aiding in personalized treatment strategies (Zhao2021Exploration).

In the context of ischemic stroke (IS), a missense variant in the GLB1L gene was identified with a minor allele frequency of 0.0029 and a P-value of 4.30 x 10^-5, indicating a potential association with IS, although it did not reach the threshold for significance (Söderholm2016Exome). However, the clinical significance of GLB1L in other diseases or conditions remains less clear, as no human phenotype has been described for GLB1L in certain studies (Granzow2015Loss).

## Interactions
The GLB1L protein has been identified in various studies as participating in interactions with other proteins. In the context of sperm capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis, GLB1L was found to be the most abundant protein in a coprecipitation lysate involving the serine protease testisin. However, it does not share interaction pathways with other proteins identified in the study, such as members of the heat-shock protein family and zonadhesin, which are involved in spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding (Swegen2018The).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, GLB1L expression is positively correlated with various tumor-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response. However, specific physical interactions of the GLB1L protein with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed (Zhao2021Exploration).

In the study of keloid pathogenesis, GLB1L was part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, specifically the EGFR/miR-370-3p/lnc-GLB1L-1 axis, indicating its potential involvement in regulatory networks rather than direct physical interactions (Duan2020Identification). Despite these findings, detailed physical interactions of GLB1L with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored.
