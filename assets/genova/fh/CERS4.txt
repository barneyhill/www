# CERS4

## Overview
CERS4, or ceramide synthase 4, is a gene that encodes the enzyme ceramide synthase 4, which is integral to the biosynthesis of ceramides. Ceramides are a class of lipid molecules that play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and modulating cell signaling pathways. The CERS4 gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the skin, heart, liver, and leukocytes, highlighting its importance in diverse physiological processes (Stiban2010Ceramide). The ceramide synthase 4 enzyme is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the synthesis of ceramides by utilizing specific fatty acyl CoAs, such as C18 and C20 (Stiban2010Ceramide). This enzyme is categorized as a synthase due to its role in catalyzing the formation of ceramides, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and signaling. The functional significance of CERS4 extends to its involvement in skin barrier integrity and hair maintenance, as well as its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Kihara2016Synthesis; Abbott2013Altered).

## Function
CERS4, also known as ceramide synthase 4, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ceramides, which are essential lipid molecules involved in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and regulating cell signaling pathways. CERS4 specifically utilizes C18 and C20 fatty acyl CoAs for ceramide synthesis and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, with some evidence suggesting its presence in mitochondria or mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (Stiban2010Ceramide).

In healthy human cells, CERS4 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest levels found in the skin, leukocytes, heart, and liver (Stiban2010Ceramide). Its activity is particularly significant in the skin, where it contributes to the production of ceramides that are vital for the structural integrity and function of the skin barrier (Kihara2016Synthesis). The enzyme's role in producing specific ceramides is essential for maintaining normal hair and skin function, as evidenced by studies in mouse models where Cers4 knockout leads to hair loss due to reduced ceramide levels (Kihara2016Synthesis).

CERS4's involvement in cellular signaling and maintaining cell membrane integrity highlights its importance in cell physiology and organismal health (Stiban2010Ceramide).

## Clinical Significance
CERS4 (ceramide synthase 4) has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In colorectal cancer (CRC), downregulation of CERS4 is associated with KRAS mutations, which may contribute to increased venous invasion and tumor progression. This downregulation is potentially linked to the Wnt and NF-kB pathways, which are known to influence CERS4 expression (Hayama2023Ceramide). In contrast, CERS4 expression is upregulated in liver cancer, where it plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and tumor growth. Silencing CERS4 in liver cancer cells leads to reduced proliferation and tumor size, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2017Ceramide).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased CERS4 expression is associated with better overall survival, indicating its potential prognostic value (Qian2020Ceramide). Altered expression of CERS4 has also been observed in Parkinson's disease, where changes in ceramide acyl chain length are noted in the anterior cingulate cortex, although the specific role of CERS4 in this context remains unclear (Abbott2013Altered). In Alzheimer's disease, CERS4 is upregulated in response to amyloid β precursor protein mutations, contributing to neurodegenerative processes (Jęśko2020Fingolimod).

## Interactions
Ceramide synthase 4 (CERS4) is involved in the synthesis of ceramides and participates in various protein interactions that regulate its activity. CERS4 has been postulated to form a stoichiometric complex with the pro-apoptotic protein Bak, along with other ceramide synthase isoforms such as CerS5 and CerS6. This suggests a potential physical interaction between CERS4 and Bak, which may influence ceramide synthesis and apoptosis pathways (Park2014Ceramide).

CERS4 is also known to form hetero-complexes and dimers with other ceramide synthase isoforms, which can modulate its enzymatic activity. However, specific details about these interactions involving CERS4 are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Park2014Ceramide).

While the role of CERS4 in drug sensitivity and cancer therapy has been explored, there is limited data on its involvement in chemotherapy resistance. Overexpression of CERS4 in cancer cells has shown anti-proliferative effects, but specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not well-documented (Brachtendorf2019Ceramide). Overall, the interactions of CERS4 with other proteins are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and apoptosis, although further research is needed to fully elucidate these interactions.
