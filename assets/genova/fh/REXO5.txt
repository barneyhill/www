# REXO5

## Overview
REXO5 is a gene that encodes the protein RNA exonuclease 5, a nuclear 3′-5′ RNA exonuclease involved in maintaining genomic integrity. The protein, also known as NEF-sp, is a member of the DEDD family of nucleases and is characterized by its role in regulating R-loop levels, which are critical for preventing genomic instability. REXO5's exonuclease activity is essential for degrading single-stranded RNA within RNA/DNA hybrids and R-loop structures, thereby mitigating replication stress and maintaining genomic stability. The protein is recruited to DNA damage sites through its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, highlighting its involvement in DNA damage response pathways. REXO5's function is particularly significant during the S-phase of the cell cycle, where it helps resolve transcription-replication conflicts. The gene has clinical significance in various myeloid malignancies, such as chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, and is also considered a prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Huang2023Advances; Lee2024REXO5).

## Structure
The REXO5 protein, also known as NEF-sp, is a testis-specific nuclear 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease composed of 774 amino acids. It features an amino-terminal nuclease domain followed by two carboxy-terminal tandem RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) (Silva2017Characterization). REXO5 is a member of the DEDD family of nucleases, characterized by four invariant acidic residues (D-E-D-D) distributed in three sequence motifs, with a histidine in motif III classifying it into the DEDDh subfamily (Silva2017Characterization). The protein's structure includes an exonuclease domain (ExoIII) and RNA recognition motifs, which are crucial for its function in RNA processing and DNA damage response (Lee2024REXO5).

The REXO5 protein is involved in maintaining genomic integrity by regulating R-loop levels through its exonuclease activity, which degrades single-stranded RNA within RNA/DNA hybrids and R-loop structures (Lee2024REXO5). The protein's nuclear localization is facilitated by an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal, and its activity is dependent on divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ (Silva2017Characterization). The RRM domains are essential for REXO5's localization to DNA damage sites and its role in genomic integrity (Lee2024REXO5).

## Function
REXO5, also known as RNA exonuclease 5, is a nuclear 3′-5′ RNA exonuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity by regulating R-loop levels in healthy human cells. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that can cause genomic instability if not properly managed. REXO5 controls R-loop levels through its exonuclease activity, which is essential for resolving these structures and preventing replication stress (Lee2024REXO5). The protein is recruited to DNA damage sites via its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, where it accumulates at R-loop loci and DNA damage sites, facilitating both the formation and resolution of R-loops (Lee2024REXO5).

REXO5's activity is crucial during the S-phase of the cell cycle, where its depletion leads to replication stress, slowing down replication forks due to transcription-replication conflicts, and triggering the ATR-dependent DNA damage response (Lee2024REXO5). The protein's exonuclease activity is necessary for degrading RNA within R-loop structures, thereby mitigating genome instability and maintaining genomic stability in healthy cells (Lee2024REXO5). This function is vital for normal cell function and preventing DNA damage, highlighting REXO5's role in the DNA damage response pathways (Lee2024REXO5).

## Clinical Significance
The REXO5 gene has been implicated in various myeloid malignancies, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In CML, REXO5 is highly expressed during the blast phase, suggesting its role in disease progression by inducing DNA damage through R-loop accumulation (Lee2024REXO5). The absence of REXO5 expression in normal cells, contrasted with its strong expression in CML, highlights its potential as a biomarker for early detection and progression of myeloid leukemia (Lee2024REXO5).

REXO5's exonuclease activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by regulating R-loop levels. Its depletion leads to increased R-loop accumulation, replication fork stalling, and global DNA damage, which are common features in myeloid malignancies (Lee2024REXO5). This mechanism is similar to those observed in other myeloid disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes, where mutations in RNA processing genes contribute to disease progression (Lee2024REXO5).

In addition to its role in leukemia, REXO5 has been identified as a prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it is part of a model used to identify high-risk patients (Huang2023Advances). These findings suggest that REXO5 could be a potential therapeutic target in cancers characterized by dysregulated DNA damage responses.

## Interactions
REXO5 is involved in maintaining genomic integrity through its interactions with R-loop structures and DNA damage sites. It is recruited to DNA damage sites via its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, which are crucial for its function. REXO5 physically accumulates at R-loop loci in cells, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays and immunoprecipitation studies. The recruitment of REXO5 to DNA damage sites is confirmed by its colocalization with γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in laser microirradiation assays (Lee2024REXO5).

REXO5's exonuclease activity is essential for degrading RNA within R-loop structures, preventing replication fork stalling and DNA damage. This activity is crucial for resolving R-loops and maintaining genomic stability (Lee2024REXO5). The study also suggests a potential interaction or compensatory mechanism between REXO5 and RNase H1, as overexpression of GFP-RNase H1 can restore cell growth in REXO5-depleted cells (Lee2024REXO5).

While specific protein interactions are not detailed, REXO5's role in DNA replication and repair processes implies interactions with components involved in these pathways (Lee2024REXO5).
