# LCE3A

## Overview
The LCE3A gene encodes the late cornified envelope 3A protein, which is a member of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family involved in skin barrier function and repair. This protein plays a critical role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective layer in the epidermis, and is primarily active in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the skin's outermost layer. LCE3A is particularly important in response to skin barrier disruptions, where it aids in repair and exhibits antimicrobial properties, contributing to the maintenance of skin integrity and protection against microbial invasion (de2012Expression; Bergboer2011Psoriasis; Chandra2021Functional). The gene's expression is regulated by proinflammatory cytokines and is influenced by genetic factors, making it a significant focus in the study of skin conditions such as psoriasis (Bergboer2011Psoriasis; Chandra2021Functional).

## Function
The LCE3A gene encodes a protein that is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which plays a crucial role in skin barrier function and repair. LCE3A is involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective layer in the epidermis that contributes to the structural integrity of the skin. This protein is active in keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, where it aids in skin cell differentiation and the maintenance of skin integrity (de2012Expression; Bergboer2011Psoriasis).

LCE3A expression is upregulated in response to skin barrier disruption, such as through tape stripping or injury, indicating its role in the skin's repair mechanisms (de2012Expression). The protein is suggested to function as a barrier repair protein, with its expression driven by proinflammatory cytokines, unlike other LCE proteins that have a constitutive role in normal skin barrier function (Bergboer2011Psoriasis). LCE3A also exhibits antimicrobial activity, which is beneficial in maintaining the epidermal barrier and protecting against microbial invasion (Chandra2021Functional). This antimicrobial function is particularly relevant in the context of skin conditions like psoriasis, where LCE3A expression is influenced by genetic and environmental factors (Chandra2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCE3A gene have been associated with psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. The PSORS4 locus, linked to psoriasis susceptibility, involves a deletion of the LCE3B and LCE3C genes, which are part of the same gene cluster as LCE3A. This deletion is found in a significant percentage of psoriasis patients and is thought to impair skin barrier function, potentially triggering an immune response that contributes to psoriasis symptoms (Hoss2013Control).

Research suggests that upregulation of LCE3A, along with other LCE3 genes, may compensate for the loss of LCE3B and LCE3C, aiding in skin repair and improving psoriasis treatment outcomes. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligands, such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and delphinidin, have been shown to upregulate LCE3A expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect in psoriasis by enhancing skin barrier restoration (Hoss2013Control).

Additionally, genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in the LCE3A gene that are associated with psoriasis vulgaris in certain populations, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in the disease's pathogenesis (Sun2018Association).

## Interactions
LCE3A interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in skin barrier function and psoriasis pathogenesis. The expression of LCE3A is influenced by the transcription factor STAT3, which binds preferentially to the wild-type allele of the SNP rs925976 located upstream of the LCE3A gene. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of LCE3A expression, particularly in the presence of the HLA-Cw6 allele, which enhances IL-6-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3, thereby promoting LCE3A activation (Chandra2021Functional).

LCE3A is also involved in the response to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6, which are known to induce its expression in psoriatic skin. This suggests that LCE3A may function as a barrier repair protein, with its expression driven by inflammation (Bergboer2011Psoriasis). Additionally, bioactive dietary ligands like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and curcumin can upregulate LCE3A expression through the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), indicating a potential interaction with VDR ligands in modulating skin repair processes (Karrys2018Bioactive). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving LCE3A in skin health and disease.
