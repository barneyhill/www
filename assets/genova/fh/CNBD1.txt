# CNBD1

## Overview
CNBD1, or cyclic nucleotide binding domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling and ion transport. The protein encoded by CNBD1 is characterized by its role in forming or regulating cation channel complexes, particularly through interactions with subunits of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA), such as CNGB1, CNGA1, CNGA3, and CNGA4. These interactions suggest that the CNBD1 protein may play a significant role in modulating ion transport across cellular membranes, thereby influencing various physiological processes (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:). Additionally, CNBD1 is implicated in the subcellular localization of EPAC2A, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways, by modulating its interactions with nuclear localization partners. This function highlights the importance of CNBD1 in cellular signaling and its potential impact on cellular function and communication (Parnell2015The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CNBD1 is involved in interactions that suggest its role in forming or regulating cation channel complexes. It is connected via co-functional edges to CNGB1, CNGA1, CNGA3, and CNGA4, which are subunits of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA). These interactions imply that CNBD1 may participate in cation channel activity, influencing ion transport across cellular membranes (Loers2022SUBATOMIC:).

In the context of cellular signaling, CNBD1 is implicated in the subcellular localization of EPAC2A, a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. CNBD1 may affect the interaction of EPAC2A with nuclear localization partners by causing steric interference, which blocks access to the nuclear pore localization signal (NPLS). This interference prevents interactions with proteins like RanBP2, which are involved in nuclear targeting. This role is specific to EPAC2A, as it is not observed in EPAC1 or the truncated form EPAC2B, which lacks CNBD1. This suggests that CNBD1 is crucial in determining the subcellular distribution of EPAC2A by modulating its interactions with other proteins (Parnell2015The).
