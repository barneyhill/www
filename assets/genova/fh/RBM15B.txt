# RBM15B

## Overview
RBM15B is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 15B, a member of the RNA-binding protein family characterized by its involvement in RNA processing and regulation. The protein is distinguished by its three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and a C-terminal SPOC domain, which facilitate RNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Zolotukhin2009Nuclear; Patil2016m6A). RBM15B plays a crucial role in the m6A methylation process, interacting with the WTAP-METTL3 complex to recruit it to specific RNA sites, such as the long non-coding RNA XIST, which is involved in X chromosome inactivation (Patil2016m6A). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications and the existence of multiple splice variant isoforms. RBM15B's interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids underscore its significance in mRNA export and post-transcriptional regulation, with implications in cancer biology, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and uveal melanoma (Wang2022N6Methyladenosine; Tan2022YY1Targeted).

## Structure
RBM15B is a protein characterized by its domain architecture, which includes three RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and a C-terminal SPOC domain. These domains are highly conserved and show significant sequence identity with its paralogue, RBM15 (Zolotukhin2009Nuclear; Patil2016m6A). The RRM domains are crucial for RNA binding, allowing RBM15B to interact with RNA sequences, particularly U-rich motifs, which are enriched at its binding sites (Patil2016m6A). The SPOC domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, which may facilitate the recruitment of other proteins or complexes to RNA substrates.

RBM15B is involved in the m6A methylation process, interacting with the WTAP-METTL3 complex, which is responsible for m6A methylation in mRNA. This interaction is mediated by WTAP, and RBM15B plays a role in recruiting the methylation complex to specific RNA sites, such as XIST, a long non-coding RNA involved in X chromosome inactivation (Patil2016m6A). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. RBM15B may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its structural and functional diversity.

## Clinical Significance
RBM15B has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM15B is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to the drug sorafenib, a common treatment for liver cancer. The transcription factor YY1 activates RBM15B, which stabilizes TRAM2 mRNA through an m6A-dependent mechanism, contributing to HCC progression. This suggests that RBM15B could be a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Tan2022YY1Targeted).

In uveal melanoma (UM), RBM15B acts as an independent prognostic biomarker. High expression levels are associated with improved overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval. RBM15B may inhibit tumor growth and progression through immune-related pathways, as its expression is negatively correlated with several immune checkpoints. This indicates a potential role in modulating immune responses in UM (Wang2022N6Methyladenosine).

RBM15B is also highly positively correlated with BAP1 expression in breast cancer and UM, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with RBM15B mutations are not detailed (Shahriyari2019BAP1).

## Interactions
RBM15B, also known as OTT3, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. It interacts with the nuclear export receptor NXF1, binding specifically to its NTF2-like domain, although this interaction is less efficient compared to its homolog RBM15 (Uranishi2009The). RBM15B also associates with the NXF1 cofactor Aly/REF, particularly the REF2-II variant, indicating a selective interaction that does not efficiently occur with REF1-II (Uranishi2009The).

RBM15B is part of the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC) and interacts with METTL3 and WTAP, recruiting them to specific RNA sites, which is crucial for m6A RNA methylation (Tan2022YY1Targeted). It binds to XIST RNA in an m6A-independent manner, with binding sites near m6A sites enriched with U-rich RNA consensus motifs (Patil2016m6A).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RBM15B promotes cell proliferation and drug resistance by stabilizing TRAM2 mRNA through m6A-dependent mechanisms, with TRAM2 identified as a downstream target (Tan2022YY1Targeted). These interactions highlight RBM15B's role in mRNA export and post-transcriptional regulation.
