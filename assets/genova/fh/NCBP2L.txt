# NCBP2L

## Overview
The NCBP2L gene encodes the nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2-like protein, which is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This protein is part of the cap-binding complex, which plays a crucial role in the maturation and stability of messenger RNA (mRNA) by binding to the 5' cap structure of nascent mRNA transcripts. The NCBP2L protein is categorized as a nuclear protein and is implicated in various cellular processes, including mRNA splicing, export, and degradation. Its function is essential for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation of NCBP2L has been associated with several pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
