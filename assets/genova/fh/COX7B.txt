# COX7B

## Overview
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7B (COX7B) is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as Complex IV, which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The COX7B protein is categorized as a structural subunit that plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the COX complex, contributing to the enzyme's proper function in cellular respiration and energy production (Čunátová2020Role; Fornuskova2010Novel). While COX7B is not directly involved in the catalytic activity of COX, it is essential for the structural integrity and regulation of the enzyme complex, influencing its activity and stability under various physiological conditions (Čunátová2020Role). Mutations and alterations in the expression of COX7B have been linked to mitochondrial diseases and cancer, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker in clinical settings (Tanaka2018Single‐cell; Kadenbach2015The).

## Function
COX7B encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), also known as Complex IV, which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a process that contributes to the formation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, a key energy-generating process in cells (Čunátová2020Role).

The COX7B subunit is involved in the late stages of COX assembly, contributing to the formation of the complete enzyme complex. It joins the assembling complex during or at the end of the formation of the assembly intermediate S3, indicating its role in the final steps of assembling the COX holoenzyme (Fornuskova2010Novel). Although COX7B is not essential for the catalytic function of COX, it may modulate COX activity and stability under different conditions, suggesting a regulatory role in the enzyme's function (Čunátová2020Role).

Mutations in COX7B have been associated with mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Kadenbach2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COX7B gene have been implicated in various cancer-related conditions. In the context of platinum-based chemotherapy, low levels of COX7B are associated with increased resistance to treatment in several solid tumors, including bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. This resistance is linked to poor patient prognosis and higher mortality rates (Tanaka2018Single‐cell). In bladder cancer, low COX7B expression correlates with poor response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for platinum resistance (Tanaka2018Single‐cell).

In breast cancer, COX7B acts as a metabolic sensor that influences brain-specific metastasis. High expression levels of COX7B enhance oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, promoting the migration of cancer cells towards astrocytes and facilitating brain metastasis. This expression pattern is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, lung cancer, and renal clear cell carcinoma (Blackman2022Mitochondrial).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), COX7B is upregulated, with novel gene variants identified in patients. These findings suggest a role for COX7B in the pathophysiology of CML, although its clinical significance requires further investigation (ElMasry2023Gene).

## Interactions
COX7B is a nuclear-encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX7B is involved in the assembly and stabilization of the COX complex. It is incorporated into the COX complex during the assembly process, specifically before the formation of the S3 intermediate, indicating its role in the early stages of COX assembly (Fornuskova2010Novel). 

Although specific physical interactions of COX7B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is known to be tightly associated with the catalytic core of COX, which consists of mitochondria-encoded subunits COX1, COX2, and COX3 (Čunátová2020Role). COX7B, along with other nuclear-encoded subunits, surrounds this core and is thought to modulate enzyme activity and stabilize respiratory supercomplexes (Čunátová2020Role). 

The presence of COX7B within the COX complex has been confirmed through high-resolution techniques such as SDS-PAGE and X-ray crystallography, which demonstrate its structural integration (Čunátová2020Role). Despite its integration, COX7B does not appear to play a disproportionate role in determining COX biosynthesis, as changes in its mRNA levels do not correlate with changes in COX activity (Duggan2011Coordination).
