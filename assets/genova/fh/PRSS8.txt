# PRSS8

## Overview
PRSS8 is a gene that encodes the serine protease prostasin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein. Prostasin is categorized as a serine protease due to its enzymatic activity, which involves cleaving peptide bonds in proteins. This protein is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the skin, kidney, colon, and lung, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial integrity and regulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (Frateschi2012Mutations; Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). Prostasin is involved in several physiological processes, such as sodium balance, skin barrier function, and cellular signaling, through both its catalytic and non-catalytic activities (Crisante2014The; Leyvraz2005The). Alterations in PRSS8 expression or function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including skin disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Zhang2016PRSS8; Shamseldin2023PRSS8).

## Structure
The PRSS8 gene encodes the serine protease prostasin, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein expressed in various tissues, including the skin and kidney (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). The primary structure of prostasin consists of 342 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 32 residues removed during maturation, resulting in a single-chain zymogen (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). The protein includes a highly conserved trypsin domain, which is the active site domain of serine proteases, composed of two antiparallel beta barrels (Shamseldin2023PRSS8).

Prostasin undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its processing and function (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). The protein is cleaved after residue R44 to form a heavy and light chain linked by a disulfide bond, which is crucial for its activity (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). Mutations such as Prss8-S238A and Prss8-R44Q have been studied to understand their effects on the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activation, highlighting the importance of prostasin's structure in its function (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked). The tertiary structure of prostasin is essential for its scaffold function, independent of its proteolytic activity, in recruiting other proteases for ENaC activation (Essigke2021Zymogen‐locked).

## Function
PRSS8, also known as prostasin, is a serine protease that plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the epidermal barrier. It is involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is crucial for sodium transport across epithelial tissues, impacting fluid balance and blood pressure regulation (Frateschi2012Mutations). In the skin, PRSS8 is essential for proper epidermal barrier function, influencing lipid composition and the processing of profilaggrin to filaggrin, which are vital for maintaining skin hydration and barrier integrity (Leyvraz2005The).

PRSS8 is expressed in various epithelial tissues, including the skin, colon, lung, and kidney, where it can be released into the extracellular space by phospholipase C (Hummler2015CleavageDependent). It is also involved in the formation and maintenance of tight junctions in the epidermis, which are crucial for preventing transepidermal water loss and ensuring proper skin barrier function (Leyvraz2005The). Despite its enzymatic activity, PRSS8 can also function through non-catalytic mechanisms, such as activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), indicating its diverse roles in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Crisante2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRSS8 gene, which encodes the serine protease prostasin, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of skin disorders, mutations in PRSS8 are associated with autosomal recessive ichthyosis, a condition characterized by dry, scaly skin. Novel homozygous variants in PRSS8 have been identified in families with congenital ichthyosis, affecting splice sites and conserved residues, which disrupt protease function and skin barrier integrity (Shamseldin2023PRSS8).

In cancer, PRSS8 expression is significantly downregulated in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and other malignancies. In gastric cancer, reduced PRSS8 mRNA expression correlates with shorter survival and increased metastasis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Sakashita2008Clinical). Similarly, in HCC, low PRSS8 expression is linked to poor prognosis, with its restoration inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (Zhang2016PRSS8).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), decreased prostasin expression exacerbates inflammation. In mouse models, the deletion of PRSS8 in intestinal epithelial cells increases susceptibility to colitis, highlighting its protective role against gut inflammation (Sugitani2020Sodium).

## Interactions
PRSS8, also known as prostasin, is a serine protease that participates in various protein interactions, influencing several biological processes. It is known to interact with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), where it plays a role in sodium balance by enhancing ENaC-mediated sodium currents. Mutations in PRSS8 can affect this interaction, leading to reduced ENaC activity (Frateschi2012Mutations).

PRSS8 also interacts with protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), a downstream target involved in ion transport regulation. This interaction is significant in contexts such as skin homeostasis and intestinal inflammation (Keppner2016Altered; Crisante2014The). The interaction with PAR2 is independent of PRSS8's catalytic activity, as both wild-type and catalytically inactive forms of PRSS8 can activate PAR2 (Crisante2014The).

Another important interaction is with the serine protease inhibitor nexin-1 (PN-1). Nexin-1 can inhibit both the active and inactive forms of PRSS8, suggesting that the catalytic site is not necessary for this inhibition. This interaction has been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments and is thought to modulate the activity of PRSS8, potentially offering therapeutic avenues for skin disorders (Crisante2014The).
