# FRG2B

## Overview
The FRG2B gene encodes the protein FSHD region gene 2 family member B, which is implicated in various cellular processes. This protein is part of a family of proteins associated with the pathogenesis of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Although the precise function of FRG2B is not fully understood, it is believed to play a role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The protein is categorized as a nuclear protein, suggesting its involvement in transcriptional regulation and other nuclear processes. Research into the FRG2B gene and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into their potential roles in muscle biology and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
