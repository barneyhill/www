# OR13F1

## Overview
The OR13F1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily F member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is integral to the olfactory system, functioning as a receptor that detects and binds specific odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium. Upon binding an odorant, the receptor initiates a signal transduction cascade that ultimately results in the perception of smell. The OR13F1 gene is characterized by significant heterozygosity, which is indicative of evolutionary adaptation through overdominance, potentially enhancing olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites (Alonso2008Overdominance).

## Structure


## Function
OR13F1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR13F1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. This binding triggers neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (Alonso2008Overdominance).

The gene OR13F1 has been shown to exhibit significant heterozygosity, suggesting it may have evolved under overdominance. This genetic diversity is thought to enhance olfactory acuity by increasing the diversity of odorant-binding sites. Such diversity is important because each olfactory neuron expresses only one allele from a single OR gene, and increased genetic diversity may improve the ability to discriminate among similar odorants. This adaptation could be a response to the loss of functional ORs in humans compared to other species, allowing for better odor discrimination despite a reduced number of functional olfactory receptors (Alonso2008Overdominance).
