# C2orf42

## Overview
C2orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 2 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 42. This protein has been proposed to function as a regulator of ischemia and stress tolerance, particularly in kidney epithelial cells, where it may play a protective role against ischemic and cytotoxic stress (Zynda2015An). While the precise biochemical function of the C2orf42 protein remains to be fully elucidated, its expression levels have been associated with various clinical conditions, including clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its potential involvement in cellular stress responses and disease pathogenesis (Zynda2015An; Rahman2020Identification). Further research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which C2orf42 influences these processes and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
C2orf42, also proposed to be named Regulator of Ischemia and Stress Tolerance 1 (RIST1), has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to alterations in its expression levels. In kidney epithelial cells, interference with C2orf42 provides protection against ischemia and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting its potential role in nephroprotection (Zynda2015An). The gene's expression is notably decreased in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), a type of kidney cancer resistant to conventional chemotherapy, indicating that reduced C2orf42 expression may be associated with the transition from drug sensitivity to resistance in this cancer type (Zynda2015An).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), C2orf42 has been identified as one of the differentially expressed genes in patients, suggesting its involvement in the disease's molecular signature (Rahman2020Identification). However, the specific role of C2orf42 in AD pathogenesis remains unclear, as the study did not find overlap with known AD-related biomarkers (Rahman2020Identification).

Overall, C2orf42's expression changes are linked to its protective roles in kidney cells and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases, although its precise biochemical function and broader clinical implications require further investigation.
