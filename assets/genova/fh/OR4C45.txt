# OR4C45

## Overview
The OR4C45 gene is responsible for encoding the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 45, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a pivotal role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding specific odorants (Barnes2020Expert). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR4C45 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as human mucosal enterochromaffin cells, where it may influence intestinal homeostasis and epithelial permeability (Zhang2016Correlation). Genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, can affect the gene's expression, potentially restoring its function from a pseudogene status in certain populations, thereby implicating OR4C45 in diverse physiological roles beyond olfaction (Barnes2020Expert).

## Function
The OR4C45 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily located in the olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity, where they play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding to specific odorants and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Barnes2020Expert). 

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR4C45 may have functions beyond the nasal cavity. It is expressed in human mucosal enterochromaffin cells, suggesting a potential role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The olfactory receptor ligand is involved in regulating epithelial permeability and electrogenic anion secretion in the human colon, indicating that OR4C45 might contribute to gut function (Zhang2016Correlation). 

The gene has been identified as having potential protein-coding capability due to genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, which can resurrect its function from a pseudogene status in some human populations (Barnes2020Expert). This suggests that OR4C45 may have a functional role in certain individuals, contributing to both olfactory and non-olfactory physiological processes.
