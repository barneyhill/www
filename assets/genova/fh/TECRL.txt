# TECRL

## Overview
The TECRL gene encodes the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase-like protein, which is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. This protein is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a pivotal role in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and calcium handling within cardiomyocytes. TECRL is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and cardiac health, operating through pathways such as PI3K/AKT to regulate mitochondrial respiration and homeostasis. Mutations in the TECRL gene are linked to severe cardiac conditions, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), which can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The protein's interactions with cardiac ion channels and mitochondrial proteins underscore its importance in cardiac function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Devalla2016TECRL; Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel; Hou2022TECRL).

## Structure
The TECRL gene encodes a protein consisting of 363 amino acids, primarily expressed in the heart and skeletal muscles (Devalla2016TECRL; Hou2022TECRL). The protein features a ubiquitin-like domain in the N-terminal half and a 3-oxo-5-alpha steroid 4-dehydrogenase domain in the C-terminal half (Devalla2016TECRL; Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel). It also contains three transmembrane segments, which are crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum of myocardial cells (Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel).

Mutations in the TECRL gene can lead to significant structural changes. For instance, the c.415C>T variant results in a premature stop codon, leading to the loss of all three transmembrane domains and the 3-oxo-5-alpha steroid 4-dehydrogenase domain (Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel). Another variant, Ser309*, results in the loss of the third transmembrane domain and part of the 3-oxo-5-alpha steroid 4-dehydrogenase domain (Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel).

The TECRL protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cardiac function (Devalla2016TECRL). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The TECRL gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and cardiac health. In healthy human cells, TECRL is involved in regulating mitochondrial respiration, which is essential for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. It operates through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and affects mitochondrial fusion proteins like mitofusin 2 (MFN2), thereby maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and proper cardiac function (Hou2022TECRL).

TECRL is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in very-long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidoreductase activity. This localization is significant for its role in calcium handling within cardiomyocytes, which is crucial for normal cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation (Devalla2016TECRL).

The protein's function is linked to the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of proteins vital for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function. TECRL helps prevent oxidative stress and maintains the ultrastructure of mitochondria, which is essential for proper cardiac function (Hou2022TECRL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TECRL gene are associated with life-threatening inherited arrhythmias, particularly catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). These conditions can lead to sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias. TECRL mutations have been linked to altered calcium handling and prolonged action potentials in cardiomyocytes, contributing to arrhythmogenic activity (Devalla2016TECRL; Hou2022TECRL). 

Patients with TECRL mutations often present with symptoms such as exercise-induced arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest. The gene is associated with autosomal recessive inheritance, and affected individuals typically have homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, while heterozygous carriers are usually asymptomatic (Webster2020Lifethreatening; Xie2019A). 

Clinical management of TECRL-related arrhythmias includes the use of beta-blockers like nadolol and propranolol, with flecainide as a potential therapeutic option. In severe cases, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may be considered (Devalla2016TECRL; Jones2024Novel). Despite these treatments, some patients may experience refractory arrhythmias, highlighting the need for further research into more effective therapies (Webster2020Lifethreatening).

## Interactions
The TECRL protein is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiomyocytes. It interacts with ATP synthase subunit beta (ATPB), and this interaction is enhanced with TECRL overexpression, suggesting a role in mitochondrial respiration (Hou2022TECRL). TECRL also regulates mitochondrial function through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, affecting proteins such as mitofusin2 (MFN2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and Fas. In human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, TECRL knockdown results in decreased levels of MFN2, p-AKT, and NRF2, while overexpression increases MFN2 and decreases Fas levels (Hou2022TECRL).

TECRL is also associated with the regulation of calcium balance in cardiomyocytes. It interacts with cardiac ion channels, including Calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2) and ryanodine-receptor 2 (RYR2), which are essential for calcium handling in the heart (Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel). These interactions are significant for maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and are implicated in the pathophysiology of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (Moscu‐Gregor2020Novel). The protein's role in these interactions highlights its importance in cardiac function and its potential as a therapeutic target for related cardiac conditions.
