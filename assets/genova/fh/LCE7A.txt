# LCE7A

## Overview
The LCE7A gene is a member of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, which is integral to the formation of the cornified envelope in the epidermis. This gene encodes the late cornified envelope 7A protein, which is involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the skin's outermost layer. The LCE7A protein contributes to the structural integrity and protective function of the skin barrier, playing a role in preventing dehydration and protecting against pathogen invasion. Its expression in human epidermal keratinocytes and conservation across mammals underscore its significance in skin biology and immune response (Holthaus2021Gene).

## Function
The LCE7A gene encodes a protein that is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene cluster, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a protective barrier in the skin. This barrier is essential for maintaining skin integrity, preventing dehydration, and protecting against pathogen entry. The LCE7A protein is involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin (Holthaus2021Gene).

In humans, the LCE7A gene is characterized by a conserved TATA box in its promoter region, splice sites at exon borders, and a mostly conserved coding sequence. Its expression has been confirmed in human epidermal keratinocytes through RT-PCR analysis, indicating its active role in skin biology (Holthaus2021Gene). Although the specific function of LCE7A in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its conservation across various mammals, including humans, suggests a significant role in epidermal function (Holthaus2021Gene). The protein's involvement in stress response and its structural role in corneocytes, as well as its potential antimicrobial properties, highlight its importance in skin barrier function and immune response (Holthaus2021Gene).
