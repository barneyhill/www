# PHLDA2

## Overview
PHLDA2, or pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling and growth regulation. The protein, characterized by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, plays a significant role in intracellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane association (Angiolini2021Deletion; Suzuki2011Characterisation). PHLDA2 is primarily expressed in the placenta, where it functions as a growth rheostat, regulating placental development and influencing fetal growth by modulating the spongiotrophoblast compartment and placental hormone expression (Tunster2010The; Tunster2016The). Beyond its physiological roles, PHLDA2 is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Zhao2024Epigenetic; Chen2023PHLDA2). The gene's involvement in oncogenic pathways underscores its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Iqbal2024Multiomics).

## Structure
The PHLDA2 protein is characterized by a single pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling and membrane association (Angiolini2021Deletion). This domain allows the protein to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) in vitro, suggesting a role in intracellular trafficking or signaling (Angiolini2021Deletion). The PH domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in the protein's function (Suzuki2011Characterisation). In the tammar wallaby, the PHLDA2 protein consists of a 426 bp open reading frame encoding 142 amino acids, with the PH domain showing significant sequence similarity to human PHLDA2 (Suzuki2011Characterisation).

The PHLDA2 protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. These modifications are important for the protein's role in signal transduction and cellular processes. The gene may also have splice variant isoforms, leading to different protein structures and functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its involvement in growth regulation and cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
PHLDA2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, PHLDA2 is primarily expressed in the placenta, where it plays a critical role in placental development and function. It acts as a growth rheostat, negatively regulating the expansion of the junctional zone in the placenta, which is crucial for maintaining the balance of maternal resources allocated to the fetus (Tunster2010The; Tunster2016The). PHLDA2 influences the spongiotrophoblast compartment, affecting the expression of placental hormones that are essential for nutrient transfer from the mother to the fetus (Tunster2016The).

The protein encoded by PHLDA2 binds to phosphatidylinositide lipids, suggesting a role in cell signaling or subcellular trafficking (Tunster2010The). This binding capability indicates that PHLDA2 may be involved in intracellular processes such as cytoskeletal regulation and vesicular transport (Salas2004Placental). PHLDA2's function is independent of the insulin-like growth factor system, distinguishing it from other imprinted genes involved in growth regulation (Salas2004Placental). Overall, PHLDA2 is essential for modulating placental size and function, thereby influencing fetal growth and development.

## Clinical Significance
PHLDA2 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PHLDA2 is identified as a prognostic biomarker associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, contributing to worse survival outcomes. Its expression is positively correlated with immune and stromal scores and negatively correlated with tumor purity, indicating its role in the tumor immune microenvironment (Chen2023PHLDA2). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), elevated PHLDA2 expression is linked to poorer prognosis and adverse clinicopathologic parameters. It is associated with DNA hypomethylation, which contributes to its dysregulation, and correlates with an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by increased infiltration of regulatory T cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Zhao2024Epigenetic).

PHLDA2 is also upregulated in several other cancers, including brain, breast, colorectal, esophageal, and lung cancers, and is associated with poor overall survival in esophageal, gastric, liver, ovarian, uterine, and cholangiocarcinoma cancers (Iqbal2024Multiomics). The gene's expression is influenced by oncogenic pathways, such as EGFR/A signaling, and its overexpression can enhance tumor growth in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and breast cancer (Iqbal2024Multiomics). These findings highlight PHLDA2's role as an oncogene in various cancers and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
