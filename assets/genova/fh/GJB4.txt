# GJB4

## Overview
The GJB4 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 4, also known as connexin 30.3 (Cx30.3), which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Cx30.3 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and plays a critical role in maintaining skin homeostasis and differentiation. It is also transiently expressed during cardiac development, suggesting a potential role in heart physiology. Mutations in GJB4 have been implicated in skin disorders such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis and have been investigated for their potential association with hearing impairment, although the latter remains inconclusive (Kooshavar2013Digenic; Lucaciu2023GJB4; Richard2003Genetic).

## Structure
The GJB4 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 4, also known as connexin 30.3 (Cx30.3), which is a member of the connexin family involved in forming gap junction channels. These channels facilitate intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Connexin 30.3 is characterized by its structure, which includes four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, one cytoplasmic loop, and cytoplasmic N- and C-termini (Premzl2019Comparative).

The protein assembles into hexameric structures known as connexons. These connexons dock with connexons from neighboring cells to form complete gap junction channels, enabling direct cell-to-cell communication (Premzl2019Comparative). The molecular structure of connexin proteins, including Cx30.3, is defined by common cysteine residues and predicted N-glycosylation sites, which are important for their function and stability (Premzl2019Comparative).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the function of connexins, although specific modifications for Cx30.3 are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's ability to form functional gap junctions is crucial for its role in maintaining cellular communication and tissue homeostasis (Lucaciu2023GJB4).

## Function
The GJB4 gene encodes the connexin protein Cx30.3, which is involved in forming gap junctions that facilitate intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. In healthy human cells, Cx30.3 is primarily expressed in the epidermis, particularly in the stratum spinosum and granulosum layers, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis and differentiation (Lucaciu2023GJB4). The protein is essential for proper cell communication, which is vital for processes such as epidermal differentiation, proliferation, and wound repair (Lucaciu2023GJB4).

Cx30.3 forms functional gap junctions in keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, and its role is likely compensated by other connexin isoforms, as evidenced by the lack of skin abnormalities in Cx30.3-deficient mice (Lucaciu2023GJB4). The protein's function in healthy cells involves forming gap junctions that are crucial for cellular communication, ensuring the maintenance of normal cellular function and structure (Lucaciu2023GJB4). While the role of GJB4 in cardiac physiology is not fully understood, it is transiently expressed during the differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes, suggesting a potential role in cardiac development (Okamoto2020Gap).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJB4 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein beta 4 (connexin 30.3), are associated with several skin disorders, most notably erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV). EKV is characterized by persistent hyperkeratosis and transient red patches on the skin. The disorder is linked to specific missense mutations in GJB4, such as G12D, R22H, T85P, F137L, and F189Y, which affect the transmembrane domains of the protein, potentially altering gap junction communication and epidermal differentiation (Richard2003Genetic). These mutations can lead to a dominant negative effect on wild-type alleles, contributing to the disease phenotype (Richard2003Genetic).

In addition to skin disorders, GJB4 variants have been investigated for their potential role in hearing impairment. Although some studies have identified GJB4 variants in hearing-impaired individuals, the evidence for a direct association with hearing loss is not conclusive. For instance, the c.542C>T variant in GJB4 has been suggested to contribute to autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss in combination with GJB2 mutations, indicating a possible digenic inheritance pattern (Kooshavar2013Digenic). However, other studies have found GJB4 variants in both affected individuals and controls, suggesting they may not be pathogenic (Adadey2020GJB4andGJC3variants).

## Interactions
GJB4, encoding the gap junction protein beta 4, is known to interact with other connexins, particularly GJA1 (connexin 43), to form functional gap junctions. In cardiac tissues, GJB4 is upregulated in diseased hearts and colocalizes with GJA1, suggesting a role in cardiac remodeling under stress conditions. The interaction between GJB4 and GJA1 is crucial for maintaining cardiac function, and mutations in GJB4, such as the E204A variant, result in weaker interactions with GJA1, potentially impairing gap junction formation and contributing to cardiac pathologies like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Okamoto2020Gap).

In the context of skin diseases, GJB4 mutants linked to erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva (EKVP) exhibit impaired trafficking and are often retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, failing to form functional gap junctions. However, co-expression with other connexins, such as Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43, can partially rescue the assembly of these mutants into gap junctions, indicating potential compensatory interactions among connexins to maintain epidermal health (Lucaciu2023GJB4). These interactions highlight the importance of GJB4 in both cardiac and skin physiology, particularly under pathological conditions.
