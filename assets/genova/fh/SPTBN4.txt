# SPTBN4

## Overview
The SPTBN4 gene encodes the spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 4 (βIV-spectrin) protein, which is a critical component of the cytoskeletal network in neurons. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of axonal membranes. βIV-spectrin is primarily located on the plasma membrane and is essential for the mechanical stabilization of axonal membranes, particularly in myelinated neurons of the central nervous system. It facilitates the clustering of sodium and potassium channels at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier through its interaction with ankyrin-G, which is crucial for the proper localization of ion channels and the function of axonal domains. These processes are vital for the initiation and propagation of action potentials, ensuring normal neurological function (Günay2023Expanding; Häusler2020A; Buelow2021Novel).

## Structure
The SPTBN4 gene encodes the βIV-spectrin protein, a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in neurons. The primary structure of βIV-spectrin includes amino acid sequences forming spectrin repeats, which are integral to its function. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha-helices, contributing to its flexible rod-like shape. Tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a stable, elongated form, allowing it to maintain cell shape and stability (Liu2019Axonal).

βIV-spectrin features specific domains, including an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD), 17 spectrin repeats (SRs), and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. These domains are essential for its interaction with other proteins and its role in clustering ion channels at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier (Wang2018βIV; Liu2019Axonal). The protein also has a non-canonical phosphorylation-dependent binding site in ankyrinG's giant exon, which is crucial for its function in neurons (Liu2019Axonal).

There are two major splice variants of βIV-spectrin: the longer βIVS1 variant and the shorter βIVS6 variant. The βIVS1 variant includes the full complement of domains, while the βIVS6 variant starts at the tenth spectrin repeat (Wang2018βIV).

## Function
The SPTBN4 gene encodes the βIV-spectrin protein, a crucial component of the cytoskeletal network in human cells. βIV-spectrin is primarily located on the plasma membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of axonal membranes. It is essential for the mechanical stabilization of these membranes, particularly in neurons, where it supports axonal integrity and synaptic function (Günay2023Expanding; Häusler2020A).

In healthy human cells, βIV-spectrin is enriched in myelinated neurons of the central nervous system. It is involved in the clustering of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) channels at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. This clustering is facilitated through its interaction with ankyrin-G, which is critical for the proper localization of ion channels and the function of axonal domains. These processes are vital for the initiation and propagation of action potentials, ensuring normal neurological function (Buelow2021Novel).

The protein also forms part of a complex with actin and adducin, creating ring-like structures that wrap around the axonal membrane, contributing to neuronal maintenance and membrane excitability (Häusler2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPTBN4 gene, which encodes the βIV-spectrin protein, are associated with a range of severe neurological disorders. These include a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by congenital hypotonia, intellectual disability, motor axonal neuropathy, and auditory neuropathy (Wang2018βIV). The disorder is often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with affected individuals carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the SPTBN4 gene (Buelow2021Novel). Clinical manifestations can include severe muscular hypotonia, developmental delays, feeding difficulties, and progressive neuropathy, with some patients experiencing epilepsy and central-vision impairment (Wang2018βIV).

The phenotypic spectrum of SPTBN4-related disorders is broad, with some patients not exhibiting all core symptoms. For instance, a reported case involved a patient with congenital hypotonia and neuropathy but without hearing loss or epilepsy (Günay2023Expanding). Other symptoms associated with SPTBN4 mutations include horizontal nystagmus, choreoathetosis, and epileptiform discharges in EEG without manifest seizures (Buelow2021Novel). Muscle histology in affected individuals often shows characteristics of both myopathy and neuropathy (Buelow2021Novel). These findings highlight the importance of considering SPTBN4 mutations in patients with congenital hypotonia and areflexia, especially after excluding other conditions like spinal muscular atrophy (Günay2023Expanding).

## Interactions
The SPTBN4 gene encodes the spectrin beta non-erythrocytic 4 protein, which is a crucial component of the cytoskeletal network. This protein interacts with ankyrin-G, a key interaction that facilitates the clustering of sodium and potassium channels at the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier in myelinated neurons. These interactions are essential for maintaining proper ion channel localization and axonal domain function, which are critical for normal neurological function (Buelow2021Novel).

Mutations in SPTBN4 can disrupt these interactions, leading to severe neurological dysfunctions. The frameshift deletion in the SPTBN4 gene results in a truncated protein that lacks the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is essential for protein transport to membranes. This disruption likely affects the protein's ability to interact with other proteins or nucleic acids, particularly those involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane (Derks2019Detection).

In addition, the affected C-terminal domain of SPTBN4 is crucial for KCNQ2 channel trafficking and excitability, highlighting the importance of SPTBN4 in ion channel regulation (Derks2019Detection).
