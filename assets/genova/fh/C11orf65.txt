# C11orf65

## Overview
C11orf65 is a gene located on chromosome 11 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 65. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and interactions are not yet fully understood. While the precise role of C11orf65 in cellular processes remains to be elucidated, it is hypothesized to be involved in various cellular pathways due to its expression in multiple tissues. Further research is necessary to determine its potential implications in health and disease, as well as its interactions with other proteins and genetic elements.
