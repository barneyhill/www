# PAXBP1

## Overview
PAXBP1, or PAX3 and PAX7 binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a nuclear adaptor protein involved in critical developmental processes such as craniofacial development, myogenesis, and spine morphogenesis. The protein encoded by PAXBP1 plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation by linking the transcription factors PAX3 and PAX7 to the histone methylation machinery, specifically facilitating the recruitment of the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complex. This interaction is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells, highlighting its significance in muscle and neural tissue development (Alharby2017A; Mohammadparast2014Exceptional). The gene's promoter region is characterized by a unique complex of CT short tandem repeats, which may influence gene expression and contribute to phenotypic variation (Mohammadparast2014Exceptional). PAXBP1's involvement in various biological pathways underscores its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states, including developmental disorders and cancer (Zhang2021Comprehensive; Alharby2017A).

## Function
PAXBP1, also known as GCFC1, is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in various developmental processes, including craniofacial development, myogenesis, and spine morphogenesis. It functions as an adaptor protein that links the transcription factors PAX3 and PAX7 to the histone methylation machinery, specifically recruiting the histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase (HMT) complex by bridging Pax7 and Wdr5. This interaction is crucial for the proliferation of Pax7-positive muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) and is involved in the regulation of gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Alharby2017A; Mohammadparast2014Exceptional).

The PAXBP1 gene's core promoter contains a unique complex of CT short tandem repeats (STRs), which is the longest identified in a human gene core promoter. These STRs are significant for generating genetic variation and may influence gene expression levels, potentially impacting phenotypic variation and evolutionary adaptation (Mohammadparast2014Exceptional). PAXBP1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and muscle precursor cells, where it is involved in myogenesis and skeletal muscle formation (Alharby2017A). The protein's activity in the nucleus is essential for modulating transcriptional activity, impacting muscle and neural tissue development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PAXBP1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A homozygous missense variant in PAXBP1, resulting in the substitution of arginine with cysteine at position 538, has been associated with a syndrome characterized by global developmental delay and myopathic hypotonia. This variant disrupts the protein's structure by preventing a crucial hydrogen bond, leading to the observed clinical symptoms (Alharby2017A).

PAXBP1 is also implicated in immune system development. Its deficiency in mice leads to thymic atrophy and increased apoptosis of CD4 and CD8 double-positive thymocytes, indicating its essential role in T cell survival and development (Li2023Paxbp1). Additionally, PAXBP1 has been associated with COVID-19 disease severity, where genetic variants may alter transcription factor binding, affecting immune response (Pahl2022Implicating).

In the context of cancer, PAXBP1 is differentially expressed in breast cancer subtypes, particularly downregulated in Luminal A breast cancer, where it is considered a good prognosis gene (Zhang2021Comprehensive). These findings highlight the gene's diverse roles in various diseases and conditions.

## Interactions
PAXBP1 is known to interact with transcription factors PAX3 and PAX7, serving as an adaptor protein that links these factors to histone methylation machinery. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex, specifically the Wdr5-Ash2L-MLL2 complex, which facilitates the tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at target gene promoters, such as Myf5, important for muscle cell differentiation (Weng2024The; Zhou2024Functional). PAXBP1 interacts with PAX7 through a specific region (amino acids 380-560) and can also bind with PAX3 due to sequence similarity (Zhou2024Functional).

PAXBP1 is primarily a nuclear protein and is associated with HMT activities specific for H3K4. It is hypothesized to facilitate the recruitment of the HMT complex by PAX7, as knockdown of Paxbp1 reduces PAX7-associated HMT activities (Zhou2024Functional). The C-terminal region of PAXBP1 can directly interact with WDR5, suggesting it may bridge the interaction between PAX7 and the HMT complex (Zhou2024Functional). These interactions highlight PAXBP1's role in transcriptional regulation and its importance in muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.
