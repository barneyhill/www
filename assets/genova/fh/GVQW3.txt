# GVQW3

## Overview
GVQW3 is a gene that encodes the protein GVQW motif containing 3, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a GVQW motif, which suggests a potential role in protein-protein interactions or signaling pathways. While the specific functions of GVQW motif containing 3 are still under investigation, it is hypothesized to play a role in cellular signaling due to its structural features. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in recent studies, particularly in the context of their interactions with other cellular components and potential implications in disease pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
