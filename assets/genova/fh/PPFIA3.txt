# PPFIA3

## Overview
PPFIA3 is a gene that encodes the protein Liprin-α3, which is a member of the liprin family of proteins. Liprin-α3 is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a pivotal role in the organization and function of presynaptic active zones, which are critical for synaptic transmission. As a scaffolding protein, Liprin-α3 interacts with various active zone proteins, such as Bassoon, RIM, and Munc13, to facilitate synaptic vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release. It is involved in the structural organization of the active zone through its phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C (PKC), which promotes the formation of liquid-like condensates essential for recruiting other proteins to the active zone (EmperadorMelero2021PKCphosphorylation; Wong2018Liprinα3). Mutations in PPFIA3 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Paul2023Rare).

## Structure


## Function
The PPFIA3 gene encodes Liprin-α3, a protein that plays a critical role in the organization and function of presynaptic active zones in neurons. Liprin-α3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, including regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, where it is involved in synaptic vesicle transport and neurotransmitter release (Paul2023Rare). It functions as a scaffolding protein, interacting with other active zone proteins like Bassoon, RIM, and Munc13, to facilitate synaptic vesicle docking and exocytosis (Paul2023Rare; Wong2018Liprinα3).

Liprin-α3 undergoes phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C (PKC) at the serine-760 site, which triggers phase separation, forming liquid-like condensates that are crucial for the recruitment of proteins such as RIM and Munc13-1 to the active zone (EmperadorMelero2021PKCphosphorylation). This process enhances the structural organization of the active zone and is essential for efficient synaptic transmission (EmperadorMelero2021PKCphosphorylation). The absence of Liprin-α3 leads to impaired synaptic vesicle docking and a reduced pool of releasable vesicles, underscoring its essential role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (EmperadorMelero2021PKCphosphorylation; Wong2018Liprinα3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPFIA3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including delayed development, intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy. These conditions are linked to rare mono-allelic variants in PPFIA3, which exhibit dominant negative loss-of-function effects, disrupting synapse formation and multiple developmental processes (Paul2023Rare). Clinical features observed in individuals with these variants include developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, abnormal EEG findings, delayed speech development, hypotonia, comorbid autism spectrum disorder, gastrointestinal dysmotility, dysmorphic facial features, and variations in head size such as macrocephaly or microcephaly (Paul2023Rare).

Functional studies using transgenic fruit flies expressing human PPFIA3 variants have demonstrated that these mutations can lead to seizure-like behaviors, motor defects, and anatomical abnormalities, indicating their pathogenicity (Paul2023Rare). The PPFIA3 protein, encoded by the PPFIA3 gene, plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle transport and presynaptic active zone assembly, and its interactions with other active zone proteins are essential for normal synaptic transmission (Paul2023Rare). Disruptions in these interactions due to mutations can significantly impact neurological development and function, contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals (Paul2023Rare).

## Interactions
PPFIA3, a member of the liprin family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for synaptic function and neuronal development. It colocalizes in the presynaptic compartment of neurons, where it interacts with active zone proteins such as Bassoon, RIM, Munc-13, RIM-BP, and ELKS. These interactions are crucial for synapse formation, synaptic transmission, and protein trafficking in hippocampal neurons (Paul2023Rare).

The PPFIA3 protein contains N-terminal coiled coil domains and C-terminal SAM domains, which facilitate its interactions with other liprin-α members and active zone proteins. The SAM domain specifically interacts with the LAR intracellular domain, highlighting its role in mediating protein-protein interactions (Paul2023Rare).

In the context of synaptic development, PPFIA3 variants have been shown to disrupt synaptic function and development, acting as dominant negative loss-of-function alleles. This disruption affects multiple developmental processes and synapse formation, as demonstrated in studies using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism (Paul2023Rare).

Overall, PPFIA3's interactions are integral to its function in the nervous system, influencing synaptic assembly and presynaptic organization through its association with various proteins (Pehkonen2021Liprins).
