# ACTRT2

## Overview
ACTRT2 is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein T2, a member of the actin family, which plays a pivotal role in cellular structure and motility. This protein is categorized within the cytoplasmic actin-related protein subfamily and is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and intracellular trafficking. ACTRT2 is particularly significant in spermatozoa, where it is localized in the post-acrosomal region and the middle piece, contributing to sperm motility and potentially serving as a biomarker for heat-induced male infertility (Liu2014Proteomic; Wu2020Effect). Additionally, ACTRT2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Peng2022Ectopic; Ignatieva2019Exomewide). Despite its recognized roles, the precise molecular mechanisms of ACTRT2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its diverse functions and interactions.

## Structure


## Function
ACTRT2, or actin-related protein T2, is part of the actin family, which is crucial for cellular structure and motility. In healthy human cells, ACTRT2 is involved in cytoskeletal organization, influencing cellular functions such as movement and stability (Thami2020Whole). The protein is localized in the spermatozoa post-acrosomal region and the middle piece, suggesting a role in sperm motility (Liu2014Proteomic). 

Studies have shown that ACTRT2 expression is positively correlated with sperm motility, indicating its potential role in maintaining normal sperm function (Liu2014Proteomic). The protein's involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics may contribute to its function in sperm motility, although its exact molecular mechanisms in healthy cells remain poorly understood (Liu2014Proteomic). 

ACTRT2 is also implicated in the response to environmental stressors, such as heat, where its expression is significantly decreased in human sperm after transient scrotal hyperthermia, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for heat-induced male infertility (Wu2020Effect). Despite these findings, the specific function of ACTRT2 in healthy human cells requires further investigation to fully elucidate its role in cellular and organismal processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACTRT2 gene have been associated with several diseases. Variants in ACTRT2 have been linked to severe forms of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Studies have identified harmful variants in ACTRT2 that are not common in non-Finnish European populations, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of TBE. These variants may affect the intracellular trafficking of the tick-borne encephalitis virus, influencing disease progression (Ignatieva2019Exomewide).

ACTRT2 is also implicated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). It is part of a five-gene set used to design a prognostic classifier for T-ALL patients. This classifier helps predict high-risk forms of the disease, characterized by poor response to treatment and shorter survival. The ectopic expression of ACTRT2 and other genes in this set serves as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment planning (Peng2022Ectopic; Peng2021Ectopic).

Additionally, ACTRT2 has been studied in the context of HIV-1 susceptibility. Variants in this gene show significant frequency differences between HIV-positive and -negative individuals in Botswana, suggesting a potential impact on HIV-1 predisposition (Thami2023Whole).

## Interactions
ACTRT2, or actin-related protein T2, is involved in cytoskeletal organization, which is crucial for intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is part of the cytoplasmic actin-related protein subfamily and plays a role in the transport and replication of viruses such as the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) within host cells (Ignatieva2019Exomewide). Although specific physical interactions of ACTRT2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies, it is included in a list of perinuclear theca (PT) proteins that interact with cylicin-1 (CYLC1) in sperm development. This interaction is part of a coordinated role in acrosome attachment to the sperm nucleus, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Jin2024Disruption). ACTRT2 is also identified as a centric protein in a protein-protein interaction network related to hypoxic tolerance in Tibetan pig spermatozoa, indicating its potential involvement in complex cellular processes (Zhao2019Comparative). However, specific details on its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited in the current literature.
