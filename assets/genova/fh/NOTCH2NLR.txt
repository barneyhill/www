# NOTCH2NLR

## Overview
The NOTCH2NLR gene encodes the protein notch 2 N-terminal like R, which is part of the NOTCH family of proteins known for their roles in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell fate decisions. This protein is categorized as a receptor, playing a crucial role in various developmental processes and cellular functions. The NOTCH signaling pathway, in which NOTCH2NLR is involved, is highly conserved across species and is essential for proper embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Aberrations in NOTCH signaling, including those involving NOTCH2NLR, have been implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer and congenital disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
