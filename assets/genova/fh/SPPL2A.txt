# SPPL2A

## Overview
SPPL2A is a gene that encodes the protein signal peptide peptidase-like 2A, an intramembrane protease involved in the regulation of immune system processes. This protein is primarily active in endosomes and lysosomes, where it plays a critical role in the maturation and function of B cells and dendritic cells by processing the invariant chain CD74, a type-II transmembrane protein. The proteolytic activity of SPPL2A is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis, as it prevents the accumulation of CD74 N-terminal fragments, which can otherwise disrupt cellular trafficking and immune cell differentiation. Dysregulation of SPPL2A has been associated with impaired immune responses and potential autoimmunity, highlighting its significance in immune regulation (Papadopoulou2020Signaling; Schneppenheim2012The; Mentrup2020Physiological).

## Function
SPPL2A is an intramembrane protease that plays a critical role in the immune system by processing the invariant chain CD74, a type-II transmembrane protein. In healthy human cells, SPPL2A is involved in the maturation of B cells and dendritic cells by cleaving CD74 N-terminal fragments (NTFs), which are crucial for proper B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and endosomal trafficking (Schneppenheim2012The; Mentrup2020Physiological). The cleavage of CD74 by SPPL2A prevents the accumulation of CD74 NTFs, which can otherwise disrupt cellular trafficking and inhibit B cell differentiation and maturation (Papadopoulou2020Signaling).

SPPL2A is active in endosomes and lysosomes, where it regulates the turnover of CD74 NTFs, maintaining the integrity of MHC class II-containing endosomes and ensuring proper antigen presentation (Schneppenheim2012The). The protease also influences the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is essential for B cell activation and survival (Mentrup2020Physiological). SPPL2A's activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to impaired immune responses and potential autoimmunity (Papadopoulou2020Signaling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPPL2A gene have been linked to Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD), a condition characterized by increased vulnerability to infections from low-virulent mycobacteria, such as those from the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Patients with SPPL2A mutations exhibit a significant decrease in certain dendritic cell subsets and impaired mycobacterium-specific IFN-γ production by memory CD4+ T cells, which compromises the immune response (Errami2023Mendelian; ReyJurado2018Insights; Mentrup2020Physiological).

SPPL2A deficiency also affects B cell development and function. In SPPL2A-deficient mice, there is an accumulation of the CD74 N-terminal fragment (NTF), leading to impaired B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and altered immune responses. This deficiency results in defects in splenic B cell maturation and a reduction in mature B cell subsets, which can contribute to immune system deficiencies (Beisner2012The; Schneppenheim2012The).

Alterations in SPPL2A activity have been proposed as a therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders, as its inhibition could modulate B cell activity, similar to treatments like rituximab (Schneppenheim2012The).

## Interactions
SPPL2A is an intramembrane protease that interacts with several substrates, playing a crucial role in immune system regulation. One of its primary interactions is with CD74, the invariant chain of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). SPPL2A cleaves the CD74 N-terminal fragment (NTF), which is essential for proper B cell maturation. The accumulation of CD74 NTF in SPPL2A-deficient cells leads to impaired B cell development and altered endosomal trafficking (Schneppenheim2012The).

SPPL2A also interacts with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and Fas ligand (FasL), cleaving these substrates to release their intracellular domains (ICDs). The TNFα ICD can stimulate interleukin 12 (IL-12) expression in dendritic cells, while the FasL ICD is involved in reverse signaling that reduces activation-induced proliferation in B and T cells, potentially preventing immune system hyperactivation (Papadopoulou2020Signaling).

SPPL2A's role extends to the cleavage of SNARE proteins, which are crucial for vesicular transport, indicating its involvement in subcellular trafficking processes (Papadopoulou2020Signaling). These interactions highlight SPPL2A's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and immune regulation.
