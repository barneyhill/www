# KCNH3

## Overview
KCNH3 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 3, also known as Kv12.2, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the ether-à-go-go (KCNH) family of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, where it plays a critical role in modulating neuronal excitability by facilitating the flow of potassium ions across the cell membrane. The Kv12.2 channel is integral to maintaining the electrical stability of neurons, thereby influencing cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Dysregulation of KCNH3 has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, as well as in oncological conditions like ovarian cancer, highlighting its significance in both neurological and pathological contexts (Takahashi2017Neurochemical; KCNH3; Li2020&lt; p&gt; Imbrici2013Major).

## Structure
The KCNH3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the subfamily H. These channels are characterized by their six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with a pore loop between S5 and S6 forming the ion-conducting pathway (Allen2020Genetic). The protein structure includes a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore domain (PD), which are non-domain-swapped, meaning they are adjacent within the same subunit (Codding2020Gating). 

KCNH3 channels contain an intracellular N-terminal region with a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, which is involved in regulating gating features, and a PAS-CAP domain that influences deactivation gating (Codding2020Gating). The C-terminal region includes a C-linker domain and a cyclic nucleotide-binding homology domain (CNBHD), which are crucial for the channel's gating mechanisms (Codding2020Gating). 

The quaternary structure of KCNH3 likely involves a tetrameric assembly, with each subunit contributing to the central pore (Allen2020Genetic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of these channels, although specific modifications for KCNH3 are not detailed in the provided context (Allen2020Genetic).

## Function
The KCNH3 gene encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel that is part of the ether-à-go-go (KCNH) family, primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. This channel plays a crucial role in regulating the electrical excitability of neurons by controlling the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes. The opening of KCNH3 channels allows potassium ions to exit the cell, which helps in repolarizing the membrane potential and decreasing neuronal excitability. This function is essential for maintaining proper neuronal activity and regulating neurotransmission, which is vital for higher brain functions such as learning and memory (Takahashi2017Neurochemical).

In healthy human cells, KCNH3 is involved in cognitive functions, as evidenced by studies in transgenic mice. High levels of KCNH3 expression in the brain are linked to learning impairments, while mice lacking KCNH3 show enhanced cognitive performance, suggesting its significant role in cognitive processes (Takahashi2017Neurochemical). Additionally, KCNH3 is implicated in maintaining normal neuronal function and preventing hyperexcitability, as knockout mice exhibit improved cognitive performance but also signs of persistent neuronal hyperexcitability, such as spontaneous seizures (Vezzali2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The KCNH3 gene, encoding the Kv12.2 potassium channel, is implicated in several neuropsychiatric and oncological conditions due to its role in neuronal excitability and cognitive function. In the context of schizophrenia, KCNH3 dysfunction is linked to cognitive deficits, a core feature of the disorder. Knockout mice studies suggest that KCNH3 may play a role in the executive functioning dysfunction observed in schizophrenia (Imbrici2013Major). ASP2905, a selective inhibitor of KCNH3, has shown potential in ameliorating cognitive impairments and negative symptoms in animal models of schizophrenia, indicating its therapeutic promise (Takahashi2020ASP2905).

In ovarian cancer, KCNH3 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. Silencing KCNH3 in ovarian cancer cell lines reduces proliferation and invasiveness, suggesting its role in cancer progression (KCNH3; Li2020&lt; p&gt).

Mutations in KCNH3 have also been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. A patient with global developmental delay and microcephaly was found to have compound heterozygous variants in KCNH3, indicating a potential link to FOXG1 syndrome pathology (Wang2023Diagnostic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of KCNH3 in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
KCNH3, also known as Kv12.2, interacts with auxiliary proteins KCNE1 and KCNE3, forming a tripartite complex that regulates its function. These interactions are crucial for the modulation of KCNH3's membrane surface expression and activity. In vitro studies have shown that reducing the expression of KCNE1 or KCNE3 increases Kv12.2 currents, while their overexpression suppresses these currents. This suggests that KCNE1 and KCNE3 have an inhibitory effect on Kv12.2 channel activation gating by shifting the voltages for half-maximal activation to more hyperpolarized values (Clancy2009KCNE1).

Co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse brain membranes indicate that KCNE1 and KCNE3 can interact with Kv12.2 simultaneously, supporting the existence of a novel KCNE1-KCNE3-Kv12.2 channel complex. This complex is proposed to regulate the channel's membrane trafficking and activity, highlighting a regulatory role for KCNE1 and KCNE3 in the brain (Abbott2016KCNE1; Clancy2009KCNE1). These interactions do not affect the total protein expression of Kv12.2 but specifically regulate its plasma membrane expression, influencing neuronal excitability in key brain regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Clancy2009KCNE1).
