Binding of growth hormone to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and the activation of an intra- and intercellular signal transduction pathway leading to growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Laron syndrome, also known as the growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS), a disorder characterized by short stature. In humans and rabbits, but not rodents, growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular ligand-binding domain from the mature growth hormone receptor protein. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].", "symbol": "GHR", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1415063"}, "unigene": ["Hs.684632", "Hs.125180", "Hs.688223"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P10912", "TrEMBL": ["A0A087X162", "A0A087X0H5", "E9PCN7", "E7ES05"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Growth hormone receptor"}}
