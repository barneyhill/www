# ARL2

## Overview
ARL2 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2) is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein involved in various cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial function. The ARL2 protein is a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins, characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, which is crucial for its regulatory roles in the cell. Unlike other ARF family members, ARL2 is not N-myristoylated, a feature that may facilitate its import into mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and energy production (Newman2014The; Sharer2002ARL2). ARL2 is also involved in the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton by interacting with tubulin cofactors, thereby influencing microtubule assembly and stability (Nithianantham2015Tubulin). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the adenine nucleotide transporter and phosphodiesterase 6d, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and signaling (HanzalBayer2005Properties; Sharer2002ARL2). Mutations in the ARL2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including ocular and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in human health and disease (Ma2024Arl2; Cai2019Whole‐exome).

## Structure
ARL2 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2) is a small GTP-binding protein with a primary structure consisting of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ARL2 gene. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, which is crucial for its function and membrane binding (Kapoor2015Effect; Sharer2002ARL2). Unlike other ARF family members, ARL2 is not N-myristoylated, which may facilitate its mitochondrial import (Sharer2002ARL2).

The secondary structure of ARL2 includes alpha helices, which are typical of GTPases. The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, with a GTP-binding domain that allows ARL2 to bind GDP or GTP rapidly and with high stoichiometry (Sharer2002ARL2). ARL2 interacts with the adenine nucleotide transporter in mitochondria through its binding partner, BART, indicating a potential quaternary structure (Sharer2002ARL2).

ARL2's interaction with membranes is nucleotide-independent, and its N-terminal helix remains flexible and exposed, allowing for membrane insertion (Kapoor2015Effect). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although it is not N-myristoylated (Sharer2002ARL2). Splice variant isoforms of ARL2 may exist, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
ARL2 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2) is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in several cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial function. In the regulation of microtubule dynamics, ARL2 interacts with tubulin cofactors such as TBCD and TBCE to form a complex that regulates the assembly and maintenance of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. This complex facilitates the binding of αβ-tubulin dimers and the activation of ARL2's GTPase activity, which is essential for microtubule dynamics and the maintenance of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Nithianantham2015Tubulin).

In mitochondria, ARL2 is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology, motility, and ATP levels. It plays a role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by influencing the inner membrane ultrastructure and interacting with proteins such as ELMOD2, which affects mitochondrial morphology and motility. Loss of ARL2 activity leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced ATP levels, highlighting its importance in cellular energy maintenance (Newman2014The).

ARL2 is active in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondria, where it influences various cellular functions and processes (Newman2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL2 gene have been implicated in several ocular and neurological conditions. A specific variant, R15L, has been associated with MRCS syndrome, which includes microcornea, rod-cone dystrophy, cataract, and posterior staphyloma. This mutation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and ATP production, and reduced binding affinity of ARL2 for ARL2BP and HRG4, contributing to the syndrome's pathogenesis (Cai2019Whole‐exome).

ARL2 is also involved in the development and stability of cilia in rod photoreceptor neurons. Mutations such as ARL2-Q70L result in defective outer segment morphogenesis and progressive rod degeneration, highlighting its role in retinal diseases like retinitis pigmentosa (Wright2018ADPRibosylation).

In neurogenesis, ARL2 mutations, including the dominant-negative form T30N and the dominant-active form Q70L, lead to defects in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis, affecting cortical development through microtubule organization (Ma2024Arl2). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ARL2 in various genetic disorders and its potential impact on cellular and developmental processes.

## Interactions
ARL2 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. It forms a trimeric complex with tubulin-specific chaperone D (TBCD) and β-tubulin, which is essential for the tubulin folding pathway and microtubule network maintenance. In this complex, ARL2 binds guanine nucleotides with high affinity, acting as a regulatory GTPase that stabilizes the complex and facilitates the release of the αβ-tubulin heterodimer (Francis2017Nucleotide; Francis2017A).

ARL2 also interacts with Binder of ARL2 (BART), forming a complex that associates with mitochondria and interacts with the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT1) in the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is significant for mitochondrial processes and is regulated by the presence of GTP (Sharer2002ARL2).

In addition, ARL2 interacts with phosphodiesterase 6d (PDEd) in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction stabilizes GTP binding to ARL2 and is specific to ARL2 and ARL3, suggesting a regulatory role for PDEd in the ARL2 GTP binding cycle (HanzalBayer2005Properties). These interactions highlight ARL2's role in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial function.
