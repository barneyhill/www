# SOBP

## Overview
The SOBP gene encodes the sine oculis binding protein homolog, a nuclear zinc finger protein that plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its FCS-type zinc finger domains and proline-rich regions, which facilitate its function as a transcriptional regulator. SOBP is highly expressed in the brain, particularly within the limbic system, and is crucial for synaptogenesis, impacting learning, memory, and affective behavior. It interacts with transcription factors such as SIX1 and EYA1, modulating their activity through a dose-dependent mechanism that influences craniofacial and otic development. Mutations in the SOBP gene have been associated with intellectual disabilities and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and development (Birk2010SOBP; Tavares2021Sobp; Jourdeuil2024Direct).

## Structure
The SOBP protein, also known as Jackson circler protein 1 (JXC1), is encoded by the SOBP gene located on human chromosome 6q21. The protein consists of 873 amino acids and features two FCS-type zinc finger domains and two proline-rich regions, which are important for its function. It contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at residues 9-24 and another putative NLS around residue 750, indicating its role in nuclear processes (Birk2010SOBP).

The SOBP protein is highly conserved across species, particularly in its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its function. A specific mutation, c.1981C>T, introduces a premature stop codon at residue 661, leading to a truncated protein that lacks a proline-rich domain, potential NLS motifs, and an RNA binding region, significantly affecting its function (Birk2010SOBP).

Bioinformatics analyses have predicted RNA binding motifs within the SOBP protein, although no DNA binding motifs have been identified (Birk2010SOBP). The protein's structure and motifs suggest its involvement in transcriptional regulation, as it interacts with other proteins such as SIX1 and EYA1, modulating their transcriptional activity (Jourdeuil2024Direct).

## Function
The SOBP gene encodes a nuclear zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in the limbic system, which is involved in learning, memory, and affective behavior. SOBP is crucial during synaptogenesis, a critical period for neural-circuit formation, suggesting its importance in maintaining normal cognitive functions (Birk2010SOBP). The protein contains two FCS-type zinc fingers and two proline-rich regions, along with a nuclear localization signal and RNA binding motifs, indicating its involvement in gene expression regulation within the nucleus (Birk2010SOBP).

SOBP interacts with the SIX1 and EYA1 proteins, influencing their localization and transcriptional activity. At lower levels, SOBP stabilizes the interaction between SIX1 and EYA1, facilitating EYA1's translocation to the nucleus. At higher levels, it disrupts this interaction, translocating EYA1 to the cytosol and repressing SIX1 transcriptional activity. This dual action suggests a feedback loop mechanism where SOBP levels modulate SIX1 activity, which is crucial for craniofacial development and other developmental processes (Jourdeuil2024Direct). SOBP's expression in various tissues indicates its broad functional role in healthy human cells (Birk2010SOBP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOBP gene have been linked to both syndromic and nonsyndromic intellectual disabilities. A specific homozygous mutation, a C>T change at nucleotide 1981 of exon 6, results in an early stop codon, truncating the protein and potentially affecting its function. This mutation is associated with intellectual disability and segregates with the disease in affected individuals, but is absent in control chromosomes (Birk2010SOBP). The SOBP gene is also implicated in MRAMS syndrome, characterized by mental retardation, anterior maxillary protrusion, and strabismus (Podolska2017Functional).

In mice, mutations in SOBP lead to erratic behavior and hearing issues, suggesting a role in synaptic processes and cochlear development. These mutations may affect synaptic vesicle traffic and neuron projection, contributing to cognitive deficits (Birk2010SOBP). SOBP is also involved in craniofacial development, interacting with the SIX1 and EYA1 transcriptional complex. Disruptions in SOBP expression or function could potentially affect craniofacial development, as seen in conditions like branchio-oto-renal syndrome, where SOBP acts as a co-repressor of SIX1 (Jourdeuil2024Direct). Additionally, SOBP mutations are linked to mild hearing loss and vestibular-mediated circling behavior in mice (Jourdeuil2024Direct).

## Interactions
SOBP (sine oculis binding protein homolog) is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in modulating transcriptional activity. SOBP is known to bind to the transcription factor SIX1 and its co-activator EYA1, forming a complex that influences gene expression during craniofacial and otic development. SOBP acts as a co-repressor of the SIX1+EYA1 complex, reducing its transcriptional activation through a dose-dependent competition mechanism. High levels of SOBP can disrupt the interaction between SIX1 and EYA1, leading to the translocation of EYA1 from the nucleus to the cytosol, thereby repressing transcriptional activity (Tavares2021Sobp; Jourdeuil2024Direct).

SOBP lacks DNA binding domains and relies on its interactions with transcription factors like SIX1 and EYA1 to exert its regulatory effects. It contains FCS zinc finger domains and SUMO interacting motifs, which may contribute to its repressive activity (Tavares2021Sobp). SOBP is also involved in the regulation of embryonic ectodermal domains, influencing the balance between neural and epidermal gene expression, a function that appears to be independent of its interaction with SIX1 (Tavares2021Sobp). These interactions highlight SOBP's role in complex regulatory networks essential for proper developmental processes.
