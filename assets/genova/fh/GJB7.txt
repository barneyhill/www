# GJB7

## Overview
The GJB7 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 7, also known as connexin 25, which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral components of gap junctions, which facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Connexins play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue integrity. The GJB7 gene, through its encoded protein, is involved in various physiological processes, and its dysregulation has been linked to pathological conditions, including certain types of cancer. Mutations in GJB7 can disrupt normal gap junction function, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Son2020Tight; Kutova2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJB7 gene, which encodes connexin 25, have been implicated in certain cancers, particularly gastric and colorectal malignancies. Frameshift mutations in GJB7 are present in a subset of colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), occurring in approximately 1% of such cases. These mutations may contribute to tumorigenesis by disrupting the normal functions of gap junctions, which are crucial for cellular communication and maintaining structural integrity (Son2020Tight). Alterations in connexin regulation, including those involving GJB7, can disrupt normal tissue environments, potentially enhancing cell motility and contributing to cancer progression (Kutova2023The).

The precise role of GJB7 mutations in carcinogenesis requires further study, as the mechanisms by which they contribute to cancer remain unclear (Kutova2023The). Despite the association of connexin mutations with certain tumors, the exact pathways and interactions leading to cancer development and progression are not fully understood. The gene's involvement in cancer highlights the importance of connexins in maintaining tissue homeostasis and the potential consequences of their dysregulation (Kutova2023The).
