# IQCA1

## Overview
IQCA1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as IQ motif containing with AAA domain 1. This protein is characterized by the presence of an IQ motif, which is a short sequence that typically binds to calmodulin or other EF-hand proteins, and an AAA domain, which is associated with ATPase activity. The IQCA1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and molecular motor activity, due to its ATPase function. It plays a role in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels and is implicated in pathways that influence cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The gene and its encoded protein have been studied for their potential involvement in certain diseases, although the precise mechanisms and clinical implications are still under investigation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
