# PCP2

## Overview
PCP2, or Purkinje cell protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the modulation of G-protein signaling pathways, primarily within the central nervous system. The protein, also referred to as Purkinje cell protein 2, is characterized by the presence of GoLoco motifs, which confer guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity. This activity is crucial for its interaction with G-protein alpha subunits, particularly those of the Gαi family, thereby influencing neurotransmission and neuronal differentiation (Willard2006Gprotein). The protein is predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and retinal ON bipolar cells, where it plays a significant role in synaptic activity and signal transduction (Guan2005Purkinje). Through its regulatory functions, PCP2 is implicated in various receptor-independent signaling pathways, which are essential for processes such as mitotic spindle force generation and asymmetric cell division (Willard2006Gprotein).

## Structure
PCP2, also known as Purkinje cell protein 2, is a protein that contains GoLoco motifs, which are involved in guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity. These motifs interact with G-protein alpha subunits, particularly Gαi subunits, and inhibit GDP release (Willard2006Gprotein). The protein has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the longest being a 120 amino acid protein containing two predicted GoLoco motifs (Willard2006Gprotein). 

The primary structure of PCP2 includes a high proportion of glycine and proline residues, which contribute to an uncoiled, linear conformation (Zhang2002Conservation). The secondary structure details are not explicitly provided, but the presence of GoLoco motifs suggests specific folding patterns necessary for G-protein interaction. 

PCP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at several consensus sites, with additional unique phosphorylation sites and two myristoylation sites in the human protein not found in rodents (Zhang2002Conservation). These modifications may influence its function and localization. The protein's role in G-protein signaling is crucial for its function in Purkinje cells, where it modulates synaptic activity and neuronal differentiation (Guan2005Purkinje).

## Function
PCP2, also known as Purkinje cell protein-2, is a GoLoco motif-containing protein that plays a significant role in modulating G-protein signaling pathways in neurons, particularly in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and retinal ON bipolar cells. The protein functions as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), interacting with Gα i subunits, including Gα i1, Gα i2, and Gα i3, to prevent the spontaneous release of GDP, thereby modulating G-protein signaling (Willard2006Gprotein). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of neurotransmission and is involved in receptor-independent signaling pathways, such as those controlling mitotic spindle force generation, which are important for asymmetric cell division and neuronal development (Willard2006Gprotein).

PCP2 also influences the activity of ion channels, such as Cav2.1 calcium channels, by modulating receptor-mediated inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. This modulation can either enhance or dampen the inhibition of these channels, depending on the concentration of PCP2 and the level of receptor activity, thus affecting calcium influx in neurons (KinoshitaKawada2004A). Despite the absence of a clear phenotype in PCP2-deficient mice, the protein is believed to play a role in cerebellar neurotransmission, potentially influencing the development and function of Purkinje cells (Willard2006Gprotein).

## Interactions
Purkinje cell protein 2 (PCP2) is known to interact with G-protein alpha subunits, particularly those from the Gα i/o family. PCP2 contains GoLoco motifs, which are involved in its function as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). These motifs allow PCP2 to interact with Gα i subunits, such as Gα i1, Gα i2, and Gα i3, with varying affinities. PCP2 shows a higher affinity for Gα i1 compared to Gα o, indicating a selective interaction with Gα i subunits (Willard2006Gprotein).

In the cerebellum, PCP2 has been shown to associate with Gα o and Gα i2 subunits. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate that PCP2 and these G-protein subunits are colocalized in the distal dendritic branches and spines of Purkinje cells. This suggests a role for PCP2 in modulating synaptic activity and signal transduction in these neurons (Redd2002Association).

PCP2's interaction with G-protein subunits is thought to influence intracellular signaling pathways, potentially affecting neuronal differentiation and neurotransmission. The protein's ability to modulate G-protein signaling highlights its importance in the regulation of neuronal functions (Guan2005Purkinje).
