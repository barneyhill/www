# HNRNPH3

## Overview
HNRNPH3 is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H3, a member of the hnRNP family involved in RNA processing. The hnRNP H3 protein is part of the H/F subfamily and is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which facilitate binding to RNA sequences. Notably, hnRNP H3 lacks the RRM1 domain, which distinguishes it from its paralogs hnRNP H1 and hnRNP F, and contributes to its reduced potency in splicing regulation (Mauger2008hnRNP). Despite this, hnRNP H3 remains active in the nucleus, playing a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression through alternative splicing. The protein is also involved in mRNA transport and stability, contributing to cellular homeostasis. HNRNPH3's interactions, particularly with the ZNF198 protein, suggest potential implications in myeloproliferative diseases, although these interactions require further validation (Kasyapa2005Mass).

## Structure
The hnRNP H3 protein is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, specifically the H/F subfamily. It is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for binding to RNA sequences, particularly at DGGGD motifs. The protein contains three annotated RRMs, but notably, RRM1 is absent in hnRNP H3. The conserved residues W20 and Y82 in RRM1 and F120 and Y180 in RRM2 are known to directly contact RNA (Mauger2008hnRNP). The hnRNP H3 protein is the most divergent member of its family, sharing 48% identity with hnRNP H1, but 71% identity in the region spanning the last two RRMs (Mauger2008hnRNP).

HnRNP H3 also contains a glycine-rich region near the carboxy terminus, which may facilitate homo- or heterodimerization. This glycine-rich domain is similar to that found in hnRNP A1, another splicing silencer protein (Mauger2008hnRNP). The protein exists in two alternatively spliced isoforms, hnRNP H3a and hnRNP H3b, which arise from alternative splicing events (Mauger2008hnRNP). The hnRNPs F/H group, which includes hnRNP H3, is unique for its specificity to poly(G) tracts, and their RNA-binding domains are described as qRRMs, differing from standard RRMs (Han2010Functional).

## Function
HNRNPH3 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H3) is involved in RNA processing, including splicing regulation, transport, and stability. It functions as part of the hnRNP complex, which binds to pre-mRNA in the nucleus, influencing mRNA maturation and export. HNRNPH3 plays a role in splicing regulation, although it is less potent than its paralogs hnRNP H1 and hnRNP F. This reduced silencing ability is attributed to the absence of the RRM1 domain, which is present in hnRNP H1 and hnRNP F (Mauger2008hnRNP). Despite its lower potency, HNRNPH3 is still active in the nucleus and contributes to the regulation of gene expression by modulating alternative splicing events. The protein's activity in the nucleus is crucial for maintaining the balance of mRNA splicing, which is essential for proper cellular function and organismal development. While specific organismal outcomes of HNRNPH3's function in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context, its involvement in RNA processing suggests a significant role in gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis.

## Interactions
HNRNPH3 is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, which are involved in mRNA processing and transport. It has been identified as a potential interacting partner of the ZNF198 protein, which is associated with rearrangements in myeloproliferative disease. This interaction was suggested through mass spectrometry analysis, although it was not confirmed by immunoprecipitation due to the lack of suitable antibodies for HNRNPH3 (Kasyapa2005Mass). HNRNPH3 is known to participate in splicing and is a component of the spliceosome, a complex involved in the removal of introns during RNA splicing (Kasyapa2005Mass).

HNRNPH3 has been shown to have a reduced ability to silence exon IIIc of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene compared to other hnRNP family members like hnRNP H1 and hnRNP F. This reduced silencing ability is attributed to the absence of the RRM1 domain in HNRNPH3, which is crucial for the full silencing activity observed in hnRNP H1 and hnRNP F (Mauger2008hnRNP). HNRNPH3's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, particularly in the context of splicing regulation, remain less well-characterized compared to its hnRNP counterparts.
