# PRDX4

## Overview
PRDX4 is a gene that encodes the protein peroxiredoxin 4, a member of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family, which functions primarily as an antioxidant enzyme. This protein is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells, where it plays a critical role in oxidative protein folding and the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Zito2013PRDX4). As a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase, peroxiredoxin 4 catalyzes the reduction of peroxides, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular redox balance (Fujii2015Physiological). The protein's structural features, including its ability to form homodimers and homodecamers, facilitate its function in forming disulfide bonds in nascent proteins, which is essential for proper protein folding and secretion (Tavender2008Peroxiredoxin; Fujii2015Physiological). PRDX4's involvement in various cellular processes and its interactions with other proteins underscore its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function, with significant implications in health and disease (Tavender2010Peroxiredoxin).

## Structure
PRDX4 (peroxiredoxin 4) is a member of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family, characterized by its thioredoxin domain and typical thioredoxin fold, which includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Fujii2015Physiological). The protein functions as a homodimer, with subunits assembling in a head-to-tail manner, forming disulfide links during catalytic peroxidase activity. These dimers are organized into homodecamers, each consisting of five dimeric units, creating a toroidal structure (Tavender2008Peroxiredoxin; Fujii2015Physiological).

PRDX4 contains a unique N-terminal region following a signal peptide, which is cleavable and responsible for its translocation across the ER membrane into the luminal space (Fujii2015Physiological). This N-terminal extension includes unique cysteine residues that form covalent links between homodimeric units, distinguishing PRDX4 from other peroxiredoxins like PRDX1 and PRDX2 (Fujii2015Physiological).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including the formation of disulfide bonds during its catalytic cycle. These bonds are reduced by thioredoxin (Trx), allowing PRDX4 to function as a Trx-dependent peroxidase (Fujii2015Physiological). PRDX4's structure and modifications enable it to play a crucial role in oxidative protein folding and hydrogen peroxide detoxification within the endoplasmic reticulum (Zito2013PRDX4).

## Function
Peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) is a crucial antioxidant enzyme localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells, where it plays a significant role in oxidative protein folding and the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Zito2013PRDX4; Tavender2010Peroxiredoxin). PRDX4 is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in nascent proteins by utilizing H2O2 produced during the oxidative folding process mediated by ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero1) (Fujii2015Physiological; Tavender2010Recycling). This activity is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular redox balance (Fujii2015Physiological).

PRDX4 functions as a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase, catalyzing the reduction of peroxides and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Fujii2015Physiological). It forms oligomeric complexes in the ER, which are stabilized by non-catalytic disulfide bonds, suggesting a role beyond simple peroxide elimination (Tavender2008Peroxiredoxin). PRDX4's activity is crucial in tissues with high secretory activity, such as the pancreas, where it helps manage oxidative stress and supports proper protein secretion (Fujii2015Physiological).

The enzyme's ability to scavenge low concentrations of H2O2 efficiently is due to its high reactivity, making it a key player in cellular defense against oxidative damage (Zito2013PRDX4). PRDX4's role in oxidative protein folding and its protective function against ER stress-induced cell death highlight its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Tavender2010Peroxiredoxin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in PRDX4 expression have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In gastric cancer, PRDX4 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including higher rates of undifferentiated cancer types, advanced stages, and increased cancer-related mortality and recurrence. Patients with high PRDX4 expression have a 1.8-fold higher risk of cancer-related death, and PRDX4 knockdown in cell lines reduces proliferation, invasion, and migration, suggesting its role in promoting metastasis (Park2020PRDX4).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), PRDX4 is significantly correlated with tumor stage and prognosis. High PRDX4 expression is linked to increased proliferation and invasion, while its knockdown promotes apoptosis and stemness, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2023Expression).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), PRDX4 overexpression contributes to radio-resistance and tumor growth. Knocking down PRDX4 increases sensitivity to radiation and reduces tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kim2012Suppression).

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), PRDX4 expression is significantly reduced, which may affect granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor signaling, although mutations in PRDX4 are rare (Palande2011The).

## Interactions
PRDX4 (peroxiredoxin 4) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), PRDX4 interacts with members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, including PDI, P5, and ERp46. These interactions facilitate the reduction of PRDX4, allowing it to continue its role in oxidative protein folding by metabolizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and forming disulfide bonds (Tavender2010Recycling).

PRDX4 also interacts with caspase-1, a key component of the inflammasome, through disulfide bonds involving the cysteine residue C397 of caspase-1. This interaction is essential for forming a high-molecular-weight complex that inhibits caspase-1 activity, thereby modulating inflammasome-mediated signaling (Lipinski2019Prdx4). The interaction between PRDX4 and caspase-1 is crucial for regulating the release of IL-1b, a cytokine involved in inflammatory responses (Lipinski2019Prdx4).

In the context of neurogenesis, PRDX4 acts as a compartment-specific H2O2 sensor that regulates the surface expression of GDE2 by oxidizing specific cysteine residues, thereby inhibiting GDE2's neurogenic function (Yan2015Prdx4). These interactions highlight PRDX4's role in maintaining cellular redox balance and modulating various signaling pathways.
