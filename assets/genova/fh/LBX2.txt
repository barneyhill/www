# LBX2

## Overview
The LBX2 gene encodes the ladybird homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various developmental processes and disease mechanisms. As a member of the homeobox gene family, LBX2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly influencing the migration and differentiation of neural crest cells. The protein encoded by LBX2 is characterized by its ability to interact with other proteins and nucleic acids, modulating key signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Lu2014Tissuespecific). LBX2's involvement in complex regulatory feedback mechanisms, including interactions with long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, underscores its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as atrial septal defects and various cancers (Wang2018Identification; Yang2019LBX2AS1miR219a23pFUSLBX2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LBX2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly atrial septal defect (ASD) and certain cancers. In the context of ASD, LBX2 has been identified as a novel causal gene. Mutations such as p.K135E and p.A167P in LBX2 have been associated with ASD, affecting cardiac development by disrupting the migration of cardiac neural crest cells and altering cardiac myocyte structure (Wang2018Identification). These mutations lead to defects in cardiac neural crest cell migration, which are crucial for heart development, potentially resulting in atrial septal malformations (Wang2018Identification).

In cancer, alterations in the expression of LBX2 and its associated long non-coding RNA, LBX2-AS1, have been linked to gastric and ovarian cancers. LBX2-AS1 is upregulated in gastric cancer, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through a feedback loop involving miR-219a-2-3p and FUS (Yang2019LBX2AS1miR219a23pFUSLBX2). In ovarian cancer, LBX2-AS1 acts as an oncogene by sponging miR-4784, which upregulates KDM5C expression, contributing to cancer progression (Gu2020ELK1). These findings suggest that LBX2 and its regulatory networks play significant roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

## Interactions
LBX2, a transcription factor, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids that influence its regulatory functions. It interacts with the WD domain of the TCF co-repressor Groucho (Gro), specifically Gro2, through its engrailed homology 1 (eh1) motif. This interaction is crucial for modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by preventing the binding of Gro2 to TCF7L1, thereby attenuating Gro2's co-repressor activity and promoting the expression of Wnt target genes (Lu2014Tissuespecific).

In the context of gastric cancer, LBX2 is involved in a feedback loop with the long non-coding RNA LBX2-AS1 and the RNA-binding protein FUS. LBX2-AS1 positively regulates LBX2 by stabilizing its mRNA through FUS, which binds to LBX2 mRNA. This interaction is crucial for maintaining LBX2 mRNA and protein levels, as FUS silencing leads to LBX2 mRNA degradation. LBX2 also transcriptionally regulates LBX2-AS1, indicating a complex regulatory feedback mechanism (Yang2019LBX2AS1miR219a23pFUSLBX2).

These interactions highlight LBX2's role in modulating key signaling pathways and its involvement in regulatory networks that influence cellular processes and development.
