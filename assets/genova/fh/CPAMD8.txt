# CPAMD8

## Overview
The CPAMD8 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the complement 3/α2-macroglobulin family, which is involved in innate immunity and extracellular matrix remodeling. The protein, known as C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain containing 8, is characterized by its structural domains, including a signal peptide, thioester motif, and a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor/follistatin-like domain. These features suggest its role as a proteinase inhibitor, contributing to its function in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling, particularly in the ocular anterior segment (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8; Li2004Identification). CPAMD8 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, indicating its evolutionary importance, and is implicated in various ocular conditions, including congenital glaucoma, due to its involvement in extracellular matrix abnormalities (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8; Li2004Identification).

## Structure
The CPAMD8 protein is a member of the complement 3/α2-macroglobulin family and is composed of 1885 amino acids. It features several distinct domains, including a signal peptide at the N-terminus, a thioester motif, and a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor/follistatin-like domain at the C-terminus (Li2004Identification). The protein also contains a bait region, an anaphylatoxin domain, and a netrin domain (Li2004Identification). 

CPAMD8 undergoes posttranslational processing, resulting in two fragments of approximately 70 kDa and 130 kDa, which are generated at the RXXR furin cleavage site (Li2004Identification). The protein is not extensively glycosylated compared to other family members (Li2004Identification). 

The Kazal domain of CPAMD8 binds to heparin, suggesting its involvement in membrane association through ionic interactions (Li2004Identification). CPAMD8 is highly conserved across vertebrate species, indicating its evolutionary significance (Li2004Identification). The protein is associated with extracellular matrix abnormalities and is implicated in various ocular conditions, including congenital glaucoma (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8). 

Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CPAMD8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CPAMD8 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the complement 3/α2-macroglobulin family, which is involved in innate immunity and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. This protein is structurally related to A2M proteins, known for their broad-spectrum proteinase inhibitor activity, suggesting that CPAMD8 may also function as a proteinase inhibitor (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8; Li2004Identification). CPAMD8 is a secreted protein that plays a role in the regulation of ECM remodeling, particularly in the ocular anterior segment, where it is synthesized and secreted by cells such as the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and corneal epithelium (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8).

The protein is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling, potentially acting through a paracrine mechanism affecting the physiology of the trabecular meshwork (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8). CPAMD8 is also associated with immune-related functions, as it is up-regulated in response to cytokines like IL-1h and IL-6, indicating a role in immune responses and damage control (Li2004Identification). The protein's C-terminal Kazal domain may have protease inhibitory activity, and it binds to heparin, suggesting interactions with cell surface heparin-like molecules and proteoglycans in the ECM (Li2004Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPAMD8 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, primarily affecting the anterior segment of the eye. Biallelic variants in CPAMD8 have been linked to congenital glaucoma and anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD), with affected individuals often exhibiting features such as buphthalmos, high myopia, and iris stromal hypoplasia (Siggs2018Congenital). These conditions are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and are characterized by a range of ocular anomalies, including corectopia, ectropion uveae, and lens subluxation (Cheong2016Mutations).

CPAMD8 mutations are also implicated in childhood and juvenile open-angle glaucoma, with a significant percentage of cases in certain populations attributed to these genetic alterations (Siggs2020Biallelic). The gene's role in ocular development is further supported by its expression in the anterior segment of the eye, particularly in the lens, iris, and cornea (Cheong2016Mutations).

In addition to glaucoma, CPAMD8 mutations have been associated with pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma, suggesting a broader impact on ocular health (Tan2022Compound). The gene's involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling and its expression in neural crest-derived tissues highlight its significance in maintaining normal eye structure and function (BonetFernández2020CPAMD8).
