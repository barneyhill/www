# IL24

## Overview
Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a gene that encodes a cytokine protein belonging to the IL-10 family, known for its diverse roles in immune regulation and tumor suppression. The IL24 gene is responsible for producing the IL-24 protein, which is characterized by a 4-helix bundle structure and interacts with specific receptor complexes, namely IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2, to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Lubkowski2018Crystal; Pham2023Regulation). This cytokine is expressed in various immune and non-immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages, and is involved in modulating immune responses, promoting anti-inflammatory effects, and exerting tumor-suppressive activities (Zhong2022Interleukin24). IL-24's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory conditions, where it can either suppress tumor growth or contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, depending on the context (Vu2021The; Persaud2016Mechanism). Despite its known functions, further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which IL-24 influences these diverse biological processes (Zhong2022Interleukin24).

## Structure
The IL-24 protein is encoded by the IL24 gene and consists of 206 amino acids, with a signal sequence comprising the first 51 residues. The mature form of IL-24 is 155 amino acids long after the signal peptide is cleaved (Lubkowski2018Crystal). The protein's secondary structure is characterized by a 4-helix bundle fold, although it contains six helices in total. The α1 helix extends from Pro66 to Asp84, followed by α2 from Gln94 to Gln98, α3 from Glu104 to Gln126, α4 from Arg132 to Gln150, α5 from Ser161 to Leu180, and α6 from Glu183 to Phe203 (Lubkowski2018Crystal). The N-terminal residues form a β hairpin, similar to IL-20 (Lubkowski2018Crystal).

IL-24's tertiary structure involves interactions with its receptors, forming a ternary complex with IL-22R1 and IL-20R2. The quaternary structure of IL-24 is noted for its ability to form signaling complexes with these receptors, activating pathways such as Tyk2/Jak1→STAT1/STAT3 (Lubkowski2018Crystal). IL-24 is glycosylated, with N-glycosylation occurring at up to three sites, which can affect its molecular weight and bioavailability (Lubkowski2018Crystal). The protein has two cysteine residues, Cys59 and Cys106, which do not form a disulfide bond in the current structure but may under certain conditions (Lubkowski2018Crystal). IL-24 can exist as a monomer, but potential dimerization through disulfide bonds has been suggested (Trivella2010Structure).

## Function
Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a cytokine that plays a multifaceted role in immune regulation and inflammation. It is part of the IL-10 family and is expressed by both immune and non-immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages (Zhong2022Interleukin24). IL-24 functions through two receptor complexes, IL-20RA/IL-20RB and IL-22RA1/IL-20RB, and its signaling is mediated by the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways, particularly involving STAT1 and STAT3 (Zhong2022Interleukin24).

In T cells, IL-24 is produced by activated T helper 2 (Th2) cells and regulates their effector functions. It suppresses other T cell lineages, such as Th1 and Th17 cells, by limiting cytokine expression like IFN-γ and IL-17A (Zhong2022Interleukin24). In macrophages, IL-24 works with IL-4 to induce anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and acts as a chemoattractant, recruiting myeloid cells and inducing monocyte migration (Zhong2022Interleukin24).

IL-24 is also known for its tumor-suppressive effects, including arresting tumor cell growth and inducing apoptosis and autophagy, which can be mediated through the p38 MAPK pathway in addition to the JAK/STAT pathway (Zhong2022Interleukin24). Despite its known roles, the precise mechanisms and involvement of IL-24 in human diseases are not fully characterized (Zhong2022Interleukin24).

## Clinical Significance
Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in immune modulation and tumor suppression. Alterations in IL-24 expression are associated with cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, IL-24 acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. It is involved in inhibiting angiogenesis and enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy, making it a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Sahoo2012Molecular; Persaud2016Mechanism). In lung adenocarcinoma, the long non-coding RNA LINC00152 represses IL-24 expression, promoting tumor growth, suggesting that IL-24 downregulation contributes to cancer progression (Chen2017Long).

In autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, IL-24 is overexpressed in conditions like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, where it contributes to inflammation and tissue damage (Vu2021The; Persaud2016Mechanism). In psoriasis, IL-24 is linked to epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation, while in rheumatoid arthritis, it is associated with joint inflammation (Otkjaer2010The). In atopic dermatitis, IL-24 affects skin barrier function and inflammation, exacerbating the disease (Vu2021The). These findings highlight IL-24's clinical significance in various pathological states.

## Interactions
Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a cytokine that interacts with specific receptors to mediate its biological effects. IL-24 primarily binds to two receptor complexes: IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2. These interactions activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is crucial for its function in immune responses and apoptosis induction in cancer cells (Zheng2006Human; Pham2023Regulation).

The interaction between IL-24 and its receptors involves several types of molecular contacts. The IL-24/IL-20R2 interface is characterized by an area of approximately 900 Å², stabilized by 13 hydrogen bonds, 2 potential salt bridges, and various polar, water-mediated, and hydrophobic contacts. Key residues involved in these interactions include Y204 in IL-24 and Y70 and Y74 in IL-20R2, which form hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions essential for complex formation (Lubkowski2018Crystal; Pham2023Regulation).

The crystal structure of the IL-24 complex with IL-22R1 and IL-20R2 reveals that IL-20R2 may act as the high-affinity receptor due to slightly stronger binding interactions compared to IL-22R1. This is supported by the comparable binding energies and the specific hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions observed in the complex (Lubkowski2018Crystal).
