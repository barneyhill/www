# IRGQ

## Overview
The IRGQ gene encodes the protein immunity related GTPase Q, which is part of the immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) family. These proteins are involved in the immune response, particularly in the defense against intracellular pathogens. Immunity related GTPase Q is characterized by its GTPase activity, which is crucial for its role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and autophagy. The IRGQ gene is expressed in various tissues, and its protein product is implicated in modulating immune responses, although the precise mechanisms remain under investigation. Understanding the function and regulation of IRGQ is important for elucidating its role in immune system dynamics and its potential implications in disease contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
