# STARD9

## Overview
STARD9 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 9, which is a large kinesin-related protein involved in cell division. The protein, also known as KIF16A, is categorized as a mitotic kinesin and plays a critical role in maintaining pericentriolar material cohesion during mitosis, which is essential for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. It is characterized by several domains, including a kinesin motor domain, a forkhead-associated (FHA) phosphoprotein binding domain, and a StAR-related lipid-transfer (START) domain, which contribute to its functions in intracellular lipid transport and microtubule dynamics. The regulation of STARD9 involves phosphorylation and ubiquitination, with interactions involving mitotic kinases such as Plk1 and the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. Dysregulation of STARD9 has been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular and pathological processes (Senese2015A; Torres2012STARD9Kif16a; Okamoto2017A).

## Structure
The STARD9 protein, encoded by the STARD9 gene, is a large kinesin-related protein involved in cell division. It is approximately 517 kDa in size and consists of several domains, including an N-terminal kinesin motor domain, a forkhead-associated (FHA) phosphoprotein binding domain, and a C-terminal StAR-related lipid-transfer (START) domain (Okamoto2017A; Torres2012STARD9Kif16a). The kinesin motor domain is crucial for its role in mitosis, particularly in maintaining pericentriolar material cohesion during bipolar spindle assembly (Senese2015A).

A unique feature of the STARD9 motor domain is an insertion in loop 12, which is 26 amino acids long and contains binding sites for the Plk1 polo-box domain and a DSGXXS β-TrCP binding motif. This insertion is heavily phosphorylated, suggesting regulation by phosphorylation and ubiquitination (Senese2015A). The START domain, common in the START protein family, adopts a 'helix-grip' fold with a central antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helices, forming an inner tunnel that accommodates lipid molecules (Alpy2005Give; Alpy2014START).

STARD9 is conserved among vertebrates, indicating its specialized functions in higher organisms (Torres2012STARD9Kif16a). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the skin, heart, and brain (Okamoto2017A).

## Function
STARD9, also known as KIF16A, is a mitotic kinesin that plays a crucial role in cell division by maintaining pericentriolar material cohesion during early mitosis, which is essential for proper spindle assembly and chromosome segregation (Senese2015A; Torres2012STARD9Kif16a). It is part of the kinesin-3 family and is involved in stabilizing the pericentriolar material under microtubule-mediated tension (Senese2015A). STARD9 is specifically enriched at the daughter centriole and is necessary for bipolar spindle assembly, ensuring the correct formation of mitotic spindles (Okamoto2017A; Torres2012STARD9Kif16a).

The protein contains several domains, including a kinesin motor domain, an FHA phosphoprotein binding domain, and a START lipid/sterol binding domain, which contribute to its function in intracellular lipid transport and microtubule dynamics (Okamoto2017A; Halama2006Identification). STARD9's activity is regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, with mitotic kinases such as Plk1 targeting it for degradation, which is crucial for its role in mitotic spindle assembly (Senese2015A). Proper regulation of STARD9 is essential for maintaining normal cell division processes, and its dysfunction can lead to mitotic defects and associated disorders (Okamoto2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STARD9 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A novel genetic syndrome associated with a mutation in STARD9 is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, acquired microcephaly, and blindness. This syndrome results from a homozygous single-nucleotide deletion in the STARD9 gene, leading to a premature stop codon and subsequent mitotic defects, such as multipolar spindle formation and centrosome amplification (Okamoto2017A).

In cancer, STARD9 is implicated in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The gene is upregulated in RCC tissues, and its expression is modulated by the long noncoding RNA SNHG16, which promotes RCC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by upregulating STARD9 expression (Cheng2021SNHG16). Additionally, STARD9 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where higher mRNA levels are associated with favorable overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2023STARD1214).

STARD9 has also been linked to specific language impairment (SLI), with rare variants identified in individuals with the condition. These findings suggest a potential role for STARD9 in neurodevelopmental disorders, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Chen2017Nextgeneration).

## Interactions
STARD9, also known as KIF16A, is a mitotic kinesin that interacts with several proteins to regulate its function during cell division. One of the key interactions is with the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets STARD9 for degradation. This interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation of specific serine residues within the STARD9 motor domain, particularly serines 312 and 317, which are crucial for binding to β-TrCP (Senese2015A). The phosphorylation of these residues forms a phosphodegron motif that is recognized by β-TrCP, facilitating ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of STARD9 (Senese2015A).

STARD9 also interacts with the kinase Plk1, which phosphorylates it at specific sites, including serine 312. This phosphorylation is essential for the regulation of STARD9's stability and degradation during mitosis (Senese2015A). The interaction with Plk1 and β-TrCP highlights a regulatory mechanism involving phosphorylation and ubiquitination that controls STARD9 levels during cell division.

Additionally, STARD9 is involved in interactions at the centrosome, which are important for its role in spindle assembly and mitotic progression. These interactions are suggested to involve centrosomal components, although specific partners at the centrosome are not fully detailed (Senese2015A).
