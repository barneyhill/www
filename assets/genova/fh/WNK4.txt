# WNK4

## Overview
WNK4 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of ion transport and blood pressure, primarily within the kidney. The protein encoded by WNK4 is characterized by a unique kinase domain that lacks a conserved lysine residue, distinguishing it from other kinases (Jonniya2020A). Functionally, WNK4 plays a critical role in modulating the activity of various ion transporters and channels, including the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), thereby influencing electrolyte balance and blood pressure (Peng2007WNK4mediated; Kahle2004WNK4). Mutations in the WNK4 gene are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a condition characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia, underscoring its clinical significance (Wilson2001Human; Yang2007Molecular).

## Structure
WNK4 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4) is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in regulating ion transport and blood pressure. Its primary structure includes a kinase domain that notably lacks a conserved lysine, which is typical in other kinases (Jonniya2020A). The secondary structure of WNK4 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Jonniya2020A).

The tertiary structure of WNK4 involves a catalytic domain and regulatory regions, which are crucial for its kinase activity. The protein can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure that may play a role in its regulatory functions (Jonniya2020A). WNK4 contains specific domains, such as the kinase domain and an autoinhibitory domain, which are essential for its function and regulation (Jonniya2020A).

Common post-translational modifications of WNK4 include phosphorylation, which significantly impacts its structural dynamics and interaction with inhibitors. Phosphorylation stabilizes certain regions of the protein, affecting its flexibility and binding affinity (Jonniya2020A). Splice variants of WNK4 may alter its regulatory functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Jonniya2020A).

## Function
WNK4 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4) is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport in various epithelial tissues, particularly in the kidney. In healthy human cells, WNK4 is involved in the regulation of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), which are essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure (Peng2007WNK4mediated; Kahle2004WNK4). WNK4 modulates the activity of these transport proteins by altering their abundance at the plasma membrane, affecting the transport of ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl- (Peng2007WNK4mediated).

WNK4 functions as an intracellular chloride sensor, with its activity modulated by intracellular chloride ion concentration. This regulation is important for maintaining sodium and potassium homeostasis (Chen2019WNK4). In the kidney, WNK4 inhibits NCC function through the MAPK ERK1/2 signaling pathway, reducing NCC surface expression and promoting its degradation via a lysosomal pathway (Zhou2012WNK4; Cai2006WNK4). WNK4 also regulates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and the transient receptor potential cation channel, vanilloid subfamily, member 5 (TRPV5), which are involved in sodium and calcium reabsorption, respectively (Peng2007WNK4mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNK4 gene are associated with pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), also known as Gordon syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia. These mutations, such as E562K, D564A, and Q565E, are clustered in a conserved segment of the gene, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism (Wilson2001Human; Yang2007Molecular). The pathogenesis of PHAII is linked to increased function of the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) through the activation of the OSR1/SPAK-NCC phosphorylation cascade, leading to enhanced salt reabsorption and reduced potassium secretion (Yang2007Molecular).

WNK4 mutations also increase paracellular chloride permeability by phosphorylating claudins, which are tight-junction proteins, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Yamauchi2004Diseasecausing). This increased chloride permeability, or "chloride shunt," results in altered transepithelial voltage and contributes to hypertension and hyperkalemia (Yamauchi2004Diseasecausing).

In some cases, WNK4 mutations are linked to hypercalciuria, a condition associated with familial hyperkalemic hypertension. These mutations can affect the interaction between WNK4 and the Na+-Cl- cotransporter, impacting calcium transport (Jiang2007WNK4).

## Interactions
WNK4 (WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 4) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that regulate ion transport in the kidney. WNK4 interacts with the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC), inhibiting its function by reducing its abundance at the plasma membrane. This inhibition is mediated through protein-protein interactions involving the carboxy-terminal domain of WNK4, specifically the carboxy-terminal 222 amino acids, which are essential for this regulatory effect (Yang2005Mechanisms).

WNK4 also interacts with WNK1, another member of the WNK kinase family. WNK1 can suppress the inhibitory effect of WNK4 on NCC, and this suppression requires the amino-terminal kinase domains of both WNK1 and WNK4, indicating that both physical association and catalytic activity are necessary for WNK1's effect (Yang2005Mechanisms).

Additionally, WNK4 interacts with the inwardly rectifying K channel (ROMK), regulating its membrane abundance through clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis. This interaction is kinase-independent and involves a unique acidic motif within WNK4, which is crucial for inhibiting ROMK currents (Murthy2008The; Yang2005Mechanisms). These interactions highlight WNK4's role in complex regulatory mechanisms affecting ion transport.
