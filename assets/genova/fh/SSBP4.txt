# SSBP4

## Overview
SSBP4 (single stranded DNA binding protein 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the stabilization of single-stranded DNA during critical cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair. The protein, categorized as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by preventing errors during DNA synthesis. This function is essential for proper cellular proliferation and overall organismal health. SSBP4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins and potentially participates in multiprotein complexes, influencing protein stability and function. Its involvement in DNA repair processes underscores its significance in preventing genomic instability, which is a key factor in the development of various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions like psoriasis (Saei2021Systemwide; Jeong2023A; Layer2020LDB1).

## Function
SSBP4 (single stranded DNA binding protein 4) plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair processes. It binds to single-stranded DNA, stabilizing it during these processes to ensure accurate DNA synthesis and maintenance. This stabilization is crucial for preventing errors during DNA replication, which can lead to genomic instability. SSBP4 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability, a key factor in cellular proliferation and overall organismal health. By ensuring the integrity of DNA replication and repair, SSBP4 supports the proper functioning of cellular processes and helps prevent the development of diseases associated with genomic instability.

## Clinical Significance
The SSBP4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in DNA replication and repair. Alterations in the expression of SSBP4 have been associated with psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. The gene is part of a sub-cluster located at the genomic locus 19p13.11, which is involved in psoriasis. Down-regulation of SSBP4 may lead to reduced activation of the interleukin 36 receptor antagonist (IL36RA), potentially exacerbating psoriasis symptoms by allowing higher levels of IL-1 and IL-36, which are elevated in psoriasis patients (Jeong2023A).

In the context of cancer, SSBP4 has been included in a 12-gene risk score system for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) prognosis, although its direct association with PAAD was not detailed. The study suggests that SSBP4 might have implications in cancer prognosis due to its role in other cancers (Dou2020Prognostic). While specific clinical significance of SSBP4 mutations in relation to diseases was not directly addressed, its involvement in DNA repair processes suggests a potential role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing cancer development (Ghoussaini2013Inherited).

## Interactions
SSBP4 (Single Stranded DNA Binding Protein 4) is known to participate in various protein interactions, although specific details about its interactions with nucleic acids are not extensively documented. SSBP4 is identified as a substrate of the kinase AKT1, indicating a potential regulatory interaction through phosphorylation under certain conditions (Saei2021Systemwide). In the context of psoriasis, SSBP4 is part of a protein-protein interaction network, where it is located within a sub-cluster associated with different biological functions, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular processes (Jeong2023A). 

While the specific interactions of SSBP4 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is mentioned alongside other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins like SSBP2 and SSBP3, which are known to interact with LDB1, a protein that stabilizes its partners in the LMO2/LDB1 complex involved in leukemia (Layer2020LDB1). This suggests that SSBP4 may also participate in similar multiprotein complexes, potentially influencing protein stability and function. However, direct evidence of SSBP4's interactions within these complexes is not explicitly provided in the available context.
