# TM4SF1

## Overview
TM4SF1, or transmembrane 4 L six family member 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin superfamily, characterized by its four transmembrane domains. The TM4SF1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration, primarily through its interactions with other proteins such as integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases (Hou2022TM4SF1; Fu2020Role). These interactions are crucial in the context of cancer, where TM4SF1 has been implicated in promoting tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance across several cancer types, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer (Wu2024NUP43; Ye2019Transmembrane4). Due to its significant role in oncogenic pathways, TM4SF1 is considered a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in oncology (Rahim2023Three; Tang2024Integrated).

## Structure
TM4SF1 is a protein characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which are integral to its structure and function. These domains are designated as TM1 through TM4 and are part of the tetraspanin superfamily, although TM4SF1 lacks some features typical of other tetraspanins, such as the LGC motif in the TM2 domain and conserved cysteine residues in the major extracellular domain (Fu2020Role). The protein includes N- and C-terminal intracellular domains and two extracellular domains, with a smaller domain between TM1 and TM2 and a larger domain between TM3 and TM4 (Fu2020Role).

The larger extracellular loop, known as EC2, contains three α-helices and a variable region, which is crucial for interactions with other proteins such as integrins (Fu2020Role). TM4SF1's structure is distinct due to the presence of two glutamine or glutamic acid residues in the TM4 domain and a unique amino acid composition in its transmembrane regions (Fu2020Role). The protein is also known to form tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which are important for its role in cell signaling and adhesion (Fu2020Role).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The TM4SF1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), TM4SF1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced recurrence-free survival and post-progression survival. This overexpression is linked to tumor progression through interactions with signaling pathways like PI3K-Akt, which are involved in cell migration and metastasis (Tang2024Integrated). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TM4SF1 is overexpressed in cancerous tissues, promoting proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance via the DDR1/AKT/ERK-mTOR signaling axis (Ye2019Transmembrane4).

In bladder cancer, high TM4SF1 expression correlates with advanced disease stages and poor overall survival. Silencing TM4SF1 can inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis through oxidative stress pathways (Rahim2023Three). In papillary thyroid carcinoma, TM4SF1 is a marker for lymph node metastasis, with its expression linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and hypomethylation of promoter regions (Wang2022Potential). TM4SF1 also plays a role in colorectal cancer by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness, contributing to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (Tang2020TM4SF1). These findings highlight TM4SF1's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TM4SF1, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression. It interacts with integrin α6, promoting cell migration and metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) through the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Hou2022TM4SF1). This interaction is crucial for laminin-dependent cell migration, highlighting the role of the TM4SF1/integrin α6/FAK axis in ESCC (Hou2022TM4SF1).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TM4SF1 interacts with DDR1, a receptor tyrosine kinase, affecting the DDR1/AKT/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. This interaction contributes to cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and chemo-resistance (Ye2019Transmembrane4). TM4SF1 also regulates the phosphorylation of downstream targets such as AKT, ERK, and mTOR, which are involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation (Rahim2023Three).

In colorectal cancer, TM4SF1 enhances PD-L1 gene transcription by stimulating the JAK/STAT3 pathway, indicating its role in immune evasion and cancer progression (Wu2024NUP43). These interactions underscore TM4SF1's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.
