# NLRP5

## Overview
NLRP5, also known as NLR family pyrin domain containing 5, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to reproductive biology, particularly in early embryonic development. The NLRP5 protein is a member of the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) family, characterized by its involvement in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. It contains several conserved domains, including a DEATH-Like domain, a pyrin domain, and a NACHT nucleoside triphosphatase domain, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes (PISANI2010Characterization; Docherty2015Mutations). The protein is a key component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for the degradation of maternal RNA and proteins and the activation of the embryonic genome during early embryogenesis (Mu2019Mutations). Mutations in the NLRP5 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, including early embryonic arrest and multilocus imprinting disturbances, underscoring its critical role in maintaining normal reproductive function and embryonic development (Sparago2019The; Mu2019Mutations).

## Structure
The NLRP5 protein, also known as Mater, is a member of the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) family and plays a crucial role in reproductive processes. The protein contains several key domains, including a DEATH-Like domain at the amino terminus, a DAPIN or Pyrin domain, and a NACHT nucleoside triphosphatase domain, which are involved in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling (PISANI2010Characterization; Docherty2015Mutations). The NACHT domain is responsible for nucleotide-dependent oligomerization, a process essential for the protein's function in response to ligand binding (Docherty2015Mutations). 

In humans, the NLRP5 protein also contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are thought to function as ligand sensors, facilitating conformational changes that enable nucleotide binding and oligomerization (Docherty2015Mutations). These domains are highly conserved among primates, indicating their importance in the protein's function (Docherty2015Mutations). 

The NLRP5 protein is part of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for early embryonic development. Mutations in NLRP5 can lead to reproductive wastage and multilocus imprinting disorders, highlighting the significance of its structural domains in maintaining normal reproductive function (Docherty2015Mutations; Mu2019Mutations).

## Function
NLRP5, a member of the NLR family, is a crucial maternal effect gene involved in early embryonic development. It encodes a protein that is part of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which is essential for the degradation of maternal RNA and proteins and the activation of the embryonic genome during early embryogenesis (Mu2019Mutations). NLRP5 is primarily expressed in oocytes and early embryos, with its expression being significantly higher in these cells compared to somatic tissues (Mu2019Mutations).

The protein contains several conserved domains, including the NACHT domain, which is predicted to bind ATP, and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Wu2009Maternal). In humans and macaques, NLRP5 also contains a pyrin domain (PYD) involved in apoptosis and autoimmune responses, although this domain is absent in mice (Wu2009Maternal).

NLRP5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in maintaining genomic integrity and proper cell cycle progression in reproductive cells. Its function is critical for the progression of early embryonic development, as its absence or mutation can lead to early embryonic arrest and female infertility (Xu2020A; Mu2019Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NLRP5 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders, primarily affecting female fertility. One significant condition linked to NLRP5 mutations is early embryonic arrest, where embryos fail to develop beyond early stages, leading to recurrent failures in assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF and ICSI (Mu2019Mutations). This condition is characterized by unstable NLRP5 proteins, which disrupt the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) crucial for early embryonic development (Mu2019Mutations).

NLRP5 mutations are also implicated in multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID), which can result in a range of phenotypic outcomes, from overt imprinting disorders to apparently healthy conditions (Sparago2019The; Docherty2015Mutations). These imprinting disorders include Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), characterized by growth and developmental abnormalities (Docherty2015Mutations; Sparago2019The). The mutations can lead to hypomethylation at imprinted loci, affecting normal epigenetic reprogramming and development (Docherty2015Mutations).

The clinical significance of NLRP5 mutations extends to reproductive wastage, including multiple pregnancy losses and molar pregnancies, highlighting the gene's critical role in reproductive health (Docherty2015Mutations). These findings underscore the importance of NLRP5 in maintaining normal embryonic development and its potential as a biomarker for diagnosing infertility and imprinting disorders.

## Interactions
NLRP5 is a component of the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), which includes proteins such as KHDC3L, TLE6, and OOEP. This complex is essential for early embryonic development and is involved in processes like epigenetic reprogramming and oocyte maturation (Docherty2015Mutations). NLRP5 interacts with members of the subcortical complex, including 2410004A20RIK (FILIA), OOEP (FLOPED), and TLE6, although the precise function of this complex is not fully understood (Fernandes2012NLRP5).

In mice, NLRP5 is known to localize to mitochondria and may be involved in the translocation or tethering of mitochondria during embryo development, potentially through interactions with cytoplasmic lattices. NLRP5 was found to localize to a cytoplasmic lattice network with PADI6, suggesting a role in mitochondrial distribution and function (Fernandes2012NLRP5).

In sheep, NLRP5 is predicted to interact with several proteins, including growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), which is a key factor affecting litter size. This interaction suggests that NLRP5 may play a significant role in reproductive processes (Zhang2020Mutations). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NLRP5 in reproductive biology and early embryonic development.
