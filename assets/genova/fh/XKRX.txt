# XKRX

## Overview
The XKRX gene encodes a transmembrane protein known as XK related X-linked, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of phospholipid scrambling within cell membranes. This process is vital for maintaining membrane asymmetry and is involved in various cellular events, including apoptosis and blood coagulation (Chandra2013Cellular). The XKRX protein is predominantly expressed in the plasma membrane and is implicated in cell signaling and membrane dynamics. It is notably expressed in germ cells and immune-related tissues, suggesting roles in both reproductive and immune functions. In particular, the downregulation of XKRX in conditions such as Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) highlights its potential involvement in male fertility, possibly through interactions with the KELL protease to facilitate germ cell movement (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel). Despite its identified roles, further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific functions and clinical implications of XKRX in human health and disease.

## Function
The XKRX gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of phospholipid scrambling in cell membranes, a process essential for maintaining membrane asymmetry and facilitating cellular events such as apoptosis and blood coagulation. The XKRX protein is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to cell signaling and membrane dynamics (Chandra2013Cellular). 

In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), particularly Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), XKRX is downregulated, suggesting its expression is primarily in germ cells. This downregulation may impair its interaction with KELL, a protease from Sertoli cells, affecting germ cell movement in the seminiferous tubules (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel). The XKRX protein shares 44% sequence identity with XK, indicating potential functional similarities, such as facilitating germ cell movement (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel).

The expression of XKRX is also noted in immune-related tissues, with higher levels in blood, bone marrow, and spleen compared to parenchymal organs like the lung and liver, suggesting a role in immune function (Chandra2013Cellular). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The XKRX gene has been implicated in several medical conditions, primarily related to male infertility and immune response. In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), particularly Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), XKRX1, the longest transcript of the XKRX gene, is exclusively down-regulated. This downregulation suggests a potential role in SCOS, a condition associated with male infertility, as XKRX is mainly expressed in germ cells and is related to the XK protein, which facilitates germ cell movement in the seminiferous tubules (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel). The impaired expression of XKRX may affect fertility by disrupting germ cell movement.

In immune-competent tissues, XKRX expression is significantly higher, indicating its role in immune function. During sepsis, IRAK1 mosaicism affects XKRX expression, with changes in allelic expression ratios observed in white blood cells and other tissues. This suggests that XKRX expression is influenced by immune responses and may play a role in the body's reaction to septic conditions (Chandra2013Cellular). However, the specific clinical significance of XKRX gene mutations in diseases beyond these contexts is not directly addressed in the available literature.

## Interactions
The XKRX gene is suggested to be primarily expressed in germ cells and may play a role in germ cell movement within the seminiferous tubules. It shares 44% sequence identity with the XK protein, which interacts with KELL, a protease secreted from Sertoli cells, to facilitate germ cell movement. This similarity suggests that XKRX might interact with KELL in a manner akin to XK, potentially influencing germ cell dynamics. Reduced expression of XKRX, particularly in Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) patients, could impair germ cell movement due to disrupted interactions with KELL (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel).

The XKRX gene's Y-linked counterpart, XKRY, is identified as a putative membrane transporter protein. XKRY is expressed in normal and maturation arrest samples but not in SCOS samples, indicating a potential role in male fertility. The low sequence similarity between XKRX and XKRY may account for differences in their expression patterns and interactions (Ahmadi2015IsoformLevel). While specific protein interactions involving XKRX are not detailed, its potential interaction with KELL and its role in germ cell movement highlight its significance in spermatogenesis.
