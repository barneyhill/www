# CADM4

## Overview
CADM4, or cell adhesion molecule 4, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The protein, also known as Necl-4, plays a pivotal role in mediating cell-cell adhesion through its extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and intracellular interactions. It is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues, including the kidney, brain, and lungs, by facilitating cell adhesion and communication. CADM4's interactions with other proteins, such as Par-3 and VEGFR2, are crucial for processes like Schwann cell polarity and endothelial cell signaling. The gene's expression is notably significant in preventing tumor progression, as its loss or reduced expression is associated with various cancers, including renal clear cell carcinoma and breast cancer, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Saito2017Decreased; Nagata2011Aberrations; Meng2018Necl‐4Cadm4).

## Structure
CADM4, also known as Necl-4, is a member of the Nectin-like cell adhesion proteins, which are single-pass transmembrane proteins. The protein contains three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in its extracellular segment, which are crucial for its role in cell-cell adhesion (Meng2018Necl‐4Cadm4). The intracellular domain (ICD) of CADM4 includes a protein 4.1-ezrin-radixin-moesin (FERM)-binding domain in the juxtamembrane region and a class II PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ)-binding sequence at the C terminus. This PDZ-binding domain is essential for interacting with Par-3, a multi-PDZ domain protein, which is important for Schwann cell polarity and myelination (Meng2018Necl‐4Cadm4).

CADM4 is involved in forming a complex with other proteins such as Mpp6, Lin7, and protein band 4.1G, particularly in the membrane cytoskeleton of Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (Jordans2022AgeDependent). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and interactions. Splice variants of CADM4 can lead to different isoforms, potentially resulting in distinct functional roles within cellular processes. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CADM4 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CADM4, or cell adhesion molecule 4, is a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cell adhesion, particularly in the proximal uriniferous tubules of the kidney. It is part of the immunoglobulin-superfamily cell adhesion molecules and interacts with the actin-binding protein 4.1B through its FERM-binding motif. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of these tubules, which are precursor cells for renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC) (Nagata2011Aberrations).

In healthy human cells, CADM4 is expressed at cell-cell attachment sites, contributing to the cell adhesion cascade in normal kidney epithelial tissues. The protein's role in cell adhesion is vital for preventing disruptions that can lead to cancerous developments (Nagata2011Aberrations). CADM4 is also expressed in a unique spectrum of tissues, including the brain, lung, intestines, and urinary organs, indicating its involvement in cell adhesion processes across different tissues (Nagata2011Aberrations).

The interaction between CADM4 and other cell-surface proteins, such as CADM1, is crucial for maintaining cellular architecture and communication. This interaction has been shown to induce cell spreading, highlighting CADM4's role in cell adhesion and interaction with other proteins (Ito2018Quantitative).

## Clinical Significance
CADM4 (cell adhesion molecule 4) is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC), CADM4 expression is frequently lost or reduced, often due to promoter methylation or loss of heterozygosity at the chromosomal region 19q13.2. This loss is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, particularly in cases with vascular infiltration (Nagata2011Aberrations). Restoring CADM4 expression in RCCC cell lines has been shown to suppress tumor formation, highlighting its tumor-suppressive role (Nagata2011Aberrations).

In breast cancer, decreased expression of CADM4 is linked to advanced tumor stages, suggesting that its inactivation may promote cancer development (Saito2017Decreased). Similarly, low CADM4 expression in gallbladder cancer correlates with advanced disease stages and poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential prognostic marker (Bang2023Clinicopathological).

CADM4 expression is also reduced in gastric adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis (Bang2022Decreased). In colorectal adenocarcinomas, loss of CADM4 expression is linked to more aggressive tumor features and poorer survival outcomes (Jang2012Clinicopathological). These findings underscore the significance of CADM4 in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic biomarker.

## Interactions
CADM4, also known as Necl-4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. It interacts with Par-3, a multi-PDZ domain protein, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding domain. This interaction is essential for recruiting Par-3 to the adaxonal membrane of Schwann cells, which is important for Schwann cell polarity and myelination. The first PDZ domain of Par-3 is primarily responsible for this interaction, while the third PDZ domain also participates to a lesser extent (Meng2018Necl‐4Cadm4).

CADM4 also interacts with VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, where it inhibits VEGFR2 activation and signaling. This interaction is mediated through the extracellular region of CADM4 and affects downstream signaling pathways, including those involved in cell movement and proliferation (Yamana2015The).

In renal clear cell carcinoma, CADM4 interacts with the actin-binding protein 4.1B, which is important for maintaining normal cell adhesion. The loss of CADM4 expression in these cells is associated with tumor progression and invasion (Nagata2011Aberrations).
