# AMOTL1

## Overview
The AMOTL1 gene encodes the angiomotin-like 1 protein, a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. As a cytoplasmic protein, AMOTL1 is characterized by its intrinsically disordered domain, coiled-coil region, and PDZ-binding motif, which facilitate interactions with various proteins and contribute to its role in cellular architecture and signaling pathways (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1; Gagné2009Human). AMOTL1 is a key player in the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, where it modulates the activity of YAP1, influencing processes such as organ size control, cell proliferation, and oncogenesis (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1; Ragni2017Amotl1). The protein's involvement in angiogenesis, wound repair, and tissue homeostasis underscores its clinical significance, with mutations in AMOTL1 linked to congenital disorders and its dysregulation associated with cancer progression (Rips2020De; Zhou2020AMOTL1).

## Structure
The AMOTL1 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains an intrinsically disordered (ID) domain in the N-terminal region, which includes actin-binding motifs and sequences that interact with the Yes1-Associated Transcriptional Regulator (YAP). This ID sequence can be phosphorylated by LATS1/2, affecting its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1). Adjacent to the ID domain is a coiled-coil region responsible for homo- and hetero-oligomerization with other proteins, facilitating interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cell migration (Gagné2009Human). The C-terminal part of AMOTL1 contains a PDZ-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins, playing a role in cell junctions and cellular architecture (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1; Gagné2009Human).

AMOTL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as mono-ubiquitination by HECW2 ligase and polyubiquitination by NEDD4L, which regulate its activity and stability at cell junctions (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1). Alternative splicing of the AMOTL1 gene generates isoforms with different exon compositions, although the specific functions of these isoforms are not fully understood (Gagné2009Human).

## Function
The AMOTL1 gene encodes the angiomotin-like 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell migration and architecture. AMOTL1 interacts with the actin cytoskeleton through its coiled-coil domain, which is essential for its function in recruiting F-actin to specific subcellular structures, thereby altering the cytoskeletal architecture and promoting the formation of stress fiber-like structures (Gagné2009Human). This interaction is significant for processes such as cell migration, where AMOTL1 increases migration velocity and affects directional persistence (Gagné2009Human).

AMOTL1 is also involved in the regulation of signaling pathways, including the Hippo/YAP pathway, where it modulates the activity of YAP1, a key effector in controlling organ size and cell proliferation (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1; Ragni2017Amotl1). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, where it maintains cell polarity and tissue architecture by interacting with tight junction proteins and influencing cellular junctions (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1). Through these interactions, AMOTL1 contributes to processes such as angiogenesis and wound repair, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Sadlak2023CircAMOTL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AMOTL1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. Pathogenic variants in AMOTL1 are associated with congenital phenotypes such as orofacial clefts and cardiac abnormalities. A specific de novo variant, c.479C>T; p.[Pro160Leu], was identified in a female infant presenting with cleft lip and palate, imperforate anus, and dysmorphic features, indicating its pathogenic potential (Rips2020De).

In cancer, AMOTL1 plays a significant role in tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer, AMOTL1 promotes the nuclear accumulation of YAP1, a key player in the Hippo signaling pathway, enhancing oncogenic transcription and correlating with poor clinical outcomes. High expression levels of AMOTL1 are linked to advanced stages of gastric cancer and reduced survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhou2020AMOTL1).

AMOTL1 is also implicated in heart development, where it interacts with the Hippo signaling pathway to regulate heart growth. In the absence of the Fat4 gene, AMOTL1 relocates to the nucleus, increasing Yap1 nuclear localization and cardiomyocyte proliferation, which can lead to excessive myocardial growth (Ragni2017Amotl1).

## Interactions
AMOTL1 (angiomotin like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the p80-Amot protein through its coiled-coil domain, forming a complex that is crucial for the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is necessary for the co-localization of AMOTL1 with p80-Amot and the recruitment of AMOTL1 to Amot protein complexes, which affects cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics (Gagné2009Human).

AMOTL1 also interacts with YAP1, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in gastric cancer, where AMOTL1 promotes YAP1's nuclear translocation and stability, protecting it from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This stabilization enhances YAP1's oncogenic potential by facilitating its role in transcriptional activation (Zhou2020AMOTL1). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a splice variant of AMOTL1, known as AMOTL1-L, also interacts with YAP1, promoting its nuclear translocation and contributing to tumorigenesis (Xu2023SRSF3AMOTL1).

These interactions highlight AMOTL1's role in modulating the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cell migration, proliferation, and oncogenesis through its association with key signaling proteins.
