# CST11

## Overview
CST11 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin 11, a member of the cystatin superfamily known for its role as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin 11 is characterized by its conserved cystatin domain, which is crucial for its inhibitory function against target proteases. The protein's structure, comprising alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributes to its stability and functional conformation, allowing it to effectively participate in protease inhibition. Post-translational modifications and splice variants of CST11 can lead to different isoforms, each with potentially unique functions and regulatory roles within the cell. These structural and functional attributes underscore the significance of CST11 in cellular regulation and its involvement in various biological processes.

## Structure
Cystatin 11 (CST11) is a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions as cysteine protease inhibitors. The primary structure of CST11 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function and interaction with other molecules. The secondary structure of CST11 typically includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation. 

The tertiary structure of CST11 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its biological activity. This folding allows CST11 to maintain its functional shape and interact effectively with target proteases. CST11 contains a conserved cystatin domain, characteristic of the cystatin superfamily, which is essential for its inhibitory activity.

CST11 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity, stability, and interactions with other proteins. Additionally, splice variants of CST11 can result in different isoforms, each potentially having distinct functions and regulatory roles within the cell. These structural and functional variations allow CST11 to participate in a range of biological processes, highlighting its importance in cellular regulation and protease inhibition.
