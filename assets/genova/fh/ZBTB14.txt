# ZBTB14

## Overview
ZBTB14 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 14, a member of the ZBTB family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate DNA binding, and a BTB domain that mediates dimerization and interaction with corepressors, playing a crucial role in transcriptional repression (Cheng2014Identification; Deng2022Zbtb14). ZBTB14 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune cell development and maintenance of genomic stability, and it may function as a tumor suppressor (Deng2022Zbtb14). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation, which enhances its repressive functions (Deng2022Zbtb14). Clinically, mutations and alterations in ZBTB14 have been linked to diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated fibrosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chen2023Zbtb14; Deng2022Zbtb14).

## Structure
The ZBTB14 protein is a member of the ZBTB family of transcription factors, characterized by the presence of zinc finger and BTB domains. The protein contains five consecutive C-terminal zinc finger motifs, which enable DNA binding, and a nearly identical N-terminal BTB motif, which mediates dimerization and recruits corepressors (Deng2022Zbtb14). The BTB domain is structurally conserved and is involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in forming dimers or higher-order oligomers (Cheng2014Identification).

ZBTB14 is also subject to post-translational modifications, specifically SUMOylation, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor. The lysine residue K40 is identified as the specific site for SUMOylation, and this modification is essential for the protein's transcriptional repression activity (Deng2022Zbtb14). The protein's structure includes nuclear localization signals (NLS) and other motifs like the A-T hook, which facilitate DNA binding and transport into the nucleus (Liu2024Zinc).

The protein may exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. The structural features of ZBTB14, including its domains and post-translational modifications, underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.

## Function
ZBTB14 is a transcriptional repressor involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in gene regulation. It functions by inhibiting the expression of specific genes, such as PU.1, which is crucial for the development of monocytes and macrophages. This repression is achieved through direct interaction with the PU.1 promoter, thereby regulating the proliferation and differentiation of these immune cells (Deng2022Zbtb14). ZBTB14 is also implicated in maintaining genomic stability and may act as a tumor suppressor, with its inactivity linked to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Deng2022Zbtb14).

In the context of embryonic stem cells, ZBTB14 is identified as a negative regulator of the 2-cell-like cell (2CLC) state, acting upstream of transcriptional activators such as DUX and DPPA2. It binds to nonmethylated CpG islands in promoters, suggesting an indirect role in gene expression regulation (Defossez2022A). ZBTB14's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, underscoring its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA and other nuclear proteins to modulate transcriptional activity (Defossez2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZBTB14 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A specific mutation, ZBTB14 S8F, has been identified in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This mutation results in a loss-of-function of the ZBTB14 protein, leading to its autophagic degradation and impaired stability. The mutation disrupts the normal function of ZBTB14 as a transcription regulator, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of AML by affecting monocyte and macrophage development (Deng2022Zbtb14).

In the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-associated fibrosis, ZBTB14 expression is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is linked to the activation of hepatic stellate cells via the β-catenin pathway, suggesting a role for ZBTB14 in promoting liver fibrosis. Alterations in ZBTB14 expression may thus have significant implications in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, presenting a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2023Zbtb14).

Additionally, duplications involving the ZBTB14 gene have been associated with developmental delay and intellectual disability, as observed in a family with a duplication of chromosome 18p11.32-p11.31, which includes ZBTB14 (Balasubramanian2016Inherited).

## Interactions
ZBTB14 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function as a transcriptional regulator. It is known to interact with the transcription factor PU.1, where it acts as a negative regulator by repressing PU.1 expression. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of monocyte and macrophage development, as demonstrated in zebrafish models (Deng2022Zbtb14). ZBTB14 is also subject to SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that enhances its transcriptional repression capabilities. This modification occurs at a specific lysine residue (K40) and is essential for its function, although it does not affect the protein's nuclear localization (Deng2022Zbtb14).

In the context of replication stress, ZBTB14 stabilizes the RPA-ATR-ATRIP complex at stalled replication forks, indicating a role in maintaining replication fork stability (Defossez2022A). ZBTB14 also binds to nonmethylated CpG islands, with a preference for promoter regions, including its own promoter, suggesting a role in autoregulation (Defossez2022A). These interactions highlight ZBTB14's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.
