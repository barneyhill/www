# UBE2G2

## Overview
UBE2G2 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system involved in protein degradation. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and plays a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. UBE2G2 collaborates with various E3 ligases to facilitate the assembly of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, marking misfolded or unassembled proteins for proteasomal degradation. The enzyme's activity is vital for numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of UBE2G2 has been implicated in several diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, cystic fibrosis, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Ju2009Solution; Liu2014Dimeric; Cremer2023Proinsulin).

## Structure
The UBE2G2 protein, encoded by the human UBE2G2 gene, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in the ubiquitination process, particularly in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). The protein features a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Arai2006Structure). The molecular structure of UBE2G2 includes a single domain with an antiparallel β-sheet comprising four strands, five α-helices, and two 3_10-helices (Arai2006Structure). 

The solution structure of UBE2G2 reveals a canonical E2 fold, consistent with crystallographic data, but with dynamic loop regions near the active site cysteine, particularly a 13-residue insertion (residues 95-107) and a loop spanning residues 130-135 (Ju2009Solution). These loops are highly dynamic and poorly defined, suggesting they require interaction with protein partners to assume a catalytically relevant conformation (Ju2009Solution). 

In terms of quaternary structure, UBE2G2 can form homodimers, which are crucial for its function in forming Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains. This dimerization is facilitated by electrostatic interactions and is essential for engaging both donor and acceptor ubiquitins simultaneously (Liu2014Dimeric). The dimer interface involves Cys48 in the acceptor and Cys89 in the donor, positioning Lys48 in the acceptor ubiquitin near the donor UBE2G2 active site (Liu2014Dimeric).

## Function
UBE2G2, also known as UBC7, is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. This enzyme is involved in the ubiquitination process, where it collaborates with E3 ligases such as gp78, HRD1, and TEB4 to assemble Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. These chains tag misfolded or unassembled proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thus preventing proteotoxic stress in cells (Ju2009Solution; Liu2014Dimeric).

UBE2G2 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. It forms homodimers, which are crucial for its function in synthesizing specific ubiquitin chains. This dimerization allows UBE2G2 to engage both donor and acceptor ubiquitins, enhancing the efficiency and specificity of ubiquitin chain assembly (Liu2014Dimeric).

The enzyme's activity is vital for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Malfunctions in the ERAD pathway, where UBE2G2 is a key player, are associated with diseases such as Parkinson's disease and cystic fibrosis (Ju2009Solution).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2G2 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Alterations in UBE2G2 expression or function can contribute to the pathogenesis of various conditions. In the context of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), UBE2G2 is involved in the degradation of proinsulin, a process crucial for the presentation of proinsulin B-chain autoantigens on pancreatic β-cells. This presentation can trigger an autoreactive CD8+ T cell response, leading to the destruction of β-cells and insulin deficiency (Cremer2023Proinsulin).

UBE2G2 is also associated with prostate cancer, where its high expression correlates with poor survival outcomes. It is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which promotes cancer cell metastasis (Chen2019Identification).

In skeletal muscle atrophy, UBE2G2 expression is up-regulated in conditions such as chronic renal failure and cancer, suggesting its involvement in muscle degradation processes (Polge2015Role). Dysfunction in the ERAD pathway, where UBE2G2 plays a critical role, is linked to a range of pathologies, indicating that alterations in UBE2G2 could contribute to these conditions (Smith2021A).

## Interactions
UBE2G2, a human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, plays a significant role in protein degradation processes, particularly in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). It interacts with several proteins to facilitate its function. UBE2G2 forms a complex with the E3 ligase gp78, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This interaction involves the RING domain of gp78, which enhances the ligation of ubiquitin molecules via a K48 linkage, essential for proteasomal degradation (Magala2017Conformational).

The enzyme also interacts with the G2BR domain of AUP1, which is vital for its recruitment and activation in the ERAD pathway. AUP1 stabilizes UBE2G2, recruits it to the ER membrane, and protects it from degradation, highlighting its critical role beyond merely maintaining UBE2G2 levels (Smith2021A).

Additionally, UBE2G2 binds to ubiquitin and diubiquitin species, with a preference for the distal subunit of Lys-48-linked diubiquitin due to steric hindrance. This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and involves specific residues in UBE2G2, particularly in the β-sheet and C terminus regions (Bocik2011Mechanism).
