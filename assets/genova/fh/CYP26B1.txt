# CYP26B1

## Overview
CYP26B1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily B member 1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a crucial derivative of vitamin A, by catalyzing its hydroxylation to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent toxicity. As a retinoic acid hydroxylase, CYP26B1 plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including neurogenesis, skin inflammation, and T-cell differentiation, by regulating retinoic acid signaling pathways (Topletz2012Comparison; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). The enzyme is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed in several extrahepatic tissues, such as the brain and skin, where it contributes to essential developmental and cellular functions (Stoney2015Expression; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). Mutations in the CYP26B1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

## Structure
CYP26B1 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which are heme-thiolate proteins involved in the metabolism of retinoic acid. The primary structure of CYP26B1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure is characterized by a compact, globular form with a heme-binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (SaenzMéndez2012Homology). The quaternary structure details are less defined, but CYP26B1 typically functions as a monomer.

The enzyme contains a heme group perfectly inserted into the model, interacting with several amino acid residues in the active site through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (SaenzMéndez2012Homology). Common post-translational modifications for cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP26B1, may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific modifications for CYP26B1 are not detailed in the provided context.

CYP26B1 also has a spliced variant that lacks exon 2, which affects its affinity for all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) and suggests a role in regulating atRA degradation (SaenzMéndez2012Homology). The spliced variant retains most interactions with the heme group, although some differences in hydrogen bonding are noted (SaenzMéndez2012Homology).

## Function
CYP26B1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a derivative of vitamin A. It functions primarily as a retinoic acid hydroxylase, catalyzing the hydroxylation of atRA to form metabolites such as 4-OH-RA, which are crucial for regulating retinoic acid levels in cells (Topletz2012Comparison; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). This enzyme is characterized by its high affinity and low capacity for atRA, making it essential for maintaining retinoid homeostasis and preventing retinoic acid toxicity (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

CYP26B1 is expressed in various extrahepatic tissues, including the brain, skin, and immune cells, where it regulates retinoic acid signaling involved in processes such as neurogenesis, skin inflammation, and T-cell differentiation (Stoney2015Expression; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). In the brain, CYP26B1 is particularly active in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, contributing to memory functions and neuroprotection (Stoney2015Expression). The enzyme's activity is crucial for embryonic development, as it regulates gene expression necessary for proper tissue and organ formation (Isoherranen2019Biochemical). CYP26B1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins to facilitate the metabolism of atRA (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CYP26B1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in CYP26B1 can lead to severe developmental abnormalities, including craniofacial malformations, skeletal defects, and encephalocele, often resulting in early embryonic death. For example, a homozygous mutation (Arg363Leu) has been linked to these severe outcomes, while other mutations like Ser146Pro and Gly435Ser are associated with Antley-Bixler syndrome, characterized by craniosynostosis and craniofacial abnormalities (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

Genetic variants in CYP26B1 have also been implicated in cancer. The Arg323Trp variant is significantly associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in smokers and drinkers, due to its increased enzyme activity and lower serum atRA concentrations. Another variant, L264S, is linked to prostate cancer and larger atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting a role in atherosclerosis development. This variant may also contribute to Crohn's disease, particularly early onset (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

In zebrafish, mutations in CYP26B1 lead to increased osteoblast activity and hyperossification, indicating its role in restricting ossification and maintaining proper vertebral column formation. This suggests potential relevance to human congenital disorders with vertebral fusions (Laue2008Restriction).

## Interactions
CYP26B1 interacts with cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs), specifically CRABP-I and CRABP-II, to facilitate the metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). These interactions involve direct protein-protein contact, where CRABPs deliver atRA to CYP26B1 through substrate channeling, bypassing the need for free atRA in the cytosol (Nelson2016Direct; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). CRABPs act as noncompetitive inhibitors of CYP26B1, decreasing the enzyme's catalytic efficiency by reducing the k_cat values, which suggests that CRABPs tightly bind atRA and facilitate its direct delivery to CYP26B1 (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

CRABPs do not inhibit other CYP enzymes like CYP3A4, indicating a specific interaction with CYP26B1. This specificity is supported by experiments showing that CRABPs do not affect the metabolism of substrates that do not bind to them, such as midazolam (Nelson2016Direct). The interactions between CRABPs and CYP26B1 are crucial for the regulation of atRA metabolism, as they influence the enzyme's activity and substrate specificity (Nelson2016Direct). These findings challenge the free-drug hypothesis by suggesting that CRABPs can directly channel atRA to CYP enzymes (Nelson2016Direct).
