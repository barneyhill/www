# SMCO3

## Overview
The SMCO3 gene encodes the single-pass membrane protein with coiled-coil domains 3, which is a transmembrane protein characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its integration into cellular membranes. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and interactions remain to be fully elucidated. The presence of coiled-coil domains suggests a role in protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing cellular signaling pathways and structural organization within the cell. Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological roles and clinical significance of SMCO3 and its encoded protein.
