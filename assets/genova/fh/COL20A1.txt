# COL20A1

## Overview
The COL20A1 gene encodes the collagen type XX alpha 1 chain, a protein that belongs to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein is integral to the structural organization and integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly through its interactions with fibrillar collagens. The collagen type XX alpha 1 chain is characterized by its complex structure, which includes fibronectin type III repeats, a von Willebrand factor A domain, and collagenous triple-helix domains interspersed with non-collagenous regions. These features enable it to play a significant role in the development and maintenance of connective tissues, such as cartilage, skin, and tendons. The expression of COL20A1 is notably observed in various tissues, including the corneal epithelium and embryonic skin, indicating its importance in normal skeletal and connective tissue development (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type; Takács2023The). Additionally, mutations in COL20A1 have been linked to several medical conditions, including striate palmoplantar keratoderma and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type; Khan2018Wholeexome).

## Structure
The COL20A1 gene encodes the collagen type XX alpha 1 chain, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein is characterized by several fibronectin type III repeats, a von Willebrand factor A domain, a thrombospondin-like domain, and collagenous triple-helix domains interspersed with non-collagenous domains (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type). These structural features suggest that type XX collagen associates with fibrillar collagens to regulate their organization and interactions (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type).

The primary structure of collagen proteins typically consists of Gly-X-Y repeats, where X and Y are often proline and hydroxyproline. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, while the tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a triple helix. The quaternary structure refers to the assembly of multiple collagen molecules into fibrils. Common post-translational modifications include hydroxylation and glycosylation, which are typical for collagen proteins (Haq2019Comparative).

The COL20A1 protein has been studied in the context of its role in diseases such as striate palmoplantar keratoderma, where a missense mutation (p.Ser131Cys) affects its structure and function (Khan2018Wholeexome).

## Function
The COL20A1 gene encodes the collagen type XX alpha 1 chain, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This protein plays a crucial role in the organization and structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by associating with fibrillar collagens, thereby regulating their organization and interactions (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type). Type XX collagen is involved in the structural and functional development of cartilage, particularly in the formation of the extracellular matrix, as indicated by its association with gene clusters involved in chondrogenesis (Takács2023The).

In healthy human cells, COL20A1 expression is primarily observed in tissues such as the corneal epithelium, embryonic skin, lung, sternal cartilage, and tendon, suggesting its role in normal skeletal and connective tissue development (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type). The protein's structure includes several fibronectin type III repeats, a von Willebrand factor A domain, and collagenous triple-helix domains interspersed with non-collagenous domains, which are essential for its function in ECM organization (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type). The expression pattern of COL20A1 suggests its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues where it is expressed, contributing to their strength and elasticity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the COL20A1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. A study identified a novel heterozygous mutation in the COL20A1 gene (c. 392C > G; p.Ser131Cys) in a Pakistani family with striate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKS), a condition characterized by hyperkeratotic lesions on the palms and soles. This mutation was not found in a control group of 219 ethnically matched individuals, suggesting its potential pathogenicity (Khan2018Wholeexome).

In the context of cancer, elevated levels of type XX collagen, encoded by COL20A1, have been observed in the blood of patients with various solid tumors. This elevation is associated with poor survival outcomes, particularly in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where high levels of type XX collagen correlate with reduced survival rates (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type). The gene's expression is notably enriched in the human brain and has been linked to brain cancers, suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis (ThorlaciusUssing2022Type; Guo2023Tumor).

Additionally, a frameshift insertion variant in COL20A1 has been associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection, highlighting its potential involvement in cardiovascular conditions (Li2016Variants).
