# ZC3H10

## Overview
ZC3H10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 10 protein, which functions primarily as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of mitochondrial physiology and thermogenic gene programs. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including CCCH-type zinc finger motifs and a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitate its role in DNA binding and transcriptional activation. ZC3H10 is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, particularly in brown adipose tissue, where it activates thermogenic genes such as UCP1, contributing to energy expenditure and protection against obesity. The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation through p38 MAPK, enhancing its DNA-binding capability. ZC3H10 also interacts with other proteins, such as Dot1L, to regulate gene expression. Mutations in the ZC3H10 gene have been linked to metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in energy metabolism and cellular function (Yi2019Zc3h10; Yi2020Dot1L; Audano2018Zc3h10).

## Structure
The ZC3H10 protein is characterized by the presence of several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains three CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in RNA binding, although in the case of ZC3H10, these domains are not required for its DNA-binding activity (Yi2019Zc3h10; Audano2018Zc3h10). The protein also features a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding function and activation of the UCP1 promoter (Yi2019Zc3h10). 

The N-terminal region of ZC3H10 includes a glycine-rich domain, while the C-terminal region contains a proline-rich motif (Audano2018Zc3h10). These structural features suggest a complex role in both RNA and DNA interactions. ZC3H10 is phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, which enhances its DNA-binding capability, particularly in the context of activating thermogenic genes (Yi2019Zc3h10). 

The protein's structure is conserved across vertebrates, indicating its regulatory mechanisms are widespread among mammals (Audano2018Zc3h10). However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of ZC3H10 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ZC3H10 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcription factor and is involved in regulating mitochondrial physiology and thermogenic gene programs. In healthy human cells, ZC3H10 is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and function. It activates the Tfam promoter, a key regulator of mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, thereby enhancing mitochondrial DNA content and the expression of mitochondrial genes (Audano2018Zc3h10). ZC3H10 is also involved in the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes, promoting mitochondrial function and myoblast differentiation (Audano2018Zc3h10).

In brown adipose tissue (BAT), ZC3H10 acts as a transcription factor that activates the thermogenic gene program, including the UCP1 promoter, which is essential for thermogenesis. This activity is crucial for energy expenditure and protection against diet-induced obesity (Yi2019Zc3h10). ZC3H10 is phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, enhancing its DNA-binding ability and transcriptional activation of thermogenic genes (Yi2019Zc3h10). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to promoter regions of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenesis, highlighting its role in energy metabolism and cellular function (Yi2019Zc3h10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZC3H10 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to metabolic disorders. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs61732294, results in an amino acid change from tyrosine (Tyr) to cysteine (Cys) at position 105. This mutation is associated with metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction in humans. Individuals homozygous for the Cys105 allele exhibit higher body mass index (BMI), increased waist circumference, total fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting glucose, and triglyceride levels, along with decreased HDL levels compared to those with the Tyr105 allele. The mutation also leads to decreased mitochondrial function, as evidenced by reduced basal, maximal coupled, and uncoupled respiration, and diminished complex I and II activities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Cys105 homozygotes. The expression of mitochondrial-related genes such as Tfam, Sdhb, and Ndufb8 is reduced, and key metabolites of the TCA cycle are significantly decreased in these subjects, indicating a link between the ZC3H10 Cys105 mutation and metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction (Audano2018Zc3h10).

## Interactions
ZC3H10 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression, particularly in the context of thermogenesis and mitochondrial function. It interacts with Dot1L, a H3K79 methyltransferase, to activate the UCP1 promoter and other thermogenic genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of these genes, as Dot1L is recruited by ZC3H10 to the promoter regions, functioning as a coactivator by methylating H3K79 (Yi2020Dot1L). The interaction between ZC3H10 and Dot1L was validated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and is essential for the full activation of the BAT gene program (Yi2020Dot1L).

ZC3H10 also acts as a DNA-binding transcription factor, binding to the UCP1 promoter at a distal region, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of UCP1. This binding is enhanced by phosphorylation at serine 126 by p38 MAPK, which increases its binding affinity to target genes, including UCP1, Tfam, and Nrf1, crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis and thermogenic capacity (Yi2019Zc3h10). Despite being an RNA-binding protein, its DNA-binding function is attributed to its basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, rather than its zinc finger domain (Yi2019Zc3h10).
