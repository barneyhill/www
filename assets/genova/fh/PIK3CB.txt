# PIK3CB

## Overview
The PIK3CB gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit beta, commonly referred to as p110β, which is a critical component of the Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This kinase plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways that regulate growth, survival, and metabolism. As a catalytic subunit, p110β is involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger that activates downstream signaling proteins such as Akt, thereby influencing various cellular processes including cell proliferation and survival (Ciraolo2008Phosphoinositide; Bilanges2019PI3K). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a Ras-binding domain, a C2 domain, a helical domain, and a kinase domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in signal transduction (Miller2019Structural). PIK3CB is implicated in numerous physiological processes and has been associated with pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer, where mutations in the gene can lead to aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy (Nakanishi2016Activating; Tian2020N6methyladenosine).

## Structure
The PIK3CB gene encodes the p110β catalytic subunit of Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways related to growth and survival. The protein structure includes several domains: the Ras-binding domain (RBD), C2 domain, helical domain, and kinase domain (Miller2019Structural). The RBD is involved in interactions with Ras, potentially activating p110β through an allosteric mechanism. The C2 domain is thought to be involved in membrane binding, while the helical domain's function remains less clear. The kinase domain is similar to other protein kinases, featuring a two-lobed structure where ATP binds at the hinge region (Miller2019Structural).

PIK3CB's quaternary structure involves its interaction with the regulatory subunit p85, forming a heterodimer. This interaction is crucial for stability and regulation, with the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of p85 being particularly important for stabilization and inhibition (Miller2019Structural). The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal in the C2 domain, which is absent in the p110α isoform, allowing it to play roles in nuclear processes such as cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Mazloumi2018Class). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions.

## Function
The PIK3CB gene encodes the p110β isoform of the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, p110β is involved in signal transduction pathways, particularly those activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). It is essential for the phosphorylation of Akt in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), indicating its involvement in GPCR signaling (Ciraolo2008Phosphoinositide).

p110β also acts as a coincidence detector, integrating signals from small GTPases and other upstream activators, contributing to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) and subsequent activation of Akt, a key player in cell survival, metabolism, and proliferation (Bilanges2019PI3K). It is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where it functions as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles and influencing receptor endocytosis (Ciraolo2008Phosphoinositide).

In terms of organismal outcomes, p110β is implicated in metabolic regulation, including insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, and plays a role in maintaining normal liver function (Ciraolo2008Phosphoinositide). It is also involved in male fertility through its regulation of androgen receptor activity in Sertoli cells (GuillermetGuibert2015Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIK3CB gene, which encodes the p110β subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), have been implicated in various cancers due to their role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Specific mutations, such as D1067Y/A/V, confer resistance to PI3K inhibitors in PTEN-deficient breast cancer cell lines and are recurrent in several cancer types, including glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, and endometrial cancer (Nakanishi2016Activating). These mutations lead to elevated phospho-AKT levels, indicating a mechanism of resistance to PI3K inhibitors like GDC-0941, GDC-0032, and TGX-221 (Nakanishi2016Activating).

Another mutation, E1051K, increases the catalytic activity of p110β, enhancing downstream PI3K signaling and promoting tumorigenic growth in cancers such as breast, lung, esophageal, renal, and stomach malignancies. This mutation renders cancer cells sensitive to the p110β-selective inhibitor TGX-221 (Whale2017Functional). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PIK3CB overexpression, particularly in PTEN-deficient cases, is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced tumor growth and metastasis through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway (Tian2020N6methyladenosine). These findings underscore the oncogenic role of PIK3CB mutations and their impact on treatment resistance and cancer progression.

## Interactions
PIK3CB, the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase beta (PI3Kβ), engages in various interactions with proteins that influence its activity and function. It forms a complex with the regulatory subunit p85, which includes domains such as SH3, nSH2, cSH2, and iSH2, facilitating interactions with proteins like Src family kinases and Rho family GTPases (Bresnick2019PI3Kβ—A). PIK3CB directly binds to the small GTPase Rab5, playing a role in vesicular trafficking and endocytosis, although the exact mechanism remains unclear due to the excess of Rab5 over p110β (Ciraolo2008Phosphoinositide; Bresnick2019PI3Kβ—A).

PIK3CB is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through interactions with phosphotyrosyl residues, which disrupt inhibitory contacts made by the SH2 domains of p85 (Bresnick2019PI3Kβ—A). It also interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) via the Gβγ subunits, with the binding site located in a flexible loop between the C2 and helical domains of p110β (Bresnick2019PI3Kβ—A). These interactions are crucial for its role in signaling pathways related to cell growth, survival, and metabolism. PIK3CB's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases (Bresnick2019PI3Kβ—A).
