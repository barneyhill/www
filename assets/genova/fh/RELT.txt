# RELT

## Overview
RELT is a gene that encodes the RELT TNF receptor, a type I transmembrane protein involved in immune signaling and cellular processes such as inflammation and apoptosis. The RELT protein is predominantly expressed in the hematopoietic system, including the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, with moderate expression in other tissues like the fetal liver and skeletal muscle (Cusick2023The). It plays a significant role in activating signaling pathways such as NF-κB and JNK, which are essential for cell survival and immune responses (Cusick2023The). The RELT gene has clinical significance, as mutations are associated with autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta, a condition affecting enamel formation (Kim2018Mutations). Additionally, alterations in RELT expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may function as an oncogene or influence immune regulation (Cusick2023The).

## Function
RELT (RELT TNF receptor) is a type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system, including the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, with moderate expression in other tissues such as the fetal liver and skeletal muscle (Cusick2023The). It is involved in various cellular processes, including the activation of signaling pathways like NF-κB and JNK, which are crucial for cellular signaling related to inflammation and cell survival (Cusick2023The). RELT interacts with proteins such as heat shock protein Hsc70 and PLSCR1, suggesting its involvement in immune signaling and apoptosis (Cusick2023The).

RELT is implicated in the regulation of T cell responses, as studies in mice indicate that it suppresses CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activity, potentially influencing immune responses (Cusick2023The). The protein's role in apoptosis is complex, as it can induce cell death through mechanisms independent of typical apoptosis pathways, such as those involving Caspase-8 or FADD (Cusick2023The). RELT's expression and function are context-dependent, varying across different cell types and tissues, which may be influenced by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins (Cusick2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RELT gene are linked to autosomal recessive amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a condition characterized by defective enamel formation. Specific mutations, such as a homozygous missense mutation in Exon 11 and a splice junction mutation in Intron 3, have been identified in individuals with AI. These mutations interfere with protein function and lead to abnormal splicing, potentially causing nonsense-mediated decay of mutant transcripts (Kim2018Mutations). RELT expression is crucial in ameloblasts during enamel development, and its absence results in hypomineralized enamel, as observed in RELT -/- mice (Kim2018Mutations).

Beyond dental implications, RELT is involved in immune responses and cancer. Alterations in RELT expression are associated with various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where it acts as an oncogene by upregulating NF-κB, enhancing cell viability, and reducing apoptosis (Cusick2023The). In prostate cancer, RELT is part of a gene panel predicting poor prognosis and is linked to an immunosuppressive environment (Cusick2023The). RELT's role in immune regulation is complex, as it can suppress T-cell activity and cytokine secretion, suggesting an anti-inflammatory function (Cusick2023The).
