# PMS2

## Overview
PMS2 is a gene that encodes the protein PMS1 homolog 2, a critical component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system. This protein functions as a mismatch repair system component, forming a heterodimer with MLH1 to create the MutLα complex, which is essential for correcting DNA replication errors and maintaining genomic stability (Genschel2017Interaction). The PMS2 protein is characterized by its endonuclease activity, which is activated through interactions with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Genschel2017Interaction). Mutations in the PMS2 gene are associated with Lynch syndrome, a hereditary condition that increases the risk of various cancers, and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome, which leads to early-onset malignancies (Mork2016Identification; Senter2008The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its role in both DNA repair and immunoglobulin class switch recombination, highlighting its importance in genomic integrity and immune function (Péron2008Human).

## Structure
The PMS2 protein is a crucial component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, forming a heterodimer with MLH1 to create the MutLα complex. The primary structure of PMS2 includes specific motifs essential for its function, such as the QRLIAP motif in the C-terminal domain, which is critical for interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the activation of MutLα's endonuclease function (Genschel2017Interaction).

The secondary structure of PMS2 features alpha helices and beta sheets, as indicated by circular dichroism analysis, which shows that certain variants like p.Gly207Glu maintain similar alpha-helical content to the wild type, while others like p.Leu42_Glu44del exhibit a high degree of disorder (D’Arcy2019Biochemical).

In terms of tertiary structure, PMS2 contains conserved ATP-binding domains in its N-terminal region and a C-terminal endonuclease domain, which is essential for its role in nicking mismatched DNA strands (D’Arcy2019Biochemical). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with MLH1, forming the MutLα complex, which is vital for MMR function (Kosinski2010Identification).

PMS2 also features nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that facilitate its import into the nucleus via the classical nuclear import pathway, with specific residues like K577 and K580 playing key roles in binding to importin-α (de2018DNA).

## Function
PMS2 is a critical component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system in human cells, where it forms a heterodimer with MLH1, known as MutLα. This complex is essential for correcting DNA replication errors, thereby maintaining genomic stability. PMS2 is active in the nucleus, where it repairs base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops, preventing mutations that could lead to cancer (Genschel2017Interaction).

The interaction between PMS2 and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is crucial for the activation of the endonuclease function of MutLα, which is necessary for effective MMR. Mutations in the interaction motif can impair this function, leading to increased genomic instability (Genschel2017Interaction). PMS2 also plays a role in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. Variants such as PMS2(R20Q) can compromise this function, affecting the organism's response to DNA damage and potentially increasing cancer susceptibility (MarinovicTerzic2008Apoptotic).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PMS2 is involved in immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), a process crucial for antibody maturation. Deficiency in PMS2 can impair CSR, highlighting its importance in immune function (Péron2008Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMS2 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with Lynch syndrome (LS), also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). This condition increases the risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers, among others. PMS2 mutations contribute significantly to LS, but the penetrance for monoallelic mutation carriers is lower compared to other mismatch repair genes like MLH1 and MSH2 (Goodenberger2016PMS2; Senter2008The). By age 70, approximately 25% of male and 32% of female PMS2 mutation carriers are expected to be diagnosed with LS-associated cancers (Senter2008The).

Biallelic mutations in PMS2 lead to constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome, a rare condition characterized by early-onset malignancies, including colorectal polyposis, brain tumors, and hematological cancers (Mork2016Identification; Krüger2007Homozygous). This syndrome is associated with a more severe clinical phenotype compared to heterozygous carriers (Senter2008The).

The detection of PMS2 mutations has been historically challenging due to the presence of pseudogenes, but advances in mutation detection methods have improved identification (Borràs2013Refining). Current guidelines for identifying patients with PMS2 mutations may need modification to better address the specific risks associated with these mutations (Senter2008The).

## Interactions
PMS2 is a crucial component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, primarily interacting with MLH1 to form the MutLα complex. This complex is essential for repairing DNA replication errors and maintaining genomic stability. The interaction between PMS2 and MLH1 occurs through specific regions in their carboxyl termini, with PMS2 interacting with MLH1 between amino acid residues 675 and 850 (Guerrette1999The).

PMS2 also interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is necessary for the activation and function of the MutLα complex in MMR. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal endonuclease domain of PMS2, specifically the 721 QRLIAP motif. Mutations in this motif can significantly reduce the interaction with PCNA, impairing the endonuclease and ATPase activities of MutLα, which are crucial for effective MMR (Genschel2017Interaction).

Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PMS2, such as P511K, T597S, and M622I, have been shown to disrupt its interaction with MLH1, suggesting the presence of additional interaction domains outside the known regions. These SNPs may contribute to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) by affecting protein function (Yuan2002Polymorphisms).
