# INPPL1

## Overview
The INPPL1 gene encodes the inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 protein, commonly referred to as SHIP2, which is a crucial component of cellular signaling pathways. SHIP2 is a phosphatase that primarily functions in the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), thereby modulating various cellular processes such as growth, survival, and metabolism (Fradet2016INPPL1; Prasad2011INPPL1). As a member of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway, SHIP2 acts as a negative regulator of insulin signaling, influencing insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (Kaisaki2004Polymorphisms). The protein is characterized by several functional domains, including an SH2 domain, an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase domain, and a proline-rich region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular signaling (Schurmans1999The; Prasad2011INPPL1). SHIP2's involvement in cytoskeletal organization and endocytosis further underscores its importance in cellular dynamics and its potential implications in various diseases, including metabolic disorders and cancer (Vande2020Altered; Prasad2011INPPL1).

## Structure
The INPPL1 gene encodes the SHIP2 protein, which is 1258 amino acids long and has a predicted molecular mass of 142 kDa (Pesesse1997Identification; Prasad2011INPPL1). SHIP2 contains several important domains that facilitate its function. These include an amino-terminal SH2 domain located between amino acids 21-117, a central inositol polyphosphate phosphatase domain (IPPc) between amino acids 422-735, and a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region (Schurmans1999The; Prasad2011INPPL1). The protein also features a NPXY motif between amino acids 983-986 and a sterile alpha-motif (SAM) domain at the carboxy-terminal end, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Schurmans1999The; Prasad2011INPPL1).

SHIP2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which is stimulated by growth factors and insulin (Habib1998Growth). The protein is involved in phosphoinositide signaling, specifically in the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and PI-3,4-bisphosphate (Prasad2011INPPL1). SHIP2 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may result in differences in its structure and function (Schurmans1999The).

## Function
The INPPL1 gene encodes the SHIP2 protein, which functions as a phosphatase involved in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways. SHIP2 primarily dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), a process crucial for modulating various cellular functions such as cell growth, survival, and metabolism (Fradet2016INPPL1; Prasad2011INPPL1). This activity is significant in the context of insulin signaling, where SHIP2 acts as a negative regulator, impacting insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (Prasad2011INPPL1; Kaisaki2004Polymorphisms).

In healthy human cells, SHIP2 is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it influences the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, a key signaling pathway involved in cellular processes such as growth and metabolism (Prasad2011INPPL1). SHIP2 also plays a role in cytoskeletal organization, affecting cell adhesion and movement by regulating actin remodeling and lamellipodia formation (Prasad2011INPPL1). Additionally, SHIP2 is involved in the regulation of endocytosis, particularly of receptors like EGFR, through interactions with proteins such as c-Cbl and intersectin 1 (Prasad2011INPPL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INPPL1 gene, which encodes the SHIP2 protein, are associated with several diseases and conditions. Opsismodysplasia (OPS) is a severe autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia caused by inactivating mutations in INPPL1. This condition is characterized by short stature, limb shortening, craniofacial dysmorphism, and defects in bone growth and mineralization. Mutations often lead to a loss of SHIP2's catalytic function, contributing to the pathogenesis of OPS (Fradet2016INPPL1; Vande2020Altered).

INPPL1 mutations have also been linked to metabolic disorders. Variants in this gene are associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, including hypertension and obesity-related traits. These associations have been observed in different populations, suggesting that INPPL1 polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to these conditions (Kaisaki2004Polymorphisms).

In cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, mutations in INPPL1 can affect cell proliferation. An E567G mutation in INPPL1 has been identified in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, indicating that INPPL1 may play a role in cancer progression and could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Shanmugam2014Whole).

## Interactions
The INPPL1 gene encodes the SHIP2 protein, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for cellular processes. SHIP2 interacts with the p130Cas adapter protein, a key regulator of cellular adhesion and spreading. This interaction is mediated through the SH2 domain of SHIP2, which binds specifically to tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of p130Cas. The interaction is enhanced in cells that reattach after trypsinization, and overexpression of SHIP2 increases its association with p130Cas (Prasad2001SH2Containing).

SHIP2 also interacts with several other proteins, including c-Met, Filamin, and Src kinase, which are important for functions such as cell adhesion, lamellipodia formation, and cell spreading. It associates with the Shc adapter protein and binds to the SH3 domain of ABL, suggesting a role in signaling pathways related to cell growth and cytoskeletal organization (Schurmans1999The; Prasad2011INPPL1).

In insulin signaling, SHIP2 modulates the pathway by hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(3,4)P2, affecting downstream signaling molecules like Akt. This enzymatic activity impacts glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in insulin-sensitive cells (Wada2001Overexpression).
