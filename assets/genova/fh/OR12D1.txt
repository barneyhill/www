# OR12D1

## Overview
The OR12D1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family 12 subfamily D member 1, which is involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is categorized as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), a large family of transmembrane receptors that play a crucial role in signal transduction by interacting with G-proteins. Olfactory receptors, including the one encoded by OR12D1, are responsible for the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of smell. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and are integral to the olfactory system's ability to detect and differentiate a wide array of odorants. The OR12D1 gene, like other olfactory receptor genes, is part of a large gene family that exhibits significant genetic diversity, contributing to the complexity and variability of olfactory perception among individuals.
