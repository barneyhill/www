# CELA3B

## Overview
CELA3B is a gene that encodes the enzyme chymotrypsin-like elastase 3B, a member of the serine protease family. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the pancreas, where it plays a vital role in the digestive process by breaking down dietary proteins in the small intestine. CELA3B is secreted as an inactive zymogen and activated by trypsin in the intestinal lumen. Although it is part of a subfamily known for elastin hydrolysis, CELA3B itself exhibits minimal elastolytic activity. The enzyme also participates in cholesterol metabolism and forms complexes with other pancreatic enzymes, such as Carboxypeptidase A1, to stabilize its zymogen state. Clinically, CELA3B levels are measured in stool samples to assess pancreatic function, and mutations in the CELA3B gene have been linked to various pancreatic disorders, including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (Moore2019Elastase; Uhlig2023CELA3B).

## Function
The CELA3B gene encodes the enzyme chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3B, also known as elastase-3B, which is primarily expressed in the pancreas, specifically in acinar cells, and to a lesser extent in some ductal cells. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the digestive process by being secreted into the intestine as a zymogen, where it is activated by trypsin. Once activated, CELA3B preferentially cleaves proteins after alanine residues, contributing to the breakdown of dietary proteins in the small intestine (Moore2019Elastase; Uhlig2023CELA3B).

In addition to its role in protein digestion, CELA3B is involved in the intestinal transport and metabolism of cholesterol. It forms complexes with Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1), which helps stabilize the zymogen state, essential for its digestive function (Uhlig2023CELA3B). The enzyme is part of a subfamily of serine proteases that hydrolyze elastin and other proteins, although it exhibits little elastolytic activity itself (Uhlig2023CELA3B).

CELA3B is also detected in the stool, and its quantification is used clinically to assess exocrine pancreatic function, providing insights into pancreatic health and diagnosing conditions like exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (Uhlig2023CELA3B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CELA3B gene have been linked to several pancreatic disorders. A specific missense mutation, p.R90C, is associated with familial pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This mutation leads to an increased translation rate of the enzyme, resulting in higher levels of active elastase, which is linked to a higher risk of pancreatitis following pancreatic injury (Moore2019Elastase). The mutation is autosomal dominant with high penetrance and is the first known instance of a CELA3B mutation contributing to hereditary pancreatitis (Moore2019Elastase).

Another variant, R90L, similarly increases CELA3B expression and is associated with greater pancreatic injury in animal models (Moore2019Elastase). Additionally, the CELA3B gene has been identified as one of the top hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network analysis related to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), suggesting its role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Li2019Identification).

The c.643-7G>T intronic variant in CELA3B is underrepresented in patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, indicating a potential protective effect against this condition (Tóth2024The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CELA3B mutations and expression alterations in pancreatic diseases.

## Interactions
CELA3B, or chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3B, is a protease that interacts with other proteins in the exocrine pancreas. It forms complexes with carboxypeptidases CPA1 and CPA2, which are crucial for its function. The R90C and R90L variants of CELA3B maintain normal binding to CPA1 and CPA2, similar to the wild-type CELA3B, indicating that these mutations do not disrupt its binding capabilities (Moore2019Elastase). This interaction is significant as it stabilizes the zymogen state of procarboxypeptidases, enhancing the binding activity of their inhibitory activation peptide (Uhlig2023CELA3B).

The interaction between CELA3B and CPA1 is particularly noted under physiological conditions, where proCELA3B forms complexes with proCPA1. This interaction is consistent with the significant association of CELA3B and CPA1 expression in acinar cell carcinomas (Uhlig2023CELA3B). The binding interactions of CELA3B with these carboxypeptidases suggest a role in regulating protease activity and stability, which may be crucial in the context of pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Moore2019Elastase).
