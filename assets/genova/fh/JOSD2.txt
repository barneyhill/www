# JOSD2

## Overview
JOSD2 is a gene that encodes the protein Josephin domain containing 2, which is a member of the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) family of deubiquitinating enzymes. This protein is characterized by its Josephin domain, a conserved catalytic domain that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation and cellular metabolism. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, Josephin-2 is involved in cleaving ubiquitin conjugates, thereby influencing protein quality control and metabolic pathways. It is particularly significant in the context of glucose metabolism, where it stabilizes key metabolic enzymes, thus maintaining glycolytic activity and cellular energy homeostasis. The protein's interactions and regulatory functions have implications in various diseases, including cancer and heart failure, where its expression levels and activity can affect disease progression and prognosis (Xu2024JOSD2; Grasty2019Structural; Krassikova2020The).

## Structure
The JOSD2 protein, encoded by the human JOSD2 gene, is characterized by its Josephin domain, which is a conserved catalytic domain shared among members of the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) family of deubiquitinating enzymes. The primary structure of JOSD2 includes a sequence that shares 51% identity with Josephin-1, but only 23.5% and 21.8% with ataxin-3 and AT3L, respectively (Grasty2019Structural). The secondary structure of JOSD2 features a compact α/β/α sandwich configuration, with a central six-stranded beta sheet flanked by helices (Grasty2019Structural). 

The tertiary structure of JOSD2 reveals a highly dynamic enzyme with several large disordered loops, and it lacks several allosteric sites found in ataxin-3 (Grasty2019Structural). The protein's structure includes a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad, with Cys-24 serving as the active-site nucleophile (Grasty2019Structural). JOSD2 does not have a quaternary structure involving assembly with other protein subunits, as it consists solely of the Josephin domain without extensive regulatory regions (Grasty2019Structural). 

Post-translational modifications of JOSD2 may include ubiquitination, particularly at Lys-142, which is located in the β4-β4.5 loop and is ubiquitinated in cells, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism (Grasty2019Structural). The protein's dynamic nature and structural features suggest its involvement in protein quality control through the cleavage of specific ubiquitin linkages (Grasty2019Structural).

## Function
The JOSD2 gene encodes the Josephin-2 protein, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein degradation and glucose metabolism. Josephin-2 cleaves ubiquitin conjugates, including K11, K48, and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are crucial for directing proteins to the proteasome or mediating autophagy, thereby maintaining cellular protein quality control (Grasty2019Structural). Unlike some other deubiquitinases, Josephin-2's activity is not stimulated by free ubiquitin, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism (Grasty2019Structural).

In the context of glucose metabolism, JOSD2 plays a significant role by stabilizing key metabolic enzymes such as PHGDH, Aldolase A, and PFK-1, preventing their proteasomal degradation. This stabilization is essential for maintaining glycolytic activity and overall glucose catabolism (Krassikova2020The). JOSD2 forms a nutrient-sensitive complex with these enzymes, integrating glucose and serine metabolism, and its activity is influenced by cellular glucose levels (Krassikova2020The). The protein is primarily localized in the cytosol, where it interacts with and stabilizes these metabolic enzymes, highlighting its role in cellular energy homeostasis (Krassikova2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the JOSD2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and heart failure. In cancer, JOSD2 is identified as a positive regulator of glucose metabolism, specifically glycolysis, in cancer cells. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as it stabilizes and enhances the activity of glycolytic enzymes, promoting cancer cell proliferation and growth (Krassikova2020The). JOSD2's role in cancer metabolism is unique among Machado-Joseph disease deubiquitinases, as its knockdown leads to reduced glycolysis and growth retardation in cancer cells (Krassikova2020The).

In heart failure, JOSD2 expression is upregulated in conditions such as isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial infarction. JOSD2 exacerbates myocardial dysfunction by interacting with CaMKIIδ, a key enzyme in cardiomyocytes, promoting its phosphorylation and affecting calcium handling. This interaction leads to increased cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, suggesting that JOSD2 plays a detrimental role in cardiac dysfunction under stress conditions (Xu2024JOSD2). JOSD2 deficiency has been shown to protect against these cardiac abnormalities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in heart failure (Xu2024JOSD2).

## Interactions
JOSD2, a protein encoded by the human gene Josephin domain containing 2, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. JOSD2 interacts with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. This interaction inhibits PKM2's nuclear localization by reducing K433 acetylation, which affects the expression of genes involved in non-glycolytic functions, such as cyclinD1 and c-myc (Lei2022JOSD2).

In the context of glucose metabolism, JOSD2 interacts with metabolic enzymes like phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and Aldolase A. JOSD2 deubiquitinates these enzymes, preventing their proteasomal degradation and stabilizing them, which enhances glycolytic activity (Krassikova2020The).

JOSD2 also interacts with Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKIIδ) in cardiomyocytes. It deubiquitinates CaMKIIδ, promoting its phosphorylation and activation, which is linked to calcium mishandling and cardiac dysfunction (Xu2024JOSD2).

Structurally, JOSD2 can cleave both K63-linked and K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, indicating its role in protein degradation pathways. It has a preference for K11 and K48 linkages, suggesting specific regulatory functions in protein quality control (Grasty2019Structural).
