# SELENOI

## Overview
SELENOI is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein I, a member of the selenoprotein family characterized by the inclusion of the amino acid selenocysteine. Selenoprotein I functions primarily as an ethanolamine phosphotransferase, playing a crucial role in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and plasmenyl PE, which are vital components of cellular membranes. This protein is a multi-pass transmembrane protein predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, although it was initially thought to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. The catalytic activity of selenoprotein I is integral to the Kennedy pathway, facilitating the transfer of phosphoethanolamine to diacylglycerol or alkyl-acylglycerol. Despite its classification as a selenoprotein, the selenocysteine residue in selenoprotein I is not directly involved in its enzymatic function. Mutations in the SELENOI gene have been linked to various neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Santesmasses2021Pathogenic; Ma2021Roles; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

## Structure
SELENOI, also known as selenoprotein I, is a multi-pass transmembrane protein primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, although it was initially thought to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (Ma2021Roles; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). The protein contains seven transmembrane domains and is embedded in the lipid bilayer, with its catalytic domain located within a membrane pocket accessible from the cytoplasm (Ma2021Roles; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). SELENOI is characterized by a CDP-alcohol phosphatidyl transferase domain, which is highly conserved and shared with other phosphotransferases like CHPT1 and CEPT1 (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”).

The protein's structure includes a unique COOH-terminal extension containing a selenocysteine (Sec) residue at position 387, which is located near the C-terminus and predicted to reside in the cytosol, away from the active site within the membrane pocket (Ma2021Roles; Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). This Sec residue is not directly involved in the catalytic function of SELENOI, as evidenced by experiments showing that a Sec-deficient protein retains enzymatic activity (Ma2021Roles). The protein's catalytic activity is associated with three conserved aspartic residues within a DG(X)2AR(X)8G(X)3D(X)3D structural motif (Dogaru2023“Alphabet”). The precise function of the Sec residue remains unknown (Chaudière2023Biological).

## Function
Selenoprotein I (SELENOI) is a unique member of the selenoprotein family, primarily functioning as an ethanolamine phosphotransferase (Ept) involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and plasmenyl PE, which are essential components of cellular membranes (Ma2021Roles). This synthesis occurs in the Kennedy pathway, where SELENOI catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine from cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol (DAG) or alkyl-acylglycerol (AAG) (Ma2021Roles). SELENOI is a transmembrane protein localized mainly in the Golgi apparatus, with its catalytic domain accessible from the cytoplasm (Ma2021Roles).

In healthy human cells, SELENOI plays a critical role in maintaining cellular functions, particularly in the immune system, by supporting metabolic reprogramming during T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation (Ma2021Roles). SELENOI deficiency can impair these processes, reducing T cell proliferative capacity and affecting differentiation into various phenotypes, which has implications for immune responses (Ma2021Roles). Despite being a selenoprotein, SELENOI does not contain the typical C-X-X-U motif found in redox selenoenzymes, and its selenocysteine residue is not directly involved in its catalytic function (Ma2021Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SELENOI gene, also known as selenoprotein I, are associated with a range of neurological and developmental disorders. Notably, pathogenic variants in SELENOI have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative condition characterized by spastic paraparesis. Two specific mutations have been identified: a missense variant p.Arg112Pro and a splice variant affecting exons 6 and 8. These mutations result in a loss of function, significantly reducing the enzymatic activity of SELENOI, which is crucial for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway (Santesmasses2021Pathogenic; Ahmed2017A).

The clinical manifestations of SELENOI mutations include complex neurodegenerative phenotypes such as delayed motor development, spastic paraparesis, intellectual impairment, and language acquisition delays. Neuroimaging often reveals increased T2 intensity in the periventricular white matter, and some patients exhibit demyelinating peripheral neuropathy and retinal pigmentary disturbances (Ahmed2017A). In severe cases, mutations can lead to early-onset severe retinal dystrophy, epilepsy, progressive bilateral hearing loss, and cerebellar ataxia (Kaiyrzhanov2021Defective).

The inheritance pattern of these conditions is typically autosomal recessive, with affected individuals being homozygous for the mutations, while unaffected relatives are heterozygous (Santesmasses2021Pathogenic). These findings underscore the critical role of SELENOI in neurodevelopment and its potential impact on human health when mutated.

## Interactions
Selenoprotein I (SELENOI) is an integral component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it plays a crucial role in the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. While direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed, SELENOI is implied to interact with ER membrane components and substrates involved in the Kennedy pathway, such as CDP-ethanolamine and 1,2-diacylglycerol, to catalyze the formation of PE (Avery2020Selenoprotein). This interaction is essential for cellular membrane formation and various cellular processes.

SELENOI's activity in the Kennedy pathway suggests potential indirect interactions with proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis and cellular signaling. The enzyme's function is critical for embryogenesis, as evidenced by the early embryonic lethality observed in SELENOI knockout mice, indicating its essential role in developmental processes (Avery2020Selenoprotein). Although specific protein partners or nucleic acid interactions are not identified, SELENOI's involvement in these pathways implies its participation in broader cellular networks related to lipid metabolism and membrane dynamics.
