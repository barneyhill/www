# ZBED3

## Overview
ZBED3 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger BED-type containing 3 protein, which is a crucial component in various cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger BED-type domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as Axin, to modulate cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Chen2009Identification). ZBED3 is predominantly localized in the cytosol, where it forms complexes with Axin, influencing the stability and activity of β-catenin (Chen2009Identification). The protein's role extends to developmental processes, such as cortical layer formation in the brain, and it is implicated in pathological conditions, including non-small cell lung cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus, due to its regulatory effects on signaling pathways and cellular metabolism (Ruan2021Zbed3; Jia2014Zinc‐finger).

## Function
ZBED3 is a protein that plays a significant role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. ZBED3 interacts with Axin, a key component of this pathway, through a PPPPSPT motif that is essential for its binding. This interaction stabilizes cytoplasmic β-catenin, leading to increased transcriptional activity of LEF-1-dependent reporter genes (Chen2009Identification). ZBED3 is primarily localized in the cytosol and colocalizes with Axin, suggesting that they form a complex in the cytoplasm (Chen2009Identification).

In the developing brain, ZBED3 is indispensable for the formation of cortical layers in the neocortex. It regulates the positioning and identity of neurons by influencing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of ZBED3 results in neurons acquiring deep-layer identities, while knockdown shifts neurons to more superficial layers (Ruan2021Zbed3). This regulation is crucial for proper neuronal layer fate and positioning during cortical development (Ruan2021Zbed3). ZBED3's role in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZBED3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In NSCLC, ZBED3 expression is significantly elevated in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues, with a positive expression rate of 59% in cancerous tissues versus 24% in normal tissues. This elevated expression is associated with advanced cancer stages, lymph node metastasis, and higher Ki67 status, indicating a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Patients with higher ZBED3 expression have shorter survival times, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. ZBED3 contributes to cancer progression by regulating β-catenin and downstream molecules of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as c-myc, cyclin D1, and MMP7, which are involved in cell proliferation and invasion (Fan2014Zbed3; Shi2018Zbed3).

In the context of metabolic disorders, ZBED3 is associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. Higher ZBED3 mRNA and protein expression levels are observed in the muscle and adipose tissues of T2DM patients compared to healthy controls. ZBED3 overexpression inhibits insulin-dependent activation of insulin receptor and Akt phosphorylation, indicating interference with insulin signaling pathways. This suggests that ZBED3 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and T2DM (Jia2014Zinc‐finger).

## Interactions
ZBED3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with Axin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is facilitated by a PPPPSPT motif in ZBED3, which is phosphorylated by GSK3β and CKI family kinases, enhancing the binding to Axin (Chen2009Identification). The interaction with Axin is crucial for ZBED3's role in modulating Wnt signaling, as it stabilizes β-catenin, leading to increased transcriptional activity (Chen2009Identification).

In the context of cancer, ZBED3 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and interacts with β-catenin and p120-catenin-1, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Fan2014Zbed3; Shi2018Zbed3). ZBED3's interaction with the Axin-GSK3β complex is essential for inhibiting β-catenin degradation, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling activity (Shi2018Zbed3).

ZBED3 also participates in the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) in mice, interacting with Mater, a component of the SCMC, which is crucial for early embryogenesis and organelle distribution (Gao2017Zbed3). Additionally, ZBED3 interacts with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in the liver, contributing to hepatic steatosis by regulating lipid metabolism (Wu2024Zinc).
