# TGFB1I1

## Overview
TGFB1I1 is a gene that encodes the protein transforming growth factor beta 1 induced transcript 1, also known as Hic-5 or ARA55. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein and is primarily involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. It functions within focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton, playing a critical role in signal transduction pathways that affect cellular responses to external stimuli. TGFB1I1 is particularly significant in the regulation of androgen receptor activity and integrin signaling pathways, which are essential for various physiological processes, including male sexual differentiation and epithelial cell growth. The protein's involvement in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway further underscores its importance in cell-matrix adhesion and modulation of Smad proteins, which are vital for TGF-β1 signaling (Li2012Identification; Ohnishi2008Antagonistic).

## Structure


## Function
TGFB1I1, also known as transforming growth factor beta 1 induced transcript 1, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. It functions as an adaptor protein within focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape and motility. TGFB1I1 is involved in signal transduction pathways, impacting cellular responses to external stimuli (Li2012Identification).

In healthy human cells, TGFB1I1 is implicated in the regulation of androgen receptor activity, which is crucial for male sexual differentiation. The protein encoded by TGFB1I1 is thought to adjust the growth process of epithelial cells through integrin signaling pathways, serotonin, and protein kinase C. It also plays a role in the redistribution of the platelet serotonin transporter, which is essential for platelet aggregation, adhesion, movement, and muscle cell generation (Li2012Identification).

TGFB1I1 is also involved in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, where it is regulated by proteins such as ΔFosB and Δ2ΔFosB, which enhance TGF-β1 signaling. This regulation is crucial for processes like cell-matrix adhesion and the modulation of Smad proteins, which are important for TGF-β1 signaling (Ohnishi2008Antagonistic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TGFB1I1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, TGFB1I1 is upregulated in patients who are sensitive to FOLFOX4 chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting chemotherapy outcomes (Li2012Identification). In osteosarcoma, TGFB1I1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, which may contribute to tumor progression (Li2019PTHR1May). The gene is also part of a regulatory network involving miR-124-3p and the androgen receptor, which may influence osteosarcoma progression (Li2019PTHR1May).

In bladder cancer, TGFB1I1 expression is higher in advanced stages and is associated with macrophage senescence, potentially affecting tumor growth and immune interactions (Jiang2023Construction). The gene's upregulation is linked to tumor-promoting stroma construction and senescence-like phenotypes (Jiang2023Construction).

In gastric cancer, particularly the diffuse-type, TGFB1I1 is highly expressed in subgroups associated with poor prognosis, indicating its role in cancer progression through EMT-related pathways (Kim2019Identification). These findings suggest that TGFB1I1 plays a significant role in cancer biology, influencing tumor growth, progression, and response to treatment.

## Interactions
TGFB1I1, also known as Hic-5, is a protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. It is known to interact with several proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Pyk2, PTP-PEST, vinculin, and p95PKL. These interactions are crucial for its role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion, although Hic-5 is not phosphorylated by integrin stimulation and lacks a target site for the Crk SH2 domain (Nishiya2001Hic5Reduced).

TGFB1I1 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), acting as a coactivator. This interaction is significant in the context of osteosarcoma progression, where TGFB1I1, also known as ARA55, may stimulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, contributing to tumor progression (Li2019PTHR1May). Additionally, TGFB1I1 is involved in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, where it is upregulated by ΔFosB and Δ2ΔFosB proteins, which positively regulate TGF-β1 signaling and cell-matrix adhesion (Ohnishi2008Antagonistic). These interactions highlight TGFB1I1's role in complex signaling networks and its potential impact on cellular processes and disease progression.
