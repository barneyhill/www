# GINS4

## Overview
GINS4 is a gene that encodes the protein GINS complex subunit 4, a critical component of the GINS complex involved in DNA replication. The GINS complex, which includes GINS4, is essential for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication, working in concert with other replication factors to ensure the stability and progression of the replication fork (Liu2021Overexpression). GINS4 is categorized as a nuclear protein due to its role in maintaining genomic integrity during the S phase of the cell cycle (Yang2019LSH). The protein's interactions with other components of the GINS complex, such as Sld5, Psf1, and Psf2, form a stable tetrameric structure crucial for DNA replication initiation (Kubota2003A). Beyond its fundamental role in normal cellular processes, alterations in GINS4 expression have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Yang2019LSH).

## Function
GINS4, a component of the GINS complex, plays a crucial role in the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication. It interacts with other replication factors such as CDC45 and MCM proteins to ensure the stability and progression of the replication fork, which is essential for accurate DNA replication and cell division (Liu2021Overexpression). This complex is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic integrity by facilitating the proper duplication of the genome during the S phase of the cell cycle (Yang2019LSH).

In healthy human cells, GINS4 is involved in the normal process of DNA replication, which is a fundamental aspect of cell division and growth (Liu2021Overexpression). The GINS complex, including GINS4, is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, a process that is critical for cell proliferation and the maintenance of genomic stability (Yang2019LSH). By ensuring the accurate replication of DNA, GINS4 helps maintain the integrity of the genome, preventing mutations that could lead to cellular dysfunction or disease.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GINS4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and glioma. In NSCLC, GINS4 is highly expressed in lung cancer tissues, such as lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and is associated with poor survival outcomes. Its expression is linked to clinical stages and lymphatic metastasis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Yang2019LSH). Knockdown of GINS4 in lung cancer cells results in reduced cancer progression, decreased cell growth, and impaired migration and invasion abilities, suggesting its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yang2019LSH).

In glioma, GINS4 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and survival. It is associated with higher WHO grades, age, and specific genetic profiles, such as wild-type IDH and absence of 1p19 codeletion. GINS4 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, indicating its potential role in modulating the immune microenvironment in glioma (Liu2021Overexpression).

Mutations in GINS4 can lead to natural killer cell deficiency (NKD), characterized by low NK cell numbers and susceptibility to viral infections. These mutations affect the assembly of the GINS complex, crucial for DNA replication (Guilz2023Unwinding).

## Interactions
GINS4, a component of the GINS complex, is involved in several critical interactions essential for DNA replication. It interacts with other proteins such as Sld5, Psf1, and Psf2 to form a stable tetrameric complex, which is crucial for the initiation of DNA replication (Kubota2003A). In the context of non-small cell lung cancer, GINS4 interacts with the lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH), which binds to the GINS4 mRNA, stabilizing it and promoting its expression. This interaction is significant for tumorigenesis, as LSH upregulates GINS4 mRNA expression by binding to its 3'UTR region (Yang2019LSH).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, GINS4 interacts with several long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, suggesting its role in modulating the cell cycle and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway (Zhang2021Overexpression). Additionally, structural studies in zebrafish have shown that mutations affecting GINS4 can alter its interaction with other GINS complex components, impacting DNA replication processes (Varga2020TissueSpecific). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of GINS4 in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
