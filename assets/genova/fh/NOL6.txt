# NOL6

## Overview
NOL6 is a gene that encodes the nucleolar protein 6, a nucleolar RNA-associated protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is primarily involved in the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, a critical cellular structure for ribosome production and function. Nucleolar protein 6 plays a significant role in the formation of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for translating messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins, thereby supporting cellular growth and proliferation (He2022NOL6). While the specific functions of NOL6 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in ribosome biogenesis underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health. Additionally, NOL6 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and specific language impairment, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (He2022NOL6; Andres2023Innovative).

## Structure


## Function
Nucleolar protein 6 (NOL6) is a nucleolar RNA-associated protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for protein synthesis and cellular growth. NOL6 is involved in the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the nucleolus, contributing to the formation of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for the translation of mRNA into proteins (He2022NOL6). The nucleolus, where NOL6 is active, is a key site for rRNA gene storage, rRNA synthesis processing, and ribosomal subunit assembly, highlighting the importance of NOL6 in maintaining cellular function and proliferation (He2022NOL6).

While the specific function of NOL6 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the studies, its role in ribosome biogenesis suggests it is vital for normal cellular operations. The protein's involvement in these processes indicates its importance in supporting the overall growth and proliferation of cells, which are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis and organismal health (He2022NOL6). The absence of detailed studies on NOL6 in non-cancerous cells leaves some aspects of its function in healthy cells to be further explored.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOL6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly gastric cancer and specific language impairment (SLI). In gastric cancer, NOL6 is overexpressed in cancer cells compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and advanced pathological TNM stages, suggesting that NOL6 may function as an oncogene in this context. Knockdown of NOL6 in gastric cancer cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (He2022NOL6).

In the context of specific language impairment, studies have identified likely pathogenic variants in NOL6 across multiple families, suggesting its involvement in gene pathways related to language impairment. These variants have been associated with low performance on language tests, indicating a potential genetic basis for SLI. The research highlights the importance of considering both gene-level and variant-level significance when evaluating the role of NOL6 in language disorders (Andres2023Innovative).

Additionally, in Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations or silencing of NOL6 enhance resistance to bacterial infections, suggesting a role in innate immunity. This resistance is linked to increased activity of a p53 homologue, CEP-1, indicating that NOL6 may suppress immune responses by inhibiting p53 activity (Fuhrman2009Nucleolar).

## Interactions
NOL6, a nucleolar protein, is primarily involved in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of human prostate cancer, NOL6 is regulated by microRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-590-3p, which can interfere with its expression. Overexpression of miR-590-3p in prostate cancer cells leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating an inhibitory interaction between miR-590-3p and NOL6 (Dong2020NOL6).

In gastric cancer cells, NOL6 interacts with several downstream genes, including TP53I3, CDK4, and MCM7. Knockdown of NOL6 results in the upregulation of TP53I3 and downregulation of CDK4 and MCM7, suggesting that NOL6 may form part of a regulatory network influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis (He2022NOL6). These interactions highlight NOL6's role in modulating oncogenic behaviors in cancer cells.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, NOL6 interacts with the p53 homolog CEP-1, where its inhibition enhances resistance to bacterial infections. This interaction suggests that NOL6 may suppress innate immunity by maintaining low levels of active p53, thereby regulating immune responses (Fuhrman2009Nucleolar).
