# ANGPT2

## Overview
ANGPT2 is a gene that encodes the protein angiopoietin 2, which is a critical component in the regulation of vascular development and remodeling. Angiopoietin 2 is categorized as a ligand for the TIE2 receptor, playing a dual role as both an antagonist and a weak agonist, depending on the cellular context. This protein is involved in the angiopoietin-TIE signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis and influencing endothelial cell functions such as migration and tube formation. Angiopoietin 2's interactions with the TIE2 receptor and integrins underscore its significance in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, contributing to vascular stability and remodeling. The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and vascular diseases, highlighting its clinical relevance (Leppänen2020Characterization; Souma2018Contextdependent; Akwii2019Role).

## Structure
ANGPT2 (angiopoietin 2) is a protein involved in vascular development and remodeling, characterized by a modular structure. The primary structure of ANGPT2 includes a signal peptide, an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, which is crucial for binding to the TIE2 receptor (Kiss2019Antiangiogenic; Leppänen2020Characterization). The secondary structure comprises alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function.

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing ANGPT2 to form asymmetric homodimers. These dimers interact with the TIE2 receptor in a 2:1 stoichiometry, which is essential for its role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (Leppänen2020Characterization). The quaternary structure of ANGPT2 is characterized by its ability to form homodimers, which are extended molecules with two globular domains arranged asymmetrically (Leppänen2020Characterization).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are suggested by the presence of an N-glycosylation consensus sequence, particularly affected by the N304K mutation (Leppänen2020Characterization). ANGPT2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which can alter its functional properties, as seen in trauma-associated acute lung injury (Meyer2011ANGPT2). These structural features are critical for ANGPT2's function as both an antagonist and a weak agonist of TIE2, influencing vascular remodeling and endothelial cell responsiveness (Kiss2019Antiangiogenic).

## Function
ANGPT2 (angiopoietin 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the angiopoietin-TIE signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, ANGPT2 can function as both an agonist and antagonist of the TIE2 receptor, depending on the cellular context and the presence of other regulatory proteins such as VEPTP (Souma2018Contextdependent). In blood endothelial cells, ANGPT2 typically acts as an antagonist to ANGPT1-mediated TIE2 activation, which can lead to vascular instability. However, in lymphatic endothelial cells, where VEPTP is absent, ANGPT2 acts as a primary TIE2 agonist, promoting lymphangiogenesis (Souma2018Contextdependent).

ANGPT2's role in vascular physiology includes influencing endothelial cell functions such as migration and tube formation, and it can induce Tie2 phosphorylation at high concentrations, activating downstream pathways like PI3K and Akt, which promote cell survival and proliferation (Akwii2019Role). ANGPT2 is also involved in regulating vascular stability and remodeling, acting as a Tie2 agonist in healthy conditions to promote vessel enlargement without leakage (Kim2016Opposing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANGPT2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, high ANGPT2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and worse overall survival, acting as an independent risk factor involved in tumor-related pathways such as the p53 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways (Yang2022Immunoregulation). In colorectal cancer, ANGPT2 is associated with poor prognosis, angiogenesis, and resistance to chemotherapy, although it is not correlated with specific molecular subtypes or common genomic alterations (Jary2020Molecular).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, high ANGPT2 expression is associated with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival, with its expression inversely correlated with CpG methylation near its transcription start site (Martinelli2013ANGPT2promoter). ANGPT2 mutations are also implicated in primary lymphedema, where they can lead to loss of function and dominant negative effects, affecting lymphatic vessel development and function (Leppänen2020Characterization).

In trauma-associated acute lung injury, genetic variants in ANGPT2 are linked to altered plasma isoform ratios and increased risk of the condition, potentially affecting endothelial cell function and vascular integrity (Meyer2011ANGPT2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANGPT2 in various pathological contexts.

## Interactions
ANGPT2 (angiopoietin 2) interacts with several proteins, primarily through its binding to the TIE2 receptor and integrins. ANGPT2 can act as both an agonist and antagonist of the TIE2 receptor, depending on the cellular context. In endothelial cells, ANGPT2 typically functions as an antagonist, blocking the activation of TIE2 by ANGPT1, which is crucial for vessel maturation and stability (Maisonpierre1997Angiopoietin2). However, in certain conditions, such as in non-endothelial cells, ANGPT2 can act as an agonist for TIE2 (Maisonpierre1997Angiopoietin2).

ANGPT2 also interacts with integrins, including αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1, albeit with lower affinity compared to TIE2. These interactions are significant in TIE2-negative endothelial cells, where ANGPT2 promotes angiogenesis by activating integrin-mediated signaling pathways, leading to cell migration and sprouting (Felcht2012Angiopoietin-2). ANGPT2's binding to integrins is enhanced by cations, suggesting a role for the MIDAS motif in integrin adhesion (Felcht2012Angiopoietin-2). These interactions highlight ANGPT2's dual role in vascular remodeling, acting as a destabilizing factor in TIE2-expressing cells and a proangiogenic factor in TIE2-negative cells (Felcht2012Angiopoietin-2).
