# CHMP4B

## Overview
CHMP4B is a gene that encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 4B, a key component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT-III). This protein plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies, cytokinesis, and membrane remodeling. As a core component of the ESCRT-III complex, CHMP4B is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of primary cilia and facilitating the abscission phase of cytokinesis, which is essential for proper cell division and cellular signaling (Hu2015High; Jung2019ESCRT). The protein's interactions with other ESCRT-III components and regulatory proteins, such as ALIX and CC2D1A, underscore its importance in endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking (Katoh2003The; Martinelli2012CC2D1A). Mutations in the CHMP4B gene have been linked to autosomal dominant cataracts, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract formation (Shiels2007CHMP4B).

## Structure
The CHMP4B protein is a human ortholog of the yeast Snf7/Vps32 and is a core component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is crucial for the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Shiels2007CHMP4B). The protein is approximately 25 kDa in size and is characterized by a highly charged helical structure, with distinct N-terminal basic and C-terminal acidic halves (Shiels2007CHMP4B). The primary structure of CHMP4B includes a conserved SNF7 domain, which contains at least four predicted helical domains (Shiels2007CHMP4B).

The secondary structure of CHMP4B involves alpha-helices, with the C-terminal tail adopting an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation when bound to the Brox protein (Mu2012Two). The tertiary structure includes a helical hairpin formed by two alpha-helices, α1 and α2, which are crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins (Martinelli2012CC2D1A). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other ESCRT-III components and proteins like ALIX, where the Bro1 domain of ALIX binds to the C-terminal regions of CHMP4B (McCullough2008ALIXCHMP4).

CHMP4B is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and function (Katoh2003The). The protein also interacts with CC2D1A, which acts as a negative regulator by preventing CHMP4B polymerization (Martinelli2012CC2D1A).

## Function
CHMP4B is a crucial component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, cytokinesis, and membrane remodeling. In healthy human cells, CHMP4B plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and function as sensory organelles. It localizes to primary cilia and stabilizes the high curvature of the ciliary membrane, ensuring proper ciliary structure and function (Jung2019ESCRT).

CHMP4B is also involved in the abscission phase of cytokinesis, where it facilitates the separation of daughter cells by accumulating at the midbody and relocalizing to constriction zones. This function is critical for normal cell division and maintaining centrosome and spindle integrity (Hu2015High; Sagona2014Association). Additionally, CHMP4B is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the degradation of membrane proteins through the formation of multivesicular bodies, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis (Horii2006CHMP7).

The protein's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is also notable, as it influences cilium assembly and elongation, highlighting its role in cellular architecture and dynamics (Jung2019ESCRT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHMP4B gene are associated with autosomal dominant forms of cataracts, particularly posterior polar cataracts. These cataracts are characterized by disc-like opacities at the posterior pole of the lens and can vary in age-at-diagnosis and age-at-surgery, with incomplete penetrance observed in some cases (Shiels2007CHMP4B; Zhou2019A). Specific missense mutations, such as p.H57R, p.D129V, and p.E161K, have been linked to this condition (Wang2021Broadening). The p.D129V mutation, in particular, has been shown to impair cellular processes like chromatin binding, which may contribute to cataract formation (Sagona2014Association).

In mouse models, homozygous mutations in Chmp4b result in embryonic lethality, highlighting the gene's critical role in development (Zhou2019A). The CHMP4B gene is also involved in autophagy, and its dysfunction can impair autophagolysosomal degradation, potentially leading to cataract formation (RodríguezSolana2023Whole). These findings underscore the importance of CHMP4B in maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract development. The gene's role in the ESCRT-III complex suggests that its mutations may lead to deleterious gain-of-function effects, affecting lens transparency and contributing to cataract formation (Shiels2007CHMP4B).

## Interactions
CHMP4B, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking. It interacts with Alix, a protein involved in endosomal sorting, through a direct physical interaction confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. This interaction is mediated by the Bro1-rhophilin conserved domain in the N-terminal region of Alix, and CHMP4B is identified as a major binding partner among the CHMP4 isoforms (Katoh2004CHMP4b; Katoh2003The).

CHMP4B also interacts with SKD1 E235Q, a mutant form of the AAA-type ATPase SKD1, which is defective in ATP hydrolysis. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in the endosomal sorting pathway, as CHMP4B co-localizes with SKD1 E235Q in HeLa cells (Katoh2003The).

Additionally, CHMP4B interacts with CC2D1A, an adaptor protein for ESCRT-III, forming a 1:1 complex with high affinity. This interaction involves a charged patch on CHMP4B's helical hairpin, preventing its polymerization and suggesting a regulatory role in CHMP4B function (Martinelli2012CC2D1A).

CHMP4B's interactions extend to other CHMP proteins and VPS4A, a MIT domain-containing protein, indicating its involvement in a complex network of interactions within the ESCRT-III complex (Tsang2006A).
