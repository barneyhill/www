# CNPY1

## Overview
CNPY1, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways. The protein encoded by CNPY1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the maturation and proper folding of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). This role is crucial for enhancing FGF signaling, which is vital for various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and development (Matsui2011Canopy1). In zebrafish, CNPY1 is essential for the proper clustering of dorsal forerunner cells during organogenesis, impacting left-right patterning in vertebrate development (Matsui2011Canopy1). The protein's interaction with ER chaperones and its involvement in a positive feedback loop with FGF8 further underscore its significance in maintaining FGF signaling pathways (Schildknegt2019Characterization).

## Function
CNPY1, also known as canopy FGF signaling regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathways. This protein plays a critical role in cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and development. CNPY1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it assists in the maturation of FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1), thereby enhancing FGF signaling (Matsui2011Canopy1). The protein interacts with ER chaperones and folding-assisting enzymes, supporting its role in protein maturation (Matsui2011Canopy1).

In zebrafish embryos, CNPY1 functions as a positive feedback regulator of FGF signaling, which is crucial for the clustering of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) during the organogenesis of Kupffer's vesicle (KV). This process is essential for proper left-right patterning in vertebrate development (Matsui2011Canopy1). Disruption of CNPY1 leads to defects in DFC clustering, ciliogenesis, and left-right patterning, similar to the phenotypes observed when FGF signaling is disrupted (Matsui2011Canopy1). CNPY1-mediated FGF signaling induces cadherin1 (cdh1), which is responsible for generating cell adhesion between DFCs, highlighting its role in cell adhesion and cluster formation (Matsui2011Canopy1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CNPY1 is a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a significant role in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling by interacting with fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). This interaction is crucial for the maturation and cell surface expression of FGFR1, thereby enhancing FGF signaling pathways. CNPY1 assists in the maturation of FGFR1 within the ER, as demonstrated by in vitro glycosylation assays that show increased maturation of FGFR1 in cells overexpressing CNPY1 (Matsui2011Canopy1). 

Proteomic data suggest that CNPY1 binds to ER chaperones and folding-assisting enzymes, supporting its role in protein maturation (Matsui2011Canopy1). In zebrafish, CNPY1 is expressed in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and is involved in maintaining this boundary and the clustering of dorsal forerunner cells, processes dependent on FGF signaling. The expression of CNPY1 is increased by FGF8, indicating a positive feedback loop that enhances FGF signaling by boosting FGFR synthesis (Schildknegt2019Characterization). 

There is no evidence in the provided context of CNPY1 directly interacting with nucleic acids or forming multiprotein complexes beyond its interaction with FGFR1.
