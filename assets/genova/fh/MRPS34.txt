# MRPS34

## Overview
The MRPS34 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S34, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins necessary for cellular energy production and metabolism (Eilers2020Local; Huang2022A). MRPS34 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Richman2015Mutation). The protein's interactions with other ribosomal proteins and 12S rRNA are vital for the stability and assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome, impacting the efficiency of mitochondrial translation processes (Richman2015Mutation). Mutations in the MRPS34 gene have been associated with mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 32 and Leigh syndrome (Billingsley2018Genetic).

## Structure
The MRPS34 protein is a component of the small ribosomal subunit in mitochondria, specifically part of the 28S subunit. It is conserved across species, from humans to zebrafish, indicating its essential role in mitochondrial function (Richman2015Mutation). The primary structure of MRPS34 includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MRPS34 gene, with specific mutations such as a leucine to proline substitution at position 68 affecting its function (Richman2015Mutation).

The secondary structure of MRPS34 is predicted to include alpha helices, which are crucial for its stability and function. A mutation in the gene can disrupt these alpha helices, leading to compromised protein synthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction (Richman2015Mutation). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D conformation of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other ribosomal components.

In terms of quaternary structure, MRPS34 associates with the small mitoribosomal subunit, playing a critical role in the stability and assembly of the mitoribosome. This interaction is vital for mitochondrial translation and the maintenance of mitochondrial function (Lake2017Biallelic). The protein's role in binding 12S rRNA suggests its involvement in ribosomal stability and function (Richman2015Mutation).

## Function
MRPS34 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the small 28S subunit. This protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Huang2022A). The proper functioning of MRPS34 is crucial for cellular metabolism and overall organismal health, as it impacts the efficiency of mitochondrial translation processes (Eilers2020Local).

In healthy human cells, MRPS34 is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome, contributing to the synthesis of proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation and other mitochondrial functions. This process is vital for the production of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell, and supports various cellular activities that depend on energy supply (Nöcker2021Thermal). The protein's activity is localized within the mitochondria, where it interacts with other ribosomal proteins and RNA to form a functional ribosome capable of translating mitochondrial-encoded genes (Doi2021Regulation). The efficient operation of MRPS34 is therefore integral to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function, influencing cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MRPS34 gene have been linked to several mitochondrial disorders, notably Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 32, which is characterized by neurological abnormalities, including movement disorders similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) (Billingsley2018Genetic). The gene encodes a component of the small mitochondrial ribosome subunit, and mutations can lead to decreased protein levels, destabilizing this subunit and affecting mitochondrial function (Billingsley2018Genetic). This destabilization suggests a role in mitochondrial processes distinct from mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis, which are implicated in PD (Billingsley2018Genetic).

MRPS34 is also associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder, further underscoring its clinical significance in mitochondrial diseases (Billingsley2018Genetic). The gene's expression in the brain has been negatively associated with PD risk, indicating that alterations in its expression levels may influence disease susceptibility (Billingsley2018Genetic). Additionally, MRPS34 is co-expressed with genes implicated in monogenic forms of PD, suggesting potential functional interactions that could contribute to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Billingsley2018Genetic). These findings highlight the complex role of MRPS34 in mitochondrial-related diseases and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
MRPS34 is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that plays a crucial role in the stability and function of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit. It is essential for mitochondrial translation and interacts with other ribosomal proteins and nucleic acids to maintain the integrity of the ribosomal subunit. MRPS34 is involved in the stability and assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit, interacting with proteins such as MRPS16, MRPS25, and MRPS35. These interactions are vital for the stability of these proteins and the overall function of the ribosome (Richman2015Mutation).

The MRPS34 protein also interacts with the 12S rRNA, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, suggesting that it may act as a 12S rRNA-binding protein. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stability of the 12S rRNA and the small ribosomal subunit, which are essential for the formation of actively translating mitoribosomes (Richman2015Mutation). The mutation in the Mrps34 gene leads to decreased levels of MRPS34, affecting the stability of the small ribosomal subunit and the 12S rRNA, resulting in reduced formation of actively translating mitoribosomes (Richman2015Mutation). These interactions highlight the importance of MRPS34 in mitochondrial protein synthesis and its role in maintaining mitochondrial function.
