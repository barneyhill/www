# CLU

## Overview
Clusterin (CLU) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional glycoprotein known as clusterin, which is involved in a wide array of physiological processes. The protein is categorized as a chaperone due to its role in maintaining protein homeostasis by preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins and facilitating their clearance. Clusterin exists in multiple isoforms, including a secreted form (sCLU) and a nuclear form (nCLU), each with distinct functions. The secreted form is primarily involved in extracellular activities such as modulating immune responses and interacting with receptors to aid in the removal of cellular debris, while the nuclear form is associated with apoptosis and DNA repair processes. CLU's involvement in various cellular interactions and pathways underscores its significance in health and disease, with implications in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders (Praharaj2021Clusterin; Rohne2016The; Foster2019Clusterin).

## Structure
Clusterin (CLU) is a glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of human CLU includes a 22-mer hydrophobic signal peptide essential for its translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it folds into a precursor protein of approximately 60 kDa with five intramolecular disulfide bonds (Satapathy2021The). The protein undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation at six asparagine residues, contributing significantly to its mass (Kapron1997Identification). 

The secondary structure of CLU is predicted to contain three amphipathic α-helices and two coiled-coil regions, although the tertiary structure remains undetermined due to its extensive glycosylation and formation of heterogeneous oligomers (Satapathy2021The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of α- and β-chains linked by disulfide bonds, which are cleaved from a precursor in the Golgi apparatus (Essabbani2010Identification).

CLU exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing and different translation start sites. The secreted form (sCLU) is a 75-80 kDa glycosylated heterodimer, while a nuclear-targeting form (nCLU) is associated with cell death (Rizzi2009Chapter). The protein's glycosylation is crucial for its function, influencing its role in physiological processes and stress responses (Kapron1997Identification).

## Function
Clusterin (CLU), also known as apolipoprotein J, is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It acts as an extracellular chaperone, preventing the aggregation of denatured proteins and facilitating their removal through lysosomal digestion. This chaperone activity is ATP-independent and involves binding to client proteins via hydrophobic interactions, forming soluble complexes that prevent protein aggregation (Rohne2016The). CLU is highly glycosylated, which is crucial for its proper folding and chaperone function, although the removal of terminal sugars does not significantly affect its activity (Rohne2016The).

Secretory clusterin (sCLU) plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular defense mechanisms. It interacts with receptors from the LDL-receptor gene family and scavenger receptors, aiding in the degradation and excretion of cellular toxins (Rohne2016The). sCLU is also involved in the removal of dead cells and cellular debris, acting as a ligand for LDLR family proteins and facilitating phagocytosis by nonprofessional phagocytes like epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Klock2009Chapter). In the immune system, sCLU prevents inappropriate immune reactions by inhibiting complement activation and enhancing the removal of dead cells (Klock2009Chapter).

## Clinical Significance
The CLU gene, also known as clusterin, is implicated in several diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CLU is a significant genetic risk factor, with variants such as rs11136000 associated with altered risk. These variants can influence CLU expression in brain regions and affect amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation and clearance, contributing to AD pathogenesis (Lambert2009Genome-wide; Foster2019Clusterin). Mutations in the CLU gene, particularly in the β-chain, can lead to protein retention and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing AD risk (Bettens2015Reduced).

In cancer, CLU expression is often altered, promoting tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. For instance, in prostate cancer, therapies like paclitaxel increase CLU expression, while in colon and breast cancer, the tumor suppressor p53 suppresses it (Praharaj2021Clusterin). CLU is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, where it aids in lipid transport and reduces apoptosis and inflammation (Foster2019Clusterin).

In neurological disorders, CLU is linked to Parkinson's disease, where it is found in cortical Lewy bodies and elevated in cerebrospinal fluid during early stages (Charnay2012Clusterin). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CLU in disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
Clusterin (CLU) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as apoptosis and DNA repair. One significant interaction is with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, a component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex involved in nonhomologous DNA end joining repair of double-strand breaks. This interaction is specific to the nuclear form of CLU, known as CLU/XIP8, and is induced by ionizing radiation in MCF-7 cells. The nuclear form of CLU/XIP8 coimmunoprecipitates with Ku70 and Ku80, suggesting a role in signaling cell death rather than immediate DNA repair (Yang2000Nuclear).

CLU also interacts with Heat Shock Protein 60 (HSP60) in neuroblastoma cells. This interaction is primarily with the alpha chain of CLU and is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays. HSP60 is known to inhibit apoptosis by activating NF-kB, and its interaction with CLU suggests an antagonistic role in NF-kB regulation. The HSP60-CLU axis is implicated in cell survival and tumorigenesis, with HSP60 acting upstream of CLU (Chaiwatanasirikul2011The).

Secretory CLU (sCLU) also participates in interactions with stress-damaged proteins, facilitating their uptake by dendritic cells and modulating immune responses. It interacts with the complement system and enhances natural killer cell proliferation through IL-2 interaction (Rohne2016The).
