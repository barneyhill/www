# PRAMEF18

## Overview
PRAMEF18 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 18, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. PRAMEF18, like other members of the PRAME family, is characterized by its expression in certain types of cancer, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis. The protein encoded by PRAMEF18 is involved in the regulation of gene expression and may interact with other cellular pathways to influence tumor progression and immune evasion. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific functions and mechanisms of PRAMEF18 in both normal physiology and disease contexts.
