# DES

## Overview
The DES gene encodes desmin, a type III intermediate filament protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of muscle cells. Desmin is predominantly expressed in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle tissues, where it forms a cytoskeletal network that connects the contractile apparatus to the sarcolemma, facilitating efficient force transmission during muscle contraction. Beyond its structural role, desmin is involved in various cellular processes, including signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and mechanotransduction, which are essential for muscle cell response to mechanical stress and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Mutations in the DES gene can lead to desminopathies, a group of muscle disorders characterized by myofibrillar myopathy and cardiomyopathy, underscoring the clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein (Capetanaki1997Desmin; Maggi2021Skeletal; Hnia2014Desmin).

## Structure
Desmin, encoded by the DES gene, is a type III intermediate filament protein essential for muscle cell structure and function. Its molecular structure comprises three domains: an N-terminal head, a central α-helical rod, and a C-terminal tail. The central rod domain is characterized by two coiled-coil subdomains, coil-1 and coil-2, separated by a non-helical linker L12. Coil-1 is further divided into regions 1A and 1B by another linker, L1 (Brodehl2022The). Desmin forms coiled-coil dimers through the dimerization of the rod domains, which then assemble into antiparallel tetramers. These tetramers laterally associate to form unit-length filaments, which are the building blocks of desmin filaments (Snider2014Posttranslational).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating desmin's assembly and disassembly. Phosphorylation occurs at specific serine residues, such as Ser28, Ser32, and Ser68, facilitating interactions with proteins like Trim32, leading to desmin's disassembly and degradation during muscle atrophy (Snider2014Posttranslational). Desmin's structure and modifications are crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of muscle cells, and mutations in the DES gene can lead to various myopathies (MuñozMármol1998A).

## Function
Desmin, encoded by the DES gene, is a type III intermediate filament protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of muscle cells. It forms a cytoskeletal network that connects the contractile apparatus to the sarcolemma, the cell membrane, ensuring proper force transmission during muscle contraction (Capetanaki1997Desmin; Hnia2014Desmin). Desmin is predominantly active in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells, where it surrounds the Z-discs of myofibrils and links them to the sarcolemma and various organelles, including the nucleus and mitochondria (Winter2013Posttranslational; Hnia2014Desmin).

Desmin's role extends beyond structural support; it is involved in signaling pathways and cellular processes such as cell adhesion and fusion, potentially influencing myogenic commitment and differentiation (Capetanaki1997Desmin; Hnia2014Desmin). It interacts with cytolinker proteins like plectin and is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, linking the extracellular matrix to the contractile apparatus (Hnia2014Desmin). Desmin also plays a role in mechanotransduction, allowing muscle cells to respond to mechanical stress, and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and nuclear positioning (Hnia2014Desmin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DES gene, which encodes the desmin protein, are associated with a group of muscle disorders known as desminopathies. These conditions can affect both skeletal and cardiac muscles, leading to a range of clinical manifestations. Desminopathies are characterized by myofibrillar myopathy, which often presents with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, typically beginning in the lower limbs. Cardiac involvement is common and can include arrhythmias and various forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, and non-compaction cardiomyopathy (Maggi2021Skeletal; Papadopoulos2023Deep).

The DES-c.735G>C mutation is a specific pathogenic variant that causes severe restrictive cardiomyopathy by inducing the skipping of exon-3, resulting in a truncated desmin protein that aggregates abnormally in the cytoplasm (Brodehl2021The). This mutation is located in a hot spot for pathogenic mutations in the rod domain of desmin and is associated with conditions such as atrial fibrillation and distal myopathy with cardiac conduction disease (Brodehl2021The).

Desmin mutations can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mechanosignaling, contributing to muscle and cardiac dysfunction. These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of muscle cells, leading to mechanical weakness and degeneration (KocherginNikitsky2019Cardiomyopathies; Maggi2021Skeletal).

## Interactions
Desmin, encoded by the DES gene, is a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein that engages in numerous interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a critical role in muscle cell structure and function. It binds to desmoplakin at the desmosomal plaque of intercalated discs, essential for muscle cell integrity (Clemen2012Desminopathies:). Desmin interacts with several intermediate filament proteins, including vimentin, nestin, synemin, syncoilin, and nuclear B-type lamins, forming heteropolymers that contribute to muscle development and maintenance (Clemen2012Desminopathies:; Costa2004Desmin:).

Desmin also associates with IF-associated proteins like plectin, linking desmin IFs to Z-discs, costameres, and mitochondria (Clemen2012Desminopathies:). It interacts with sarcomeric proteins such as myomesin-1, nebulin, and calponin, and is anchored to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton through spectrin and ankyrin (Clemen2012Desminopathies:). Desmin's interaction with small heat shock proteins, such as HspB1 and HspB5, is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the desmin IF network, especially under stress conditions (Clemen2012Desminopathies:).

Desmin's head domain can bind single-stranded RNA and DNA, suggesting a role in gene regulation (Clemen2012Desminopathies:; Costa2004Desmin:). It also interacts with MyoD, potentially influencing gene expression (Costa2004Desmin:). These interactions highlight desmin's multifaceted role in muscle cell architecture and function.
