# N4BP2L1

## Overview
N4BP2L1 (NEDD4 binding protein 2 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in adipocyte function and glucose metabolism. The protein encoded by N4BP2L1 is not classified as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein but plays a crucial role in intracellular transport and metabolic regulation. It interacts with the dynactin complex, facilitating the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane, which is essential for glucose uptake in response to insulin. Additionally, N4BP2L1 is implicated in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, regulated by transcription factors such as FoxO1 and USF1. The gene's expression and function are significant in the context of metabolic disorders and certain cancers, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for disease prognosis (Watanabe2019A; Watanabe2021N4BP2L1; Dastsooz2024Involvement).

## Function
N4BP2L1 (NEDD4 binding protein 2 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in adipocytes. It is identified as a novel target gene of the transcription factor FoxO1, which enhances its transcriptional activity. Insulin signaling downregulates N4BP2L1 expression, indicating its involvement in insulin-mediated pathways (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1).

N4BP2L1 interacts with the dynactin complex, a crucial component for intracellular transport, including the trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4. This interaction is essential for GLUT4 translocation to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose uptake in response to insulin. Overexpression of N4BP2L1 enhances GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, while its knockdown reduces these processes, highlighting its role in glucose metabolism (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1).

The protein also plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. It is regulated by upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), which binds to its promoter region, increasing its expression during adipocyte differentiation. Knockdown of N4BP2L1 results in decreased lipid accumulation and reduced expression of adipogenic markers, indicating its importance in adipogenesis (Watanabe2019A).

## Clinical Significance
The N4BP2L1 gene has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In breast cancer, N4BP2L1 is significantly downregulated across multiple subtypes, including HER2-positive, triple-negative, and metaplastic breast cancers. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and metastasis, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role for N4BP2L1. Its expression is notably lower in primary breast tumors and various histological subtypes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer (Dastsooz2024Involvement).

In the context of metabolic conditions, N4BP2L1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism. It is a target of the transcription factor FoxO1 and is regulated by insulin signaling. Alterations in N4BP2L1 expression can impact glucose uptake and lipid metabolism, potentially influencing conditions such as diabetes and obesity. The gene's interaction with the dynactin complex is crucial for GLUT4 trafficking, which is essential for glucose uptake in adipocytes (Watanabe2019A; Watanabe2021N4BP2L1).

In adrenocortical carcinoma, low expression of N4BP2L1 is associated with higher mortality, highlighting its potential role as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (MartinHernandez2023Machine).

## Interactions
N4BP2L1 is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It is identified as a novel target gene of the transcription factor FoxO1, which binds directly to the N4bp2l1 promoter region, influencing its transcriptional activity (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1). N4BP2L1 forms a complex with dynactin subunit proteins, including ARP11 and DCTN3-6, suggesting its membership in the pointed-end complex domain of dynactin. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1). The interaction with dynactin is crucial for GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake in adipocytes, as N4BP2L1 is involved in the insulin signaling pathway, contributing to adipocyte homeostasis (Watanabe2021N4BP2L1).

N4BP2L1 also interacts with the upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), which binds to the Ebox motif in the promoter region of N4bp2l1, regulating its expression during adipogenesis (Watanabe2019A). This interaction is confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating USF1's direct binding to the N4bp2l1 promoter (Watanabe2019A). These interactions highlight N4BP2L1's role in lipid metabolism and cellular regulation.
