# PWWP4

## Overview
PWWP4 is a gene that encodes the PWWP domain containing 4 protein, which is part of the PWWP domain-containing protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a PWWP domain, a conserved sequence motif involved in chromatin-associated functions, including DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. The PWWP domain containing 4 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific biological roles remain to be fully elucidated. Research suggests that proteins with PWWP domains are often involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, indicating that PWWP4 may play a role in these processes as well (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further studies are needed to clarify the precise functions and interactions of the PWWP4 protein within the cell.
