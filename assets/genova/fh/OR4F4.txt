# OR4F4

## Overview
The OR4F4 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 4, a protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a pivotal role in the sense of smell. OR4F4 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants and initiates a signal transduction cascade that ultimately leads to olfactory perception. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4F4 and other olfactory receptors are also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential involvement in broader physiological processes. The gene's expression patterns have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a possible role in their pathophysiology (Grison2014Mesencephalic; Raka2021Human).

## Function
OR4F4 is an olfactory receptor protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. The binding of an odorant to OR4F4 triggers a conformational change in the receptor, activating the associated G-protein. This activation leads to the dissociation of G-protein subunits, which then initiate intracellular signaling cascades involving second messengers such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium ions. These signaling pathways modulate various cellular processes, ultimately contributing to the organism's ability to detect and respond to different odors (Raka2021Human).

In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR4F4 are also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in broader biological processes. Although the specific functions of OR4F4 in these tissues are not fully understood, the presence of olfactory receptors in diverse tissues indicates they may participate in general signaling pathways, influencing cell-specific functions and potentially contributing to physiological processes beyond smell (Grison2014Mesencephalic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4F4 gene has been studied in the context of several neurodegenerative diseases, where its expression levels are altered. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), OR4F4 is downregulated in the entorhinal cortex during stages III-IV and V-VI, but upregulated in the frontal cortex at stages III-IV, suggesting a complex role in the disease's progression (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), OR4F4 is significantly upregulated in the frontal cortex, indicating a potential involvement in the disease's pathology (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation). In Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), OR4F4 is downregulated in the frontal cortex in the MM1 subtype and in the cerebellum, but not in the VV2 subtype, highlighting subtype-specific expression patterns (Ansoleaga2013Dysregulation).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), OR4F4 was identified as the only putatively upregulated olfactory receptor gene in the frontal cortex, although with low significance. This upregulation was confirmed to be significant in females with PD, suggesting a gender-specific expression pattern (GarciaEsparcia2013Functional). In chronic schizophrenia, OR4F4 expression did not show significant changes compared to controls, indicating that its role may be less prominent in this condition (Ansoleaga2015Decrease). These findings suggest that OR4F4 may play a role in the pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative diseases through its altered expression.
