# NDUFC1

## Overview
NDUFC1 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C1, an accessory protein component of mitochondrial Complex I, which is a crucial enzyme in the electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the assembly and stability of Complex I, although it does not directly participate in the catalytic process. Instead, it supports the structural integrity necessary for the efficient transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, facilitating ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Han2022Knockdown; Xu2021NDUFC1). The NDUFC1 gene has been studied for its role in cellular energy metabolism and its potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in gastric cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Xu2021NDUFC1). Despite its involvement in cancer, no mutations in NDUFC1 have been linked to mitochondrial complex I deficiency (Koene2012Natural).

## Function
NDUFC1 is a subunit of mitochondrial Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. This complex is responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis (Han2022Knockdown; Xu2021NDUFC1). NDUFC1 is involved in the assembly and stability of Complex I, particularly in the formation of the P P -b subassembly, and interacts with other subunits such as NDUFC2 and NDUFA10 to form a cardiolipin binding pocket. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of Complex I (Padavannil2022The).

Although NDUFC1 does not directly participate in catalysis, it supports the structural stability of Complex I, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Han2022Knockdown). In healthy human cells, NDUFC1's role in oxidative phosphorylation is essential for efficient energy production, impacting various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Xu2021NDUFC1). The protein is active within the mitochondria, where it contributes to the overall function of the electron transport chain (Smeitink2004Cell).

## Clinical Significance
The NDUFC1 gene, encoding an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I, has been implicated in the progression of gastric cancer. Studies have shown that NDUFC1 is significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, with higher expression levels correlating with more advanced tumor stages and characteristics such as increased tumor infiltration and lymphatic metastasis (Xu2021NDUFC1). Knockdown of NDUFC1 in gastric cancer cell lines has been observed to reduce cell proliferation and migration, increase apoptosis, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo, suggesting its role as a tumor promoter (Xu2021NDUFC1). The gene influences the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival, indicating that NDUFC1 could be a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer treatment (Xu2021NDUFC1).

Despite its role in cancer, there is no evidence from the literature of diseases or conditions caused by mutations in the NDUFC1 gene related to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, as no patients with such mutations have been reported (Koene2012Natural).
