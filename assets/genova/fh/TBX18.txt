# TBX18

## Overview
TBX18 is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor 18, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain known as the T-box. This transcription factor plays a pivotal role in the regulation of developmental processes, particularly in the formation and differentiation of various tissues, including the heart, kidneys, and skeletal system. TBX18 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin and interacts with other transcriptional cofactors to modulate gene expression. It is involved in transcriptional repression through interactions with corepressors and chromatin remodeling proteins, contributing to the regulation of cellular differentiation and organogenesis. Mutations in the TBX18 gene have been associated with congenital anomalies such as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and skeletal dysplasia, highlighting its critical role in human development (Ovejero2022Clinical; Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic).

## Function
The TBX18 gene encodes a T-box transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development and differentiation of various tissues in humans. TBX18 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to chromatin and interacts with transcriptional cofactors and homeobox transcription factors to regulate gene expression. It is involved in transcriptional repression, particularly through interactions with corepressors, and may form complexes with proteins such as CBFB, CHD7, and IKZF2 to compact chromatin and deacetylate histones, thereby repressing gene expression (Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic).

In the context of heart development, TBX18 is expressed in the proepicardium and contributes to the formation of the epicardium, which undergoes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and contributes to the smooth muscle cells of the coronary vasculature. It is also expressed in the precursors of the myocardium of the sinus venosus and the sinoatrial node (SAN), playing a crucial role in the formation and function of the venous return system and coronary vasculature (Papaioannou2014The).

TBX18 is also essential for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into smooth muscle cells in various tissues, including the prostate, where it maintains epithelial integrity through stromal-epithelial signaling (Bolt2016Tbx18).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBX18 gene have been linked to several congenital disorders. In humans, these mutations are associated with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including ureter-pelvic and vesico-ureteric junction obstruction and hydronephrosis. These conditions arise due to reduced transcriptional repression or complete derepression of TBX18, affecting its function in the developing ureter (Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic). In mouse models, the absence of TBX18 leads to severe hydroureter and hydronephrosis, primarily due to the lack of ureteral smooth muscle cells, which are essential for urine transport (Airik2006Tbx18).

TBX18 mutations have also been implicated in skeletal dysplasia characterized by high bone mass and lucent bone lesions. A specific TBX18 variant, p.(R349Q), has been identified in a familial case of this condition, suggesting a role in bone metabolism and development (Ovejero2022Clinical). Additionally, TBX18 is crucial for organ formation during embryogenesis, and its mutations have been linked to dominant urinary tract malformations and congenital heart defects (Ovejero2022Clinical). These findings underscore the gene's significant role in developmental processes and its potential involvement in various congenital diseases.

## Interactions
TBX18, a transcription factor, interacts with various proteins, primarily in the nucleus, to regulate transcriptional activity. In 293 cells, TBX18 has been shown to interact with several proteins, including MAP9, PARP3, SYBU, TPX2, HAUS8, and B9D2, through different domains. Despite some of these proteins being annotated as centrosomal, TBX18 itself does not localize to the centrosome but is found in the nucleus, suggesting that these interactions occur there (Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic).

TBX18 also interacts with transcriptional cofactors and homeobox transcription factors, with a preference for chromatin binding and interaction with corepressors. Notably, CBFB, CHD7, and IKZF2 enhance TBX18's repressive activity. CBFB is part of a transcription factor complex, CHD7 is involved in chromatin remodeling, and IKZF2 is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs). These interactions suggest that TBX18 may form complexes to compact chromatin and deacetylate histones, contributing to transcriptional repression (Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic).

The study identified 143 human proteins interacting with TBX18, with significant enrichment in nucleosome, homeobox, DNA-binding, and nuclear chromatin-related proteins. Histone H2A was notably enriched, indicating TBX18's association with transcriptional regulatory proteins on chromatin (Rivera-Reyes2018Proteomic).
