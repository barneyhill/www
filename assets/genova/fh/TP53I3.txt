# TP53I3

## Overview
The TP53I3 gene encodes the tumor protein p53 inducible protein 3, which is a member of the quinone oxidoreductase (QOR) family. This protein is primarily involved in cellular responses to stress, particularly in the context of DNA damage and oxidative stress. It is transcriptionally activated by the tumor suppressor protein p53 and plays a crucial role in apoptosis, a programmed cell death process that is essential for eliminating damaged cells and preventing tumorigenesis (Chaudhry2021Germline). Additionally, TP53I3 is implicated in maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in homologous recombination repair (HRR), a critical DNA repair mechanism (Chaudhry2021Germline). The protein's enzymatic activity contributes to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are vital for triggering apoptosis and managing oxidative stress (Chaudhry2021Germline). As such, TP53I3 is integral to both apoptosis and DNA repair, playing a significant role in cancer prevention and cellular homeostasis.

## Function
The TP53I3 gene, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 3, encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in response to stress. In healthy human cells, TP53I3 is transcriptionally activated by the tumor suppressor p53 and plays a significant role in apoptosis, a programmed cell death pathway essential for removing damaged cells and preventing tumorigenesis (Chaudhry2021Germline). The protein is part of the quinone oxidoreductase (QOR) family and is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are crucial for triggering apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Chaudhry2021Germline).

TP53I3 also contributes to maintaining genomic stability through its involvement in homologous recombination repair (HRR), a vital DNA repair mechanism. Knockdown of TP53I3 has been shown to reduce HRR capabilities, indicating its role in DNA repair processes (Chaudhry2021Germline). The protein's enzymatic activity is linked to its ability to produce ROS, which is important for cellular responses to oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Chaudhry2021Germline). In summary, TP53I3 is integral to both apoptosis and DNA repair, contributing to the prevention of uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development.

## Clinical Significance
The TP53I3 gene, also known as tumor protein p53 inducible protein 3, plays a significant role in cancer development and progression due to its involvement in apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms. Mutations in TP53I3, such as the TP53I3 p.S252X mutation, have been identified in patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). This mutation results in a premature stop gain, leading to decreased homologous recombination repair efficiency and increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic drugs (Chaudhry2021Germline). The TP53I3-S252X mutation also disrupts reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is crucial for apoptosis, potentially contributing to chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenesis (Chaudhry2021Germline).

In breast cancer, TP53I3 overexpression is associated with increased survival, whereas its loss is linked to the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon, and papillary thyroid cancer (Chaudhry2021Germline). The gene's role as a BRCA-like tumor suppressor is highlighted by its involvement in hereditary ovarian cancer, where its mutations contribute to cancer susceptibility (Lopes2019FANCM). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TP53I3 in various cancers, particularly in the context of hereditary cancer risk and treatment response.

## Interactions
TP53I3, also known as PIG3, is a gene that plays a significant role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage. It is induced by the tumor suppressor protein p53 and is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and oxidative stress response. TP53I3 interacts with a range of proteins and nucleic acids, which can be part of multiprotein complexes or involve transient regulatory roles.

The interactions of TP53I3 are crucial for its function in mediating cellular stress responses. It is known to participate in multiprotein complexes that facilitate its role in apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. These interactions may involve binding with other proteins that are part of the apoptotic machinery, thereby influencing the cell's decision to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage.

In addition to its role in apoptosis, TP53I3 is involved in the oxidative stress response. It interacts with proteins and nucleic acids that help modulate the cellular response to oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage if not properly managed. These interactions are often transient, allowing TP53I3 to act as a regulatory molecule that can quickly respond to changes in the cellular environment.
