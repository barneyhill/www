# LCTL

## Overview
The LCTL gene encodes a protein known as lactase-like, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family, specifically within the CAZy family GH1. Unlike other members of this family, the lactase-like protein has lost its catalytic activity and has adapted to perform novel functions in the extracellular space. It is involved in various physiological processes, including calcium and phosphate homeostasis, amino acid transport, and the regulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly in gliomas (Su2019LCTL; Hansen2020A). The protein interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptors and fibroblast growth factors, suggesting a role in the FGF signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune regulation in tumors (Su2019LCTL). Additionally, LCTL is implicated in lens biology, contributing to lens suture formation and potentially maintaining lens transparency and integrity (Schey2020Spatiotemporal). The expression of LCTL is tissue-specific, indicating its functional adaptation to different biological contexts (Hansen2020A).

## Function
The LCTL gene encodes a protein that is part of the glycoside hydrolase family, specifically classified within the CAZy family GH1. This protein has lost its catalytic activity and is targeted to the extracellular space, where it has developed new functions. Among these functions, some are related to calcium and phosphate homeostasis or amino acid transport (Hansen2020A). The LCTL protein is involved in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly in gliomas, where it is associated with immune and stromal cell infiltration. It correlates with various cell types, including myeloid, stromal, and stem cells, and is negatively correlated with most lymphoid cells (Su2019LCTL). 

In the context of the human lens, LCTL is implicated in lens suture formation, suggesting a role in the structural organization of lens fibers. This involvement in lens biology highlights its potential function in maintaining lens transparency and integrity (Schey2020Spatiotemporal). The expression of LCTL is tissue-specific, indicating that its activity is regulated and adapted to the needs of different tissues (Hansen2020A).

## Clinical Significance
The LCTL gene is significantly upregulated in various cancers, including gliomas and skin cutaneous melanoma, and is associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients, particularly those with high-grade gliomas (Su2019LCTL). In gliomas, LCTL expression is linked to immunosuppressive properties, correlating positively with immunosuppressive cells like M2 macrophages and negatively with anti-tumor immune cells such as CD8+ T cells. This suggests a role in promoting immune evasion and tumor aggressiveness (Su2019LCTL). LCTL is also involved in the tumor microenvironment, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which can facilitate cancer metastasis (Su2019LCTL).

In addition to gliomas, LCTL expression is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer, correlating with increased cell proliferation and poor patient outcomes (Mota2023Klotho). High γKlotho protein expression, related to LCTL, is observed in aggressive forms of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer, indicating a correlation with cancer aggressiveness and reduced survival (Mota2023Klotho). These findings suggest that alterations in LCTL expression may serve as prognostic markers in these cancers, indicating more aggressive disease and poorer outcomes.

## Interactions
The LCTL gene encodes a protein that is involved in various interactions within the tumor microenvironment, particularly in gliomas. LCTL is known to interact with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), specifically FGFR1, FGFRL1, FGFR4, and FGF23. These interactions suggest that LCTL may play a role in the FGF signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating immunity in gliomas (Su2019LCTL). 

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis indicates that LCTL can directly interact with these FGFRs and FGFs, and indirectly with immunosuppressive factors, recruitment factors, and markers of exhausted T cells and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Su2019LCTL). These interactions are significant as they contribute to the immunosuppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment by promoting the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and tumor-associated neutrophils. LCTL's involvement in these processes highlights its potential role in promoting invasion signals and contributing to T cell exhaustion, characterized by high levels of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, BTLA, and TIGIT (Su2019LCTL).
