# BMP2K

## Overview
The BMP2K gene encodes the BMP2 inducible kinase, a serine-threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including erythroid differentiation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The gene produces two splice variants, BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S, which have distinct functions in cellular homeostasis and intracellular trafficking. BMP2K-L is involved in promoting erythroid maturation and autophagy, while BMP2K-S acts as an inhibitor of these processes. The kinase is crucial for the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein complex AP-2, facilitating the maturation of clathrin-coated pits into vesicles, a key step in CME. BMP2K's interactions with AP-2 and clathrin are essential for its recruitment and stabilization at clathrin-coated pits, impacting endocytic and signaling pathways. Clinically, mutations in BMP2K have been linked to developmental dysplasia of the hip and its expression levels are associated with gallbladder cancer prognosis, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Cendrowski2020Splicing; Ramesh2021BMP2K; Zhao2017A).

## Structure
The BMP2K protein, encoded by the BMP2K gene, has two splice variants: BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S. Both variants share an identical N-terminus and contain a serine-threonine protein kinase domain, which is crucial for their enzymatic activity (Cendrowski2020Splicing; Ramesh2021BMP2K). BMP2K-L is the longer variant, consisting of 1161 amino acids, while BMP2K-S is shorter with 662 amino acids. The first 650 amino acids of BMP2K-S are identical to BMP2K-L, but BMP2K-L includes an additional 510 amino acids at its C-terminus (Cendrowski2020Splicing).

The C-terminus of BMP2K-L contains motifs for binding clathrin and AP-2, which are absent in BMP2K-S. These motifs include clathrin (SLL) and three AP-2 (DPF) binding motifs, suggesting a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) (Cendrowski2020Splicing). BMP2K is involved in phosphorylating the AP-2 µ subunit at the T156 residue, a post-translational modification essential for CME (Ramesh2021BMP2K).

The protein structure includes a kinase domain, a glutamine/histidine-rich region, and an intrinsically disordered C-terminus, which is crucial for its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits (Ramesh2021BMP2K). The extended C-terminus of BMP2K-L is important for its function and localization in cellular processes (Ramesh2021BMP2K).

## Function
The BMP2K gene encodes a serine-threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in erythroid cells. It has two splicing variants, BMP2K-L and BMP2K-S, which have opposing functions. BMP2K-L promotes erythroid maturation by enhancing autophagy and COPII-dependent trafficking, while BMP2K-S inhibits these processes. The balance between these variants is crucial for erythroid differentiation, with BMP2K-L facilitating autophagic degradation and BMP2K-S restricting it (Cendrowski2020Splicing; Cendrowski2020Splicinga).

BMP2K also plays a significant role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by phosphorylating the adaptor protein complex AP-2, which is essential for the maturation of clathrin-coated pits into vesicles. This phosphorylation is crucial for the proper functioning of CME, affecting the recruitment and stabilization of clathrin-coated pits (Ramesh2021BMP2K). BMP2K's activity is linked to the morphology of the lattice structure and the status of CME, with its inactivation leading to delays in endocytosis (Ramesh2021BMP2K). The gene's function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient intracellular trafficking, impacting processes like erythroid differentiation and endocytosis (Ramesh2021BMP2K; Cendrowski2020Splicinga).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BMP2K gene have been associated with several medical conditions. Notably, mutations in BMP2K are linked to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), a condition affecting the hip joint. Zhao et al. identified two novel heterozygous mutations in the BMP2K gene, specifically c.1432_1440delCAGCAGCAG and c.1440_1441insCAG, in affected family members and some sporadic DDH cases. These mutations result in the deletion or insertion of amino acids in the BMP2K transcript, affecting an evolutionarily conserved glutamine residue, suggesting a significant role for BMP2K variants in DDH (Zhao2017A).

In gallbladder cancer (GBC), decreased expression of BMP2K is correlated with advanced disease stages and poor prognosis. BMP2K expression is lower in GBC tissues compared to adjacent tissues, and its reduced levels are linked to increased cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for GBC (Song2020Regulation).

Additionally, BMP2K has been identified as a fusion partner in the BMP2K-ZNF384 fusion gene, which is associated with a subgroup of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). This fusion gene is characterized by a specific immunophenotype and contributes to the heterogeneity of BCP-ALL (Hirabayashi2016ZNF384).

## Interactions
BMP2K (BMP2 inducible kinase) is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) through its interactions with the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) and clathrin. BMP2K phosphorylates the AP-2 µ subunit at threonine 156, a modification crucial for the proper functioning of CME. This phosphorylation is facilitated by BMP2K's extended C-terminus, which contains motifs that directly bind to the α and β subunits of AP-2 and the clathrin heavy chain (Ramesh2021BMP2K). 

BMP2K's interaction with AP-2 is essential for its recruitment and stabilization at clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). The presence of a poly-glutamate rich region in BMP2K's C-terminus enhances its interaction with AP-2, aiding in its accumulation and stabilization at CCPs (Ramesh2019Allosteric). BMP2K's stability is closely linked to functional AP-2, as depletion of AP-2 leads to a significant decline in BMP2K levels (Ramesh2021BMP2K). 

In addition to its role in CME, BMP2K interacts with AP2M1 and ALOX15 in the context of gallbladder cancer, where it phosphorylates AP2M1, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Song2020Regulation). These interactions highlight BMP2K's role in both endocytic and signaling pathways.
