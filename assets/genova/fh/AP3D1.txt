# AP3D1

## Overview
The AP3D1 gene encodes the delta 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is integral to the intracellular trafficking system in eukaryotic cells. The AP-3 complex, a heterotetramer, plays a pivotal role in the sorting and transport of proteins to lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. The protein encoded by AP3D1, known as adaptor related protein complex 3 subunit delta 1, is involved in vesicle formation and trafficking, particularly within the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments. This protein is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper delivery of lysosomal membrane proteins. Mutations in AP3D1 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 10, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Dell’Angelica2009AP3dependent; Peden2004Localization; Mohammed2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The AP3D1 protein, a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), is involved in vesicle trafficking to lysosomes and related organelles. The primary structure of the bovine version, boAP3D1, consists of 1,207 amino acids, with a balance of positively and negatively charged residues, indicating its hydrophilic nature (Corredor2018In). The secondary structure includes β-sheets and β-hairpins, contributing to its stability (Corredor2018In).

The tertiary structure of AP3D1 features a BLVR domain, with conserved sites highlighted, and is validated by a Ramachandran plot, ensuring a reliable model (Corredor2018In). The δ subunit of AP3D1, part of the AP-3 complex, interacts with the SNARE protein VAMP7, particularly within the hinge domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Frohne2022A).

In terms of quaternary structure, AP3D1 forms part of the AP-3 complex, which includes β3, σ3, and μ3 subunits. This complex is involved in vesicle formation and trafficking, with the δ subunit playing a key role in membrane binding and interaction with Arf1, a small GTPase (Zhuo2021AP3; Begley2024A). The δ subunit is also subject to post-translational modifications, which may regulate its function (Begley2024A).

## Function
The AP3D1 gene encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is crucial for intracellular trafficking processes in eukaryotic cells. The AP-3 complex is a heterotetramer composed of four subunits, including the delta subunit encoded by AP3D1, and is involved in the sorting and transport of proteins to lysosome-related organelles (LROs) such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (Dell’Angelica2009AP3dependent). In healthy human cells, AP3D1 is expressed in both ubiquitous and neuronal forms, playing a significant role in the biogenesis and function of these organelles (Li2021Serum).

The AP-3 complex is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomal compartments, where it mediates the trafficking of membrane-associated proteins. It is involved in the formation of vesicles that transport proteins to lysosomes, influencing processes such as pigmentation and immune response (Peden2004Localization). The AP-3 complex also plays a role in the trafficking of lysosomal membrane proteins, ensuring their proper delivery from endosomal compartments to lysosomes, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Peden2004Localization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP3D1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 10 (HPS10). This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, neurodevelopmental delays, platelet dysfunction, and immunodeficiency. The absence of the δ subunit of the AP-3 complex, due to mutations in AP3D1, leads to the degradation of other subunits and is linked to severe neurological manifestations, including seizures and developmental delays (Mohammed2019Biallelic).

A specific homozygous missense variant, p.V711I, in the AP3D1 gene has been identified in patients with sensorineural hearing loss as the leading manifestation. This variant is associated with mild HPS10-like symptoms, such as mild neutropenia and reduced NK-cell cytotoxicity, but lacks the characteristic albinism and bleeding diathesis typically seen in HPS10 (Frohne2022A).

Additionally, elevated levels of serum anti-AP3D1 antibodies have been linked to an increased risk of acute ischemic stroke related to atherosclerosis, as well as other conditions like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. These antibodies are considered potential markers for certain types of atherosclerosis (Li2021Serum).

## Interactions
The AP3D1 gene encodes the delta subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is involved in vesicle trafficking. AP3D1 interacts with other subunits of the AP-3 complex, such as AP3B1, AP3M1, and AP3S1, to facilitate the transport of proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (Zhuo2021AP3). AP3D1 also interacts with the v-SNARE protein VAMP7, which is crucial for membrane fusion events and neurotransmitter release. This interaction is important for the intracellular localization of VAMP7 in various cell types (Frohne2022A).

AP3D1 is involved in the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles from endosomes in neurons, where it interacts with calcyon, a protein that binds to clathrin light chain, regulating synaptic vesicle trafficking (Zhuo2021AP3). The AP-3 complex, including AP3D1, also interacts with the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), affecting the targeting of proteins such as LAMP1 and PI4KIIα (Zhuo2021AP3). The interaction between AP3D1 and BLOC-1 is part of a pathway that transports synaptic vesicle membrane proteins, with implications for neurotransmitter systems affected in conditions like schizophrenia (Larimore2011The).
