# SHANK2

## Overview
SHANK2 is a gene that encodes the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 protein, a crucial postsynaptic scaffolding protein involved in the organization and function of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. The SHANK2 protein is characterized by several domains, including the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain, ankyrin repeats, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PSD-95/discs large/ZO1 (PDZ) domain, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its role in synaptic signaling and plasticity (Hassani2022Structural; Kursula2019Shanks). It plays a pivotal role in the formation of the postsynaptic density by linking glutamate receptors to intracellular signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal differentiation (Lutz2021SHANK2; Unsicker2021SHANK2). Mutations in SHANK2 have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, highlighting its significance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function (Eltokhi2018Distinct; Unsicker2021SHANK2).

## Structure
The SHANK2 protein is a postsynaptic scaffold protein involved in synaptic organization, particularly at glutamatergic synapses. It contains several key domains that facilitate its function: the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain, multiple ankyrin repeats, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PSD-95/discs large/ZO1 (PDZ) domain, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain (Hassani2022Structural; Kursula2019Shanks). The PDZ domain is crucial for binding to SAPAP/GKAP proteins, which mediate interactions with NMDA receptors (Hassani2022Structural). The SAM domain can polymerize in the presence of Zn2+ to form helical fibers, which stack to form large sheets, facilitating the multimerization of Shank proteins (Hassani2022Structural).

SHANK2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in various isoforms, such as Shank2E, which includes ankyrin repeats and is expressed in epithelial tissues (McWILLIAMS2004Characterization). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and ubiquitination, contributing to its functional diversity in neuronal signaling (Kursula2019Shanks). These structural features and modifications are essential for SHANK2's role in synaptic function and plasticity.

## Function
The SHANK2 gene encodes a postsynaptic scaffolding protein that is crucial for the function of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. In healthy human cells, SHANK2 is involved in synaptic signal transduction and neuronal differentiation, playing a key role in synapse formation and neuronal plasticity (Lutz2021SHANK2; Unsicker2021SHANK2). It organizes a large protein complex known as the postsynaptic density, connecting various types of glutamate receptors, such as AMPA and NMDA receptors, to signaling pathways and the actin cytoskeleton (Hassani2022Structural; Unsicker2021SHANK2).

SHANK2 interacts with proteins like PSD95 and SYP, which are essential for anchoring receptors at the postsynaptic density, thereby facilitating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Unsicker2021SHANK2). It is also involved in insulin signaling in the brain, interacting with IRSp53, and may influence pathways susceptible to mutations (Unsicker2021SHANK2). The protein is expressed in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, and is also found in extra-neuronal tissues like the liver and kidney (Woelfle2023Expression). SHANK2's role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function is underscored by its association with neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated (Eltokhi2018Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHANK2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Eltokhi2018Distinct; Ma2021Genetic; Unsicker2021SHANK2). SHANK2 is considered a high-confidence autism risk gene, and its mutations can lead to impaired synaptic function and plasticity, contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Unsicker2021SHANK2).

Specific missense mutations, such as p.Gly643Arg and p.L1800W, disrupt critical protein interactions within the postsynaptic density, affecting synaptic transmission and leading to severe neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations interfere with the binding of proteins like GKAP and the polymerization of the SAM domain, which are essential for synaptic function (Hassani2022Structural).

The phenotypic expression of SHANK2-related disorders varies widely, with some individuals exhibiting mild to moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, and behavioral abnormalities, while others may experience more severe symptoms, including seizures and microcephaly (Hassani2022Structural; Caumes2020Phenotypic). The variability in phenotypes is attributed to different mutations affecting SHANK2's expression and function, leading to altered protein-protein interactions and changes in the postsynaptic protein network (Eltokhi2018Distinct).

## Interactions
SHANK2, a scaffolding protein, plays a critical role in the organization of synaptic signaling complexes. It interacts with various proteins to form the postsynaptic density (PSD) in neurons, which is essential for synaptic function and plasticity. SHANK2 contains several domains, including the PDZ and SAM domains, which mediate its interactions with other proteins.

The PDZ domain of SHANK2 binds to SAPAP/GKAP proteins, which are crucial for linking glutamate receptors to the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines (Hassani2022Structural). Mutations in the PDZ domain, such as p.Gly643Arg (G643R), disrupt the binding of SHANK2 to GKAP, significantly reducing binding affinity and affecting postsynaptic targeting (Hassani2022Structural). The SAM domain of SHANK2 is involved in polymerization processes that are dependent on zinc ions (Zn2+), forming helical fibers that contribute to the structural integrity of the PSD (Hassani2022Structural).

SHANK2 also interacts with other scaffolding proteins like PSD-95 and Homer, facilitating the formation of postsynaptic nanoclusters. These interactions are implicated in a liquid-liquid phase transition that enhances postsynaptic clustering and synaptic transmission (Hassani2022Structural). Disruptions in these interactions, due to mutations in SHANK2, can lead to alterations in synaptic function and are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Hassani2022Structural).
