# MAPK14

## Overview
MAPK14 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 14, commonly referred to as p38α, which is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation, acting as a key regulator in various signaling pathways. The p38α kinase is involved in modulating cell cycle checkpoints, immune responses, and inflammatory processes by influencing the expression and activity of numerous downstream targets (Cuenda2007p38). It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it exerts its effects on gene expression and cellular adaptation to environmental changes (Cuenda2007p38). Due to its involvement in critical cellular functions, MAPK14 has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Guo2021MAPK14; Alam2016Targeting).

## Structure
The MAPK14 gene encodes the p38α protein, a serine/threonine kinase involved in cellular stress responses. The primary structure of p38α consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes a small N-terminal domain composed mainly of β-sheets and a larger C-terminal domain composed primarily of α-helices (Yang2019p38α; Haar2007Crystal). The tertiary structure features a kinase domain with an ATP-binding pocket located between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which remains flexible even after ligand binding (Yang2019p38α).

The quaternary structure of p38α involves interactions with other proteins, such as forming a heterodimer with MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2), where the C-terminal regulatory domain of MK2 binds in the docking groove of p38α (Haar2007Crystal). This interaction is crucial for regulating the kinase's activity in response to stress signals. Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at Thr-180 and Tyr-182, are essential for the activation and function of p38α (Haar2007Crystal). The protein also contains a docking groove for interacting with other kinases and phosphatases, which is conserved among MAP kinases (Haar2007Crystal).

## Function
MAPK14, also known as p38α, is a crucial component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, playing a significant role in cellular responses to stress and inflammation. In healthy human cells, MAPK14 is involved in regulating cell cycle checkpoints and maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to various stress stimuli. It modulates cell cycle transitions at the G0, G1/S, and G2/M phases by influencing cyclin levels and phosphorylating key proteins such as the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the tumor suppressor p53 (Cuenda2007p38).

MAPK14 is also involved in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, influencing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines at both transcriptional and translational levels (Cuenda2007p38). It plays a role in chemotactic cell migration and angiogenesis by regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of matrix metalloproteases, such as MMP-9, which are important for cell motility and angiogenesis (Cuenda2007p38).

In terms of cellular localization, MAPK14 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular adaptation to environmental changes (Cuenda2007p38). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and preventing tumorigenesis by regulating cell cycle and stress response pathways (Cuenda2007p38).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAPK14 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In polycythemia vera (PV), a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, MAPK14 is significantly over-expressed. This over-expression is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including increased need for drug therapy, higher rates of splenectomy and thrombosis, and poorer prognosis with lower survival rates. MAPK14 expression is particularly elevated in patients with JAK2 mutations, especially those with JAK2-homozygous mutations, and is linked to the activation of pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling (Guo2021MAPK14).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), MAPK14 is upregulated and associated with poorer disease-free survival and disease-specific survival. Its expression correlates with clinical stages of CRC and is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint markers, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Hypomethylation of the MAPK14 gene body is associated with its high expression, contributing to its oncogenic effects (Wang2022Mapk14).

In Alzheimer's disease, MAPK14 expression is upregulated in the brains of transgenic mouse models, where it is associated with amyloid pathology. Inhibiting MAPK14 activity has been shown to stimulate autophagy and reduce amyloid beta levels, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Alam2016Targeting).

## Interactions
MAPK14, also known as p38α, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with proteins such as GDF15 and SFRS5, with high-confidence interaction scores of 18.5 and 4.5, respectively, as determined by the PRINCESS tool for scoring protein-protein interactions (Wang2008Protein). In the context of cancer, MAPK14 has been shown to interact with CDC25B in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where phosphorylated MAPK14 (P-MAPK14) stabilizes CDC25B protein, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Liu2019Knockdown). In bladder cancer, P-MAPK14 interacts with RUNX2, maintaining its stability and thereby facilitating cancer cell proliferation and migration (p&gt; Phosphorylated; Liu2020&lt).

MAPK14 also plays a role in metabolic regulation by interacting with proteins such as SLC2A3 and PFKFB3. It modulates glucose metabolism and affects the stability of these proteins, contributing to cancer cell survival under stress conditions (Desideri2014MAPK14p38αdependent). These interactions highlight MAPK14's involvement in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
