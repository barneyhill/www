# SURF6

## Overview
SURF6 is a gene that encodes the surfeit 6 protein, a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing. The surfeit 6 protein is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein, which allows it to interact flexibly with various nucleolar components, including nucleic acids and other proteins such as Nucleophosmin (NPM1), UBF1, and Nucleolin. These interactions are primarily mediated through electrostatic forces facilitated by arginine-rich motifs within the protein's structure, contributing to the dynamic organization of the nucleolus and the formation of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) networks. The surfeit 6 protein plays a critical role in the early stages of ribosomal RNA maturation and the assembly of ribosomal subunits, functioning largely independently of the p53 pathway, although p53 may influence ribosome biogenesis under certain conditions (Moraleva2023Human; Ferrolino2018Compositional).

## Structure
SURF6 is an intrinsically disordered nucleolar protein composed of 361 amino acids. It contains multiple arginine-rich short linear motifs (R-motifs) within its structure, which are crucial for its interaction with other nucleolar proteins, such as Nucleophosmin (NPM1) (Ferrolino2018Compositional). These R-motifs facilitate electrostatic interactions, particularly with the acidic tracts of NPM1, driving liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and forming NPM1-SURF6 molecular networks (Ferrolino2018Compositional).

The protein's structure is characterized by its ability to interact with nucleic acids and other nucleolar proteins, such as UBF1 and Nucleolin, through electrostatic interactions. These interactions are thought to modulate the features of the nucleolar scaffold during ribosome biogenesis (Ferrolino2018Compositional). SURF6's interaction with NPM1 involves the invasion of the NPM1 network by a fragment of SURF6, known as S6N, which alters the architecture and dynamics of NPM1 droplets (Ferrolino2018Compositional).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SURF6 are not provided, its intrinsically disordered nature suggests a flexible structure that facilitates its interactions and functional roles in the nucleolus. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
SURF6 is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and pre-rRNA processing in human cells. It is involved in the early steps of pre-rRNA processing, which is essential for the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the assembly of ribosomal subunits (Moraleva2023Human). SURF6 co-localizes with pre-rRNA components in the nucleolus, suggesting its involvement in the formation of complexes with large subunit (LSU) precursors and possibly with less mature 41S precursors of both small subunit (SSU) and LSU (Moraleva2023Human).

The protein is implicated in the cleavage of pre-rRNA at specific sites, which is critical for the progression of ribosome biogenesis pathways (Moraleva2023Human). SURF6's function in pre-rRNA processing is largely independent of the p53 pathway, although p53 may modulate the efficiency of ribosome biogenesis under certain conditions (Moraleva2023Human).

SURF6 also interacts with other nucleolar proteins, such as Nucleophosmin (NPM1), and is involved in the dynamic phase separation processes within the nucleolus. These interactions contribute to the structural organization and adaptability of nucleolar scaffolding networks, which are important for ribosome assembly and cellular proliferation (Ferrolino2018Compositional).

## Interactions
SURF6 is a nucleolar protein that participates in various interactions crucial for ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar structure maintenance. It is known to interact with nucleophosmin (NPM1) within the granular component of the nucleolus. This interaction is driven by electrostatic forces between the arginine-rich motifs of SURF6 and the acidic tracts of NPM1's intrinsically disordered region, facilitating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (Ferrolino2018Compositional). SURF6 can displace NPM1 from its homotypic droplets, forming heterotypic droplets with a core-shell architecture, which significantly alters the structural and dynamic properties of these protein droplets (Ferrolino2018Compositional).

SURF6 also interacts with nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, and other nucleolar proteins such as UBF1 and Nucleolin. These interactions are likely mediated through electrostatic interactions involving long acidic tracts, suggesting a role in regulating the composition and biophysical properties of the nucleolar matrix (Ferrolino2018Compositional). In the context of pre-rRNA processing, SURF6 is associated with proteins like EBNA1BP2/Ebp2 and NOP52/Rrp1, which are involved in large ribosomal subunit biogenesis, although a direct association with the pre-60S ribosomal subunit has not been proven (Moraleva2023Human).
