# ALAS2

## Overview
The ALAS2 gene encodes the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2, which plays a pivotal role in the heme biosynthetic pathway, specifically within erythroid cells. This enzyme is categorized as a mitochondrial enzyme and is crucial for catalyzing the first step in heme production by converting succinyl CoA and glycine into 5-aminolevulinate, a rate-limiting step in the pathway (Harigae2003Aberrant; Cox2004The). The ALAS2 protein is synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently imported into the mitochondria, where it operates on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Cox2004The). The gene is located on the X-chromosome and is specifically expressed during erythroid cell differentiation (Cox2004The). Mutations in ALAS2 can lead to disorders such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia and X-linked protoporphyria, underscoring its importance in heme synthesis and iron homeostasis (Harigae2003Aberrant; Tchaikovskii2019Molecular).

## Structure
The human ALAS2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis, primarily expressed in erythroid cells. It is a homodimeric enzyme, meaning it consists of two identical subunits, each contributing to the formation of the active site (Bailey2020Human). The primary structure includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is part of the N-terminal extension (Bailey2020Human).

The secondary structure of ALAS2 features alpha helices and beta sheets. The catalytic core can be divided into three sub-domains: Subdomain 1 forms an α-helix and a three-stranded, antiparallel β-sheet; Subdomain 2 consists of a seven-stranded β-sheet enclosed by nine α-helices; and Subdomain 3 includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three α-helices (Bailey2020Human).

The tertiary structure of ALAS2 includes a C-terminal extension (Ct-extension) that acts as an autoinhibitory element by folding onto the catalytic core, blocking substrate binding. This extension must re-orient during catalysis (Bailey2020Human). The Ct-extension is unique to higher eukaryotes and plays a regulatory role in enzyme activity (Bailey2020Human).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, affecting the enzyme's activity and localization (Bailey2020Human). The structure of ALAS2 is highly conserved, with interactions involving the central sub-domain of the catalytic core (Bailey2020Human).

## Function
The ALAS2 gene encodes the erythroid-specific enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase-2, which is crucial for the initial step of the heme biosynthetic pathway in erythroid cells. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of 5-aminolevulinate from succinyl CoA and glycine, a rate-limiting step in heme production, which is essential for hemoglobin synthesis in red blood cells (Harigae2003Aberrant; Cox2004The). ALAS2 is specifically expressed during erythroid cell differentiation and is located on the X-chromosome (Cox2004The).

The ALAS2 protein is synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, where it functions on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Cox2004The). The N-terminal region of ALAS2 is necessary for mitochondrial targeting, with the first 49 amino acids required for import across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Cox2004The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by iron levels through an iron-responsive element in the mRNA, linking heme biosynthesis to iron availability (Peoc’h2019Regulation).

Mutations in ALAS2 can lead to conditions such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal heme production and function in erythroid cells (Peoc’h2019Regulation; Harigae2003Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALAS2 gene are primarily associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA), a condition characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, hypochromic microcytic anemia, and systemic iron overload. This disorder is caused by mutations that impair the function of the ALAS2 enzyme, leading to inadequate heme synthesis despite sufficient iron stores. The condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, predominantly affecting males, although females can be affected due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation (Hurford2002A; Harigae2010Hereditary; Cotter1994Xlinked).

XLSA can be classified into pyridoxine-responsive and pyridoxine-refractory types, depending on the clinical response to vitamin B6 therapy. Many patients with XLSA respond to pyridoxine treatment, which enhances the residual activity of the mutant enzyme by increasing its affinity for the cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) (Harigae2010Hereditary; Huang2021A).

In addition to XLSA, gain-of-function mutations in the ALAS2 gene can lead to X-linked protoporphyria (XLP), characterized by overproduction of 5-aminolevulinic acid and accumulation of protoporphyrin IX, resulting in photosensitivity and severe phototoxic reactions (Tchaikovskii2019Molecular). These mutations highlight the critical role of ALAS2 in maintaining heme biosynthesis and iron homeostasis.

## Interactions
ALAS2, an enzyme involved in heme biosynthesis, interacts with the β-subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SUCLA2). This interaction is crucial for the enzyme's function in erythroid cells. Mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of ALAS2, such as p.Met567Val and p.Ser568Gly, disrupt this binding, which is significant in the pathogenesis of X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) (Bishop2012Xlinked). Despite these mutations, the enzymatic activity and stability of ALAS2 remain normal, indicating that the disruption of the ALAS2-SUCLA2 complex is a key factor in the disease (Bishop2012Xlinked).

The interaction between ALAS2 and SUCLA2 has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation (Furuyama2000Interaction; Bishop2012Xlinked). The binding stoichiometry between ALAS2 and SUCLA2 is approximately 1:1, suggesting a specific interaction (Bishop2012Xlinked). The presence of the α subunit in the succinyl-CoA synthetase holoenzyme does not affect the binding of ALAS2 to SUCLA2, nor does it promote binding to mutant forms of ALAS2 (Bishop2012Xlinked). These interactions highlight the importance of ALAS2 in the context of a multienzyme complex in vivo (Bishop2012Xlinked).
