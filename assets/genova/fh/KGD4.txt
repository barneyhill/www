# KGD4

## Overview
KGD4 is a gene that encodes the protein alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase subunit 4, a critical component of the mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) complex. This protein functions as an adaptor, facilitating the assembly and stability of the KGDH complex by recruiting the E3 subunit, Lpd1, to the core components formed by Kgd1 and Kgd2. The KGDH complex plays a vital role in the citric acid cycle, a key metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. KGD4's dual-domain structure, with its N-terminal domain binding to Lpd1 and its C-terminal domain interacting with the Kgd1-Kgd2 core, underscores its role as a molecular adaptor within the complex. The gene's ability to produce two isoforms, Kgd4L and Kgd4S, through alternative translation initiation, highlights the flexibility of protein synthesis and its contribution to protein diversification in yeast (Heublein2014The; Heublein2019Alternative).

## Structure
The KGD4 protein, a subunit of the mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) complex, has a distinct molecular structure that includes two functionally separable domains. The N-terminal domain of KGD4 binds to the E3 subunit Lpd1, while the C-terminal domain interacts with the Kgd1-Kgd2 core, allowing KGD4 to function as a molecular adaptor within the complex (Heublein2014The). 

KGD4 exists in two isoforms, Kgd4L and Kgd4S, resulting from alternative translation initiation. Kgd4L is produced from a UUG start codon located 90 nucleotides upstream of the standard AUG start codon, making it approximately 30 amino acids longer than Kgd4S. This difference in length results in molecular weights of approximately 20 kDa for Kgd4L and 15 kDa for Kgd4S (Heublein2019Alternative). Both isoforms are efficiently imported into mitochondria and support the activity of the KGDH complex (Heublein2019Alternative).

The presence of these isoforms highlights the flexibility of translation initiation in yeast, where non-AUG codons can be utilized under specific sequence contexts, contributing to protein diversification (Heublein2019Alternative).

## Function
The KGD4 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) complex, which is integral to the citric acid cycle, a critical metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. Kgd4 functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating the assembly and stability of the KGDH complex by recruiting the E3 subunit, Lpd1, to the core components formed by Kgd1 and Kgd2. This recruitment is essential for the proper functioning of the KGDH complex, as it ensures the stable incorporation of Lpd1, which is necessary for the complex's enzymatic activity (Heublein2014The).

Kgd4 has a dual-domain structure, with its N-terminal domain binding to Lpd1 and its C-terminal domain interacting with the Kgd1-Kgd2 core. This structure allows Kgd4 to bridge the E3 subunit with the core components, maintaining the integrity of the KGDH complex (Heublein2014The). The activity of the KGDH complex is crucial for converting alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, generating NADH and CO2, which are vital for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Heublein2014The). The function of Kgd4 is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular metabolism (Heublein2014The).

## Interactions
KGD4, also known as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase subunit 4, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) complex. It plays a significant role in the assembly and stability of this complex by facilitating the incorporation of the E3 subunit, Lpd1, into the E1-E2 core. KGD4 directly binds to Lpd1, ensuring its stable integration into the KGDH complex. In the absence of KGD4, Lpd1 fails to co-migrate with Kgd2 and remains in a free form, indicating that KGD4 is essential for bringing Lpd1 into proximity with Kgd2 (Heublein2014The).

KGD4 contains two distinct domains that mediate its interactions: the N-terminal domain binds to the E3 subunit Lpd1, while the C-terminal domain interacts with the Kgd1-Kgd2 core. This dual-domain structure allows KGD4 to function as a molecular adaptor, facilitating the integration of the E3 subunit into the KGDH complex (Heublein2014The). KGD4 co-migrates with the catalytic subunits Kgd1, Kgd2, and Lpd1, further supporting its role in the complex. The absence of KGD4 significantly reduces KGDH activity, highlighting its importance in the functional organization of the complex (Heublein2014The).
