# SETSIP

## Overview
The SETSIP gene encodes the SET like protein, which is a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation. As a retrogene of the SET gene, SETSIP shares high homology with the SET-α and SET-β isoforms and is located on chromosome 1 (Bayarkhangai2018A). The protein plays a significant role in the differentiation of endothelial cells from induced pluripotent stem cells, making it a key player in regenerative medicine and cardiovascular therapies (McBride20186). SETSIP is also implicated in various disease contexts, including multiple myeloma and colorectal cancer, where its expression patterns may influence treatment outcomes and disease progression (Terragna2015The; Budinská2023Molecular). Through its interactions with other proteins and DNA, SETSIP contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cell function (Radulovic2016Spatial).

## Function
SETSIP, or SET like protein, is involved in the differentiation of endothelial cells (ECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). During this differentiation process, SETSIP is upregulated, and its stimulation with a SETSIP peptide increases the expression of endothelial markers, indicating its role in promoting EC differentiation. This function is crucial for regenerative medicine, particularly in developing therapeutic options for cardiovascular diseases (McBride20186).

SETSIP is closely related to the SET protein, with a 10 amino acid extension at the amino terminus. It is implicated in the reprogramming of fibroblasts into endothelial cells, suggesting its involvement in cellular differentiation processes (Radulovic2016Spatial). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal cell function. It is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with other proteins and DNA, influencing gene expression (Radulovic2016Spatial).

The SETSIP gene is located on chromosome 1 and is considered a retrogene of the SET gene, showing high homology with the SET-α and SET-β isoforms (Bayarkhangai2018A).

## Clinical Significance
The SETSIP gene has been implicated in various disease contexts due to its role in chromatin binding and cell differentiation. In multiple myeloma, alterations in the SETSIP gene have been associated with patient responses to induction therapy with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD). Specifically, small copy number losses on chromosome 1p22.1, which include the SETSIP gene, were significantly more common in patients achieving complete response compared to those with partial response or stable disease, suggesting a potential role in influencing treatment outcomes (Terragna2015The).

In colorectal cancer, SETSIP is noted for its differential expression in various morphotypes, particularly in the TB morphotype, which had the most differentially expressed genes. This suggests that SETSIP may play a role in the development and progression of colorectal cancer through its involvement in fibroblast reprogramming and differentiation into epithelial cells (Budinská2023Molecular).

The potential of SETSIP in distinguishing between different disease subtypes is also highlighted in cancer liquid biopsy studies, where its abnormal expression patterns under pathogenic conditions could help identify disease-associated genes and proteins (Chen2019Immunosignature).
