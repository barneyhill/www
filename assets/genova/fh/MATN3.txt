# MATN3

## Overview
The MATN3 gene encodes matrilin-3, a non-collagenous oligomeric extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of cartilage. Matrilin-3 is a member of the matrilin family, characterized by its modular structure, which includes a von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a coiled-coil α-helical oligomerization domain. This protein is primarily expressed in cartilage, where it acts as an adapter, bridging macromolecular networks and interacting with collagen-containing fibrils and other matrix proteins to maintain cartilage stability and organization (Ko2004Matrilin3; Budde2005Altered). Mutations in the MATN3 gene are linked to skeletal disorders such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), highlighting its clinical significance (Cotterill2005Multiple; Chapman2001Mutations).

## Structure
Matrilin-3 is a member of the matrilin family of extracellular matrix proteins, characterized by a modular structure that includes a von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and a coiled-coil α-helical oligomerization domain (Ko2004Matrilin3). It is the simplest member of the matrilin family, consisting of one vWFA domain followed by four EGF-like domains and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Ko2004Matrilin3). The vWFA domain is crucial for the protein's structure and function, playing a significant role in secretion, assembly, and proteolysis (Zhang2008Multiple). Matrilin-3 can form homotetramers via the coiled-coil domain, and mixed trimers and tetramers with matrilin-1 have been observed in humans and calves (Ko2004Matrilin3). 

Post-translational modifications of matrilin-3 include glycosylation, which affects its function and stability (Ko2004Matrilin3). The protein is primarily expressed in cartilage, where it connects macromolecular networks in the extracellular matrix, associating with collagen VI microfibrils and connecting them to aggrecan and collagen II (Ko2004Matrilin3). Mutations in the MATN3 gene, particularly in the vWFA domain, are linked to skeletal disorders such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) (Chapman2001Mutations).

## Function
Matrilin-3 (MATN3) is a noncollagenous oligomeric extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cartilage. It acts as an adapter, bridging different macromolecular networks within cartilage tissues, and is strongly expressed in growing skeletal tissues such as the epiphyseal growth plate (Budde2005Altered). Matrilin-3 interacts directly with collagen IX-containing cartilage fibrils and indirectly with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), contributing to the stability and organization of the cartilage matrix (Budde2005Altered).

In healthy human cells, MATN3 is involved in regulating gene expression in chondrocytes, the cells found in cartilage. It induces the expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which inhibits the IL-1 pathway, and stimulates the expression of type II collagen (COL2A1) and aggrecan (ACAN), key components of the cartilage extracellular matrix (Jayasuriya2012Matrilin3). MATN3 also inhibits the expression of protease genes such as MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, and ADAMTS-5, which are involved in cartilage degradation, thereby playing a protective role in maintaining cartilage integrity (Jayasuriya2012Matrilin3). These functions highlight MATN3's importance in cartilage homeostasis and its potential therapeutic applications in preventing cartilage degradation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MATN3 gene are associated with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and early-onset osteoarthritis, particularly affecting the hips and knees (Mäkitie2003Clinical; Cotterill2005Multiple). MED is genetically heterogeneous, and MATN3 mutations result in a relatively mild form of the disease, with symptoms including normal stature, mild hip abnormalities, and moderate knee changes (Mäkitie2003Clinical). 

The majority of MATN3 mutations are missense mutations located in the A-domain of matrilin-3, which lead to protein misfolding and retention in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), preventing its secretion (Cotterill2005Multiple; Fresquet2008Novel). This misfolding is believed to cause MED through dominant negative or interference mechanisms (Jackson2004Missense). Specific mutations such as p.Arg121Trp, p.Val194Asp, and others cluster in the β-strands of the A-domain, disrupting its folding and preventing the secretion of the mutant protein (Cotterill2005Multiple). 

In addition to MED, a mutation in the first EGF repeat of matrilin-3 has been linked to a form of hand osteoarthritis, and a recessive form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia results from a mutation at a neighboring residue (Cotterill2005Multiple).

## Interactions
Matrilin-3 (MATN3) is a non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in cartilage structure and function. It is known to interact with various proteins within the extracellular matrix, forming complex networks that contribute to cartilage integrity. Matrilin-3 interacts with collagen-containing fibrils, particularly type II and type IX collagens, which are essential for cartilage structure (Fresquet2008Novel). These interactions suggest that matrilin-3 acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the assembly of a complex matrix structure (Wagener2005The).

Matrilin-3 can form homo-tetramers and has been shown to create hetero-oligomeric complexes with matrilin-1, particularly in fetal human and calf cartilage (Wagener2005The). However, there is no conclusive evidence for other natural hetero-oligomers involving matrilin-3. The protein also interacts with non-collagenous molecules such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and decorin, which bind with higher affinity, indicating its role in a complex matrix assembly (Wagener2005The). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage, and disruptions in these interactions due to mutations can lead to skeletal disorders such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) (Cotterill2005Multiple).
