# SPTBN1

## Overview
SPTBN1 is a gene that encodes the protein spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1, commonly referred to as βII-spectrin. This protein is a crucial component of the cytoskeleton, playing a significant role in maintaining cell shape, stability, and intracellular organization. βII-spectrin is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is involved in forming a complex network with actin and ankyrin, which is essential for linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. It is characterized by its modular structure, including actin-binding domains and spectrin repeats, which confer elasticity and flexibility to the cytoskeleton. βII-spectrin is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and the regulation of cell cycle transitions. It is also vital for the stability of axons in the nervous system and the maintenance of cardiac membrane excitability. Mutations in SPTBN1 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2019SPTBN1; Cousin2021Pathogenic; Yang2021βII).

## Structure
The SPTBN1 gene encodes βII-spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and stability. The molecular structure of βII-spectrin is highly modular, consisting of several distinct domains. It includes actin-binding domains (ABDs) at the NH2 terminal, which are composed of a pair of calponin homology (CH) domains. These domains are crucial for actin binding, with CH1 primarily binding actin and CH2 regulating the conformational state through autoinhibition (Cousin2021Pathogenic; Yang2021βII).

The protein structure features 17 consecutive triple helix motifs known as spectrin repeats (SRs), which form a triple-helix supercoil connected by an α-helical linker. This configuration allows spectrin to expand and contract, contributing to its elasticity (Yang2021βII; Zhang2013Spectrin:). The C-terminal region of βII-spectrin includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, with splice variants exhibiting either 'long' or 'short' C-terminal regions (Yang2021βII).

βII-spectrin forms heterodimers with α-spectrin, which further assemble into tetramers, contributing to its quaternary structure. This assembly is essential for its function in forming a complex intracellular network with actin and ankyrin, maintaining cell membrane flexibility and shape (Zhang2013Spectrin:). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination affect its function and interactions (Yang2021βII).

## Function
The SPTBN1 gene encodes βII spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein crucial for maintaining cell structure and function in healthy human cells. βII spectrin forms a complex with ankyrin and actin, contributing to the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton and facilitating the linkage between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton (Derbala2018The; Yang2021βII). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, spreading, and the regulation of cell shape and flexibility (Yang2021βII).

In the nervous system, βII spectrin is essential for axon stability and the assembly of the axon initial segment, playing a role in rapid action potential propagation (Yang2021βII). In epithelial cells, it stabilizes cell connections and forms cell barriers, contributing to epithelial morphogenesis (Yang2021βII). βII spectrin is also involved in the regulation of the G1/S cell cycle transition through the TGF-β signaling pathway, affecting cell cycle checkpoint-related proteins (Yang2021βII).

In the cardiovascular system, βII spectrin is vital for maintaining normal cardiac membrane excitability and proper cardiac development during embryogenesis (Derbala2018The). It also plays a role in endothelial cell function, influencing cell-cell junctions and cell-matrix interactions (Rademakers2024Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPTBN1 gene are associated with several diseases, notably neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers. Pathogenic variants in SPTBN1 have been linked to an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, autistic features, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. These variants disrupt the stability and function of βII-spectrin, affecting neural development and function (Cousin2021Pathogenic).

In cancer, SPTBN1 plays a complex role. In colorectal cancer, loss of SPTBN1 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting a role in early carcinogenesis. Conversely, high SPTBN1 mRNA levels correlate with poor prognosis in late-stage colon cancer (Chen2019SPTBN1). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPTBN1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its loss is linked to increased expression of cancer stem cell markers, enhanced tumor sphere formation, and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and aggressiveness (Zhi2015βII‐Spectrin). SPTBN1 is also implicated in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where its knockdown in liver models reduces fibrosis and inflammation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Rao2021β2spectrin).

## Interactions
SPTBN1, or spectrin beta, non-erythrocytic 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular architecture and signaling. SPTBN1 interacts with α-synuclein in neuronal cells, a relationship that modulates neurite outgrowth. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays and colocalization studies in N2a neuronal cells, where SPTBN1 and α-synuclein are shown to directly interact (Lee2012αSynuclein). In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPTBN1 binds to SOCS1, stabilizing the SOCS1 protein and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of the p65 protein. This interaction is crucial for regulating inflammatory responses and tumorigenesis in HCC (Lin2021SPTBN1).

SPTBN1 also plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with E-cadherin and kallistatin, a Wnt inhibitor. Loss of SPTBN1 leads to decreased E-cadherin and increased Wnt signaling, promoting malignant behaviors in HCC cells (Zhi2015βII‐Spectrin). In neurodevelopmental contexts, SPTBN1 variants can disrupt the spectrin-actin membrane-associated periodic skeleton, affecting axonal growth and neuronal architecture (Cousin2021Pathogenic).
