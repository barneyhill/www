# MTIF3

## Overview
The MTIF3 gene encodes the mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of protein synthesis within mitochondria. This protein is essential for the proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, facilitating the binding of mRNA and initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Khawaja2020Distinct). These proteins are integral to oxidative phosphorylation and energy production, impacting cellular metabolism and overall health (Chicherin2019Mitochondrial). Structurally, MTIF3 is characterized by distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which are connected by a helical linker and include mitochondria-specific extensions that are absent in bacterial homologues (Khawaja2020Distinct). The protein's interactions with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and its role in ribosome splitting underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Derbikova2018Biological). Variations in the MTIF3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, obesity, and childhood allergic asthma, highlighting its significance in human health (Abahuni2007Mitochondrial; Zhao2024Identification; Huang2023Identification).

## Structure
The mitochondrial translation initiation factor 3 (MTIF3) in humans is a protein involved in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Structurally, MTIF3 is characterized by an extended topology with distinct N-terminal and C-terminal domains connected by a helical linker. These domains are flanked by mitochondria-specific extensions, which are not present in bacterial counterparts (Khawaja2020Distinct). The C-terminal domain of MTIF3 binds to specific rRNA sequences, playing a crucial role in blocking the premature association of the large mitoribosomal subunit (Khawaja2020Distinct).

The C-terminal extension (CTE) of MTIF3 is an α-helix that faces away from the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mtSSU) and is stabilized by interactions with the C-terminal domain (CTD). This orientation prevents MTIF3 from interacting with fMet-tRNA Met i, as the CTE occupies the binding site of the acceptor stem of fMet-tRNA Met i (Khawaja2020Distinct). The N-terminal domain forms interactions with other mitoribosomal proteins, which are conserved among vertebrates (Khawaja2020Distinct).

MTIF3's structure is adapted to its mitochondrial function, with its rigidity and specific domain interactions ensuring proper assembly and function of the mitochondrial translation initiation complex (Khawaja2020Distinct).

## Function
MTIF3, or mitochondrial translational initiation factor 3, is a crucial protein involved in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis. It plays a significant role in the assembly of the mitochondrial ribosome by facilitating the binding of mRNA and the initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit, a process essential for the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Khawaja2020Distinct). These proteins are vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production within cells, impacting cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal health (Chicherin2019Mitochondrial).

MTIF3 is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it ensures the proper translation and function of the mitochondrial genome. It is involved in ribosome splitting, promoting the dissociation of mitoribosomes into their subunits, and the dissociation of initiator tRNA from mitoribosomes in the absence of mRNA (Derbikova2018Biological). The protein's structure includes unique N-and C-terminal extensions that are adaptations to the mitochondrial environment, which are crucial for its function in mitochondrial translation (Derbikova2018Biological).

In axons, MTIF3 is locally synthesized and plays a critical role in promoting mitochondrial translation, which is essential for axonal growth and development (Lee2022mtIF3). This local translation supports mitochondrial function and ATP production, particularly upon stimulation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Lee2022mtIF3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MTIF3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor, and MTIF3 has been associated with PD pathogenesis. Studies have identified specific polymorphisms, such as c.798C>T and rs7669, that show significant associations with PD risk. These genetic variations may affect MTIF3 function, leading to impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis and increased oxidative stress, which are critical in the degeneration of dopamine neurons in PD (Abahuni2007Mitochondrial; Behrouz2010Mitochondrial; Anvret2010Possible).

MTIF3 is also linked to metabolic conditions, particularly obesity. Variants like rs1885988 and rs67785913 have been associated with differences in weight loss outcomes and adipocyte function. MTIF3 deficiency in adipocytes can lead to reduced mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, contributing to obesity by impairing lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Huang2023Identification).

In childhood allergic asthma, lower MTIF3 expression has been observed, suggesting a role in immune system imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of asthma (Zhao2024Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MTIF3 in various diseases through its impact on mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.

## Interactions
MTIF3, the mitochondrial translation initiation factor 3, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in mitochondrial translation. MTIF3 primarily interacts with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, including those with bacterial homologues such as MRPS5, MRPS9, MRPS10, and MRPS18, as well as mitochondria-specific proteins like MRPS29, MRPS32, MRPS36, and PTCD3. The N-terminal domain of MTIF3 binds to MRPS10, while the C-terminal domain interacts with the other ribosomal proteins (Kuzmenko2014Mitochondrial).

In yeast, the mitochondrial translation initiation factor 3, known as Aim23p, interacts with Pet111p, a specific translational activator for COX2 mRNA. This interaction is crucial for the translation of COX2 mRNA, as Aim23p enhances Pet111p's binding to the 5'-UTR of COX2 mRNA. The interaction between Aim23p and Pet111p was demonstrated using non-denaturing PAGE and a yeast two-hybrid system, which confirmed the physical interaction between these proteins (Chicherin2020Yeast). Although Aim23p does not directly bind COX2 mRNA, it facilitates Pet111p's binding, thereby promoting COX2 mRNA translation (Chicherin2020Yeast).
