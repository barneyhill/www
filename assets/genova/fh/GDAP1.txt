# GDAP1

## Overview
The GDAP1 gene encodes the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1, a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which is primarily located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Despite its structural resemblance to GSTs, GDAP1 lacks typical enzymatic activity and is distinguished by its unique dimerization and structural features. The protein plays a critical role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in fission and fusion processes, and is involved in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. GDAP1 also influences peroxisomal and Golgi apparatus morphology, contributing to cellular homeostasis and energy regulation. Mutations in the GDAP1 gene are associated with various forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, highlighting its clinical significance in peripheral neuropathies (Binięda2021Mutations; Nguyen2021Structure; Tazir2013Autosomal).

## Structure
The GDAP1 protein is a unique member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, characterized by its distinct structural features. It consists of 358 amino acids and includes domains similar to the N- and C-terminal domains of canonical GSTs, a hydrophobic domain (HD), and a transmembrane domain (TMD) (Nguyen2021Structure). Despite its GST-like domains, GDAP1 lacks typical GST activity due to its unique dimerization mode and structural differences, such as the absence of an α helix between β2 and β3 and the presence of unique helices α5 and α6 (Nguyen2021Structure).

The GDAP1 protein forms a homodimer mediated by a hydrophobic surface and a disulfide bridge involving Cys88 and Tyr29, which are crucial for dimerization (Nguyen2021Structure). The dimer interface is formed entirely between the GST-N domains, unlike canonical GSTs, which involve both GST-N and GST-C domains (Nguyen2021Structure). The dimer interface is smaller than that of canonical GSTs, with a buried surface area of 1,530 Å² (Nguyen2021Structure).

GDAP1's structure includes a long α6 helix and a flexible α5-α6 loop, contributing to its unique conformation. The protein's dimeric state is influenced by ligand binding, which can induce conformational changes (Nguyen2021Structure). GDAP1 is also associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with mutations affecting its folding and stability (Nguyen2021Structure).

## Function
The GDAP1 gene encodes the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1, which is primarily located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is involved in mitochondrial fission-fusion events, distribution, transmembrane potential, and bioenergetics, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Binięda2021Mutations). GDAP1 also influences peroxisomal morphology and is implicated in regulating calcium homeostasis, potentially through interaction with junctophilin-1 (Binięda2021Mutations).

In addition to its mitochondrial roles, GDAP1 affects the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus. Reduced expression of GDAP1 leads to changes in Golgi morphology and impacts the maturation and localization of trans-Golgi proteins, indicating its role in maintaining Golgi architecture and function (Binięda2021Mutations). GDAP1 is also involved in metabolic processes in skeletal muscle, where its expression is inversely related to AMPK activity. It influences lipid oxidation and non-mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a role in peroxisomal regulation and energy homeostasis (Lassiter2018AMPK).

GDAP1's functions are essential for normal cellular operations, including protein and lipid trafficking, processing, and sorting, as well as maintaining cellular oxidative balance and mitochondrial function (Kabzińska2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GDAP1 gene are linked to various forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a group of inherited neuropathies affecting the peripheral nervous system. These mutations can lead to both demyelinating and axonal forms of CMT, including CMT4A, AR-CMT2K, and CMTRIA, with varying inheritance patterns and clinical severity (Yoshimura2017Clinical; Senderek2003Mutations; Tazir2013Autosomal). Recessive mutations in GDAP1 are associated with severe, early-onset neuropathies, often resulting in significant disability by adolescence, while dominant mutations typically result in milder phenotypes with later onset (Zimoń2011Dominant; Tazir2013Autosomal).

GDAP1 mutations can impair mitochondrial dynamics, leading to decreased mitochondrial fission or fusion, increased reactive oxygen species production, and heightened susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli (Zimoń2011Dominant; BarneoMuñoz2015Lack). These alterations contribute to the pathophysiology of GDAP1-related neuropathies, which may involve complex interactions between mitochondrial networks, oxidative stress, and calcium homeostasis (BarneoMuñoz2015Lack). Additionally, GDAP1 mutations have been associated with symptoms such as vocal cord paralysis and diaphragmatic dysfunction, further complicating the clinical presentation of these neuropathies (Sevilla2008Vocal).

## Interactions
GDAP1 is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. It is an integral mitochondrial outer membrane protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in these processes. GDAP1 is known to interact with mitofusin 1 and 2 (MFN1/2), which are proteins located on the mitochondrial outer membrane and are crucial for mitochondrial fusion. It also interacts with proteins on the mitochondrial inner membrane, such as OPA1 and FIS1, which play roles in mitochondrial fission and fusion (Sutinen2022Conserved).

The protein forms dimers through a covalent disulfide bridge between Cys88 residues from each subunit, a feature that is essential for its function. This dimerization is distinct from that of catalytic GSTs, indicating a unique structural role in GDAP1's function (Sutinen2022Conserved). GDAP1's interactions are thought to be redox-dependent, potentially involving cytoskeletal components like actin and tubulin, which suggests a role in maintaining cellular structural integrity (Sutinen2022Conserved). Despite these insights, the exact molecular basis of GDAP1's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remains to be fully elucidated, and its enzymatic activity has not been convincingly demonstrated (Sutinen2022Conserved).
