# CD96

## Overview
CD96 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD96 protein is primarily expressed on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it plays a crucial role in immune response regulation. As a receptor, CD96 is involved in mediating cell adhesion and interactions between immune cells, particularly through its binding with CD155, a receptor important for immune regulation. The protein's function varies between cell types; it acts as an inhibitory receptor in NK cells, limiting cytokine production, while serving as a co-stimulatory receptor in CD8+ T cells, enhancing their activation and effector responses (Martinet2015Balancing; Chiang2020CD96). CD96's interactions and signaling pathways are significant in the context of tumor immunity, where its expression levels and interactions can influence cancer prognosis and potential therapeutic interventions (Zhang2020Direct; Ye2021CD96).

## Structure
CD96 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, primarily expressed on T and NK cells. Its extracellular domain comprises three immunoglobulin-like domains: V1, V2/C, and C, along with a membrane-proximal stalk domain (Jin2021Hitting). The cytoplasmic domain of CD96 contains a short basic/proline-rich motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-like domain, which is present in both mice and humans. In humans, the cytoplasmic domain also includes a YXXM motif, which is involved in binding and activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT pathway, although its role in immune-cell response is not fully understood due to its low specificity (Jin2021Hitting).

The molecular structure of CD96 suggests potential roles in immune signaling, but the exact nature of its function in human NK and T cells remains unclear. The discrepancies in CD96's role in immune regulation may be attributed to differences in the intracellular domain between mouse and human CD96, as well as the presence of the YXXM motif, which is also found in co-stimulatory receptors like CD28 and ICOS (Jin2021Hitting). CD96 is also subject to post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation, which contributes to its apparent size and may influence its activity and stability (Holmes2019Interaction).

## Function
CD96, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is primarily expressed on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a significant role in immune response regulation by mediating cell adhesion and interactions between immune cells. CD96 interacts with CD155, a receptor involved in cell adhesion and immune regulation, which is crucial for NK cell activity and cytokine production (Georgiev2018Coming; Seth2007The).

In NK cells, CD96 functions as an inhibitory receptor, limiting cytokine production, particularly IFNγ, by competing with CD226 for CD155 binding. This competition is essential for regulating NK cell cytokine secretion during inflammation (Martinet2015Balancing). CD96 also plays a role in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and adhesion, although its exact function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Martinet2015Balancing).

In contrast, in CD8+ T cells, CD96 acts as a co-stimulatory receptor, enhancing activation and effector responses. It promotes proliferation and cytokine production through the MEK-ERK signaling pathway, increasing the expression of transcription factors like NUR77 and T-bet, which are associated with cytotoxic effector activity (Chiang2020CD96).

## Clinical Significance
CD96, also known as Tactile, is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade glioma (LGG), high CD96 expression is associated with poorer overall survival, making it a negative prognostic indicator (Zhang2020Immune; Ye2021CD96). CD96 expression is upregulated in higher-grade gliomas and is more prevalent in IDH-wildtype gliomas, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for certain glioma subtypes (Zhang2020Immune).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), increased CD96 expression is observed in tumor tissues, correlating with T cell and NK cell exhaustion, which may contribute to immunosuppression and tumor progression (Trumet2023The). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, high CD96 expression is linked to poor prognosis and disease recurrence (Trumet2023The).

CD96 also plays a role in immune infiltration and modulation in various cancers. It is associated with immune cell markers and immune infiltration levels, impacting patient prognosis through immune-related mechanisms (Ye2021CD96). These findings suggest that CD96 could be a target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in cancers where it contributes to immune evasion and poor clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
CD96, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily within the immune system. It is part of a network of receptors that includes CD226 (DNAM-1) and TIGIT, all of which interact with CD155, also known as the poliovirus receptor (PVR). The interaction between CD96 and CD155 is significant for immune regulation, particularly in modulating natural killer (NK) cell activity. In humans, CD96 binds to CD155 with high affinity, which can activate NK cells, whereas in mice, this interaction is associated with decreased NK cell activation (Holmes2019Interaction; Georgiev2018Coming).

CD96 also interacts with nectin-1, although this interaction has a lower affinity compared to CD155. The binding site for CD96 on nectin-1 is located on the V-domain, which is a common interface for nectin interactions (Holmes2019Interaction). These interactions suggest that CD96 plays a role in immune cell adhesion and signaling, influencing the activation and function of NK and T cells (Holmes2019Interaction; Chiang2020CD96). The interaction with CD155 is particularly important in the context of tumor immunity, where blocking CD96 can enhance immune responses against tumors (Zhang2020Direct).
