# GPR37

## Overview
GPR37 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 37, a member of the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the central nervous system. GPR37 is also known as the parkin-associated endothelin-like receptor due to its interaction with parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (Zhang2022Inflammation; Berger2017Parkinson’s). The receptor's function is modulated through interactions with other proteins, including the adenosine A2A receptor and dopamine D2 receptor, influencing neurotransmission and cellular signaling pathways (Dunham2009GPR37; Morató2017The). GPR37's role extends beyond neurological disorders, as its expression levels are implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022Inflammation).

## Structure
GPR37 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of the rhodopsin or Class A family of GPCRs (Smith2015Drug). The protein consists of 613 amino acids and features a notably long N-terminal ectodomain, which undergoes cleavage by metalloproteases such as ADAM10 and furin (Bolinger2023Orphan; Mattila2021GPR37). This cleavage results in a mature protein lacking the first 167 amino acids (Bolinger2023Orphan).

GPR37 contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn 36, Asn 138, Asn 222, and Asn 239, which are common post-translational modifications that may influence its function (Smith2015Drug). The receptor also has a PDZ motif at its C-terminus, which interacts with proteins such as syntenin-1, PICK1, and MUPP1, potentially affecting its expression and cytotoxicity (Smith2015Drug).

The protein's structure includes a cysteine-rich region at the C-terminal, proposed to interact with the GABA(A) binding site of GABARAPL2 (Bolinger2023Orphan). GPR37 is involved in the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates, which are significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (Li2021Cytosolic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the GPR37 gene are implicated in several neurological disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD), GPR37 is associated with the accumulation of insoluble aggregates in Lewy bodies, a hallmark of the disease. These aggregates are linked to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, contributing to the neurodegenerative process (Zhang2022Inflammation; Berger2017Parkinson’s). GPR37's interaction with parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is crucial for its degradation, and disruptions in this process can lead to protein misfolding and cellular stress (Berger2017Parkinson’s).

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), specific mutations in GPR37, such as Del312F and R558Q, have been identified in patients, suggesting a potential link to the disorder. These mutations may contribute to ASD through mechanisms involving endoplasmic reticulum stress and altered dopamine signaling (FujitaJimbo2012Mutation).

GPR37 is also implicated in cancer, with its expression levels varying across different types. In lung adenocarcinoma, GPR37 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, lower expression correlates with poor outcomes (Zhang2022Inflammation). These findings highlight the dual role of GPR37 in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, depending on its expression and interaction with cellular pathways.

## Interactions
GPR37, also known as the parkin-associated endothelin-like receptor, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. It interacts with the adenosine A2A receptor (A2A R) in the striatum, forming heteromers that modulate A2A R cell surface expression and function. This interaction negatively regulates A2A R-mediated signaling, affecting locomotor activity and catalepsy in vivo (Morató2017The). GPR37 also interacts with the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), influencing D2R's ligand-binding properties and potentially forming complexes with A2A R and D2R in GABAergic striatopallidal neurons (Morató2017The; Dunham2009GPR37).

GPR37's surface expression is enhanced through interactions with the PDZ scaffold protein syntenin-1, which binds to its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (Dunham2009GPR37). This interaction is crucial for GPR37's trafficking and functional activity. Additionally, GPR37 interacts with other proteins such as PICK1 and MUPP1, which are involved in its cellular processes and have implications for neurotoxicity and disorders like autism spectrum disorders (Smith2015Drug). These interactions highlight GPR37's role in modulating neurotransmission and its potential as a therapeutic target.
