# CFAP97

## Overview
CFAP97, or cilia and flagella associated protein 97, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella. The CFAP97 protein is categorized as a structural component of the axoneme, the core of cilia and flagella, which is crucial for their motility functions. This protein is involved in maintaining the integrity of the flagellar axoneme, which is essential for proper sperm motility and fertility. CFAP97 interacts with various proteins, including those associated with the centrosome-cilium interface, and plays a role in protein quality control, particularly in response to misfolded proteins at the nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum. Its interactions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins suggest a potential impact on sperm motility during infection, highlighting its significance in both cellular and clinical contexts (Sansbury2023Pooled; BermejoValdés2020Ciliary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CFAP97 gene can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly related to male infertility. The gene is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the flagellar axoneme, which is essential for sperm motility. In mice, mutations in the orthologous gene Cfap97d1 result in defects in sperm motility, characterized by an asymmetric flagellar waveform and reduced swimming velocity, leading to male infertility (Oura2020Cfap97d1). These defects are primarily due to the loss of specific microtubule doublets, particularly doublet 4, which is critical for microtubule sliding during motility (Oura2020Cfap97d1). 

The study of Cfap97d1 knockout mice has shown that about half of the affected mice were infertile, while the rest exhibited severe sub-fertility, suggesting that CFAP97 could be a candidate gene for Multiple Morphological Abnormalities of the Sperm Flagella (MMAF) syndrome, a condition causing primary infertility due to flagellar defects (Oura2020Cfap97d1). Although the role of CFAP97 in humans is not fully elucidated, the similarities in ultrastructural flagellar defects between mice and humans indicate its potential involvement in similar conditions (Oura2020Cfap97d1). The gene's deletion in mice results in ultrastructural flagellar defects similar to those seen in MMAF, highlighting its clinical significance in reproductive health (Oura2020Cfap97d1).

## Interactions
CFAP97, also known as cilia and flagella associated protein 97, is involved in interactions with several proteins, particularly in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It interacts with four viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2: the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N protein), non-structural protein 16 (nsp16), non-structural protein 2 (nsp2), and non-structural protein 7 (nsp7). These interactions suggest a potential role in affecting sperm motility and transient male infertility during infection (BermejoValdés2020Ciliary).

CFAP97 is also part of a complex with human centrosome-cilium interface proteins, indicating its participation in the human ciliary structure (BermejoValdés2020Ciliary). Although specific details on the physical interactions of CFAP97 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in ciliary and flagellar structures is suggested through its association with these interface proteins (BermejoValdés2020Ciliary).

In addition, CFAP97 is implicated in protein quality control, particularly in response to protein misfolding at the nuclear membrane and the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is upregulated under these conditions and is associated with cytosolic translation, suggesting a role in modulating translation at the nuclear membrane and ER (Sansbury2023Pooled).
