# ADAMDEC1

## Overview
ADAMDEC1 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM-like decysin 1, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family of proteins. Unlike other ADAM proteins, ADAM-like decysin 1 is a soluble metalloprotease, lacking a transmembrane domain, and is characterized by a unique zinc-binding site that facilitates its proteolytic activity (Bates2002The; Seegar2019Domain). This protein plays a crucial role in immune response regulation and tissue remodeling, primarily expressed in immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (O’Shea2016Critical; Liu2020ADAMDEC1). ADAM-like decysin 1 is involved in the hydrolysis of extracellular matrix components, contributing to cell adhesion and migration, and is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and responding to inflammatory stimuli (Qi2022ADAMDEC1). Its expression and activity are significant in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Goncharova2016Genes; JimenezPascual2019ADAMDEC1).

## Structure
ADAMDEC1 is a unique member of the ADAM family of metalloproteases, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. Unlike typical ADAM proteins, ADAMDEC1 lacks a transmembrane domain and is secreted as a soluble protein. It features a metzincin-type metalloprotease domain and a truncated disintegrin-like domain, but it does not possess the cysteine-rich domain, transmembrane domain, or intracellular tail found in other ADAM proteins (Bates2002The; Seegar2019Domain).

The zinc-binding site of ADAMDEC1 is atypical, with two histidine residues and one aspartic acid coordinating the catalytic zinc ion, rather than the usual three histidine residues. This configuration is sufficient for its proteolytic activity (Lund2017Monoclonal). The protein is expressed as a zymogen with a large N-terminal prodomain, which undergoes post-translational proteolysis at specific proprotein convertase recognition sites. ADAMDEC1 is also subject to auto-proteolysis and is modified by N-linked glycosylations at specific asparagine residues (Lund2017Monoclonal).

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the disintegrin-like domain have been developed, which can modulate the proteolytic activity of ADAMDEC1 and enable its quantification in human plasma (Lund2017Monoclonal).

## Function
ADAMDEC1 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, which plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly in immune response regulation and tissue remodeling. This protein is primarily expressed in immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and is involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses (O’Shea2016Critical; Liu2020ADAMDEC1).

In healthy human cells, ADAMDEC1 is active in the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to the hydrolysis of extracellular matrix components, facilitating cell adhesion and migration. This activity is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and responding to inflammatory stimuli (Qi2022ADAMDEC1). ADAMDEC1 is also involved in the regulation of macrophage polarization, particularly promoting the M1 macrophage phenotype, which is associated with pro-inflammatory responses (Liu2020ADAMDEC1).

In the gastrointestinal tract, ADAMDEC1 is expressed in the lamina propria and is essential for intestinal immunity. It helps maintain mucosal barrier integrity and regulates inflammatory responses, protecting against exaggerated inflammation and infection (O’Shea2016Critical). The protein's expression is not dependent on bacterial antigens, indicating its role in innate immunity (O’Shea2016Critical).

## Clinical Significance
The ADAMDEC1 gene is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ADAMDEC1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with higher tumor malignancy and poorer prognosis. It contributes to GBM progression by maintaining cancer stem cell characteristics and promoting a growth factor signaling loop involving FGF2 and FGFR1 (JimenezPascual2019ADAMDEC1; Qi2022ADAMDEC1). In colorectal cancer, ADAMDEC1 expression is reduced in tumor tissues and further decreased in metastatic sites, suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis (MacartneyCoxson2008Metastatic).

In inflammatory diseases, ADAMDEC1 is upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis, indicating a potential role in disease pathogenesis (Kumagai2020&lt; ADAMDEC1; p&gt). Conversely, in Crohn's disease, its expression is downregulated, which may contribute to impaired immune responses and increased disease severity (Kumagai2020&lt; ADAMDEC1; p&gt). In ischemic heart disease, ADAMDEC1 is associated with atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, potentially leading to myocardial infarction (Goncharova2016Genes). These findings highlight ADAMDEC1's involvement in both oncogenic processes and inflammatory conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ADAMDEC1 interacts with various proteins and is involved in several biological processes. It is known to interact with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), although TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 do not inhibit its proteolytic activity. However, the hD362H variant of ADAMDEC1, which has a modified zinc-binding site, can be inhibited by N-TIMP-3, suggesting a specific interaction that is not present in the wild-type protein (Lund2015Evidence).

ADAMDEC1 also plays a role in the hydrolysis of pro-epidermal growth factor (pro-EGF) on platelet membranes. It is released from activated platelets and facilitates the conversion of pro-EGF to its active form, high-molecular-weight EGF (HMW-EGF). This interaction is significant for platelet function and vascular biology, as HMW-EGF acts as a ligand for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Chen2017The).

In the context of glioblastoma, ADAMDEC1 is involved in maintaining cancer stem cell properties by promoting the release of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) from the extracellular matrix, which activates FGFR signaling pathways. This interaction supports a growth factor signaling loop crucial for cancer stem cell maintenance (JimenezPascual2019ADAMDEC1).
