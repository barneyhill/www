# OSTN

## Overview
The OSTN gene encodes the protein osteocrin, a secreted factor primarily expressed in osteoblasts and other mesenchymal tissues. Osteocrin is characterized by its role as a modulator of natriuretic peptide signaling, particularly through its interaction with the natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C). This interaction is crucial for bone growth and development, as it enhances the signaling pathways of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), thereby promoting osteogenesis and chondrocyte maturation (Kanai2017Circulating; Chiba2016Osteocrin). Beyond its skeletal functions, osteocrin is also involved in neuronal activity in the primate brain, where it regulates dendritic growth in response to membrane depolarization, suggesting a role in synaptic development and function (Ataman2016Evolution). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various bone-related conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for skeletal disorders (Wang2021Control).

## Structure
Osteocrin (OSTN) is a secreted protein primarily expressed in osteoblasts and other mesenchymal tissues. The primary structure of osteocrin consists of 130 amino acids, including a cleavable signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is essential for its secretion (Moffatt2009Osteocrin; Thomas2003Osteocrin). The protein contains conserved dibasic cleavage sites, such as KKKR and KKR, which are reminiscent of those found in peptide hormone precursors and are crucial for its processing into smaller peptide fragments (Moffatt2009Osteocrin; Thomas2003Osteocrin).

Osteocrin shares homology with natriuretic peptides (NPs) in its C-terminal region, which includes domains similar to the ring structure of NPs. This region is important for binding to the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) (Moffatt2007Osteocrin; Moffatt2009Osteocrin). However, unlike typical NPs, osteocrin lacks the cysteine residues necessary for forming the cyclic ring structure, indicating it does not bind to GC-A or GC-B receptors (Moffatt2007Osteocrin).

The tertiary and quaternary structures of osteocrin are not detailed in the available literature. There is no mention of specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The OSTN gene, also known as osteocrin, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in bone growth and development. In bone tissue, OSTN is expressed in periosteal osteoblasts and is crucial for both endochondral and intramembranous ossification, processes that contribute to the growth in length and width of long bones, respectively (Watanabe-Takano2021Mechanical). OSTN enhances osteogenesis by potentiating C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) signaling, which is important for the proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes. This signaling pathway involves the activation of guanylate cyclase-B (GC-B) and the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), leading to the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs) (Watanabe-Takano2021Mechanical).

In the human brain, OSTN is an activity-dependent secreted factor that regulates dendritic growth in neurons. It is expressed in a subset of neocortical excitatory neurons and is involved in restricting dendritic growth in response to membrane depolarization (Ataman2016Evolution). The gene has been repurposed in primates to be transcribed in response to neuronal activity, a change attributed to specific regulatory elements within the OSTN gene locus (Ataman2016Evolution). This suggests that OSTN plays a role in the organization of dense primate neocortical networks, potentially contributing to synaptic development and function (Ataman2016Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OSTN (osteocrin) gene have been implicated in various bone-related conditions. The gene plays a critical role in osteocyte dendrite formation, and its dysregulation can lead to skeletal disorders. Specifically, alterations in OSTN expression are associated with defects in osteocyte morphology, which can contribute to conditions like skeletal dysplasia and other bone disorders (Wang2021Control). The study by Wang et al. suggests that OSTN is involved in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell shape, which are crucial for osteocyte development. This indicates that changes in OSTN expression levels can impact osteocyte morphology and function, potentially linking it to bone-related conditions (Wang2021Control).

The research also highlights the potential of OSTN in rescuing osteocyte defects in Sp7 mutant mice, suggesting that increasing systemic levels of OSTN can improve dendrite number and length, and reduce osteocyte apoptosis (Wang2021Control). This implies that OSTN could be a therapeutic target for improving bone health in conditions characterized by osteocyte dysfunction. While the study does not directly mention specific diseases caused by OSTN mutations, it underscores the gene's importance in maintaining bone integrity and its potential implications in skeletal diseases (Wang2021Control).

## Interactions
Osteocrin (OSTN) interacts with the natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C), a receptor involved in the clearance of natriuretic peptides. By binding to NPR-C, OSTN modulates the availability of natriuretic peptides, such as C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), enhancing their signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for bone growth, as OSTN binding to NPR-C reduces the clearance of CNP, thereby increasing its circulating levels and promoting endochondral bone growth (Kanai2017Circulating; Chiba2016Osteocrin).

OSTN also influences the nuclear export of transcriptional co-factors YAP1 and WWTR1 in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, a process dependent on CNP signaling through NPR2. This interaction suggests that OSTN enhances CNP-dependent signaling pathways, which are important for bone elongation and osteogenesis (Chiba2016Osteocrin).

In addition to its role in bone, OSTN has been shown to interact with the natriuretic peptide system in muscle and fat tissues, where it may influence energy metabolism and insulin signaling. OSTN's interaction with NPR-C in these tissues suggests a broader role in modulating natriuretic peptide actions beyond bone growth (Moffatt2009Osteocrin).
