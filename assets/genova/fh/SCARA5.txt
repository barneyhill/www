# SCARA5

## Overview
SCARA5 is a gene that encodes the protein scavenger receptor class A member 5, a type II transmembrane receptor involved in various physiological processes. The protein is characterized by its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, which plays a crucial role in ligand binding and internalization, particularly in the context of iron homeostasis and hemostatic balance (Yu2020Interactions; Swystun2019The). SCARA5 is implicated in the regulation of ferritin and von Willebrand factor (VWF), contributing to iron metabolism and blood coagulation, respectively (Swystun2019The; Ni2023Decreased). Additionally, SCARA5 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, where its expression is often downregulated, leading to enhanced tumorigenicity and metastasis (Huang2010Genetic; Ni2023Decreased). The gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways, such as the FAK-ERK pathway, underscores its role in cellular differentiation and cancer biology (WEN2016Overexpression; Lee2017SCARA5).

## Structure
SCARA5 is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and structural stability. The protein includes a C-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, which is crucial for ligand binding and is involved in recognizing and internalizing ferritin in a calcium-dependent manner (Yu2020Interactions). The SRCR domain also contains three calcium-binding sites, forming a positively charged region important for ligand interactions (Yu2020Interactions).

The molecular structure of SCARA5 features a transmembrane domain, a collagen-like domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The collagenous domain is involved in forming trimers and is essential for ligand binding, consisting of repeats of the G-X-Y motif that form a triple helix structure (He2014Identification). SCARA5 assembles as a trimer at the cell surface, which may depend on the spacer region of the receptor (Yu2020Interactions; Swystun2019The).

SCARA5 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially influencing its function and localization.

## Function
SCARA5 is a scavenger receptor that plays a significant role in the binding and internalization of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in human cells. It is expressed by littoral cells in the human spleen and functions as an endocytic receptor for VWF, facilitating its internalization into early endosomes. This process is crucial for the clearance of VWF and the VWF-FVIII complex, indicating SCARA5's involvement in maintaining hemostatic balance by regulating plasma levels of these factors (Swystun2019The).

SCARA5 is also involved in iron homeostasis, acting as a ferritin receptor that mediates non-transferrin iron transmission. It internalizes ferritin to regulate ferritin homeostasis and cell death, linking its function to ferroptosis, a form of cell death associated with immune infiltration and antitumor immunity (Ni2023Decreased).

In the context of adipogenesis, SCARA5 is expressed in preadipocytes and plays a critical role in the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to the adipocyte lineage. It regulates adipogenesis through the modulation of the FAK-ERK signaling pathway, promoting adipogenic differentiation over osteogenic differentiation (Lee2017SCARA5).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SCARA5 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, and lung cancer. In HCC, SCARA5 is frequently downregulated due to genetic and epigenetic mechanisms such as promoter hypermethylation and allelic loss. This downregulation is associated with increased tumorigenicity, cell invasion, and metastasis, primarily through the activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway. SCARA5 normally inhibits this pathway by interacting with FAK, and its silencing leads to enhanced phosphorylation of FAK and related proteins, promoting cancer progression (Huang2010Genetic).

In melanoma, decreased SCARA5 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with immune infiltration and ferroptosis, a form of cell death. SCARA5's expression levels correlate with survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Ni2023Decreased).

In lung cancer, SCARA5 is also downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation. This downregulation is associated with poor overall survival and increased cancer progression. SCARA5 overexpression in lung cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor (Peng2021The).

## Interactions
SCARA5, a member of the scavenger receptor class A family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with ferritin, specifically recognizing and internalizing it through its C-terminal SRCR domain. This interaction is crucial for ferritin binding, as demonstrated by experiments showing that the SRCR domain alone can pull down L-ferritin, confirming it as the binding site (Yu2020Interactions). The binding is Ca2+-dependent, with specific residues in SCARA5 essential for this interaction (Yu2020Interactions).

SCARA5 also plays a role in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SCARA5 interacts with the FAK signaling pathway, inhibiting FAK activation by preventing its phosphorylation. This interaction is significant in reducing cell invasion and metastasis (Huang2010Genetic). Similarly, in osteosarcoma, SCARA5 overexpression inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK and Src, reducing cell proliferation and invasion (WEN2016Overexpression).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), SCARA5 interacts with the ferritin light chain, leading to increased intracellular Fe2+ levels and inducing ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death. This interaction is suggested to inhibit tumor growth (Liu2022SCARA5).
