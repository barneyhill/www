# COPS3

## Overview
COPS3 is a gene that encodes the protein COP9 signalosome subunit 3, a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, primarily through its role in the deneddylation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which are crucial for protein ubiquitination and degradation (WEI2008The). COP9 signalosome subunit 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and signal transduction, and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Yan2003COP9). The protein interacts with several key molecules, such as desmosomal proteins and components of the MAPK signaling pathway, influencing processes like keratinocyte differentiation and cancer metastasis (Najor2017Epidermal; Yan2011RNAimediated). Alterations in COPS3 expression have been linked to various cancers, including osteosarcoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, where it is associated with increased metastasis and poor patient outcomes (Pang2017Knockdown; Zhu2019Knockdown; Yan2011RNAimediated).

## Function
COPS3, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), plays a crucial role in regulating protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It is involved in the deneddylation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which is essential for their function in protein ubiquitination and degradation (WEI2008The). COPS3 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle control, DNA damage response, and signal transduction (Yan2003COP9).

In the context of epidermal differentiation, COPS3 interacts with desmosomal proteins like Desmoglein 1 and Desmoplakin, facilitating the de-neddylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This interaction is crucial for promoting keratinocyte differentiation by inhibiting EGFR signaling, which is necessary for maintaining tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis in the epidermis (Najor2017Epidermal).

COPS3 also stabilizes proteins involved in signal transduction, such as Sos1, by preventing their degradation. This stabilization is important for maintaining proper levels of RasGTP formation, which is vital for cellular proliferation and differentiation (Zarich2019The). The CSN complex, including COPS3, is implicated in various cellular processes, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Schwechheimer2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COPS3 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In osteosarcoma, COPS3 overexpression is associated with increased metastasis and poor patient outcomes. Studies have shown that 57.1% of metastatic osteosarcoma cases exhibit intense COPS3 staining, compared to 18.9% in non-metastatic cases, suggesting a role in promoting metastasis. Silencing COPS3 in osteosarcoma cell lines reduces cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yan2011RNAimediated). COPS3 amplification is also linked to larger tumor size and a shorter time to metastasis, although its independent effect on disease-free survival is unclear (Yan2007COPS3).

In prostate cancer, high COPS3 expression correlates with shorter overall survival and is associated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis. Knockdown of COPS3 in prostate cancer cells reduces phosphorylated p38 MAPK expression and impairs the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Zhu2019Knockdown).

In lung cancer, COPS3 is overexpressed, particularly in small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Its expression is associated with poor differentiation and increased cell proliferation, suggesting a role in tumor growth and progression (Pang2017Knockdown).

## Interactions
COPS3, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Beclin1 and Raf-1, playing a crucial role in regulating autophagy and metastasis in osteosarcoma. This interaction affects the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which are important for cancer cell migration and invasion (Zhang2018Novel).

COPS3 also interacts with desmosomal components such as Desmoglein1 (Dsg1) and Desmoplakin (Dp) in keratinocytes. These interactions are important for regulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and keratinocyte differentiation. COPS3's interaction with Dsg1 and Dp is crucial for the de-neddylation of EGFR, a process necessary for proper epidermal differentiation (Najor2017Epidermal).

In the context of osteogenic sarcoma, COPS3 is implicated in the MAPK signaling pathway. Silencing COPS3 reduces the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MEK, suggesting its role in modulating this pathway to influence metastasis (Yan2011RNAimediated). These interactions highlight COPS3's involvement in critical signaling pathways and cellular processes.
