# RPS27

## Overview
RPS27 is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein S27, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit, which plays a pivotal role in the process of protein synthesis. The protein is characterized by a zinc-finger-like domain, although its cysteine residues undergo methylation, which likely alters its zinc-binding capacity (van2018Dissecting; Rabl2011Crystal). Ribosomal protein S27 is involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth, contributing to essential cellular processes such as mRNA translation and cell proliferation (Xiong2010Ribosomal). It also plays a significant role in the regulation of the p53-MDM2 axis, influencing cell cycle control and apoptosis (Xu2016The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as integrin β4, further underscore its involvement in cancer cell behavior and tumorigenesis (Xu2016The). Given its critical functions and implications in various cancers, RPS27 is of considerable interest as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Structure
The human ribosomal protein S27 (RPS27) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and features a zinc-finger-like domain, which is a common structural motif in ribosomal proteins. This domain is characterized by a C4-type zinc finger, which includes cysteine residues that are typically involved in zinc ion binding (van2018Dissecting; Rabl2011Crystal). However, in RPS27, these cysteine residues undergo methylation, which likely prevents zinc ion binding, altering the protein's structural and functional properties (van2018Dissecting).

The primary structure of RPS27 consists of 84 amino acids, with a high degree of conservation across species, differing by only a few amino acids in humans compared to other vertebrates (Xiong2010Ribosomal). The secondary structure includes a unique arrangement of β strands in the zinc finger core fold, which is specific to eukaryotes (Rabl2011Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of RPS27 include cysteine methylation, which is a novel modification for human ribosomal proteins and has been shown to affect the protein's interaction with zinc ions (van2018Dissecting). This modification is significant as it has not been previously reported in human ribosomal proteins, although it is known in yeast (Young2012Identification).

## Function
RPS27, also known as ribosomal protein S27, is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit and plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating mRNA translation. It is involved in ribosome biogenesis and cellular growth, contributing to cell proliferation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Xiong2010Ribosomal). RPS27 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and function of ribosomes, essential for protein synthesis (Xiong2010Ribosomal).

In healthy human cells, RPS27 is implicated in the regulation of the p53-MDM2 axis, a critical pathway for cell cycle control and apoptosis. RPS27 can bind to MDM2, inhibiting its activity and leading to p53 activation, which results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Xu2016The). This interaction suggests a role for RPS27 in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating cell proliferation under normal conditions (Xu2016The).

RPS27 also exhibits anti-apoptotic activity and is involved in cell cycle regulation. Its knockdown induces apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB activity, highlighting its dual role in promoting or inhibiting apoptosis and cell proliferation depending on cellular conditions (Xu2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RPS27 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, RPS27 expression is significantly elevated, particularly in cells from high-fat diet-fed mice, and is associated with cancer metastasis and recurrence. Overexpression of RPS27 enhances the migration and invasion abilities of prostate cancer cells, contributing to metastasis (Li2024Highfat). In gliomas, RPS27 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal brain tissues, although it is not suitable as a tumor cell-specific marker (Feldheim2020Ribosomal). 

In melanoma, RPS27 mutations near the transcription start site are associated with decreased expression, and a bimodal expression pattern is observed, with some tumors showing high expression and others low. High RPS27 expression is linked to increased proliferation and invasion, while low expression is associated with worse prognosis and increased drug resistance (Floristán2019Functional). 

RPS27 is also involved in the regulation of the p53-MDM2 axis, where its overexpression in cancers may stabilize mutant p53, providing a growth advantage (Xiong2010Ribosomal). These findings suggest that RPS27 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RPS27, also known as metallopanstimulin-1 (MPS-1), is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly within the p53-MDM2 regulatory axis. RPS27 binds directly to MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, inhibiting its activity and leading to the stabilization and activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is crucial for p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, especially under conditions of ribosomal stress (Xiong2010Ribosomal; Xu2016The). 

RPS27 also interacts with integrin β4 (ITGB4), which is significant for its role in regulating cell migration and invasion, particularly in gastric cancer. The interaction with ITGB4 is linked to the protein's ability to influence cancer cell behavior, with RPS27 expression correlating with poor survival outcomes in gastric cancer patients (Xu2016The).

In addition to these interactions, RPS27 is part of a group of ribosomal proteins that can bind to MDM2, competing with p53 for binding sites and thus modulating the degradation of p53. This competitive binding reduces MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination, thereby increasing p53 levels and activity (Xiong2010Ribosomal). These interactions highlight RPS27's role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis.
