# CDH6

## Overview
CDH6, or cadherin 6, is a gene that encodes a type II classical cadherin protein involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion. The cadherin 6 protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue architecture, primarily through homophilic binding at the cell membrane. This transmembrane protein is crucial for various physiological processes, including embryonic development, where it contributes to kidney morphogenesis and central nervous system formation. Additionally, cadherin 6 is involved in the regulation of endometrial receptivity, which is essential for embryo implantation. Beyond its physiological roles, CDH6 is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where it interacts with integrins to promote metastasis, and Alzheimer's disease, where its expression is altered. The clinical significance of CDH6 is underscored by its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, particularly in cancer treatment (Ahmad2020CDH6; Sancisi2013Cadherin; Zhou2020Characterization; Bartolomé2021CDH6‐activated).

## Function
Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is a type II classical cadherin involved in calcium-dependent cell adhesion, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue architecture. In healthy human cells, CDH6 is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it facilitates intercellular connections through homophilic binding, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and adhesive capacity of epithelial tissues (Zhou2020Characterization; Casal2019Beyond).

CDH6 is notably involved in the regulation of human endometrial receptivity, particularly during the mid-secretory phase, which is critical for embryo implantation. It localizes to the endometrial luminal epithelial cell surface, where it is essential for maintaining cell integrity and adhesive capacity, facilitating embryo attachment (Zhou2020Characterization). The protein's expression is reduced in the endometrium of women with infertility, suggesting its importance in fertility (Zhou2020Characterization).

In embryonic development, CDH6 plays a significant role in kidney morphogenesis, where it facilitates mesenchymal-epithelial differentiation necessary for nephron development (Sancisi2013Cadherin). It is also involved in the morphogenesis of the central nervous system, contributing to tissue morphogenesis and cell sorting (Sancisi2013Cadherin).

## Clinical Significance
CDH6 (cadherin 6) is implicated in several cancers, including ovarian, renal, and gastric cancers, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In ovarian and renal cancers, CDH6 is overexpressed in advanced stages and is involved in integrin-mediated metastatic progression. It interacts with integrins, particularly aIIbb3 and a2b1, promoting cellular adhesion and invasion, which are critical for metastasis (Bartolomé2021CDH6‐activated). In gastric cancer, high CDH6 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis, serving as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Zhao2021High).

CDH6 is also a target for therapeutic interventions. The development of HKT288, a CDH6-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has shown efficacy in preclinical models of ovarian and renal cancers, with its effectiveness correlating with CDH6 expression levels (Bialucha2017Discovery). In Alzheimer's disease, CDH6 protein levels are significantly increased in patients carrying the APOE ε4 allele, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathology (Ahmad2020CDH6). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CDH6 in various diseases, particularly in cancer progression and as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Cadherin 6 (CDH6) is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly with integrins. It acts as a ligand for the integrin αIIbβ3, a receptor critical for platelet aggregation. This interaction is mediated by the RGD motif present in the first cadherin domain of CDH6, which is crucial for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation (Dunne2012Cadherin). The binding of CDH6 to αIIbβ3 integrin is significant in both platelet function and cancer metastasis, as it promotes cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in metastatic ovarian and renal cancers (Bartolomé2021CDH6‐activated).

CDH6 also interacts with the integrin α2β1, facilitating cellular adhesion and invasion through integrin crosstalk. This interaction is essential for processes such as lung metastasis in cancer (Bartolomé2021CDH6‐activated). The RGD motif in CDH6 is evolutionarily conserved and plays a role in coagulation by activating αIIbβ3 integrin, which undergoes a conformational change to bind fibrinogen, aiding in platelet cross-linking (Casal2019Beyond). These interactions highlight CDH6's role in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions like cancer.
