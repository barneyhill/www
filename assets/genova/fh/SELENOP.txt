# SELENOP

## Overview
The SELENOP gene encodes selenoprotein P, a unique selenium-containing protein primarily synthesized in the liver. Selenoprotein P is characterized by its multiple selenocysteine residues, which are crucial for its function as a selenium transporter. This protein plays a vital role in distributing selenium from the liver to various tissues, including the brain, testis, and kidney, thereby supporting antioxidative defense and maintaining selenium homeostasis. Selenoprotein P interacts with specific receptors such as ApoER2 and megalin to facilitate selenium uptake in target tissues. Additionally, it is involved in modulating WNT signaling, which has implications in colorectal carcinogenesis. The SELENOP gene and its protein product are of clinical significance, with associations to conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity and colorectal cancer, as well as implications in cardiovascular health (Pilat2023SELENOP; Saito2021Selenium; Schomburg2019SelenoproteinP).

## Structure
Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is a unique selenoprotein characterized by its multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues, with humans having ten Sec residues encoded by UGA codons. The protein's primary structure includes a signal peptide, which is cleaved to produce a mature protein consisting of 359 amino acids (Tsutsumi2020Selenoprotein; Lamarche2021Characterization). SELENOP is divided into two main regions: an N-terminal domain with one Sec in a redox motif and a C-terminal domain containing up to nine Sec residues, which function as selenium transporters (Saito2021Selenium; Lamarche2021Characterization).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which contributes to its structural diversity and functional properties (Tsutsumi2020Selenoprotein; Lamarche2021Characterization). SELENOP exists in multiple isoforms due to genetic and post-translational variations, and these isoforms can differ in amino acid chain lengths and glycosylation sites (Lamarche2021Characterization). The protein's structure is complex, and its three-dimensional structure has not been fully resolved, partly due to challenges in expressing it exogenously (Tsutsumi2020Selenoprotein; Lamarche2021Characterization).

## Function
Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is a crucial selenium-containing protein primarily synthesized in the liver and present in human plasma. It plays a significant role in selenium transport and antioxidative defense. SELENOP contains multiple selenocysteine residues, which are essential for its function as a selenium transporter, delivering selenium from the liver to various tissues, including the brain, testis, and kidney (Renko2008Hepatic; Saito2021Selenium). In human plasma, SELENOP accounts for a substantial portion of the total selenium concentration, facilitating the maintenance of selenoenzymes that contribute to antioxidative defense and selenium metabolism (Saito2021Selenium).

SELENOP interacts with specific receptors such as ApoER2, megalin, and LRP1 to mediate selenium uptake in target tissues. ApoER2 is primarily associated with selenium uptake in the brain and testis, while megalin is linked to the kidney and brain (Saito2021Selenium). The protein also exhibits glutathione peroxidase-like activity, reducing phospholipid hydroperoxides and protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage (Schomburg2019SelenoproteinP; Saito2021Selenium).

SELENOP's role extends to supporting neurological and reproductive health, as evidenced by studies on knockout mice, which show neurological dysfunction and impaired spermatogenesis under selenium-deficient conditions (Renko2008Hepatic). Its presence in mother's milk indicates its importance in supplying selenium to offspring (Saito2021Selenium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SELENOP gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In premature infants, the rs3877899 variant of SELENOP is linked to an increased risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a condition that can lead to visual impairment and blindness. The rs3877899A allele is particularly associated with advanced stages of ROP and treatment failure, especially in infants with extremely low gestational age (Strauss2023SELENOP).

In colorectal cancer, SELENOP plays a role in tumorigenesis through its interaction with the WNT signaling pathway. SELENOP expression increases during the progression from normal colon stem cells to adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting its involvement in promoting tumor growth. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of SELENOP reduces tumor incidence and size, indicating its tumor-promotive role (Pilat2023SELENOP).

SELENOP deficiency is also linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Low plasma concentrations of SELENOP correlate with higher mortality rates and a greater risk of cardiovascular events, likely due to its role in selenium transport and antioxidant defense (Schomburg2019SelenoproteinP).

## Interactions
SELENOP, or selenoprotein P, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. One of its key interactions is with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins LRP5 and LRP6, which are co-receptors in the WNT signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for SELENOP's role in modulating WNT signaling activity, which is implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. The interaction domain on SELENOP for LRP5/6 is located between its third and fourth selenocysteines (Pilat2023SELENOP).

SELENOP also interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which can modulate its binding to LRP6, influencing WNT signaling. This interaction is thought to enhance WNT signaling through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms (Pilat2023SELENOP; Prabhu2023The).

In addition to its role in WNT signaling, SELENOP interacts with other receptors such as ApoER2 (LRP8) and megalin (LRP2), facilitating selenium transport to various tissues. These interactions are essential for maintaining selenium homeostasis and are involved in the uptake of selenium in the brain, testis, and kidney (Zhang2023Selenium; Saito2021Selenium).
