# SPINK13

## Overview
SPINK13 is a gene that encodes the serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 13, a protein involved in the regulation of proteolytic processes. This protein functions as a serine protease inhibitor, specifically interacting with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which plays a critical role in extracellular matrix degradation and cellular invasion. The inhibition of uPA by SPINK13 is particularly significant in the context of cancer biology, where it has been shown to impede the invasive growth of cancer cells, such as in hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, SPINK13 has been implicated in reproductive biology, where its expression is essential for normal sperm maturation and function. The gene's expression levels and interactions have potential clinical implications, serving as a prognostic marker in certain cancers and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Liao2022SPINKs; Zhang2019Lack; Wei2019Novel).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
SPINK13 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression and interactions. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), SPINK13 is upregulated, with increased transcription and protein expression levels. This upregulation is significantly correlated with decreased progression-free survival and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker in RCC (Liao2022SPINKs).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SPINK13 plays a role in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. It interacts with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) pathway, inhibiting the cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) by uPA, which is crucial for extracellular matrix degradation and cancer cell invasion. This interaction suggests that SPINK13 could serve as a molecular-targeted therapy for advanced HCC, although its clinical application requires further investigation (Wei2019Novel).

In the context of male fertility, SPINK13 is downregulated in a mouse model lacking androgen receptor SUMOylation, leading to defects in sperm motility and fertilizing ability. This suggests that SPINK13 is crucial for normal sperm maturation and function, and its altered expression can contribute to infertility (Zhang2019Lack).

## Interactions
SPINK13, a serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 13, is known to interact with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, as SPINK13 directly inhibits the activity of uPA, preventing the cleavage of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). This inhibition is crucial for controlling extracellular matrix degradation and invasive growth in cancer cells, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Liao2022SPINKs; Wei2019Novel).

In HCC, SPINK13's interaction with uPA has been shown to inhibit the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. This was demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments, where SPINK13 reduced the invasive growth of MHCC97-H cells, a highly aggressive HCC cell line, by targeting the uPA-MMP9 pathway (Wei2019Novel). The interaction between SPINK13 and uPA was confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, highlighting SPINK13's potential as a therapeutic agent by disrupting the uPA pathway (Wei2019Novel).

In ovarian cancer, SPINK13 overexpression is associated with a higher overall survival rate, suggesting its role in inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inhibiting uPA (Liao2022SPINKs).
