# OR2B2

## Overview
The OR2B2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily B member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, OR2B2 is embedded in the olfactory epithelium and participates in the initial steps of olfactory signal transduction by binding specific odorants and activating downstream signaling pathways (Yin2020Functional). The gene has been subject to positive selection in humans and chimpanzees, suggesting its evolutionary importance (Santos2010Variation). Additionally, OR2B2 is part of a larger transcript that includes the OR2B6 gene, indicating potential functions beyond olfaction, such as expression in fetal liver and spleen (Santos2010Variation).

## Function
OR2B2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating olfactory signal transduction pathways. When OR2B2 binds to specific odorants in the olfactory epithelium, it triggers a cascade of molecular events that lead to the generation of a neuronal response, ultimately contributing to the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional).

The olfactory transduction process involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, which increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This rise in cAMP opens ion channels, allowing an influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the olfactory sensory neurons, leading to their depolarization and the transmission of signals to the brain (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). Although the specific ligands for OR2B2 are not yet identified, the gene is noted for evidence of positive selection in humans and chimpanzees, indicating its potential evolutionary significance (Santos2010Variation). OR2B2 is also part of a long primary transcript related to the OR2B6 gene, which is expressed in fetal liver and spleen, suggesting a broader functional role beyond olfaction (Santos2010Variation).
