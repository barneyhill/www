# PIK3R5

## Overview
The PIK3R5 gene encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 5, commonly referred to as p101, which is a critical component of the class IB phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3Kγ) complex. This regulatory subunit plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways by facilitating the activation of PI3Kγ through its interactions with the catalytic p110γ subunit and the Gβγ subunits of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Al2011A). The p101 subunit is essential for the membrane anchoring and activation of PI3Kγ, influencing various physiological processes such as cell survival, growth, metabolism, immune response, and cardiac function (Han2023lncRNA; Lv2022Exosomes). The gene is notably expressed in the cerebellum, implicating its involvement in neurological functions and disorders (Al2011A). Mutations and dysregulation of PIK3R5 have been associated with several diseases, including ataxia-oculomotor apraxia and osteoarthritis, highlighting its clinical significance (Staiano2015Mendelian; Lv2022Exosomes).

## Structure
The PIK3R5 gene encodes the p101 regulatory subunit of class IB phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3Kγ), which is involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The p101 subunit is crucial for the activation of PI3Kγ, particularly through its interaction with the catalytic p110γ subunit. The N-terminus of p101 binds to the p110γ catalytic subunit, while the C-terminus interacts with the Gβγ subunits of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), facilitating the membrane anchoring and activation of PI3Kγ (Al2011A).

The structure of p101 includes specific domains that mediate these interactions, although detailed structural information such as specific folds or secondary structures is not provided in the available context. The study identified a missense mutation near the C-terminus Gβγ binding domain, which in silico analysis suggests may decrease protein stability and affect the activation of PI3Kγ by altering interaction domains (Al2011A).

PIK3R5 is highly expressed in the cerebellum and cerebellar vermis, indicating its potential role in cerebellar development and function. This expression pattern is relevant to its association with disorders such as ataxia and oculomotor apraxia (Al2011A).

## Function
The PIK3R5 gene encodes the p101 regulatory subunit of class IB phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3Kγ), which is involved in various intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, growth, metabolism, immune, and cardiac functions (Al2011A). PI3Kγ is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic p110 subunit and a regulatory subunit, such as p101, which is encoded by PIK3R5. This regulatory subunit is crucial for the activation of PI3Kγ by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as it binds to the p110 catalytic subunit and the Gβγ subunit, facilitating the enzyme's activation and membrane anchoring (Al2011A).

In healthy human cells, PIK3R5 is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high expression in the fetal brain and specific regions of the adult brain, such as the cerebellum and vermis cerebelli (Al2011A). The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, in which PIK3R5 is involved, plays a significant role in cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This pathway is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and is implicated in various physiological processes, including immune responses and cardiovascular health (Han2023lncRNA; Lv2022Exosomes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PIK3R5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of Ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 3 (AOA3), a rare form of autosomal recessive ataxia, mutations in PIK3R5 are associated with cerebellar ataxia, sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia, fixation instability, and extrapyramidal features. These mutations are predicted to cause structural instability of the PIK3R5 protein, leading to a loss of interaction with its relevant PIK3 partner (Staiano2015Mendelian).

In osteoarthritis (OA), PIK3R5 expression is significantly higher in the cartilage tissues of OA patients compared to non-OA patients. This increased expression is linked to the regulation of PIK3R5 mRNA stability by the osteoarthritis non-coding transcript (OANCT) and the FTO protein, which affects the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Alterations in PIK3R5 expression contribute to inflammatory responses and cartilage degradation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in OA (Lv2022Exosomes).

In metastatic melanoma, novel mutations in PIK3R5 have been identified, which may contribute to melanoma progression and resistance to BRAF V600 inhibitors. These mutations suggest a cooperative role in melanoma proliferation and highlight the potential for targeting the PI3K pathway in treatment strategies (Shull2012Novel).

## Interactions
The PIK3R5 gene encodes the p101 regulatory subunit, which is a crucial component of the class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kγ) complex. This subunit interacts with the catalytic subunit PIK3CG (p110γ) to form a functional PI3Kγ complex. The p101 subunit is essential for the activation of PI3Kγ by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as it binds to the P110 catalytic subunit through its N-terminus and to the Gβγ subunits via its C-terminus. Both interactions are necessary for the activation of PI3Kγ, which plays a significant role in various cellular functions, including cell survival, growth, and metabolism (Al2011A).

In mouse neutrophils, the p101/p110γ complex is involved in neutrophil chemotaxis, while the p84/p110γ complex is more associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Mutations in the Gβγ-binding sites of these complexes can significantly impact neutrophil responses, highlighting the importance of Gβγ interaction in their activation (Rynkiewicz2020Gβγ).

PIK3R5 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, such as lnc-Helf and miR-210-5p, which regulate its mRNA stability and expression, affecting pathways like AKT/mTOR and contributing to various pathological conditions (Han2023lncRNA; Liu2020miR2105p).
