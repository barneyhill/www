# ZNF30

## Overview
ZNF30 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 30, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 30 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and chromatin remodeling. Its function is significant in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. The protein's ability to interact with other molecular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact when dysregulated (Ito2020Endogenous; AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF30 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and interactions. In prostate cancer, the long noncoding RNA lnc-ZNF30-3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, sponging miR-145-5p. This interaction prevents miR-145-5p from targeting TWIST1, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer progression. The upregulation of lnc-ZNF30-3 in prostate cancer tissues is associated with poor clinical outcomes, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Le2023Protumorigenic).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, ZNF30 is part of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is crucial for brain development. De novo deletions in the 19q13.11 region, including the ZNF30 gene, have been linked to microcephaly and intellectual disabilities, indicating its potential role in these conditions (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

While the specific clinical significance of ZNF30 mutations in other diseases is not fully detailed, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests that alterations could impact various gene regulation pathways, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Ito2020Endogenous).
