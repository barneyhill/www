# TRIM69

## Overview
TRIM69 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 69, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which collectively classify it as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM69 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including centrosome dynamics, chromosome segregation, and microtubule dynamics, by facilitating protein interactions and post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Wang2018Interferonstimulated). It is also involved in the immune response, particularly in inhibiting viral replication, by targeting viral proteins for degradation (Wang2018Interferonstimulated; Rihn2019TRIM69). Clinically, TRIM69 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Chi2023TRIM69:; Sun2023TRIM69).

## Structure
TRIM69 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, characterized by a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating interactions and post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Wang2018Interferonstimulated). The RING domain is crucial for TRIM69's antiviral activity, as it mediates dimerization and multimerization, which are essential for its function against viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and dengue virus (DENV) (Kueck2019Vesicular; Wang2018Interferonstimulated).

TRIM69 forms dimers through its coiled-coil domain in an antiparallel orientation, and these dimers can assemble into higher-order multimeric structures. Specific amino acids at the dimer interface, such as V95, L96, and L99, are important for this process, and mutations at these sites disrupt multimerization and antiviral activity (Kueck2019Vesicular). TRIM69 also has splice variant isoforms, including TRIM69A and TRIM69B, with TRIM69A containing the RING domain and being associated with centrosome dynamics during mitosis, while TRIM69B lacks this domain and does not localize with the centrosome (Wang2023The). The protein's ability to form filamentous structures and cytoplasmic bodies has been observed through superresolution imaging (Kueck2019Vesicular).

## Function
TRIM69 is a protein encoded by the TRIM69 gene, which plays a significant role in centrosome dynamics and chromosome segregation in human cells. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacting with protein kinases MST2 and MST1, and promoting the formation of an MST2-PLK1 complex. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of MST2 at S15, a necessary step for centrosome disjunction, a process distinct from other pathways that do not involve PLK1 (Wang2023The).

TRIM69 is also involved in microtubule dynamics and centrosome clustering. It forms complexes with microtubule motors like DYNEIN and microtubule-associated proteins such as PRC1, which are essential for centrosome clustering and separation. TRIM69 promotes the association of PRC1 with antiparallel microtubule bundles and facilitates Dynein's association with microtubules, aiding in centrosome coalescence and spindle formation (Wang2023The).

In addition to its role in centrosome dynamics, TRIM69 is inducible by interferons and plays a role in inhibiting vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus in human cells, highlighting its involvement in immune response modulation (Rihn2019TRIM69).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TRIM69 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), TRIM69 is significantly downregulated in anoikis-resistant cells, which are crucial for metastasis. Overexpression of TRIM69 inhibits anoikis resistance, migration, and invasion of GC cells, while its knockdown promotes these processes. TRIM69 interacts with PRKCD, leading to its degradation and suppression of anoikis resistance and metastasis through the TRIM69/PRKCD/BDNF axis. Low TRIM69 expression is associated with distant metastasis in GC patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2023TRIM69).

In breast cancer, TRIM69 is involved in centrosome dynamics and mitotic progression. It is highly expressed in certain cancers and is associated with centrosome amplification and homologous recombination deficiency. TRIM69 deficiency leads to increased spindle multipolarity and decreased clonogenic survival, indicating its role in promoting cell proliferation under mitotic stress (Wang2023The).

In colon adenocarcinoma, TRIM69 expression is lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues and is linked to metastasis. It is associated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents like 5-fluorouracil and better responses to PD-1 inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a marker for metastasis and a target for enhancing drug sensitivity (Chi2023TRIM69:).

## Interactions
TRIM69 is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with MST2 and MST1, serine/threonine protein kinases that are part of the Hippo pathway, through strong interactions with its variant TRIM69A. These interactions are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. TRIM69A promotes the ubiquitination of MST2, although this does not lead to its degradation, suggesting a non-degradative role (Wang2023The).

TRIM69A also interacts with proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, such as PRC1 and Dynein. It co-localizes with PRC1, promoting its localization to bundled microtubules, and facilitates the association of Dynein with these structures. These interactions are crucial for centrosome clustering and microtubule bundling (Wang2023The).

In the context of viral infections, TRIM69 targets the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) of the dengue virus, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby restricting viral replication (Wang2018Interferonstimulated). It also interacts with the P protein of the Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), inhibiting viral transcription by associating with the L-stimulatory region of the P protein (Kueck2019Vesicular).
