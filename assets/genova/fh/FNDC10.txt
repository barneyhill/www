# FNDC10

## Overview
The FNDC10 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 10, which is involved in various cellular processes, including adhesion and interactions with the extracellular matrix. This protein is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains, which are commonly found in proteins that mediate cell adhesion and signal transduction. FNDC10 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer, where it undergoes significant changes in expression and co-expression networks between healthy and tumor tissues. These alterations suggest a potential role in tumorigenesis and highlight its importance in cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, FNDC10 expression is significantly affected by GLE1 dysfunction, further underscoring its role in cellular homeostasis and development (Zárybnický2024GLE1; AviñaPadilla2022Deciphering). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, FNDC10 has not been identified as a significant target for immunotherapy, indicating that its role in cancer treatment may be limited or context-dependent (Lischer2024Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The FNDC10 gene has been implicated in various cancer types due to its role in cellular processes and signaling pathways. In cancer, FNDC10 is affected by genetic 'rewiring,' particularly in breast cancer, where significant changes in co-expression networks between healthy and tumor tissues have been observed. This suggests that FNDC10 may play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and could serve as a potential therapeutic target (AviñaPadilla2022Deciphering).

In the context of GLE1 dysfunction, FNDC10 is significantly downregulated in Gle1 -/- embryos, indicating that GLE1 function is crucial for the expression of FNDC10. This downregulation impacts cellular homeostasis and development, suggesting that FNDC10 is involved in adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions (Zárybnický2024GLE1).

Despite its involvement in these processes, FNDC10 was not identified as a significant target for immunotherapy in a study ranking tumor-associated antigens. It received a score of 0 for all its peptides, indicating it may not be a significant target in the context of the study's immunotherapy model (Lischer2024Gene). The clinical significance of FNDC10 gene mutations, expression alterations, or interaction changes remains an area for further research.
