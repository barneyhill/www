# SLC44A4

## Overview
SLC44A4 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 44 member 4, also known as the human thiamine pyrophosphate transporter (hTPPT). This protein is a multitransmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the uptake of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a vital form of vitamin B1, across cell membranes. It is predominantly expressed in the human colon, where it facilitates the absorption of TPP produced by gut microbiota, thus contributing to cellular metabolism and energy production. The SLC44A4 protein is part of the choline transporter-like protein family and is characterized by 13 transmembrane domains, with significant post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. Variants of the SLC44A4 gene have been associated with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and alterations in lipid metabolism, highlighting its importance in both nutritional and clinical contexts (Nabokina2014Molecular; Gupta2016Identification).

## Structure
The SLC44A4 gene encodes a protein known as the human thiamine pyrophosphate transporter (hTPPT), which is a multitransmembrane protein involved in the transport of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) across cell membranes. The primary structure of the SLC44A4 protein includes 710 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 79,254 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.91 (Nabokina2014Molecular). The protein is highly conserved across mammals, showing 82-86% identity with homologs in other species (Nabokina2014Molecular).

The secondary and tertiary structures of hTPPT are characterized by 13 transmembrane domains, with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus (Nabokina2014Molecular). The protein is heavily glycosylated and contains potential N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, indicating post-translational modifications that may regulate its function (Nabokina2014Molecular; Gupta2016Identification).

SLC44A4 has three alternatively spliced transcript variants, encoding different isoforms. Variant 1, the longest, is predominantly expressed in human colonic epithelial cells and is capable of transporting TPP (Nabokina2014Molecular). Variant 3, a truncated version, also retains TPP transport capability (Nabokina2014Molecular). These structural features contribute to the protein's role in thiamine nutrition and its association with ulcerative colitis (Gupta2016Identification).

## Function
The SLC44A4 gene encodes a protein that functions as a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) transporter, specifically in the human colon. This transporter is crucial for the uptake of TPP, a form of vitamin B1 synthesized by gut microbiota, which is essential for cellular metabolism and energy production (Nabokina2014Molecular). The SLC44A4 protein, also known as the human TPP transporter (hTPPT), is a multitransmembrane protein with 13 predicted transmembrane domains, and it is part of the choline transporter-like protein family (Nabokina2014Molecular).

In healthy human cells, SLC44A4 is predominantly expressed in the colon, where it facilitates the absorption of microbiota-generated TPP at the apical membrane of colonic epithelial cells. This process is temperature- and energy-dependent, Na+-independent, and highly specific for TPP, indicating a TPP-H+ cotransport mechanism (Nabokina2014Molecular). The transporter is also expressed in other tissues such as the prostate, trachea, and lungs, suggesting additional physiological roles (Nabokina2014Molecular; Nabokina2015Regulation). The activity of SLC44A4 is vital for maintaining thiamine homeostasis, contributing to overall body thiamine nutrition and the cellular nutrition of colonocytes (Nabokina2014Molecular; Nabokina2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC44A4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis (UC). SLC44A4, which encodes a thiamine pyrophosphate transporter, is crucial for thiamine uptake in colonocytes. Variants in this gene can lead to reduced thiamine uptake, contributing to vitamin B1 deficiency, a condition associated with chronic fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease patients (Gupta2016Identification; Gupta2016A). 

The gene has shown significant associations with UC susceptibility in various populations, including North Indian and Han Chinese cohorts. In these populations, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs2736428 have been identified as risk factors for UC, suggesting that genetic variations in SLC44A4 may influence disease susceptibility and progression (Wu2017Evaluating; Gupta2016A). 

Additionally, the SLC44A4 gene has been linked to serum lipid levels, with the rs577272 SNP associated with total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in certain ethnic groups. This association indicates a potential role in lipid metabolism and related conditions, such as coronary heart disease (Zheng2020Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SLC44A4 in various metabolic and inflammatory conditions.
