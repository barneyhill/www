# CTSW

## Overview
CTSW is a gene that encodes the protein cathepsin W, a member of the cysteine protease family, which is primarily expressed in immune cells such as CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Cathepsin W plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating protein degradation within lysosomes, thereby contributing to antigen processing and presentation. This function is crucial for the immune system's ability to target and eliminate infected or cancerous cells. The protein is characterized by a papain-like fold and a unique C-terminal extension, which may influence its subcellular localization and function. CTSW expression is regulated by interleukin-2 (IL-2), with higher expression levels observed in NK cells compared to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, underscoring its importance in maintaining cytotoxic activity. The gene's expression is notably high in immune-related tissues, such as the spleen and lymph nodes, highlighting its significant role in immune responses (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

## Structure
The CTSW gene encodes a putative polypeptide consisting of 376 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The primary structure of CTSW includes a catalytic triad composed of Cys-153, His-291, and Asn-330, which are highly conserved residues typical of papain-like enzymes. Other notable residues include Gln19, Trp177, Gly67, and Gly68. A unique substitution in CTSW is Gly-23â†’Cys, which may influence peptide bond cleavage selectivity (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

The tertiary structure of CTSW is predicted to have a papain-like fold, a common feature among cathepsins, although its 3D structure has not been experimentally solved. Predicted structures from AlphaFold are available (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). CTSW is unique among cysteine proteinases due to its C-terminal extension, which may play a role in regulating subcellular localization (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

CTSW is primarily expressed in immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and is localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The gene includes 11 exons, with 10 encoding cysteine proteinases, and has splice variant isoforms, including one with a deletion of exon 6, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

## Function
CTSW (cathepsin W) is a cysteine protease primarily expressed in CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, where it plays a crucial role in cellular cytotoxic processes. It is involved in the degradation of proteins within lysosomes, contributing to antigen processing and presentation, which enhances the immune system's ability to target and destroy infected or cancerous cells (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). 

CTSW is regulated by interleukin-2 (IL-2), with NK cells expressing significantly more CTSW transcripts than cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the cytotoxic activity of these immune cells, as decreased expression of CTSW corresponds to reduced cytotoxic activity in NK cells (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). 

In terms of subcellular localization, CTSW is found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in humans and mice, although the anchoring mechanisms are not fully understood (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). The gene's expression is highest in immune system tissues such as the spleen, peripheral blood, and lymph nodes, indicating its significant role in immune responses (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). 

CTSW also plays a role in immune system regulation, modulating immune cell activation and effector function, including dendritic cell maturation and T-cell activation (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

## Clinical Significance
CTSW (cathepsin W) is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), tumor cells exhibit significantly lower CTSW expression compared to normal cells, and this reduced expression is consistent across different risk factors. Elevated CTSW expression is generally associated with a favorable prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer, where it enhances the immune response against early cancer cells. In breast cancer patients with BRCA variants, higher CTSW expression levels correlate with increased overall survival, suggesting its potential as a marker for metastasis (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CTSW is linked to the immune response and DNA damage repair processes, showing an inverse relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. This suggests a role in inhibiting cancer progression (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), altered CTSW expression is associated with survival rates, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).

CTSW is also involved in racial disparities in cancer survival, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its expression varies between individuals of African and European ancestry (Zdravkova2024Unveiling). Despite extensive research, the precise role of CTSW in cancer immune response remains unclear (Zdravkova2024Unveiling).
