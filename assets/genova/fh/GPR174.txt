# GPR174

## Overview
GPR174 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 174, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily expressed in lymphoid organs and plays a crucial role in immune regulation, particularly in modulating T cell function. The GPR174 protein is activated by lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), a lipid mediator that binds to the receptor, leading to downstream signaling events that suppress T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 production through a Gαs-dependent pathway (Liang2023Structural; Barnes2018Lysophosphatidylserine). The receptor's unique structural features, including its ligand-binding pocket, facilitate its interaction with LysoPS and subsequent activation of immune signaling pathways. GPR174's involvement in immune homeostasis and its potential implications in autoimmune diseases and other conditions highlight its significance as a therapeutic target (Qiu2019Gpr174deficient; Barnes2015The).

## Structure
GPR174 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature among GPCRs. The receptor's structure includes a unique ligand-binding pocket for lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), which is divided into an inner polar subpocket and a lateral hydrophobic subpocket. The polar head of LysoPS is accommodated in a positively charged pocket, involving residues such as R75, K98, Y99, and Y79, which contribute to the receptor's high constitutive activity (Liu2023Structural; Liang2023Structural).

The tertiary structure of GPR174 reveals that the L-serine head group of LysoPS is deeply buried in a positively charged cavity, forming extensive polar interactions that stabilize the ligand within the binding pocket (Liang2023Structural). The receptor's quaternary structure, as observed in cryo-electron microscopy studies, shows GPR174 in complex with Gs proteins, highlighting a non-canonical Gs coupling mode. This involves a unique interaction where the 'hook' of the Gαs protein protrudes into a groove formed by transmembrane helices TM1, TM2, and TM7 (Nie2023Specific).

GPR174 is expressed in lymphoid organs and is involved in immune regulation, with potential implications for autoimmune disease therapies (Liang2023Structural).

## Function
GPR174 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in T cell function. It is predominantly expressed in lymphoid organs such as the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, where it modulates T cell activity and proliferation (Liang2023Structural; Barnes2018Lysophosphatidylserine). GPR174 is activated by lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), a lipid mediator that binds to the receptor, leading to the suppression of T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production through a Gαs-dependent signaling pathway (Nie2023Specific; Barnes2018Lysophosphatidylserine).

In regulatory T cells (Tregs), GPR174 constrains their development and function, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune responses (Barnes2015The). The receptor's activity is linked to the modulation of cyclic AMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which are involved in the suppression of T cell activation markers such as CD25 and CD69 (Barnes2018Lysophosphatidylserine). GPR174's role in immune regulation suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, as its deficiency has been associated with enhanced Treg activity and reduced severity of autoimmune conditions (Barnes2015The).

## Clinical Significance
GPR174 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in immune response regulation. Alterations in GPR174 expression have been associated with hypertensive retinopathy, where its upregulation contributes to increased retinal thickness, vascular permeability, and inflammation. Suppression of GPR174 in angiotensin II-treated mice alleviated these symptoms by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for hypertensive retinopathy (Yue2020GPR174).

In autoimmune diseases, genetic variations in GPR174 have been linked to conditions such as Graves' disease and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GPR174, such as rs3827440 and rs5912838, are associated with increased risk of AITD in Korean children, indicating a genetic susceptibility linked to these polymorphisms (Cho2020GPR174).

GPR174 also plays a role in sepsis, where its deficiency in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue injury, promoting an anti-inflammatory response. This suggests that GPR174 could be a target for managing inflammatory disorders like sepsis (Qiu2019Gpr174deficient).

Additionally, elevated expression of GPR174 has been observed in vasovagal syncope (VVS) patients, suggesting a potential role in the condition's pathogenesis (Huang2014Alteration).

## Interactions
GPR174, a G protein-coupled receptor, primarily interacts with the Gαs protein to mediate its signaling functions. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's role in suppressing T cell proliferation and activation by reducing IL-2 production, a process that involves increasing cyclic AMP levels and activating protein kinase A (PKA) (Liu2023Structural; Barnes2018Lysophosphatidylserine). The receptor's coupling to Gαs is distinct, as it involves a noncanonical binding mode where the C terminus of the α5 helix of Gαs binds into a deeper cavity formed by the TM7-H8 linkage and other transmembrane regions (Liu2023Structural).

GPR174 also interacts with other proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. It has been implicated in the regulation of B cell migration in response to CCL21, suggesting a potential interaction with Gαi proteins in a sex-dependent manner (Liu2023Structural). The receptor's interaction with lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) is mediated through a positively charged central pocket, which facilitates the binding of LysoPS and subsequent activation of the Gαs protein (Liu2023Structural). These interactions highlight GPR174's role in modulating immune cell functions through its coupling with specific G proteins.
