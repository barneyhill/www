# XIRP2

## Overview
XIRP2, or xin actin binding repeat containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes within both the cardiac and auditory systems. The XIRP2 protein is categorized as an actin-binding protein, characterized by its ability to interact with actin filaments and other structural proteins, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal organization and repair. In the heart, XIRP2 is essential for the proper functioning of the cardiac conduction system, influencing the localization of ion channels necessary for maintaining cardiac rhythm. In the auditory system, XIRP2 is crucial for the repair and maintenance of stereocilia in the inner ear, contributing to hearing function by facilitating the repair of actin core damage. The protein's structure includes a proline-rich region and a C-terminal domain, which are vital for its interactions and mechanosensory functions. Mutations in the XIRP2 gene have been linked to various cardiac disorders, highlighting its importance in both cardiac and auditory health (Wagner2023Repair; Eulitz2013Identification; Huang2018Critical).

## Structure
The XIRP2 protein is characterized by its multiple isoforms, which arise from alternative splicing. These isoforms include a long form containing Xin repeats and a short form that lacks these repeats. The short isoform is particularly abundant in the hair bundles of the inner ear and is crucial for maintaining stereocilia morphology and hearing function (Wagner2023Repair; Francis2015A). The short isoform lacks exon 7, which encodes the Xin repeats, and has an altered reading frame extending through exons 8 and 9 (Francis2015A).

Structurally, XIRP2 contains a proline-rich region that interacts with the SH3 domains of nebulin and nebulette, adopting a right-handed polyproline helix conformation (Eulitz2013Identification). The protein also features a C-terminal domain (CTD), which acts as a mechanosensor, facilitating the recruitment of repair factors to damaged sites in stereocilia (Wagner2023Repair). This CTD is crucial for the protein's localization to F-actin gaps and is involved in actin remodeling (Wagner2023Repair).

XIRP2 is subject to tissue-specific expression, with the short isoform being present in the ear but not in the heart, indicating its specialized role in auditory function (Francis2015A).

## Function
The XIRP2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in both cardiac and auditory systems. In the cardiac conduction system, XIRP2 is essential for the formation and function of the infranodal ventricular conduction system. It is involved in the localization of Nav1.5 and Kv1.5 channels to intercalated discs, which are crucial for electrical coupling and ionic current modulation in cardiomyocytes. This localization is vital for maintaining normal action potential configuration and cardiac rhythm, preventing conduction defects (Huang2018Critical).

In the auditory system, XIRP2 is involved in the repair of noise-induced damage to the F-actin cores of stereocilia in hair cells. It interacts with monomeric actin, recruiting repair factors to lesion sites, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of stereocilia and hearing sensitivity. The C-terminal domain of XIRP2 is hypothesized to contain a mechanosensor domain, which is important for its function in actin binding and repair processes (Wagner2023Repair). XIRP2's role in these systems highlights its importance in maintaining both cardiac and auditory function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the XIRP2 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions. In the context of cardiac stress responses, XIRP2 is upregulated in response to stressors such as myocardial infarction and cardiac hypertrophy. However, in failing human hearts, XIRP2 expression is downregulated, indicating its role in heart failure and cardiomyopathy (Wang2014New). XIRP2 is also associated with cardiac conduction disorders, including Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome (SUNDS) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS). Variants in XIRP2, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, have been identified in individuals with these conditions, suggesting that these mutations may lead to cardiac arrhythmias by affecting cardiac conduction (Huang2018Critical). XIRP2-null mice exhibit conduction defects, including prolonged PR and QT intervals and atrioventricular conduction block, further supporting its role in maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (Huang2018Critical). Additionally, XIRP2 mutations have been associated with osteochondrosis in horses, indicating a broader impact on musculoskeletal health (Wittwer2009The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XIRP2 in both cardiac and skeletal conditions.

## Interactions
XIRP2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in muscle development and repair. It binds to the SH3 domains of nebulin and nebulette, which are involved in myofibril formation and remodeling. This interaction is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry and involves specific proline-rich sequences in XIRP2 that bind to these domains with micromolar affinity (Eulitz2013Identification). The interaction is mediated by polyproline ligands, with a PPXXXPKP consensus motif being crucial for binding (Eulitz2013Identification).

XIRP2 also interacts with actin filaments, where it plays a role in cytoskeletal organization. It binds and cross-links skeletal muscle F-actin, similar to the Xin protein, and is involved in actin-bundling activities (Pacholsky2004Xin). In the inner ear, XIRP2 is crucial for repairing noise-induced damage to stereocilia F-actin cores by recruiting actin monomers and crosslinkers to lesion sites (Wagner2023Repair). The C-terminal domain of XIRP2 is particularly important for binding monomeric actin and facilitating F-actin gap repair, highlighting its role in maintaining hearing sensitivity (Wagner2023Repair).
