# LCLAT1

## Overview
LCLAT1, or lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the remodeling of cardiolipin, a vital phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes. The protein product of LCLAT1, categorized as an acyltransferase, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function by facilitating the reacylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin. This enzymatic activity is crucial for energy production and apoptosis regulation within cells. LCLAT1 is predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes, where it also participates in the acylation of other lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidylinositol. The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Hishikawa2014Diversity).

## Function
LCLAT1, also known as lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the remodeling of cardiolipin (CL), a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes. It is involved in the reacylation of monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function. This process is crucial for energy production and apoptosis regulation in cells (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

LCLAT1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes, where it participates in the remodeling of CL acyl chains by acylating lyso-CL. This activity is important for mitochondrial function, including mitochondrial fusion and the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into CL (Hishikawa2014Diversity). The enzyme also exhibits acyltransferase activities for other lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) (Hishikawa2014Diversity).

In healthy cells, LCLAT1 is involved in the acyl composition of phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) and phosphoinositide phosphates (PtdInsPs), enriching them with stearate at the sn-1 position. This specific acyl profile is significant for receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, particularly in epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, where LCLAT1 is essential for the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and subsequent Akt signaling (Chan2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCLAT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high expression of LCLAT1 is associated with shorter overall survival and is linked to genomic heterogeneity and mutations in genes such as TP53. This suggests a role in tumor progression and a potential poor response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (Wen2023The). LCLAT1 is also upregulated in lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with a poorer prognosis. A variant of LCLAT1, known as ALCAT1, promotes mitochondrial fusion and contributes to tumor growth by enhancing the proliferation and migration of lung cancer cells (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

In metabolic diseases, LCLAT1 is implicated in insulin resistance caused by obesity. A high-fat diet upregulates LCLAT1 expression, leading to changes in cardiolipin composition, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). This suggests that LCLAT1 plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of conditions characterized by increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, such as diabetes and obesity. These findings highlight LCLAT1 as a potential therapeutic target in both cancer and metabolic disorders.
