# SLC26A7

## Overview
The SLC26A7 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 7, which is a transmembrane transporter involved in critical physiological processes. This protein functions primarily as an iodide transporter in the thyroid gland, facilitating iodide efflux necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis (Ishii2019Congenital; Kiriya2022Thyroglobulin). Additionally, SLC26A7 acts as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger in renal epithelial cells, playing a significant role in maintaining acid-base balance and electrolyte homeostasis (Ullah2020SLC26A7). Mutations in the SLC26A7 gene can lead to congenital goitrous hypothyroidism and distal renal tubular acidosis, underscoring its importance in thyroid and renal function (Xu2009Deletion; Cangul2018Homozygous).

## Function
The SLC26A7 gene encodes a protein that functions as an iodide transporter in the thyroid gland, playing a crucial role in thyroid hormone synthesis. It is predominantly expressed on the apical side of thyroid follicular cells, where it facilitates iodide efflux into the follicular lumen, a necessary step for hormone production (Ishii2019Congenital; Kiriya2022Thyroglobulin). SLC26A7 is co-expressed with thyroid-specific genes and is essential for maintaining proper thyroid function (Ishii2019Congenital).

In addition to its role in the thyroid, SLC26A7 also functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger in renal epithelial cells, contributing to acid-base balance and electrolyte homeostasis. It is involved in processes such as urine acidification and cellular pH regulation (Ullah2020SLC26A7). The protein's activity is influenced by environmental conditions like osmolarity and pH, which affect its abundance and stability (Ullah2020SLC26A7).

Mutations in SLC26A7 can lead to congenital goitrous hypothyroidism due to disrupted iodide transport and abnormal protein localization, highlighting its importance in thyroid hormonogenesis (Ishii2019Congenital).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A7 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the thyroid and renal systems. Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in SLC26A7 have been linked to goitrous congenital hypothyroidism, characterized by thyroid enlargement and reduced thyroid hormone production. This condition is due to impaired iodide transport, as SLC26A7 functions as an iodide transporter in the thyroid gland (Ishii2019Congenital; Cangul2018Homozygous). Specific mutations, such as c.679C>T, p.R227* and c.1893delT, p.F631Lfs*8, have been identified in affected individuals, leading to moderate to severe primary congenital hypothyroidism (Cangul2018Homozygous).

In the renal system, deletion of the SLC26A7 gene in mice results in distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition characterized by metabolic acidosis and an inability to acidify urine. This is due to impaired chloride and bicarbonate exchange in the kidney's outer medullary collecting duct (Xu2009Deletion). The gene's dysfunction also leads to impaired gastric acid secretion, suggesting its role in maintaining acid-base balance in both the kidney and stomach (Xu2009Deletion).
