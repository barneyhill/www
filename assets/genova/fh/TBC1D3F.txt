# TBC1D3F

## Overview
TBC1D3F is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3F, which is part of the TBC1 domain family known for its role in regulating intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. The protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab GTPases, which are critical in controlling vesicle movement and membrane dynamics within cells. TBC1 domain family member 3F is implicated in various cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and migration, thereby influencing overall cellular function and development. Despite its potential significance, the protein is challenging to study due to its sequence similarity with other TBC1D family members, complicating its detection and characterization through mass spectrometry (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Nonetheless, its interactions, particularly in the context of the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, suggest a novel role in modulating cellular signaling networks (Tripathi2015The).

## Interactions
TBC1D3F is a member of the TBC1 domain family, which is involved in protein-protein interactions that regulate intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways. The protein has been identified as a potential novel modulator in the gastrin-mediated Rho GTPase signaling pathway. Specifically, TBC1D3F was identified as one of the eight protein interactors of the Rho GTPase module, suggesting its role in activating small GTPases such as RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 through guanine exchange factor proteins (Tripathi2015The).

Despite its potential roles, TBC1D3F is challenging to detect using mass spectrometry due to the similarity in amino acid sequences among TBC1D family members. This similarity complicates the identification of unique proteotypic peptides, which are necessary for mass spectrometry-based validation (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). As a result, protein-protein interaction data remains a primary method for validating the presence and interactions of TBC1D3F (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

The protein's interactions and functions are still being explored, and it is not present in common pathway databases, indicating its potential as a novel interactor in signaling pathways (Tripathi2015The).
