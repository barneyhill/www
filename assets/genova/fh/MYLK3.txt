# MYLK3

## Overview
The MYLK3 gene encodes myosin light chain kinase 3 (cMLCK), a serine/threonine kinase predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue. This kinase plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by phosphorylating the myosin regulatory light chain, thereby enhancing actin-myosin interactions and contributing to sarcomere organization. Unlike other myosin light chain kinases, cMLCK operates independently of Ca2+/calmodulin, highlighting its unique regulatory mechanisms within cardiac cells (Chan2008Identification; Seguchi2007A). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cardiac muscle structure and function, and its dysregulation is implicated in conditions such as familial dilated cardiomyopathy (Tobita2017Identification). The MYLK3 gene's evolutionary conservation across vertebrates underscores its essential role in cardiovascular health (Seguchi2007A).

## Structure
The MYLK3 gene encodes cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK), a protein primarily expressed in the heart. The protein features a well-conserved serine/threonine kinase domain located near the C terminus, which includes an ATP-binding site and an active kinase domain, typical of the myosin light chain kinase family (Seguchi2007A). This domain is crucial for its function in phosphorylating cardiac-specific myosin regulatory light chain, which is essential for sarcomere organization and cardiac muscle contraction (Chan2008Identification; Seguchi2007A).

The amino acid sequence of cardiac-MLCK is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating a similar molecular structure across species (Seguchi2007A). The protein is composed of 795 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 86 kDa (Chan2008Identification). The structure of cardiac MLCK is similar to skeletal and smooth muscle MLCKs but has a unique amino-terminal domain that lacks significant homology to other known proteins (Chan2008Identification). Unlike other MLCKs, cardiac MLCK's catalytic activity is not regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin in vitro (Chan2008Identification). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity (Chan2008Identification).

## Function
The MYLK3 gene encodes cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK), which plays a critical role in the phosphorylation of cardiac myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). This phosphorylation is essential for enhancing actin-myosin interactions, thereby increasing contractile force in the heart (Tobita2017Identification). In healthy human cells, cMLCK is involved in promoting sarcomere assembly, which is vital for maintaining cardiac muscle structure and function (Tobita2017Identification). 

cMLCK also phosphorylates the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), which enhances calcium sensitivity, isometric force, and crossbridge kinetics, contributing to cardiac twitch dynamics and inotropy (Sevrieva2020Cardiac). Additionally, cMLCK phosphorylates human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser-23, affecting myofilament calcium sensitivity and relaxation kinetics. This phosphorylation is species-specific, as cMLCK does not phosphorylate rodent cTnI due to sequence differences (Sevrieva2020Cardiac). 

The coordinated phosphorylation of RLC and cTnI by cMLCK suggests a regulatory mechanism for thick and thin filaments in the heart, modulating cardiac inotropy and lusitropy in response to intracellular calcium changes (Sevrieva2020Cardiac). This activity is crucial for proper cardiac output and overall cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYLK3 gene are associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by the enlargement and impaired contraction of the heart's ventricles. Two specific mutations identified in MYLK3 include a read-through mutation and a frameshift mutation, both predicted to be deleterious. The read-through mutation results in a protein with a 19-amino acid extension, potentially causing protein instability and reduced expression through non-stop decay. The frameshift mutation introduces a premature stop codon, likely leading to nonsense-mediated decay or truncation of the protein, disrupting its catalytic domain. These mutations result in decreased expression and activity of cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK), which is crucial for normal cardiac function (Tobita2017Identification).

In mouse models, the absence of MYLK3 expression due to a point mutation leads to cardiomyopathy, highlighting the gene's role in cardiac health. The mutation introduces a new translation initiation site, resulting in an altered protein that is not expressed, which is linked to the development of cardiomyopathy in C57BL/6N mice (Williams2020Mylk3null). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MYLK3 in maintaining cardiac function and its potential role in cardiomyopathy.

## Interactions
MYLK3, or myosin light chain kinase 3, is involved in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), which is crucial for cardiac muscle contraction. This kinase interacts with MLC2v and MLC2a, facilitating their phosphorylation without the need for Ca2+/calmodulin, which is typically required for the activity of other myosin light chain kinases (Chan2008Identification). MYLK3 is regulated by the cardiac homeobox protein Nkx2-5, as evidenced by reduced expression and activity in Nkx2-5 knockout models (Chan2008Identification). 

The phosphorylation of MYLK3 itself is influenced by phenylephrine stimulation, which increases its phosphorylation levels and subsequently enhances MLC2v phosphorylation (Chan2008Identification). This suggests that MYLK3 may participate in a signaling pathway involving upstream kinases that modulate its activity. The kinase is also capable of autophosphorylation, indicating a potential self-regulatory mechanism (Chan2008Identification). 

While specific protein interactions of MYLK3 are not detailed extensively, its role in sarcomere organization and cardiomyocyte contractility implies interactions with structural proteins such as actin, as indicated by its cytoplasmic localization and striated pattern overlapping with actin in cardiomyocytes (Chan2008Identification).
