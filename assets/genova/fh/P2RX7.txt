# P2RX7

## Overview
The P2RX7 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X7, a transmembrane protein that functions as a ligand-gated ion channel. This receptor is activated by extracellular ATP and is primarily involved in mediating various cellular processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, and immune responses. Structurally, the P2X7 receptor is a homo-trimeric protein, characterized by a large extracellular loop, two transmembrane domains, and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, with unique features such as a cysteine-rich domain and a lipopolysaccharide-binding domain (Di2019Structure; MartínezCuesta2020Structural). The receptor is expressed in a wide range of cell types, including immune, bone, and neural cells, and plays a significant role in processes such as cytokine release, phagocytosis, and mechanotransduction (Sluyter2017The; Jørgensen2018The). The P2X7 receptor's involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Territo2021P2X7; Burnstock2017The).

## Structure
The P2RX7 gene encodes the P2X7 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel activated by ATP. The receptor is a homo-trimeric protein, with each subunit consisting of 595 amino acids (Di2019Structure). The primary structure includes a large extracellular loop, two transmembrane domains, and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails (MartínezCuesta2020Structural). The secondary structure features α-helical transmembrane domains and a β-strand-rich extracellular domain, forming a structure resembling a leaping dolphin (Jiang2021Structural).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the extracellular domain containing ATP-binding sites at the interface between subunits (Jiang2021Structural). The quaternary structure is a trimeric assembly, with three subunits co-assembling to create a functional receptor (MartínezCuesta2020Structural). The receptor's C-terminus is extended compared to other P2X receptors, containing unique domains like a cysteine-rich domain and a lipopolysaccharide-binding domain (MartínezCuesta2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation affect the receptor's function and trafficking (Di2019Structure). The P2X7 receptor is highly polymorphic, with at least nine human splice variants, contributing to its functional diversity (MartínezCuesta2020Structural).

## Function
The P2RX7 gene encodes the P2X7 receptor, a trimeric ion channel activated by extracellular ATP. This receptor is involved in various cellular functions, including inflammation, apoptosis, and immune responses. In healthy human cells, P2X7 plays a crucial role in immune regulation by mediating the release of inflammatory molecules and cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 through the activation of the inflammasome. It also stimulates metalloproteases, leading to the shedding of cell surface molecules (Sluyter2017The).

P2X7 is expressed in a wide range of cell types, including immune, bone, and neural cells. It is involved in cell proliferation and death, metabolic events, and phagocytosis. The receptor facilitates phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy, contributing to the destruction of intracellular pathogens. It also influences glucose and lipid metabolism and can function as a scavenger receptor, mediating phagocytosis independently of ATP activation (Sluyter2017The).

In bone cells, P2X7 is significant for osteoblast and osteoclast function, affecting bone formation and resorption. It is involved in mechanotransduction, where it helps osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical stimuli, promoting bone growth and strength (Jørgensen2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the P2RX7 gene, which encodes the P2X7 receptor, have been linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. The SNP rs3751143 (Glu496Ala) is a loss-of-function variant associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis due to impaired P2X7-mediated processes, such as ATP-induced apoptosis of macrophages (Sluyter2011Significance). Other SNPs, like rs2230912, have been linked to mood disorders, although the association is inconsistent (UrbinaTreviño2022P2X7). In neurodegenerative diseases, P2X7 receptor activation contributes to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage, with antagonists showing potential therapeutic effects in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Territo2021P2X7).

In cancer, P2X7R expression is an early marker of prostate cancer and is involved in melanoma, where it supports an anti-tumor immune response (Burnstock2017The). The receptor is also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, where its antagonists have shown promise in reducing inflammation and pain (Burnstock2017The). Genetic polymorphisms in P2RX7 may influence susceptibility to these diseases and response to treatment (Burnstock2017The). The receptor's role in these conditions highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
The P2RX7 receptor is known to participate in various physical interactions with other proteins, forming complex signaling networks. It interacts with P2X4 receptors, forming heteromeric assemblies that enhance the diversity of receptor currents. This interaction is supported by coimmunoprecipitation experiments and functional studies showing that P2X4/P2X7 heteromers can modulate P2X7 receptor signaling, which has implications for inflammatory diseases and neuropathic pain (Guo2007Evidence).

P2RX7 also forms part of a signaling complex involving multiple proteins, including structural proteins like laminin a3, integrin b2, and cytoskeletal proteins such as b-actin and a-actinin. These interactions are crucial for the receptor's role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and cellular signaling (Kim2001Proteomic).

The receptor is involved in interactions with scaffolding proteins like MAGuK, which may anchor ion channels to the cytoskeleton, and signaling proteins such as PI4K and RPTPb, suggesting a role in downstream signaling pathways (Kim2001Proteomic). Additionally, P2RX7 interacts with Cav-1 in mouse lung epithelial cells, forming higher-order complexes that are essential for its function and stability (Weinhold2010Interaction).
