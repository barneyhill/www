# MOAP1

## Overview
MOAP1 (Modulator of Apoptosis 1) is a gene that encodes a pro-apoptotic protein involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, particularly through the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The MOAP1 protein is characterized by structural features reminiscent of retrovirus/retrotransposon Gag proteins, including a BH3-like domain crucial for its apoptotic function. It plays a pivotal role in the activation and translocation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, to the mitochondria, facilitating the release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase activation. MOAP1 interacts with several key proteins, including the tumor suppressor RASSF1A and TRIM39, which modulate its stability and function. The protein is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with its levels being rapidly upregulated in response to apoptotic stimuli. Clinically, MOAP1 is implicated in various cancers and neurological diseases, where its expression levels and interactions influence disease progression and patient outcomes (Koong2023Therapeutic; Zurowska2021Structural; Law2012Modulator).

## Structure
MOAP1 (Modulator of Apoptosis 1) is a protein with structural features derived from retrovirus/retrotransposon Gag proteins. The primary structure of MOAP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MOAP1 gene. Its secondary structure includes five α-helices that form a tertiary fold similar to the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of retroviral capsid proteins, such as those from HIV-1 and Ty3, despite lacking recognizable sequence identity to these retroviruses (Zurowska2021Structural).

The MOAP1 C-terminal domain (CTD) contains a major homology region (MHR), a highly conserved sequence motif that forms a network of interactions similar to those seen in retrovirus CA-CTDs. This MHR adopts a strand-turn-helix configuration stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, involving conserved residues like glutamine, glutamate, and arginine (Zurowska2021Structural). The three-dimensional configuration of the MOAP1-CTD MHR backbone is essentially identical to that of HIV-CTD (Zurowska2021Structural).

MOAP1 may have a dimeric interface, similar to retrovirus CA-CTDs, although it was observed as monomeric in solution (Zurowska2021Structural). The protein also contains a BH3-like domain, crucial for its pro-apoptotic function. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate its activity. Splice variants may exist, potentially altering its functional properties.

## Function
MOAP1 (Modulator of Apoptosis 1) is a protein that plays a critical role in apoptosis, particularly in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In healthy human cells, MOAP1 is involved in promoting the activation and translocation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, to the mitochondria. This process is essential for the release of cytochrome c, which subsequently leads to the activation of caspases and the execution of apoptosis (Huang2012The; Law2012Modulator).

MOAP1 interacts with the tumor suppressor RASSF1A, forming a complex that is necessary for Bax conformational change and subsequent apoptosis. This interaction suggests a cooperative role in tumor suppression (Law2012Modulator). MOAP1 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy, specifically in the closure of the phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to nutrient deprivation (Chang2021The).

Under non-apoptotic conditions, MOAP1 is subject to constitutive degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, but its levels are rapidly upregulated in response to apoptotic stimuli, enhancing the sensitivity of cells to apoptotic signals (Huang2012The; Lee2009TRIM39).

## Clinical Significance
MOAP1 (modulator of apoptosis 1) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in apoptosis regulation. Alterations in MOAP1 expression are linked to several cancers, including lung, breast, colorectal, bladder, and non-small cell lung cancer. In these cancers, MOAP1 often acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression is associated with increased tumorigenesis and poor patient outcomes (Volodko2016RASSF1A; Koong2023Therapeutic; law2012moap). 

In breast cancer, MOAP1 downregulation correlates with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis, particularly in high-risk subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer (law2012moap). MOAP1's interaction with the RASSF1A gene is crucial for its tumor suppressor function, and the combined loss of MOAP1 and RASSF1A expression may contribute to malignant cell growth (law2012moap).

MOAP1 is also involved in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where it regulates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. In Parkinson's disease, reduced MOAP1 expression in cortical neurons is linked to increased apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons (Su2022Revealing). Additionally, MOAP1 mutations, such as K278R and K264R, are associated with oncogenic growth and altered signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin and p53, which may contribute to cancer development (law2012moap).

## Interactions
MOAP1 (Modulator of Apoptosis 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate apoptosis. It interacts with Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, through a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-like domain within amino acids 120-127. This interaction is essential for Bax activation and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, promoting apoptosis (Law2012Modulator). MOAP1 also binds to anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L, which can inhibit its pro-apoptotic activity (Law2012Modulator).

MOAP1 interacts with RASSF1A, a tumor suppressor, to facilitate apoptosis in response to death receptor signaling (Law2012Modulator). It also associates with TRIM39, which stabilizes MOAP1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing its apoptotic function (Huang2012The; Lee2009TRIM39). Additionally, MOAP1 interacts with MTCH2, which is crucial for the recruitment of tBid to mitochondria during Fas-induced apoptosis (Chang2021The; Tan2016MOAP1).

MOAP1 is subject to regulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with its degradation mediated by the APC/C Cdh1 complex. TRIM39 and UBR5 are involved in modulating MOAP1 stability through ubiquitination processes (Matsuura2016Downregulation; Huang2012The). These interactions highlight MOAP1's role in the intricate regulation of apoptotic pathways.
