# EEF1B2

## Overview
EEF1B2 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 beta 2 (eEF1Bα), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and plays a pivotal role in the elongation phase of protein synthesis by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eEF1A, thereby activating it for the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. The eEF1Bα protein is part of a heterotrimeric complex that includes other subunits such as eEF1Bβ and eEF1Bγ, which together enhance the efficiency of protein synthesis. Beyond its canonical role in translation, eEF1Bα is involved in non-translational functions, including interactions with proteins involved in DNA repair and microtubule polymerization, indicating its broader involvement in cellular processes such as cell cycle control and stress response (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational; Cristiano2022The). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment (BitergeSut2019Alterations).

## Structure
The EEF1B2 gene encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex, specifically the eEF1Bα protein. This protein is characterized by a monomeric, non-globular structure with a moderately elongated shape. It consists of a non-catalytic N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal region, which are connected by a non-conserved linker. The C-terminal region contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain, which has been structurally resolved using NMR techniques (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary). The eEF1Bα protein also includes a central acidic region (CAR) that is structurally independent and upstream of the GEF domain (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary).

The eEF1B complex, which includes eEF1Bα, eEF1Bβ, and eEF1Bγ subunits, forms a heterotrimeric assembly. The eEF1Bβ subunit is a stable homotrimer, facilitated by a leucine-zipper motif, and interacts with eEF1Bγ in equimolar stoichiometry (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary). The eEF1B complex is capable of binding up to six molecules of eEF1A2, enhancing its activity compared to individual subunits (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary). The complex also interacts with valyl-tRNA synthetase, which may compensate for the low affinity of valyl-tRNA to eEF1A (Bondarchuk2022Quaternary). The EEF1B2 gene can produce different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to protein diversity (He2021Proteogenomics).

## Function
EEF1B2 encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 complex, which plays a crucial role in the elongation step of protein synthesis. This protein is involved in the guanine nucleotide exchange on eEF1A, converting it from its inactive GDP-bound form to its active GTP-bound form, which is essential for the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome during protein translation (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational; Cristiano2022The). 

In healthy human cells, EEF1B2 is part of a complex that includes other subunits such as eEF1Bα, eEF1Bβ, and eEF1Bγ, which together facilitate the continuous synthesis of proteins by ensuring the recycling of eEF1A (Le2006eEF1B:). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with eEF1A isoforms, such as eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, to maintain efficient protein synthesis (Cao2014Characterisation). 

Beyond its role in translation, EEF1B2 may also participate in non-canonical functions, such as interacting with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins involved in DNA repair and microtubule polymerization, suggesting a broader role in cell cycle control and stress response (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational).

## Clinical Significance
EEF1B2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. In glioma, EEF1B2 is significantly upregulated, and lower expression levels are associated with shorter survival periods, suggesting a link to poor prognosis (BitergeSut2019Alterations). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, lower expression levels of EEF1B2 correlate with better survival outcomes (BitergeSut2019Alterations). Genetic alterations in EEF1B2 and other EEF1 genes are found in 26% of glioma and 52% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, indicating a substantial role in these cancers (BitergeSut2019Alterations).

The gene also has pseudogenes, such as EEF1B2P3, which are upregulated during HIV-1 infection, suggesting a potential role as a reverse transcription cofactor (Cristiano2022The). Additionally, EEF1B2 mutations have been identified in lung adenocarcinoma among never-smokers, although their biological relevance remains unclear (Sun2014Conserved). The discovery of novel protein isoforms of EEF1B2 through proteogenomics suggests that these isoforms may have distinct functional roles, potentially impacting disease mechanisms and therapeutic development (He2021Proteogenomics). These findings highlight the potential of EEF1B2 as a molecular biomarker for personalized cancer treatment (BitergeSut2019Alterations).

## Interactions
EEF1B2, also known as eEF1β or eEF1Bα, is a component of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1 complex (eEF1H) and plays a crucial role in the elongation step of protein biosynthesis. It interacts with eEF1A, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is essential for the regeneration of the active form of eEF1A necessary for peptide elongation during protein synthesis (Cristiano2022The). EEF1B2 is part of the macromolecular complex eEF1BGD, which includes valyl t-RNA synthetase (valRS) (Cristiano2022The).

EEF1B2 also interacts with eEF1A2, a relationship influenced by the phosphorylation state of eEF1A2. Phosphorylation of eEF1A2 can lead to a reduced interaction with EEF1B2, as demonstrated by a phosphomimetic mutant of eEF1A2 showing decreased co-immunoprecipitation with EEF1B2 compared to the wild-type (Mendoza2020eEF1A2). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of local translation in synaptic spines, with phosphorylation events modulating the association between eEF1A2 and EEF1B2 (Mendoza2020eEF1A2).

In addition to its role in translation, EEF1B2 is involved in various non-canonical functions, such as interacting with nuclear/cytoplasmic prolylisomerase FKBP25, a nucleic acid binding protein involved in DNA repair and microtubule polymerization (Negrutskii2020Nontranslational).
