# ARHGAP19

## Overview
ARHGAP19 is a gene that encodes the Rho GTPase activating protein 19, a critical regulator of cellular processes, particularly in hematopoietic cells. The protein functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and is involved in the regulation of cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis in T lymphocytes (David2013The). ARHGAP19 is characterized by a highly conserved RhoGAP domain, which is essential for its role in inactivating Rho-family proteins, and contains nuclear localization signals that suggest its involvement in nuclear functions (Lv2007Sequence; Kang2021Statistical). The protein's activity and localization are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions with other proteins like 14-3-3 and its subcellular distribution (Marceaux2018Phosphorylation). ARHGAP19's expression is tightly regulated, with significant expression in fetal tissues and limited expression in certain adult tissues, underscoring its importance in developmental and cellular processes (Lv2007Sequence).

## Structure
The ARHGAP19 protein is encoded by a gene with an open reading frame of 1485 base pairs, resulting in a protein composed of 494 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 55.806 kDa (Lv2007Sequence). The primary structure includes a highly conserved RhoGAP domain located between amino acid residues 119 and 305, which is crucial for its function in inactivating Rho-family proteins (Lv2007Sequence; Kang2021Statistical). The protein also contains two nuclear localization signals: a pat4 NLS (KKKK) at residue 440 and a pat7 NLS (PESAKKK) at residue 384, suggesting its involvement in nuclear functions (Lv2007Sequence).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at residues S422, T404, and T476, which regulate its subcellular localization and function during mitosis (Marceaux2018Phosphorylation). These modifications affect ARHGAP19's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its localization within the cell, preventing premature translocation to the cell cortex (Marceaux2018Phosphorylation). The protein's expression is highly regulated, with significant expression in fetal tissues and limited expression in certain adult tissues (Lv2007Sequence). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
ARHGAP19 is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in the division of T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. It is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, which are involved in blood cell formation. ARHGAP19 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specifically for RhoA, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and does not affect other Rho family members such as Rac1 or CDC42 (David2013The). This protein is essential for regulating cytokinesis and chromosome segregation during mitosis in T lymphocytes. It controls the recruitment of proteins like citron and myosin II to the plasma membrane, which is vital for cytoskeleton contractility and cell shape changes (David2013The).

ARHGAP19 influences the activity of Rock2, a kinase involved in cell shape changes, by regulating the phosphorylation of vimentin, an intermediate filament protein. This regulation is crucial for the flexibility of the cell's structural framework during cell division (David2013The). The protein shuttles between the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell cortex, with its localization changing during different stages of mitosis (David2013The). Phosphorylation of ARHGAP19 by kinases such as ROCK and CDK1 is critical for its function and subcellular localization, ensuring proper activation of RhoA and successful cytokinesis (Marceaux2018Phosphorylation).

## Interactions
ARHGAP19 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes through these interactions. One significant interaction is with the 14-3-3 protein family. ARHGAP19 is phosphorylated by ROCK on serine residue 422, creating a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction protects ARHGAP19 from dephosphorylation and prevents its premature relocation to the plasma membrane during mitosis, which is crucial for proper cell division (Marceaux2018Phosphorylation).

ARHGAP19 also interacts with RhoA, a member of the Rho GTPase family. It specifically displays GAP activity on RhoA, regulating its activation and localization during cytokinesis. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of RhoA and its downstream effectors, such as citron and myosin IIA, to the cell equator during mitosis (David2013The).

Additionally, ARHGAP19 is regulated by miR-192-5p, a microRNA that directly binds to ARHGAP19, leading to decreased expression. This interaction has been shown to inhibit the migration of triple-negative breast cancer cells, highlighting the role of ARHGAP19 in cancer cell migration (Vajen2021MicroRNA‐192‐5p).
