# GPR108

## Overview
GPR108 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 108, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is part of the LUSTR family of proteins and is involved in various cellular processes, including the entry and trafficking of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) within cells, which is significant for gene therapy applications (Dudek2020GPR108; Edgar2007Human). GPR108 is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network and intracellular vesicles, suggesting a role in retrograde transport and cellular trafficking (Dudek2020GPR108). Additionally, GPR108 is implicated in immune signaling pathways, such as the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, although its precise functions in normal cellular physiology remain to be fully elucidated (Dudek2020GPR108; Meisen2020Pooled).

## Structure
The GPR108 protein is encoded by a 1836 bp cDNA and has an open reading frame that encodes a 562 residue protein with a molecular mass of 63,258 Da and an isoelectric point of 7.26 (Edgar2007Human). It is part of the LUSTR family of proteins, characterized by a predicted amino-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide sequence, a long extracellular domain, and a carboxy-terminal seven transmembrane domain, similar to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Edgar2007Human). The LUSTR domain consists of seven predicted transmembrane alpha-helices, which are well conserved between species, indicating their importance (Edgar2007Human). The cytoplasmic loops 2 and 3 are conserved, with loop 2 containing a conserved glycine-polar-glycine sequence, suggesting a role in G-protein binding (Edgar2007Human). The intracellular COOH terminal segment is characterized by a strong negatively charged region followed by a positively charged region (Edgar2007Human). Approximately two-thirds of GPR108 transcripts encode a splice variant isoform that includes an additional seven amino acid residues due to the utilization of an exon 6 acceptor splice site 21 bp upstream of the one used in the primary sequence (Edgar2007Human).

## Function
GPR108 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in the entry of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) into cells, playing a critical role in gene therapy applications. It is necessary for the transduction of most AAV serotypes, except AAV5, by facilitating endosomal escape and potentially stabilizing the VP1 unique domain or generating a pore in the endosomal membrane (Dudek2020GPR108). GPR108 is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and intracellular vesicles, suggesting its involvement in retrograde transport and cellular trafficking processes (Dudek2020GPR108; Meisen2020Pooled).

The protein's N and C-terminal domains are essential for its function, while its transmembrane domain can be exchanged with that of GPR107 without losing functionality, indicating potential redundancy in cellular roles (Dudek2020GPR108). GPR108 is also implicated in immune signaling, acting as an activator of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and modulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which may influence immune responses (Dudek2020GPR108; Meisen2020Pooled). Despite its significant role in AAV transduction, the specific functions of GPR108 in healthy human cells remain largely undefined (Meisen2020Pooled).

## Interactions
GPR108, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, is involved in the entry of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) into cells. It interacts with the VP1 unique domain of AAV capsids, facilitating viral entry and endosomal escape, which is crucial for the trafficking and nuclear import of AAV genomes (Dudek2020GPR108). GPR108 functions downstream of AAVR, another AAV entry factor, suggesting a coordinated role in the AAV transduction pathway (Dudek2020GPR108). 

The N and C termini of GPR108 are essential for its function, indicating that these domains may be involved in specific interactions necessary for AAV transduction (Dudek2020GPR108). GPR108 is localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network, which supports its role in the intracellular trafficking of AAVs (Dudek2020GPR108). 

GPR108 is also associated with the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and may regulate Toll-like receptor signaling, although its role as an AAV entry factor might be independent of these functions (Büning2020AAV; Dudek2020GPR108). The interaction between GPR108 and TLR9, a pattern recognition receptor for AAV vectors, might be significant in modulating immune responses against AAV vectors (Büning2020AAV).
