# DPY19L3

## Overview
DPY19L3 is a human gene that encodes the protein dpy-19 like C-mannosyltransferase 3, a member of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. This protein is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a critical role in the post-translational modification process known as C-mannosylation. This enzymatic activity involves the addition of mannose to specific tryptophan residues in target proteins, which is essential for their proper folding, stability, and secretion. The DPY19L3 protein's function is crucial for the maintenance of cellular processes, and its dysfunction has been linked to various developmental disorders and diseases, including hematological abnormalities and potential psychiatric conditions (Minakata2021Protein; Watanabe2011Dpy19l1).

## Structure
The DPY19L3 protein is characterized by a topological structure with 11 transmembrane domains and two re-entrant loops, with the N-terminal end facing the cytoplasm and the C-terminal end facing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Minakata2021Protein). The C-terminal region is crucial for its C-mannosyltransferase activity, which involves the addition of mannose to tryptophan residues in specific motifs, a process essential for the proper folding and secretion of certain proteins (Minakata2021Protein).

The protein contains conserved motifs and domains, such as the ExE motif located shortly after the first transmembrane domain and the Rx6LRE motif in the extracytoplasmic loops. These motifs, along with conserved residues like E63, E65, R211, E220, E400, and R471, are important for the protein's function in C-mannosylation (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane). Mutations in these residues can affect the protein's ability to facilitate C-mannosylation, with some mutations inactivating the protein (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane).

The DPY19L3 protein is part of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases, which are characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and conserved luminal loops essential for catalysis (AlbuquerqueWendt2019Membrane). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of DPY19L3 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DPY19L3 is a human gene encoding a C-mannosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the C-mannosylation of proteins. This post-translational modification involves the addition of a mannose sugar to the tryptophan residues in proteins, specifically targeting the first tryptophan in the consensus sequence W-x-x-W and the third tryptophan in the sequence W-x-x-W-x-x-W-x-x-C. The enzyme uses dolichyl-phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) as the mannose donor (Minakata2021Protein).

DPY19L3 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is involved in protein quality control by facilitating proper protein folding and intracellular transport. This activity is essential for the stability and function of proteins such as IL-21R and ADAMTS16. In IL-21R, C-mannosylation of Trp195 is necessary for its localization and secretion, indicating that DPY19L3 is vital for stabilizing protein structures and ensuring their correct transport within cells (Minakata2021Protein).

Deficiencies in DPY19L3 can lead to reduced secretion of certain proteins, highlighting its importance in cellular processes. The absence of C-mannosylation due to DPY19L3 dysfunction may result in developmental disorders and diseases through the impaired function of substrate proteins (Minakata2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPY19L3 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and diseases. Knockout studies in mice have demonstrated that the absence of DPY19L3 leads to blood abnormalities, including reductions in erythrocyte number, hematocrit, free fatty acid levels, and hemoglobin content. These findings suggest that DPY19L3 is crucial for normal hematological function (Minakata2021Protein). Additionally, the gene's knockout in the Japanese rice fish medaka has been shown to impair eye development, indicating its role in ocular development through the dysfunction of ADAMTS16 without C-mannose (Minakata2021Protein).

The DPY19L3 gene has also been associated with bipolar disorder through genome-wide association studies, suggesting a potential link between its mutations and psychiatric conditions (Watanabe2011Dpy19l1). While the specific mechanisms by which DPY19L3 mutations contribute to these disorders are not fully understood, the gene's involvement in protein C-mannosylation suggests that defects in this process may lead to broader implications in protein function and stability, potentially affecting neural, cardiac, or muscular systems (Minakata2021Protein). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical significance of DPY19L3 mutations.
