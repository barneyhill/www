# TMCC2

## Overview
TMCC2, or transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum. The TMCC2 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and coiled-coil regions, which facilitate its anchoring within cellular membranes and enable protein-protein interactions. This protein is part of a highly conserved family, with significant roles in erythropoiesis and neuronal function. TMCC2 is notably implicated in the regulation of red blood cell maturation and is highly expressed during the terminal differentiation of erythroblasts. In the nervous system, TMCC2 interacts with key proteins such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), suggesting its involvement in amyloid-beta processing and Alzheimer's disease pathology. The protein's presence in dense core senile plaques and dystrophic neurites further underscores its potential role in neurodegenerative processes (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration; Hopkins2021TMCC2; Kumari2022Ablation).

## Structure
The TMCC2 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains and coiled-coil regions, which contribute to its structural stability and function. These coiled-coil domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the transmembrane domains anchor the protein within cellular membranes (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration). TMCC2 is part of a family of highly conserved proteins, with a conserved C-terminal region of about 400 amino acids, showing 40 to 80% similarity to its Drosophila orthologue, Dementin (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration). The N-terminus of this protein family is highly variable between paralogues but conserved between human and mouse homologues, suggesting a regulatory role (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration).

TMCC2 exists in at least three isoforms, with their abundance varying by brain region and influenced by APOE and dementia status (Hopkins2021TMCC2). These isoforms may result from alternative splicing, potentially altering the protein's function or localization (Hopkins2021TMCC2). The protein is associated with dense core senile plaques and dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer's disease, indicating its involvement in neurodegenerative processes (Hopkins2021TMCC2). The molecular structure of TMCC2 is not fully detailed in the available sources, but its interaction with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) is evolutionarily conserved (Hopkins2021TMCC2).

## Function
The TMCC2 gene encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). TMCC2 is part of the transmembrane and coiled-coil domain family and is implicated in the regulation of erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production. It is highly expressed during the terminal differentiation of erythroblasts, suggesting a critical role in red blood cell maturation. Interference with TMCC2 in human erythroid cells leads to reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and disrupted cell morphology, indicating its importance in normal erythroblast maturation (Kumari2022Ablation).

In addition to its role in erythropoiesis, TMCC2 is involved in neuronal function. It forms complexes with apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP), indicating a role in APP processing and potentially influencing amyloid-beta secretion. TMCC2 is primarily expressed in neurons, where it shows a somatodendritic pattern of expression, suggesting its involvement in neuronal synapse homeostasis and brain development (Hopkins2021TMCC2). The protein's interaction with APP and its presence in dense-cored plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains further highlight its potential role in neurodegeneration (Hopkins2021TMCC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TMCC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of erythropoiesis and neurodegeneration. In mice, the inactivation of the TMCC2 gene leads to impaired erythropoiesis, resulting in neonatal macrocytic anemia and defects in erythroid maturation. These phenotypes resemble congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDAs), suggesting that TMCC2 dysfunction may contribute to similar hereditary erythropoietic disorders in humans (Kumari2022Ablation).

In the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, TMCC2 has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Studies have shown that TMCC2 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (apoE), influencing amyloid-beta production, a key factor in AD. TMCC2 is found in dense core senile plaques and dystrophic neurites in AD brains, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration). The Drosophila orthologue of TMCC2, known as Dementin, has been shown to protect against APP-induced defects, further supporting the gene's role in neurodegenerative processes (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of TMCC2 in both erythropoietic and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
TMCC2 is known to interact with several key proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It forms complexes with apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP), both of which are central to the etiology of AD (Hopkins2021TMCC2). TMCC2's interaction with APP is evolutionarily conserved, as demonstrated by its Drosophila orthologue, Dementin, which interacts genetically with both human APP and its Drosophila equivalent, APPL (Hopkins2013Neurodegeneration). In the human brain, TMCC2 immunoreactivity is primarily neuronal and closely associated with APP immunoreactivity in both control and AD cases (Hopkins2021TMCC2).

TMCC2 is also associated with dense core senile plaques and adjacent dystrophic neurites in AD cases, indicating its involvement in the pathological processes of the disease (Hopkins2021TMCC2). The interaction between TMCC2 and apoE is particularly significant in the presence of the apoE4 isoform, which is known to increase Aβ secretion, suggesting that TMCC2 may mediate the impact of apoE on AD pathogenesis (Hopkins2021TMCC2). These interactions highlight TMCC2's potential role in modulating the metabolism of APP and contributing to neurodegenerative processes.
