# BAZ1B

## Overview
The BAZ1B gene encodes the bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 1B protein, a critical component of chromatin remodeling complexes, notably the WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling (WICH) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in nucleosome assembly, chromatin organization, and transcription regulation. It is characterized by several conserved domains, including a bromodomain and a PHD-type zinc finger motif, which facilitate interactions with acetylated lysine residues and histone codes, respectively. BAZ1B is involved in essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and DNA damage response, contributing to genomic stability and gene expression regulation. Clinically, alterations in the BAZ1B gene are linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome and various cancers, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Sharif2021BAZ1B; Salvati2022Combinatorial).

## Structure
The BAZ1B protein, encoded by the WBSCR9 gene, is involved in chromatin remodeling and contains several conserved domains and motifs that contribute to its molecular structure. The protein has a molecular mass of 171 kDa and consists of 1483 amino acids, with two isoforms containing either 19 or 20 exons (Sharif2021BAZ1B). Key structural features include a bromodomain (BrD) at the C-terminus, spanning residues 1356 to 1426, which is involved in protein-protein interactions by binding acetylated lysine residues (Sharif2021BAZ1B). Adjacent to the bromodomain is a PHD-type zinc finger motif, which interacts with histone H3 and reads histone codes such as H3K4me3 and H3K14ac (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

The protein also contains a WAC domain at the N-terminus, DDT domain, and WHIM motifs, which are involved in DNA binding and chromatin remodeling (Sharif2021BAZ1B). The FERM domain, located between the DDT and BAZ1 domains, is involved in cytoskeleton attachment and cell integrity (Sharif2021BAZ1B). BAZ1B undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which are linked to its roles in DNA replication and cancer (Sharif2021BAZ1B). The protein is part of the WICH complex, which plays a role in chromatin accessibility and nucleosome assembly (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

## Function
The BAZ1B gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling (WICH) complex, which plays a crucial role in nucleosome assembly and chromatin organization. This complex is essential for maintaining chromosome stability and facilitating heterochromatin replication or assembly post-replication (Sharif2021BAZ1B). BAZ1B is involved in chromatin remodeling during DNA replication and transcription, interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to maintain open chromatin, which is necessary for transcription regulators and chromatin-modifying enzymes to bind newly replicated DNA (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

BAZ1B also participates in the B-WICH complex, which is involved in RNA Pol-I and Pol-III transcription, recruiting histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to rDNA promoters to maintain histone acetylation levels and facilitate RNA polymerase movement on chromatin (Sharif2021BAZ1B). The protein's kinase activity is important for DNA damage responses, particularly within heterochromatin regions, where it mobilizes H2AX mononucleosomes and phosphorylates Tyr142, crucial for DNA repair and apoptosis (Sharif2021BAZ1B). BAZ1B's functions are vital for maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BAZ1B gene are associated with several clinical conditions. BAZ1B is one of the genes deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a disorder characterized by cardiovascular complications, distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, and other developmental issues (Zhou2022Atypical; Sharif2021BAZ1B). The gene's deletion contributes to the neurodevelopmental and facial phenotypes observed in WBS patients (Zhou2022Atypical). BAZ1B is also implicated in cancer, particularly breast cancer, where its overexpression is linked to tumorigenesis and resistance to endocrine therapy. High levels of BAZ1B are associated with worse survival outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, suggesting its role in promoting aggressive tumor phenotypes (Salvati2022Combinatorial). In lung cancer, BAZ1B overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, activating oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 (Sharif2021BAZ1B). Additionally, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in BAZ1B, rs1178977, has been associated with increased susceptibility to gout in the Japanese population (Kawaguchi2021Both). These findings highlight BAZ1B's significant role in various diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
BAZ1B, also known as the Williams Syndrome Transcription Factor (WSTF), is involved in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It is a component of the WSTF-ISWI chromatin remodeling (WICH) complex, where it interacts with SNF2H, a member of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers of the ISWI family. This interaction is essential for nucleosome assembly and spacing, as well as higher-order chromatin organization (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

BAZ1B also interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through its PCNA-binding motifs, facilitating its recruitment to replication foci and subsequent localization of SNF2H. This interaction is crucial for maintaining open chromatin structure during DNA replication (Sharif2021BAZ1B). BAZ1B is part of the B-WICH complex, which co-precipitates with PCNA and is involved in chromatin accessibility, allowing transcription regulators and chromatin-modifying enzymes to bind newly replicated DNA (Sharif2021BAZ1B).

In addition, BAZ1B interacts with the chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor CDT1, although this interaction is independent of PCNA. It is also involved in RNA Pol-I and Pol-III transcription through the B-WICH complex, which includes several other proteins such as Cockayne syndrome protein B (CSB), nuclear RNA helicase II (DDX21), and nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) (Sharif2021BAZ1B).
