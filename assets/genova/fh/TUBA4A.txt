# TUBA4A

## Overview
TUBA4A is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha 4a protein, a critical component of the microtubule cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a pivotal role in the formation and stability of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, and maintenance of cell shape. Tubulin alpha 4a is unique among tubulin isotypes due to its lack of a C-terminal tyrosine residue, which influences its post-translational modifications and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (Hausrat2022Disruption). The gene is particularly significant in the nervous system and platelets, where it contributes to axonal transport and platelet biogenesis, respectively (Strassel2019An). Mutations in TUBA4A have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), highlighting its clinical importance in maintaining neuronal integrity (Nguyen2018ALS; Van2022Frontotemporal).

## Structure
The TUBA4A gene encodes the tubulin alpha-4A chain, a structural component of microtubules. The primary structure of TUBA4A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are crucial for the protein's stability and function (Ganne2023In). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and molecules. TUBA4A forms a heterodimer with the tubulin beta-chain (TUBB4A), which is critical for microtubule assembly, representing its quaternary structure (Ganne2023In).

TUBA4A is subject to post-translational modifications, such as polyglutamylation, which affects its interaction with microtubule-associated proteins like Tau. This modification is significant in regulating microtubule dynamics and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Hausrat2022Disruption). TUBA4A is unique among alpha-tubulins due to its lack of a C-terminal tyrosine residue, making it independent of de-tyrosination, another tubulin modification (Hausrat2022Disruption). These structural features and modifications play a crucial role in the protein's function in cellular processes, including axonal transport and platelet biogenesis (Strassel2019An).

## Function
The TUBA4A gene encodes the α4A-tubulin protein, a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and participating in cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis (Hausrat2022Disruption). In healthy human cells, α4A-tubulin is particularly enriched in platelets, where it plays a significant role in platelet biogenesis. It is involved in the formation of the marginal band, a microtubule structure crucial for maintaining platelet shape and function (Strassel2019An).

α4A-tubulin is unique among tubulin isotypes as it lacks a C-terminal tyrosine residue, which affects the tyrosination cycle, a posttranslational modification process important for microtubule functions (Strassel2019An). This characteristic leads to a high proportion of detyrosinated tubulin, which is important for maintaining proper microtubule dynamics (Strassel2019An). In neurons, TUBA4A is highly expressed in the postnatal nervous system and is involved in the regulation of microtubule-associated protein interactions, such as those with Tau, which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases (Hausrat2022Disruption). The polyglutamylation of TUBA4A is crucial for regulating these interactions and maintaining microtubule stability (Hausrat2022Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBA4A gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The R64Gfs*90 mutation in TUBA4A is associated with FTLD and the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). This mutation leads to reduced levels of the wild-type TUBA4A protein, suggesting haploinsufficiency as a pathogenic mechanism (Van2022Frontotemporal). TUBA4A mutations are also linked to ALS, with studies identifying nonsynonymous and premature termination codon variants in a small percentage of familial and sporadic ALS cases (Nguyen2018ALS). 

In addition to ALS and FTLD, TUBA4A mutations have been associated with spastic ataxia. The p.Glu415Lys variant in TUBA4A has been identified as a novel genetic cause of this condition, affecting protein stability and function (Torella2023A). The clinical significance of TUBA4A mutations extends to hereditary ataxia, with evidence supporting its association with this condition (Cipriani2023Rare). These findings underscore the importance of TUBA4A in maintaining neuronal integrity and its role in various neurodegenerative pathologies.

## Interactions
TUBA4A, a tubulin alpha 4a protein, plays a significant role in microtubule dynamics through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It forms heterodimers with beta-tubulin, which are essential for microtubule polymerization and stability (Hausrat2022Disruption). TUBA4A interacts with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) such as Tau and MAP2, facilitating their binding to microtubules. This interaction is regulated by the polyglutamylation of TUBA4A, which is crucial for the efficient binding of these proteins (Hausrat2022Disruption). The polyglutamylation of TUBA4A also affects the phosphorylation status of Tau, a process relevant in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's (Hausrat2022Disruption).

TUBA4A is involved in the regulation of motor protein movement along microtubules. Its polyglutamylation influences the motility of cargo, such as mitochondria, by affecting the interaction with motor proteins like kinesins and dyneins (Hausrat2022Disruption). Additionally, TUBA4A interacts with the long non-coding RNA TubAR, which promotes microtubule assembly by enhancing the interaction between TUBA4A and TUBB4A, another tubulin isotype (Liang2024LncRNA). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TUBA4A in maintaining cellular structure and function.
