# TTC29

## Overview
TTC29 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 29, which is integral to the structure and function of sperm flagella. The TTC29 protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the assembly of multi-protein complexes. Predominantly expressed in the human testis, TTC29 plays a significant role in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, particularly as a potential member of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for the proper formation and function of sperm flagella (Liu2019Biallelic). Mutations in the TTC29 gene are linked to male subfertility, specifically asthenoteratospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology, often presenting as multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) (Liu2019Biallelic). Additionally, TTC29 has been implicated as a potential prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer, highlighting its broader significance beyond reproductive biology (Wang2020Integrated).

## Structure
The TTC29 protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These TPR domains typically form a helix-turn-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures by facilitating the assembly of multi-protein complexes (Liu2019Biallelic). The TTC29 protein is composed of 475 amino acids and is predominantly expressed in the human testis (Liu2019Biallelic). 

The TPR domains in TTC29 are crucial for its proper localization into the axoneme, as demonstrated in studies involving Trypanosoma brucei (Liu2019Biallelic). These domains are essential for the protein's role in cilia and flagella-associated functions, particularly in the context of sperm flagellar structure and function (Liu2019Biallelic). 

Mutations in TTC29, particularly those that truncate the protein before or at the TPR domains, lead to significant structural and functional impairments, such as multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) (Liu2019Biallelic). The protein may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Function
The TTC29 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of sperm flagella in healthy human cells. TTC29 is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in the assembly and anchorage of axonemal protein complexes, which are essential for the motility and structural integrity of sperm flagella (Liu2019Biallelic). The protein is localized mainly at the base of sperm flagella, with a faint presence along the flagella, indicating its role in maintaining the structural integrity necessary for sperm motility (Liu2019Biallelic).

TTC29 is implicated in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, potentially as a member of the IFT-B complex, which is crucial for the proper formation and function of sperm flagella (Liu2019Biallelic). It interacts with other proteins such as TTC30A and IFT52, which are part of the IFT complex, facilitating anterograde transport necessary for ciliogenesis and flagellar function (Liu2019Biallelic). The absence or mutation of TTC29 leads to significant defects in sperm morphology and motility, highlighting its essential role in male fertility (Liu2019Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC29 gene are associated with male subfertility, specifically a condition known as asthenoteratospermia, which is characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology. This condition often presents as multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), where sperm exhibit severe flagellar malformations such as absent, short, bent, coiled, and irregular-caliber flagella (Liu2019Biallelic). TTC29 mutations lead to structural defects in sperm flagella, including the absence of the central pair of microtubules and disorganized outer dense fibers, contributing to the observed sperm defects (Liu2019Biallelic).

The TTC29 gene is crucial for the proper assembly and function of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex, which is essential for cilia and flagella formation. Mutations in TTC29 disrupt the localization and function of other proteins involved in IFT, such as TTC30A and IFT52, leading to abnormal assembly of the anterograde IFT complex (Liu2019Biallelic). These disruptions result in the observed phenotypes of asthenoteratospermia and MMAF, contributing to male infertility (Liu2019Biallelic).

In addition to its role in male fertility, TTC29 has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer, where its alterations are associated with increased mortality (Wang2020Integrated).

## Interactions
TTC29 is involved in several protein interactions crucial for sperm flagellum function and male fertility. It is associated with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, particularly as a potential member of the IFT-B complex, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella. TTC29 mutations affect the staining and localization of IFT proteins such as TTC30A and IFT52 in human sperm, indicating a functional association between TTC29 and these proteins (Liu2019Biallelic).

In mouse models, TTC29 interacts with DNAH1 and DNALI1, components of the axonemal inner dynein arms (IDAs), which are critical for flagellar motility. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses have confirmed these interactions, highlighting TTC29's role in the axonemal complex (Dacheux2023Novel). Additionally, TTC29 interacts with ZMYND12, another axonemal protein necessary for sperm flagellum structure and function. The absence of ZMYND12 destabilizes the axonemal complex, leading to severe disorganization and a multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) phenotype. This suggests a potential physical or functional association between TTC29, ZMYND12, and other axonemal components (Dacheux2023Novel).
