# APOL5

## Overview
Apolipoprotein L5 (APOL5) is a gene that encodes a member of the apolipoprotein L family, which is involved in lipid transport and metabolism. The protein product, apolipoprotein L5, is categorized as a lipid-binding protein and is implicated in various cellular processes, including lipid trafficking and immune response modulation. APOL5 is expressed in several tissues and may play a role in the pathophysiology of certain diseases, although its specific functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The study of APOL5 and its protein product is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential involvement in metabolic disorders and its interactions with other cellular pathways.
