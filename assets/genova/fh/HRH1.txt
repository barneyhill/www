# HRH1

## Overview
The HRH1 gene encodes the histamine receptor H1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating various physiological responses, including allergic reactions, smooth muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. As a transmembrane receptor, the histamine H1 receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which facilitate its function in signal transduction across the plasma membrane (Smit1999Molecular). The receptor is widely expressed throughout the body, with significant presence in the lungs, central nervous system, and blood vessels, where it primarily couples with Gq/11 proteins to activate downstream signaling pathways (Panula2015International). The HRH1 gene and its encoded receptor are implicated in various clinical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and certain cancers, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Wright2017Altered; GarcíaMartín2008Genetic; Czerwiński2021Variances).

## Structure
The HRH1 gene encodes the histamine H1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a primary structure of 491 amino acids, forming a single polypeptide chain (Smit1999Molecular). The receptor features seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of GPCRs, which span the plasma membrane and are highly conserved across species (Smit1999Molecular). These helices contribute to the receptor's secondary structure, facilitating its role in signal transduction.

The tertiary structure of HRH1 involves the arrangement of these helices to form a binding pocket for histamine, with specific residues such as Asp 107, Thr 194, and Asn 198 playing crucial roles in ligand binding (Smit1999Molecular; Inoue1996Characteristics). The receptor's quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but it is suggested to function as a monomer (Smit1999Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of HRH1 include N-terminal glycosylation and potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and C, which are important for receptor regulation (Smit1999Molecular). The receptor lacks a cysteine residue in the C-terminal tail, a feature common in many GPCRs, which is often palmitoylated for membrane anchorage (Smit1999Molecular). No splice variant isoforms have been identified (Inoue1996Characteristics).

## Function
The HRH1 gene encodes the histamine H1 receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. The H1 receptor is primarily involved in mediating allergic reactions, smooth muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. It is ubiquitously expressed in the body, with high concentrations in the lungs, central nervous system, and blood vessels (Panula2015International).

At the molecular level, the H1 receptor primarily couples with Gq/11 proteins, leading to the activation of phospholipase C. This activation results in the production of 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, which subsequently activate protein kinase C (PKC) and release calcium ions from intracellular stores (Panula2015International). The receptor also mediates the production of arachidonic acid, nitric oxide, and cyclic GMP through Gi/Go protein-mediated pathways (Panula2015International).

In the brain, H1 receptor activation excites neurons in various regions, leading to increased firing frequency and influencing processes such as sleep-wake regulation and synaptic transmission (Panula2015International). The receptor is also involved in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in promoting T H 1-type responses and influencing cytokine profiles (Jutel2001Histamine).

## Clinical Significance
The HRH1 gene, encoding the histamine receptor H1, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In Parkinson's disease (PD), changes in the density and expression of histamine receptors, including HRH1, have been observed. Specific polymorphisms, such as HRH1Leu449Ser, were identified in PD patients, suggesting a potential link to the disease, although these polymorphisms are not considered major risk factors (GarcíaMartín2008Genetic).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered expression of HRH1 and related histamine signaling genes has been reported. Studies have shown significant overexpression of these genes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of ASD subjects, indicating a possible involvement in the disorder's pathophysiology (Wright2017Altered).

HRH1 expression has also been studied in the context of endometrioid endometrial cancer, where it differentiates cancerous tissues from controls. This suggests a role for HRH1 in cancer pathology, potentially offering targets for molecular therapies (Czerwiński2021Variances).

Additionally, HRH1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the severity of side effects in patients treated with desloratadine for chronic spontaneous urticaria, highlighting the gene's influence on treatment outcomes (Li2019Human).

## Interactions
The histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) is known to physically interact with the C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) to form a heteromeric complex. This interaction has been demonstrated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. In these assays, coexpression of CXCR4 and HRH1 in HEK293A cells resulted in significant BiFC signals, indicating the formation of CXCR4-HRH1 heteromers. The interaction was specific, as no BiFC signals were observed with other receptors like the opioid receptor μ type 1 (OPRM1). The BRET donor saturation assay further confirmed this interaction, showing hyperbolic increases in BRET ratios when CXCR4 and HRH1 were coexpressed, suggesting specific heteromerization (Park2023Simultaneous).

The interaction between HRH1 and CXCR4 is significant in enhancing calcium signaling and cancer cell migration, indicating a potential therapeutic target for anticancer therapy. This synergistic effect is observed in various cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231, NCI-H23, and HeLa cells, and involves the Gαi/o and Gαq/11 signaling pathways. The histamine/HRH1 pathway is functionally related to the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway, contributing to tumor progression by enhancing calcium signaling and cell migration (Park2023Simultaneous).
