# NMNAT2

## Overview
Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 2, a key player in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential coenzyme in cellular metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a nucleotide-binding protein and is characterized by its monomeric structure, distinct from other NMNAT isozymes. NMNAT2 is predominantly expressed in neurons, where it plays a critical role in maintaining axonal health and supporting neuronal survival, particularly in the central nervous system. The enzyme's activity is crucial for sustaining the NAD+/NADH redox balance, which is vital for energy metabolism processes such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. NMNAT2's interaction with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) underscores its involvement in proteostasis, particularly in neurodegenerative conditions. Mutations in the NMNAT2 gene have been linked to severe neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neuroprotection and axonal maintenance (Yang2024NMNAT2; Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90).

## Structure
NMNAT2 is a 307-residue enzyme involved in NAD biosynthesis, primarily localized in the Golgi complex. It is unique among the NMNAT isozymes for being monomeric, unlike the oligomeric NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 (Brunetti2010Homology). The protein's structure includes a Rossmann fold, a common feature in nucleotide-binding proteins, which forms part of its conserved N- and C-terminal domains (Brunetti2010Homology; Lau2010Isoformspecific). 

The central domain of NMNAT2, spanning residues 103-196, is nonconserved and lacks homology with NMNAT1 and NMNAT3. This region is suggested to have noncatalytic functions, possibly related to subcellular localization or protein interactions, and is not essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Brunetti2010Homology). 

NMNAT2's localization to the Golgi complex is mediated by cysteine palmitoylation at residues Cys 164 and Cys 165, which are crucial for its membrane anchoring (Lau2010Isoformspecific). The protein also features isoform-specific targeting and interaction domains (ISTIDs), which are encoded by separate exons and play a role in subcellular targeting (Lau2010Isoformspecific).

## Function
NMNAT2 (nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 2) is a critical enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme essential for various cellular processes. NMNAT2 catalyzes the conversion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to NAD+, playing a vital role in maintaining NAD+ homeostasis within neurons (Yang2024NMNAT2; Tribble2024NMNAT2). This enzyme is predominantly expressed in neurons and is crucial for the survival and maintenance of long axons, particularly in the central nervous system (Tribble2024NMNAT2; Gilley2010Endogenous).

In healthy human cells, NMNAT2 supports glycolysis on synaptic vesicles, which is essential for fast axonal transport by providing ATP necessary for motor protein function (Yang2024NMNAT2). It is localized to Golgi-derived vesicles and is involved in the fast, bi-directional transport of vesicular cargos in axons, although it rarely colocalizes with mitochondria (Yang2024NMNAT2). NMNAT2's activity is crucial for maintaining the NAD+/NADH redox potential, which is necessary for energy metabolism processes such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Yang2024NMNAT2). Its rapid turnover and requirement for neurite survival underscore its critical role in axonal health and neuroprotection (Gilley2010Endogenous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NMNAT2 gene are associated with several severe neurological and developmental disorders. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in NMNAT2 have been linked to fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), a condition characterized by reduced fetal movement, skeletal muscle atrophy, and hydrops fetalis. These mutations impair axon growth and survival, leading to severe developmental issues (Lukacs2019Severe).

A specific homozygous missense mutation, T94M, in NMNAT2 has been identified in siblings with childhood-onset polyneuropathy and erythromelalgia. This mutation results in a partial loss of NMNAT2 function, affecting axon survival and enzymatic activity, and is associated with sensory and motor axon loss (Huppke2019Homozygous).

Reduced expression levels of NMNAT2 have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. This reduction compromises axonal health and increases vulnerability to neurodegenerative stress, potentially contributing to disease progression (Yang2024NMNAT2; Gilley2018Low). NMNAT2's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and reducing phosphorylated tau levels is crucial in Alzheimer's disease, where its chaperone function is protective against tau-induced neurodegeneration (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90).

## Interactions
NMNAT2 interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to mediate proteostasis in proteinopathies. This interaction is crucial for NMNAT2's chaperone function, particularly its foldase activity, which is necessary for refolding aggregated proteins. The NMNAT2:HSP90 complex is involved in reducing protein aggregates, such as phosphorylated tau (p-hTau), and is essential for NMNAT2's ATPase activity (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90). NMNAT2 does not interact with other chaperones like HSP70, CHIP, or HOP, indicating a specific interaction with HSP90 (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90).

The interaction between NMNAT2 and HSP90 is evolutionarily conserved, as similar interactions have been observed in Drosophila (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90). This complex is particularly important under protein stress conditions, where NMNAT2's interaction with HSP90 is enhanced, suggesting a mechanism for switching between its functional modes to offer neuroprotection (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90).

NMNAT2 also plays a role in synaptic maintenance, and its loss leads to decreased levels of synaptic proteins in neurons, highlighting its importance in neuronal health (Ali2016NMNAT2:HSP90). The protein's localization to the Golgi complex is mediated by cysteine palmitoylation, which is crucial for its function and interaction with cellular structures (Lau2010Isoformspecific).
