# NPY5R

## Overview
The NPY5R gene encodes the neuropeptide Y receptor Y5, a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, with significant presence in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, where it plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. The neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 mediates the physiological effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), influencing feeding behavior and other functions such as circadian rhythm regulation and reproductive processes. The receptor's structure, including specific amino acid residues and glycosylation sites, is essential for its ligand binding and signal transduction capabilities. Additionally, NPY5R is involved in various interactions and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders (Walther2011Neuropeptide; Lindner2008Molecular; PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide).

## Structure
The NPY5R protein, also known as the neuropeptide Y receptor Y5, is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by seven transmembrane domains, typical of the rhodopsin-like superfamily of receptors (Lindner2008Molecular). These domains are interspersed with three extracellular and three intracellular loops, with the N-terminal end located extracellularly and the C-terminal end intracellularly (Alam2011Analysis). The third intracellular loop is notably extended, contributing to the receptor's larger size compared to other Y-receptor subtypes (Lindner2008Molecular).

The primary structure of NPY5R includes specific amino acids crucial for ligand binding and signal transduction, such as Asp 6.59 and Asp 2.68, which are important for maintaining ligand affinity through ionic interactions (Lindner2008Molecular). The receptor also contains consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation at the amino terminus, which may influence its function and stability (Lindner2008Molecular).

NPY5R exists in two splice variant isoforms, differing by a 10-amino acid extension at the N-terminus, resulting in lengths of 445 and 455 amino acids. Despite this variation, both isoforms exhibit similar pharmacological profiles (PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide). The receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, with high densities in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, playing a significant role in regulating food intake (PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide).

## Function
The NPY5R gene encodes the neuropeptide Y receptor Y5, a G-protein coupled receptor primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus and hippocampus (Lindner2008Molecular; PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide). This receptor is involved in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis by mediating the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) (Walther2011Neuropeptide; PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide). 

The Y5 receptor plays a significant role in stimulating feeding behavior, as NPY is known to increase food intake when administered intracerebroventricularly (Lindner2008Molecular). It is also implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms and reproduction through the inhibition of luteinizing hormone release (PedragosaBadia2013Neuropeptide). 

At the molecular level, the Y5 receptor interacts with specific amino acid residues in NPY, such as Arg 25 and Asp 2.68, which are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Lindner2008Molecular). The receptor's slow internalization process, due to structural differences like a longer intracellular loop, influences its functional activity in signal termination and transmission (Walther2011Neuropeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPY5R gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cattle, polymorphisms in the NPY5R gene, including non-synonymous SNPs, have been linked to changes in appetite and energy homeostasis, which could have parallels in human metabolic conditions such as obesity and dyslipidemia (Alam2011Analysis). The Arg364stop mutation, which introduces a premature stop codon, is particularly noteworthy as it may lead to a truncated protein with impaired function, potentially affecting receptor-ligand interactions and protein stability (Alam2011Analysis).

In the context of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC), the NPY5R receptor is upregulated in cardiac mesenchymal stromal cells, promoting adipogenesis. This upregulation is associated with increased sensitivity to neuropeptide Y, contributing to the fibro-fatty myocardial replacement characteristic of AC (Stadiotti2021Neuropeptide). Elevated plasma levels of neuropeptide Y in AC patients further suggest a role for NPY5R in the disease's pathophysiology (Stadiotti2021Neuropeptide).

Additionally, deletions involving the NPY5R gene have been observed in cases of autism, suggesting its potential role as a candidate gene for the disorder. The deletion of NPY5R, along with other genes, may contribute to the neurodevelopmental aspects of autism (Ramanathan2004A).

## Interactions
The neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 (NPY5R) is involved in several interactions that influence its function and signaling. NPY5R is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and can form homodimers and heterodimers with other Y receptor subtypes, such as Y1. These dimerizations may affect the receptor's internalization and signaling processes (Babilon2013Towards). The receptor's internalization is slower compared to other Y receptors and involves clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with limited recruitment of arrestins (Babilon2013Towards).

Specific amino acid interactions are crucial for NPY5R's binding affinity and function. The conserved aspartic acid residues, such as Asp 6.59 and Asp 2.68, play significant roles in ligand binding through ionic interactions with arginine residues in the ligands, such as Arg 25 and Arg 33 in neuropeptide Y (Babilon2013Towards; Lindner2008Molecular). These interactions are essential for the receptor's activation and signal transduction.

In the context of cancer, NPY5R has been shown to colocalize with hypoxic regions in breast cancer, suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis. Its expression is linked to cancer stage and differentiation, although it does not predict progression-free survival (Pascetta2023Pharmacological).
