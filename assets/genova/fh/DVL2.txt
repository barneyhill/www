# DVL2

## Overview
DVL2, or dishevelled segment polarity protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is pivotal in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The protein, categorized as a signaling adaptor, contains three conserved domains: DIX, PDZ, and DEP, each facilitating distinct protein-protein interactions essential for signal transduction. The DIX domain is involved in oligomerization and interaction with AXIN, the PDZ domain serves as a docking site for various signaling molecules, and the DEP domain is crucial for membrane localization and interaction with the Frizzled receptor. DVL2's role extends to both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, influencing processes such as β-catenin stabilization and planar cell polarity. Its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which are vital for its stability and function (Kafka2014The; Consonni2014DEP; Kishida1999DIX).

## Structure
DVL2, or dishevelled segment polarity protein 2, is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway and is characterized by several conserved domains that facilitate its function in signal transduction. The protein contains an N-terminal DIX domain, a central PDZ domain, and a C-terminal DEP domain. The DIX domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and oligomerization, playing a significant role in the formation of homo- or hetero-oligomers and the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Kishida1999DIX). The PDZ domain acts as a docking site for kinases, phosphatases, and adaptor proteins, contributing to submembranous receptor assembly (Kafka2014The). The DEP domain is involved in membrane localization and interacts with the Frizzled receptor, facilitating the formation of a DVL-dependent signalosome (Consonni2014DEP).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, regulate DVL2's activity and stability. Phosphorylation by RIP kinase 4 enhances β-catenin stabilization, while ubiquitination processes are modulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme Usp14, which is essential for Wnt signaling activation (Jung2013Deubiquitination; Consonni2014DEP). DVL2 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties (Kafka2014The).

## Function
DVL2 (dishevelled segment polarity protein 2) is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, DVL2 functions as a cytoplasmic mediator, transmitting signals from Wnt receptors to downstream effectors. It is involved in both the canonical (β-catenin-dependent) and non-canonical (planar cell polarity, PCP) Wnt pathways (Kafka2014The; De2012Genetic).

DVL2 contains three conserved domains: DIX, PDZ, and DEP, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. The DIX domain is involved in interactions with AXIN, a scaffolding factor in Wnt signaling, and is necessary for the dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, thus activating the Wnt pathway. The PDZ domain provides docking sites for kinases and phosphatases, crucial for signal transduction, while the DEP domain interacts with DAAM1, affecting actin polymerization and planar epithelial polarization (Kafka2014The).

DVL2 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular signaling balance, as its availability is limited, meaning that activation of one pathway can down-regulate the other. This highlights its multifunctional role in maintaining cellular signaling balance in healthy human cells (Kafka2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DVL2 gene are associated with several human diseases and conditions. In neural tube defects (NTDs), rare mutations in DVL2, such as missense mutations p.Tyr667Cys and p.Ala53Val, have been identified in patients, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these defects. These mutations are thought to disrupt the Wnt signaling and planar cell polarity pathways, which are crucial for neural tube closure (De2012Genetic).

DVL2 polymorphisms have also been linked to non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) in a Polish population. Specific variants, such as rs35594616 and rs2074222, show significant associations with increased risk for NSCL/P, indicating that DVL2 may play a role in craniofacial development (Mostowska2012Association).

In Gaucher disease, particularly type I, dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway involving DVL2 has been observed. Alterations in DVL2 expression, potentially due to single nucleotide variants in the 3'UTR, may contribute to bone differentiation defects seen in this lysosomal disorder (Costa2019A).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of DVL2 in various developmental and genetic disorders, underscoring its role in critical signaling pathways.

## Interactions
DVL2, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. DVL2 interacts with β-arrestin 2 (Arrb2) and the β and γ subunits of trimeric G-proteins (Gβ and Gγ), forming a complex that includes Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) (Gentzel2015Distinct). This interaction is particularly strong with CamKIIδ and is enhanced by Wnt-5a stimulation, highlighting DVL2's role in Wnt/Ca2+ signaling (Gentzel2015Distinct).

DVL2 also interacts with Axin, a key regulator in the Wnt pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of TCF-dependent transcription, as DVL2 can activate this transcription, which is inhibited by Axin and GSK-3β (Smalley1999Interaction). The co-localization of DVL2 and Axin in cells suggests a direct interaction, with specific Axin residues being essential for this association (Smalley1999Interaction).

In the context of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, DVL2 forms complexes with Sestd1 and Dact1, enhancing Rho GTPase activity, which is vital for PCP signaling (Yang2013SEC14). These interactions underscore DVL2's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and development.
