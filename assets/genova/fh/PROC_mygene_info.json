vitamin K-dependent plasma glycoprotein. The encoded protein is cleaved to its activated form by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. This activated form contains a serine protease domain and functions in degradation of the activated forms of coagulation factors V and VIII. Mutations in this gene have been associated with thrombophilia due to protein C deficiency, neonatal purpura fulminans, and recurrent venous thrombosis.[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2009].", "symbol": "PROC", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1418943"}, "unigene": "Hs.224698", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P04070", "TrEMBL": ["F2Z2A0", "B4DPC8", "H7BYX9", "E7ENR9", "E7EVH6", "E7END6", "E7EU72"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Protein C"}}
