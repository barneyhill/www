# ATP8B2

## Overview
ATP8B2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B2 protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is integral to the maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry in cellular membranes, particularly influencing the distribution of plasmalogens, a type of phospholipid, across the plasma membrane. The ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B2 protein is crucial for various cellular processes, including the activation of AKT, a protein kinase involved in cell growth and survival (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). Although its flippase activity is lower compared to other related proteins, ATP8B2 plays a significant role in maintaining plasmalogen homeostasis and intracellular signaling, particularly in tissues such as the brain, kidney, and lung, where plasmalogens are abundant (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). The gene's expression and function have implications in cancer pathophysiology, as altered plasmalogen levels can affect cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated).

## Function
The ATP8B2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the P4-ATPase family, functioning as a phospholipid flippase. This protein plays a crucial role in the asymmetric distribution of plasmalogens across the plasma membrane, particularly in the inner leaflet. This distribution is essential for the activation of AKT, a protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and survival (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). ATP8B2's flippase activity, although lower compared to other related proteins, is vital for maintaining plasmalogen homeostasis and intracellular signaling in healthy human cells (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated).

In HeLa cells, ATP8B2 facilitates the movement of plasmalogens from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of plasma membranes. This process is crucial for maintaining the proper distribution of plasmalogens, which affects intracellular signaling pathways, such as the phosphorylation of AKT (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). Knockdown of ATP8B2 results in increased localization of plasmalogens in the extracellular leaflet and impairs the plasmalogen-dependent degradation of fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (Far1), a key enzyme in plasmalogen biosynthesis (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). ATP8B2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, and lung, where plasmalogens are enriched (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP8B2 gene is implicated in the regulation of plasmalogen homeostasis and intracellular signaling, with its expression levels and function potentially influencing cancer pathophysiology. Reduced expression of ATP8B2 is observed in various human cancers, which may contribute to altered plasmalogen levels in cancer cells, affecting their sensitivity to ferroptosis, a form of cell death (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated). Although specific diseases directly linked to ATP8B2 mutations are not detailed, the gene's role in phospholipid translocation suggests that alterations could impact cellular processes and potentially lead to disease (Paulusma2005The).

ATP8B2 is part of the type 4 P-type ATPase family, which includes other genes associated with severe genetic disorders. While ATP8B2 itself is not directly linked to specific inherited diseases, its homologs, such as ATP8B1, are associated with conditions like Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 1 (PFIC1) (Paulusma2005The). The involvement of ATP8B2 in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry and its expression in tissues where plasmalogens are enriched, such as the brain, kidney, and lung, underscores its potential clinical significance in disorders related to lipid metabolism and membrane integrity (Honsho2022ATP8B2Mediated).
