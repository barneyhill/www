# WAPL

## Overview
WAPL is a gene that encodes the WAPL cohesin release factor, a protein integral to the regulation of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. The WAPL protein is categorized as a regulatory factor and is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a conserved C-terminal domain and a non-conserved N-terminal region. These structural features enable WAPL to interact with cohesin subunits and other regulatory proteins, facilitating the release of cohesin from chromosomes during mitotic prophase. This process is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability. Beyond its role in mitosis, WAPL also influences chromatin structure and gene expression during interphase, underscoring its importance in cell cycle progression and chromosomal stability (Gandhi2006Human; Tedeschi2013Wapl; Chatterjee2013Structural).

## Structure
The WAPL protein, a key regulator of the cohesin complex, exhibits a distinct molecular structure characterized by specific domains and structural motifs. The primary structure of WAPL includes a conserved C-terminal domain, approximately 45 kDa in size, which is predominantly alpha-helical. This domain is crucial for its function in cohesin release (Chatterjee2013Structural). The N-terminal region of WAPL is non-conserved and highly divergent, likely intrinsically disordered, and contains FGF motifs essential for interactions with Pds5 and cohesin subunits SA1 and Rad21 (Shintomi2009Releasing).

The tertiary structure of WAPL reveals an elongated, peanut-shaped form defined by 20 consecutive alpha-helices, divided into three subdomains. Domain 1 forms an anti-parallel helical 'cap', followed by six HEAT repeats in the central domain, and a flattened 4-helix bundle in the C-terminal lobe (Chatterjee2013Structural). The quaternary structure involves WAPL's interaction with cohesin components, forming a complex with Pds5 and SA1/2, which facilitates the release of cohesin from chromosomes (Ouyang2017Releasing).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are present in the N-terminal half of WAPL, influencing its interactions and function (Shintomi2009Releasing). These structural features are critical for WAPL's role in regulating chromatin structure and chromosome segregation.

## Function
The WAPL gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of cohesin, a protein complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. In healthy human cells, WAPL facilitates the release of cohesin from chromosome arms during mitotic prophase, which is vital for the proper segregation of sister chromatids. This process ensures that chromosomes are correctly aligned and separated during cell division, preventing errors that could lead to aneuploidy, a condition associated with cancer (Gandhi2006Human; Tedeschi2013Wapl).

WAPL interacts directly with cohesin's regulatory subunits, forming a ternary complex that inactivates cohesin's ability to bind chromatin. This interaction is crucial for the timely release of cohesin, preventing the accumulation of prometaphase-like cells with poorly resolved sister chromatids (Gandhi2006Human). WAPL's activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression by regulating cohesin-DNA interactions (Tedeschi2013Wapl).

The protein's function is not limited to mitosis; it also plays a role in maintaining chromatin structure during interphase, affecting gene regulation and cell cycle progression (Tedeschi2013Wapl). WAPL's role in cohesin regulation is evolutionarily conserved, highlighting its importance in chromosomal stability and organismal development (Tedeschi2013Wapl).

## Interactions
WAPL interacts with several proteins and plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cohesin complex. It is known to bind with cohesin subunits such as Smc3 and Scc1. The interaction between WAPL and Smc3 is influenced by the acetylation state of the Smc3 ATPase domain, which affects the binding strength and modulates ATPase activity (Chatterjee2013Structural). WAPL also interacts with PDS5 proteins, specifically PDS5A and PDS5B, which are involved in cohesin release and chromatin organization. The depletion of WAPL, along with PDS5A and PDS5B, leads to significant chromatin condensation and altered genomic interactions, indicating their collaborative role in chromatin structure regulation (Wutz2017CTCF).

In female meiosis I, WAPL interacts with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein Bub3. This interaction is crucial for maintaining Bub3 protein levels and proper SAC activity, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. The interaction is mediated by the N-terminal YSR motif of WAPL, and depletion of WAPL results in reduced Bub3 levels at kinetochores, although its localization remains unchanged (Zhou2020The). These interactions highlight WAPL's role in cohesin regulation and chromatin dynamics.
