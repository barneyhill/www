# MSL3

## Overview
The MSL3 gene encodes the MSL complex subunit 3 protein, a critical component of the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex involved in chromatin modification and gene regulation. The MSL3 protein is characterized by its chromo-barrel and MRG domains, which facilitate its interaction with other MSL complex components and its binding to specific histone modifications. The chromo-barrel domain of MSL3 preferentially binds to mono- or dimethylated lysine 20 on histone H4, playing a significant role in targeting the MSL complex to chromatin regions. This interaction is crucial for the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16, a modification that influences transcriptional activation and chromatin structure. MSL3's function is essential for normal gene expression, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. Mutations in the MSL3 gene are linked to Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome, an X-linked disorder characterized by developmental and neurological symptoms, underscoring the gene's importance in human health (Basilicata2018De; Brunet2021Defining; Moore2010Structural).

## Structure
The human MSL3 protein is characterized by a chromo-barrel domain and an MRG domain, both of which play crucial roles in its function within the MSL complex. The chromo-barrel domain of MSL3 has a canonical methyllysine binding pocket, which is composed of specific residues such as Tyr-31, Phe-56, Trp-59, and Trp-63. This domain shows a preference for binding mono- or dimethylated lysine 20 on histone H4, which is significant for the protein's role in chromatin targeting and gene regulation (Moore2010Structural).

The MRG domain in MSL3 is essential for its interaction with MSL1, another component of the dosage compensation complex. This domain is highly conserved and consists of three blocks of strong sequence similarity, separated by less conserved linker regions. These regions may contain insertions specific to MSL3 in both flies and humans (Morales2005The).

The MSL3 protein also contains a chromo-related domain (CRD) within the first 90 amino acids, which deviates from canonical chromodomains and is involved in RNA binding. However, the CRD alone is not sufficient for RNA binding; sequences within the first 259 amino acids are critical (Morales2005The).

## Function
The MSL3 gene encodes a subunit of the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex, which is crucial for chromatin modification and gene regulation in healthy human cells. MSL3 is involved in the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac), a key epigenetic modification that facilitates transcriptional activation by altering chromatin structure (Brunet2021Defining; Smith2005A). This acetylation process is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining chromatin integrity, impacting cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Moore2010Structural).

MSL3 contains a chromo-barrel domain that preferentially binds to mono- or dimethylated lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20Me1 or H4K20Me2), which is important for targeting the MSL complex to specific chromatin regions (Moore2010Structural). This binding preference suggests a role in recruiting the MSL complex to chromatin, thereby influencing transcriptional activity (Moore2010Structural). The MSL3 protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other components of the MSL complex, such as MSL1 and MOF, to enhance histone acetyltransferase activity and regulate chromatin structure (Kadlec2011Structural). These molecular activities of MSL3 are vital for normal gene expression and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MSL3 gene are associated with a rare X-linked disorder known as Basilicata-Akhtar syndrome or MSL3-related disorder. This condition is characterized by a range of developmental and neurological symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and muscle tone abnormalities such as hypotonia and spasticity. Other clinical features include macrocephaly, hearing impairment, gastrointestinal issues, and subtle facial dysmorphism (Brunet2021Defining).

The disorder is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the MSL3 gene, which lead to a loss of interaction with the histone acetyltransferase MOF and MSL1, resulting in reduced acetylation of histone H4K16 and dysregulation of genes involved in developmental pathways (Brunet2021Defining). The mutations include nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, in-frame deletion, and multi-exon deletion types, with loss-of-function variants being predominant (Brunet2021Defining).

Research has shown that these mutations disrupt normal histone acetylation processes, contributing to the observed syndrome (Basilicata2018De). The clinical spectrum of the disorder affects both males and females equally, with no significant differences in clinical features between sexes (Brunet2021Defining).

## Interactions
The human MSL3 protein is a component of the Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. MSL3 interacts with other proteins within the MSL complex, including MSL1 and MOF. The interaction between MSL3 and MSL1 is mediated through the MRG domain of MSL3, which forms a hydrophobic interface with MSL1. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of MOF into the dosage compensation complex, enhancing MOF's histone acetyltransferase activity (Kadlec2011Structural).

MSL3 also exhibits a preference for binding to mono- or dimethylated lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20Me1 or H4K20Me2), which is significant for targeting the MSL complex to chromatin regions. This binding preference is facilitated by the chromo-barrel domain of MSL3, which contains a methyllysine binding pocket (Moore2010Structural).

In addition to protein interactions, MSL3 can bind nucleic acids, although this interaction can be disrupted through ion-exchange chromatography, indicating potential nucleic acid interaction surfaces on the MSL3 chromo-barrel domain (Moore2010Structural).
