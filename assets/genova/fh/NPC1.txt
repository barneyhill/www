# NPC1

## Overview
The NPC1 gene encodes the NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1, a polytopic transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in intracellular cholesterol and lipid metabolism. This protein is primarily located in the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes, where it facilitates the transport of cholesterol and other lipids out of lysosomes, maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. Structurally, NPC1 is characterized by 13 transmembrane helices and three significant lumenal domains, which are essential for its function in cholesterol binding and transport. The protein's interaction with NPC2 is crucial for the transfer of cholesterol from lysosomes into the cytosol, a process vital for normal cellular function. Mutations in the NPC1 gene are linked to Niemann-Pick disease type C, a lysosomal storage disorder marked by the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, leading to severe clinical manifestations such as neurodegeneration. Beyond its role in lipid metabolism, NPC1 is also implicated in the cellular entry of certain viruses, including the Ebola virus, highlighting its diverse functional significance (Infante2008Purified; Gong2016Structural; Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick).

## Structure
The NPC1 protein is a polytopic membrane protein consisting of 1,278 amino acids, featuring 13 transmembrane helices and three distinct lumenal domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), middle lumenal domain (MLD), and C-terminal domain (CTD) (Li2016Clues; Gong2016Structural). The NTD is known for its cholesterol binding site, which binds cholesterol with its hydroxyl group facing the interior, stabilized by hydrophobic and polar residues (Cologna2019Insights). The sterol-sensing domain (SSD), composed of transmembrane helices 3-7, is crucial for cholesterol metabolism and signaling (Gong2016Structural).

The NPC1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with 14 glycosylation sites identified across different domains (Gong2016Structural). The protein's structure exhibits a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) superfamily fold, with the transmembrane domain (TMD) forming this characteristic structure (Gong2016Structural). The interaction between NPC1 and NPC2 is essential for cholesterol transfer, with the MLD binding to NPC2 to facilitate this process (Li2016Clues). The structural organization of NPC1 is similar to other RND members, such as Patched and Dispatched, with a central tunnel connecting the NTD to the SSD, facilitating cholesterol transport (Qian2020Structural).

## Function
The NPC1 protein is integral to cholesterol and lipid metabolism within cells, primarily located in the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. It plays a crucial role in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids out of lysosomes, facilitating cellular lipid homeostasis (Infante2008Purified). NPC1 interacts with NPC2, another protein involved in cholesterol transport, to transfer cholesterol from lysosomes into the cytosol. This interaction is essential for cholesterol trafficking within cells, with NPC1's N-terminal domain receiving cholesterol from NPC2 (Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick).

The protein is characterized by 13 transmembrane domains and three large luminal loops, with its second luminal domain binding directly to NPC2 in a cholesterol-dependent manner, particularly at acidic pH (Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick). This binding is necessary for the directional transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to NPC1's N-terminal domain, facilitating cholesterol export from lysosomes (Deffieu2011Niemann–Pick).

Mutations in NPC1 can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in cells, causing severe clinical symptoms such as neurodegeneration and organ dysfunction (Infante2008Purified). The protein's role in cholesterol homeostasis is critical for normal cellular processes and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NPC1 gene are primarily associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in lysosomes, leading to progressive neurodegeneration and various neurological impairments (Runz2008NPCdb). Clinical symptoms of NPC can vary widely, ranging from severe forms with fetal ascites and perinatal liver failure to milder adult forms presenting with psychiatric symptoms (Runz2008NPCdb). The most common mutation in Western Europeans is p.I1061T, which is associated with a folding defect that leads to retention and degradation of the NPC1 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (Rauniyar2015Quantitative).

Alterations in NPC1 expression or function can also impact cholesterol metabolism, contributing to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown that NPC1 gene variants are linked to increased body fat percentage and altered metabolic traits, particularly when combined with a high-fat diet (Lamri2018The). The NPC1 gene's influence on steroid hormone synthesis may further affect metabolic diseases, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Lamri2018The).

## Interactions
The NPC1 protein is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate cholesterol transport and cellular lipid metabolism. It interacts with the NPC2 protein to mediate the export of cholesterol from lysosomes. This interaction is essential for the transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to the N-terminal domain of NPC1, a process described as a 'hydrophobic hand-off' (Li2016Clues; Wang2010Identification). The middle lumenal domain (MLD) of NPC1 binds to NPC2, forming a cholesterol transfer tunnel that is crucial for this process (Li2016Clues).

NPC1 also interacts with various lysosomal proteins, including cathepsin D, a protease involved in proteolysis and lipid catabolism. This interaction regulates cathepsin D activity, with NPC1 modulating the processing of cathepsin D from its precursor form to its mature form (Macías‐Vidal2015Identification). In NPC disease patients with low NPC1 levels, there is an accumulation of procathepsin D and reduced mature cathepsin D, leading to diminished activity (Macías‐Vidal2015Identification).

Additionally, NPC1 is involved in the cellular entry of the Ebola virus, as it interacts with the cleaved glycoprotein of the virus, facilitating viral escape from the lysosome (Gong2016Structural). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of NPC1 in cellular processes beyond cholesterol transport.
