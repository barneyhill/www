# SRGAP1

## Overview
SRGAP1, or SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multi-domain protein involved in critical cellular processes such as neuronal development and cell migration. The protein, categorized as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), plays a pivotal role in the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, which is essential for axon guidance and neuronal migration. Structurally, the protein comprises an N-terminal F-BAR domain, a central RhoGAP domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain, each contributing to its function in membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The). The F-BAR domain is involved in membrane binding and deformation, while the RhoGAP domain inactivates Rho GTPases, influencing actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The SH3 domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as the Roundabout receptor (Robo), underscoring its role in cellular signaling pathways (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The). SRGAP1's involvement in various cancers, including gastric and colorectal cancer, highlights its clinical significance, where its expression levels and interactions can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis (Huang2017SRGAP1; Feng2016srGAP1).

## Structure
SRGAP1 (SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 1) is a multi-domain protein involved in neuronal development and cell migration. It consists of three primary domains: an N-terminal F-BAR domain, a central RhoGAP domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The). The F-BAR domain is responsible for membrane binding and deformation, playing a crucial role in processes like filopodia formation and membrane curvature (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The). The RhoGAP domain inactivates Rho GTPases, specifically promoting GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42 and RhoA, which is essential for actin cytoskeleton destabilization and cell migration (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The). The SH3 domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly binding to the intracellular domain of the Roundabout receptor (Robo), which is part of the axon guidance pathway (Endris2011SrGAP3; CoutinhoBudd2012The).

The F-BAR domain of SRGAP1 can form homodimers and potentially heterodimers, contributing to its function in membrane deformation (CoutinhoBudd2012The). The protein's interaction with negatively charged phospholipids and its dependence on F-actin for intracellular mobility are crucial for its role in cellular dynamics (CoutinhoBudd2012The). The precise molecular mechanisms and structures of these domains, including those of SRGAP1, remain subjects of ongoing research (CoutinhoBudd2012The).

## Function
SRGAP1 (SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 1) plays a crucial role in regulating membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization in healthy human cells. It is involved in the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, where it functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho-family GTPases, including RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1. This activity is essential for the regulation of cell migration and lamellipodial dynamics, influencing cell shape and movement (Huang2017SRGAP1).

The F-BAR domain of SRGAP1 is particularly important for its role in membrane deformation and cell shape regulation. It prevents filopodia formation in cortical neurons and reduces plasma membrane dynamics, thereby stabilizing the plasma membrane (CoutinhoBudd2012The). SRGAP1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with regulatory molecules of actin reorganization at the cell periphery, controlling lamellipodial protrusions and influencing neuronal morphology (Huang2017SRGAP1).

In the central nervous system, SRGAP1 is involved in neuronal migration and morphogenesis, contributing to the development of neural circuits and brain structure (CoutinhoBudd2012The). Its activity in axon guidance impacts neural circuit formation, highlighting its significance in brain development.

## Clinical Significance
SRGAP1 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer (GC), SRGAP1 is overexpressed and functions as a potential oncogene, promoting tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in the intestinal type of GC, and is associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Huang2017SRGAP1). The gene's upregulation in GC is not solely due to gene amplification but also involves the downregulation of tumor-suppressive microRNAs, miR-340 and miR-124, which normally inhibit SRGAP1 expression (Huang2017SRGAP1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SRGAP1 is significantly downregulated, which correlates with tumor progression and poor survival outcomes. It mediates the migration inhibition effect of the Slit2-Robo1 signaling pathway by inactivating Cdc42, a small GTPase involved in cell migration (Feng2016srGAP1). The downregulation of SRGAP1 in CRC is associated with increased lymphatic invasion and higher TNM stages, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Feng2016srGAP1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SRGAP1 is commonly overexpressed, with its genetic alterations, including gene amplification and DNA methylation, contributing to its dysregulation. This overexpression is linked to advanced pathological stages in HCC patients (Li2021Identification).

## Interactions
SRGAP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is known to interact with Robo1, a receptor involved in the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, which is crucial for inhibiting cell migration in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. This interaction is demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation assays, showing that SRGAP1 and Robo1 share similar subcellular localization in CRC cells treated with Slit2, a ligand for Robo1 (Feng2016srGAP1).

SRGAP1 also interacts with cortactin, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This interaction is influenced by the phosphorylation state of cortactin. Tyrosine non-phosphorylated cortactin preferentially binds to SRGAP1, which is crucial for regulating RhoA signaling at epithelial cell junctions. This interaction is confirmed through co-transfection experiments in HEK293T cells, where SRGAP1 shows a higher binding affinity to non-phosphorylated cortactin (Liang2017Tyrosine).

In gastric cancer, SRGAP1 interacts with Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, promoting their GTP hydrolysis. This interaction affects cell morphology and motility, influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression (Huang2017SRGAP1).
