# KRTAP4-11

## Overview
KRTAP4-11 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-11, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically within the KAP4 family. This protein is characterized by its ultrahigh sulfur content, primarily due to a high concentration of cysteine, which is essential for forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). The protein's structure includes rigid repeat sequences that facilitate interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, playing a crucial role in the strength and elasticity of the hair cortex (Kariya2005Size). The expression of KRTAP4-11 is influenced by environmental factors, such as smoking, which can affect hair quality and formation (Pease2022Transcriptomic).

## Structure
The KRTAP4-11 gene encodes a protein that is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically within the KAP4 family, known for its ultrahigh sulfur content. The primary structure of KRTAP4-11 is characterized by a high cysteine content, ranging from 33.6% to 36.7% mol, which is crucial for forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the rigidity and strength of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). The protein also contains significant amounts of serine, proline, arginine, threonine, glutamine, and valine. 

The secondary structure of KRTAP4-11 includes rigid repeat structures composed of monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing pentameric repeats. These repeats are predominantly located in the midsection of the protein, with cysteine occupying the first and/or second positions, proline often in the fourth position, and serine and threonine frequently in the fourth and fifth positions (Rogers2006Human).

The tertiary structure is stabilized by the formation of disulfide bonds, which are facilitated by the high cysteine content. These bonds enable the protein to interact with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the structural integrity of hair (Kariya2005Size). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other keratin proteins, forming a cross-linked network essential for hair fiber strength (Kariya2005Size).

## Function
KRTAP4-11 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which plays a significant role in the structural integrity of hair. These proteins are characterized by their ultrahigh sulfur content, primarily due to a high concentration of cysteine, which constitutes 33.6-36.7 mol % of their amino acid composition. This high sulfur content is crucial for forming disulfide bonds, contributing to the mechanical properties and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP4-11 proteins are involved in forming a matrix that interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, providing strength and elasticity to the hair cortex. The proteins exhibit size heterogeneity and contain rigid repeat structures, including monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing pentameric repeats. These repeats are essential for the protein's function, as they contribute to the structural stability of the hair shaft (Rogers2006Human).

In healthy human cells, KRTAP4-11 is primarily active in the hair cortex, influencing hair texture and quality. The gene's expression is modulated by environmental factors such as smoking, which can alter its expression levels and potentially impact hair formation and health (Pease2022Transcriptomic).
