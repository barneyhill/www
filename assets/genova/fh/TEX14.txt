# TEX14

## Overview
TEX14 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 14, intercellular bridge forming factor, which plays a pivotal role in spermatogenesis by facilitating the formation and stabilization of intercellular bridges between germ cells. This protein is categorized as a kinase-like factor due to its structural features, including an ankyrin repeat domain and a protein kinase-C domain, which are essential for its function in germ cell development (Iwamori2010TEX14; Bellil2021Human). TEX14 interacts with the protein CEP55, preventing cell abscission and ensuring the maintenance of intercellular bridges, which are crucial for the synchronized development of spermatozoa (Iwamori2010TEX14). The absence or mutation of TEX14 is linked to male infertility, highlighting its critical role in reproductive biology (Boroujeni2018Expression; Cannarella2019New).

## Structure
The TEX14 protein is characterized by several distinct structural features that are crucial for its function in forming intercellular bridges during spermatogenesis. The primary structure of TEX14 includes a sequence of 1450 amino acids, with specific domains such as an ankyrin repeat domain and a protein kinase-C domain (Bellil2021Human). The protein also contains a GPPX3Y motif, which is essential for its interaction with CEP55, a protein involved in cell abscission (Iwamori2010TEX14).

The secondary structure of TEX14 includes ankyrin repeats, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Iwamori2010TEX14). The tertiary structure features a kinase-like domain and a C-terminal leucine zipper dimerization motif, which facilitates the interaction with CEP55 (Iwamori2010TEX14). The C-terminal domain also includes several coiled-coil domains, contributing to the protein's structural stability and interaction capabilities (Iwamori2010TEX14).

While the quaternary structure of TEX14 is not explicitly detailed, its interaction with CEP55 suggests a complex formation that is critical for blocking cell abscission and stabilizing intercellular bridges (Iwamori2010TEX14). The presence of these structural elements underscores TEX14's role in maintaining the integrity of germ cell connections during meiosis.

## Function
TEX14 is a crucial protein involved in the formation and maintenance of intercellular bridges in germ cells, which are essential for successful spermatogenesis. In healthy human cells, TEX14 localizes to the midbody during cell division, where it interacts with CEP55, a protein involved in cytokinesis. This interaction prevents the recruitment of ALIX and TSG101 to the midbody, thereby inhibiting cell abscission and allowing the formation of stable intercellular bridges (Iwamori2010TEX14). These bridges facilitate communication and resource sharing between developing germ cells, ensuring synchronized development and maturation of spermatozoa (Iwamori2010TEX14).

TEX14's role is particularly significant in male germ cells, where it is expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. Its absence or reduced expression is linked to meiotic arrest and sterility, as seen in cases of maturation arrest in patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (Boroujeni2018Expression). TEX14's function is not only crucial for male fertility but also plays a role in female germ cell development, although its absence does not affect female fertility as severely (Bellil2021Human). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the testis, where it ensures the structural integrity necessary for germ cell development (Boroujeni2018Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TEX14 gene are associated with spermatogenic failure and male infertility. In humans, a 10 bp deletion in TEX14 has been reported in two azoospermic brothers, leading to a truncated protein. Histological analysis of these individuals showed the presence of spermatogonia in all tubules but only a few spermatocyte cells, indicating that TEX14 is crucial for the early phase of the first meiotic division in humans (Cannarella2019New). 

In pigs, a 51 bp exonic insertion in the Tex14 gene results in a premature stop codon, causing spermatogenic arrest and male infertility. This mutation disrupts the formation of intercellular bridges during spermatogenesis, similar to the phenotype observed in Tex14 knockout mice (Sironen2011An). The mutation leads to a significant reduction in Tex14 expression, as confirmed by qPCR and Western blotting, where TEX14 protein is absent in affected testis (Sironen2011An).

These findings underscore the critical role of TEX14 in spermatogenesis and highlight its potential as a target for genetic selection in livestock breeding and as a candidate gene for studying azoospermia in humans (Sironen2011An).

## Interactions
TEX14 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of intercellular bridges during spermatogenesis. It interacts specifically with the protein CEP55, a key player in cytokinesis. TEX14 binds to CEP55 through a conserved GPPX3Y motif, which is essential for this interaction. This binding prevents CEP55 from interacting with other proteins involved in cell abscission, such as ALIX and TSG101, thereby inhibiting the completion of cytokinesis and stabilizing intercellular bridges in germ cells (Iwamori2010TEX14).

The interaction between TEX14 and CEP55 is significant because it alters the role of CEP55 from facilitating abscission to becoming a component of the intercellular bridge. This interaction is supported by various experimental methods, including yeast two-hybrid assays and coimmunoprecipitation, which demonstrate that TEX14 forms a complex with CEP55 (Iwamori2010TEX14). TEX14's ability to outcompete ALIX and TSG101 for binding to CEP55 is crucial for maintaining stable intercellular bridges, which are essential for the progression of spermatogenesis (Iwamori2010TEX14). The absence of TEX14 disrupts these bridges, leading to male sterility (Iwamori2010TEX14).
