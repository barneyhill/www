# CD8B

## Overview
The CD8B gene encodes the CD8 beta chain, a critical component of the CD8 glycoprotein complex found on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the immune response by acting as a co-receptor alongside the T cell receptor (TCR) to enhance the recognition of antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules. The CD8 beta chain forms a heterodimer with the CD8 alpha chain, which is essential for effective T cell activation and signaling. The CD8B protein is involved in the development and maturation of T cells, contributing to the immune system's ability to target and eliminate infected or cancerous cells. Its function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, which influence its interactions with other cellular components and its localization within the cell membrane (Shore2005Glycosylation; Norment1988A).

## Structure
The CD8B gene encodes the CD8 beta chain, which is a component of the CD8 glycoprotein found on T cells. The primary structure of the CD8B protein includes a polypeptide chain with specific domains such as the leader, immunoglobulin V-like, membrane proximal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions (Norment1988A). The secondary structure features an immunoglobulin-like fold with beta-strands and loops, typical of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Srinivasan2024Structure).

The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, allowing the protein to participate in interactions with other molecules, such as the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) (Srinivasan2024Structure). The quaternary structure of CD8B involves its association with the CD8 alpha chain to form a heterodimer, which is crucial for its function as a co-receptor in T cell activation (Norment1988A).

Post-translational modifications of CD8B include glycosylation, with both N-linked and O-linked glycosylation sites identified. These modifications are important for the protein's interaction with MHC-I and its role in T cell maturation (Moody2003Sialic). The CD8B protein also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which result in different cytoplasmic domain lengths and potentially secreted forms (Norment1988A).

## Function
The CD8B gene encodes the CD8 beta chain, a crucial component of the CD8 co-receptor on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This protein plays a significant role in T cell activation by enhancing the interaction between the T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules (Shore2005Glycosylation). The CD8 co-receptor, particularly in its heterodimeric form with CD8 alpha (CD8ab), is the primary co-receptor for TCR-mediated signaling, being 100-fold more effective than the CD8aa homodimer (Shore2005Glycosylation).

CD8B is involved in the development and maturation of class I-restricted T lymphocytes, interacting with the tyrosine kinase p56lck, which is crucial for early signaling events following T cell activation (Disanto1993Transcriptional). The CD8B subunit enhances the avidity of TCR/CD3-antigen/MHC interactions, facilitating effective immune responses (Disanto1993Transcriptional). The cytoplasmic tail of CD8B is palmitoylated, which may aid in interactions with cell membrane rafts, enhancing the co-receptor's activity (Shore2005Glycosylation). CD8B is primarily active in the plasma membrane of T cells, where it contributes to the immune system's ability to target and eliminate infected or cancerous cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CD8B gene can have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of immune function. The CD8B gene encodes the beta chain of the CD8 receptor, which is crucial for the function of cytotoxic T cells. Changes in CD8B expression or its interactions can impact immune responses, potentially leading to immunodeficiency disorders or affecting the body's ability to combat infections and cancer (Kioussis2002Chromatin).

Alterations in the epigenetic regulation of the CD8B gene have been linked to autoimmune conditions. For instance, in TCRαβ+CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) T cells, which are implicated in autoimmune diseases, there is increased DNA methylation at the CD8B locus, suggesting epigenetic repression. This unique methylation pattern may contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in these cells, highlighting a potential role for CD8B in autoimmune pathogenesis (Renauer2015The).

Furthermore, the regulation of CD8B expression during thymocyte development involves complex interactions with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling. Disruptions in these processes, such as through the deletion of specific enhancers or transcription factors like SATB1, can lead to impaired T-cell maturation and function, which may have clinical consequences (Kioussis2002Chromatin; Bilic2006Negative).

## Interactions
The CD8B gene encodes the CD8β chain, which is a critical component of the CD8 co-receptor complex on T cells. CD8β interacts with the CD8α chain to form the CD8αβ heterodimer, which plays a significant role in T cell activation by enhancing the coreceptor function of CD8. This interaction is crucial for the association of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex with lipid rafts, specialized microdomains in the cell membrane enriched with signaling molecules like p56lck, a protein tyrosine kinase essential for T cell signaling (Arcaro2001CD8β).

The cytoplasmic tail of CD8β is particularly important for its function, as it mediates the association of CD8 with lck and facilitates the localization of CD8 in lipid rafts. This association is enhanced by the palmitoylation of CD8β, which is necessary for the efficient coreceptor function of CD8 by linking TCR/CD3 to raft-associated CD8/p56lck complexes (Arcaro2001CD8β). The CD8β chain also contributes to the increased avidity of TCR-ligand binding, which is crucial for the sensitivity of CD8+ T cells to recognize antigens (Arcaro2001CD8β).
