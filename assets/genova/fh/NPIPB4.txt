# NPIPB4

## Overview
Nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B4 (NPIPB4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the nuclear pore complex, which plays a crucial role in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The NPIPB4 protein is part of a larger family of proteins that interact with the nuclear pore complex, contributing to the regulation of molecular trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and chromatin organization. Alterations in NPIPB4 expression and splicing have been associated with significant clinical implications, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Tao2024Alternative; Jensen2021Combinatorial; Pino2024Protein).

## Clinical Significance
NPIPB4 has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In the context of the 16p12.1 deletion, NPIPB4 shows altered expression, which is associated with neurodevelopmental changes. This deletion affects genes involved in neurogenesis and cell signaling, with significant transcriptomic changes observed in brain regions such as the hippocampus and basal ganglia (Jensen2021Combinatorial). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alternative splicing events involving NPIPB4 have been identified as having independent prognostic significance. These splicing changes are linked to cohesin mutations and chromatin interactions, suggesting a role in AML progression and patient prognosis (Tao2024Alternative).

Although specific diseases directly associated with NPIPB4 mutations are not detailed, the gene is noted for its enrichment in structurally damaging mutations, similar to other members of the NPIP family, which are linked to cancer. This suggests a potential role for NPIPB4 in oncogenesis, warranting further investigation (Pino2024Protein).

Overall, NPIPB4's involvement in these conditions highlights its clinical significance, particularly in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
