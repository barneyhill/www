# TAB3

## Overview
TAB3, or TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The TAB3 protein is a component of the TAK1-TABs complex, which plays a pivotal role in mediating inflammatory and immune responses by activating NF-kB and MAPK pathways. These pathways are essential for the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. TAB3 is characterized by its ubiquitin-binding domains, which facilitate interactions with ubiquitinated proteins, and is widely expressed across various human tissues. It is involved in the modulation of signaling pathways in response to cytokines and stress signals, highlighting its importance in cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli (Xu2021TAK1-TABs; CHEUNG2004TAB3).

## Structure
TAB3 is a protein consisting of 712 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 78 kDa. It shares 48% identity with TAB2, particularly at the N- and C-termini (CHEUNG2004TAB3). The protein contains a ubiquitin-binding CUE domain near the N-terminus and an NZF domain at the C-terminus, both of which are involved in ubiquitin binding (CHEUNG2004TAB3; Kanayama2004TAB2). These domains suggest that TAB3 can interact with ubiquitinated proteins, playing a role in signaling pathways such as NF-κB activation (Kanayama2004TAB2).

TAB3 is part of the TAK1 complex, forming distinct complexes with TAK1 and TAB1, either as TAB1-TAK1-TAB2 or TAB1-TAK1-TAB3 (CHEUNG2004TAB3). The protein is phosphorylated by the SAPK2a/p38α pathway, which is crucial for its function in TAK1 activation (CHEUNG2004TAB3). Phosphorylation sites on TAB3 include Ser60, Thr404, and Ser506, which are inhibited by p38 inhibitors (Hirata2017PostTranslational).

TAB3 is expressed in all examined tissues as a single transcript of approximately 7.5 kb, indicating its widespread expression (CHEUNG2004TAB3). The protein is subject to selective autophagy-mediated degradation, suggesting a regulatory mechanism distinct from TAB2 (Braun2020Stabilization).

## Function
TAB3 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 3) is a crucial component of the TAK1-TABs complex, which plays a significant role in inflammatory and immune responses. TAB3 functions as an adaptor protein that interacts with TAK1, a key kinase in the MAPK signaling pathway, and is involved in the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways. These pathways are essential for the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (Xu2021TAK1-TABs; Ajibade2013Cell).

TAB3 is widely expressed across various human tissues and cell lines and is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates signaling pathways in response to cytokines and stress signals (CHEUNG2004TAB3). It binds to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, facilitating the oligomerization and autophosphorylation of TAK1, which subsequently phosphorylates IKKs and MAPKs, activating NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors (Xu2021TAK1-TABs). The phosphorylation of TAB3 by the SAPK2a/p38α pathway is part of a feedback control mechanism that regulates TAK1 activity, highlighting its role in the cellular response to inflammatory stimuli (CHEUNG2004TAB3).

## Interactions
TAB3 (TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. TAB3 interacts with TAK1, a kinase, through its C-terminal coiled-coil region, enhancing TAK1 kinase activity and inducing JNK activation (Ishitani2003Role). It also forms complexes with TAK1 and TAB1, distinct from those formed with TAB2, and these complexes are activated by IL-1, TNFα, or LPS (CHEUNG2004TAB3).

TAB3 interacts with TRAF6 and TRAF2, adaptor proteins involved in IL-1 and TNF signaling, respectively. These interactions are mediated by the C-terminal domain of TAB3, although the coiled-coil motif is not necessary for binding to TRAF6 or TRAF2 (Ishitani2003Role). TAB3 enhances the association between TRAF6 and TAK1, acting as an intermediate signaling molecule (Ishitani2003Role).

In the context of autophagy, TAB3 interacts with Beclin1, a protein involved in autophagy regulation, through its carboxyl terminal region containing a coiled-coil motif (Takaesu2011TGF). In triple-negative breast cancer, TAB3 interacts with Lnc-PCIR, which enhances the stability of TAB3 mRNA and is involved in the TNF-a/NF-kB signaling pathway (Guo2021LncRNA).
