# GPR137

## Overview
GPR137 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 137, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its role in transmembrane signaling. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play crucial roles in cellular communication and signal transduction. The GPR137 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and survival, and has been implicated in the progression of several cancer types. Alterations in the expression of GPR137 have been associated with oncogenic activities, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (WANG2014RNA; Ren2016Knockdown; Li2018Small).

## Clinical Significance
GPR137 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In gastric cancer, GPR137 is highly expressed in several cell lines, and its silencing through RNA interference results in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, as well as cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. This suggests a role in promoting gastric cancer cell growth (WANG2014RNA). In osteosarcoma, GPR137 is expressed at higher levels compared to normal osteoblasts, and its knockdown leads to decreased cell viability, impaired colony formation, and increased apoptosis, indicating its involvement in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival (Li2018Small).

In prostate cancer, GPR137 is upregulated in cancerous tissues, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, causing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. This highlights its potential role in prostate cancer progression (Ren2016Knockdown). In leukemia, GPR137 downregulation results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in leukemia cell lines, suggesting its role in leukemia pathogenesis (Men2018Down). These findings indicate that GPR137 could be a promising therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.
