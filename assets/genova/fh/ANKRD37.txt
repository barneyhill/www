# ANKRD37

## Overview
ANKRD37 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain 37, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains known for mediating protein-protein interactions. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in response to hypoxic conditions, where it acts as a target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (Benita2009An). The ankyrin repeat domain 37 protein is implicated in the regulation of autophagy and cell proliferation, especially in the context of cancer, such as colon adenocarcinoma, where its expression is altered during tumor progression (Deng2020HIF1a). The protein's nuclear localization and interaction with other proteins, such as feminization 1 homolog b (Fem1b), suggest its role in cellular localization and degradation pathways (Shi2011Mouse). ANKRD37's involvement in the HIF-1 signaling pathway underscores its potential clinical significance, particularly in the adaptation of tumors to hypoxic environments (Benita2009An).

## Structure
ANKRD37 is a protein characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These domains typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, a common motif in proteins with ankyrin repeats (Benita2009An; Shi2011Mouse). The protein is composed of 159 amino acids in mice, with a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) from positions 139 to 145, suggesting its localization to the nucleus (Shi2011Mouse). The ankyrin repeat domain in ANKRD37 is a module composed of multiple copies of a 33-amino acid motif, which is a characteristic feature of this protein family (Shi2011Mouse).

ANKRD37 is also involved in various cellular processes, including hypoxia response, where it acts as a target gene of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (Benita2009An). The protein's expression is significantly induced under hypoxic conditions, particularly in colon cancer cell lines, indicating its role in the hypoxia response (Benita2009An). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ANKRD37 are not provided, its functional domains and motifs are well-characterized, highlighting its role in protein interactions and cellular localization.

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD37 has been implicated in the progression of colon cancer, where its expression levels are notably altered. In colon adenocarcinoma, ANKRD37 expression is increased in primary and stages 1-3 but slightly decreased in stage 4. High levels of ANKRD37 are associated with a poor prognosis, as indicated by a decreased survival rate in patients with elevated expression of this gene (Deng2020HIF1a). The gene is a target of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway, which is known to induce autophagy under hypoxic conditions. In colon cancer, ANKRD37 is upregulated in response to hypoxia, leading to increased autophagic activity, which is crucial for tumor growth and survival in low-oxygen environments (Benita2009An; Deng2020HIF1a).

The translocation of ANKRD37 to the nucleus is essential for promoting hypoxia-induced autophagy and cell proliferation. This suggests that ANKRD37 plays a significant role in the cellular response to hypoxia, potentially impacting tumor growth and survival (Deng2020HIF1a). The gene's involvement in the HIF-1 signaling pathway and its regulation under hypoxic conditions highlight its potential clinical significance in cancer, particularly in the context of tumor progression and adaptation to hypoxic environments (Benita2009An).

## Interactions
ANKRD37 interacts with the feminization 1 homolog b (Fem1b) protein. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. ANKRD37 facilitates the transport of Fem1b from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in co-transfected cells. The presence of Fem1b leads to a decrease in ANKRD37 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Fem1b targets ANKRD37 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This process is similar to how the nematode Fem-1 targets TRA-1, indicating a conserved mechanism across species (Shi2011Mouse).

ANKRD37 is also a target of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 binds to specific sites in the ANKRD37 promoter, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. This binding leads to the induction of ANKRD37 expression, highlighting its role in the hypoxia response (Benita2009An). The interaction with HIF-1 suggests that ANKRD37 may be involved in cellular processes related to hypoxia, such as autophagy and cell proliferation (Deng2020HIF1a).
