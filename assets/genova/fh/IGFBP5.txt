# IGFBP5

## Overview
The IGFBP5 gene encodes the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, a member of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein family. This protein plays a critical role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) by binding to them, thereby regulating their availability and prolonging their half-life in circulation. IGFBP5 is characterized by its ability to interact with various extracellular matrix components and other proteins, influencing IGF-mediated cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. It is involved in both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent pathways, contributing to diverse biological functions, including bone growth and maintenance. The protein's structure, consisting of N-terminal, linker, and C-terminal domains, is essential for its function and interaction with IGFs and other molecules (Duan2020InsulinLike; Beattie2006Insulinlike). IGFBP5's role in disease contexts, such as cancer and diabetic complications, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Waters2022Insulinlike; Song2022IGFBP5).

## Structure
The human IGFBP5 protein is a member of the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins family, characterized by a primary structure of 252 amino acids with a hydrophobic signal sequence typical of secreted proteins. It is slightly basic with a pI of approximately 8.5 and contains 18 highly conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds crucial for its structure (Beattie2006Insulinlike). The protein is organized into three main domains: N-terminal, linker (L), and C-terminal domains (Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

The N-terminal domain is highly conserved and cysteine-rich, containing 12 conserved cysteines that form disulfide bonds, contributing to a rigid, globular structure with three anti-parallel β-strands (Beattie2006Insulinlike; Zeslawski2001The). The C-terminal domain adopts a thyroglobulin type-1 fold and contains three conserved disulfide bonds (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The linker domain is less structured and flexible, with helical properties when cross-linked (Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

Post-translational modifications of IGFBP5 include glycosylation and potential phosphorylation, which may affect its binding to cell surfaces and ECM components (Beattie2006Insulinlike). The protein's interactions with IGFs are influenced by these structural features and modifications (Clemmons2001Use).

## Function
IGFBP5, or insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5, plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in human cells. It functions by binding to IGFs, thereby prolonging their half-life in circulation and regulating their availability to tissues. This binding is essential for preventing the hypoglycemic effects that would occur if IGFs were free to interact with insulin receptors (Duan2020InsulinLike). IGFBP5 can form complexes with IGF and Acid Labile Subunit (ALS), which further extends the half-life of IGFs and maintains a circulating reservoir (Duan2020InsulinLike).

IGFBP5 is involved in both IGF-dependent and IGF-independent actions. It enhances IGF signaling by delivering IGFs to the IGF-1 receptor and can also inhibit IGF signaling by competing with the receptor for ligand binding (Duan2020InsulinLike). In osteoblasts, IGFBP5 stimulates mitogenesis and potentiates IGF action, suggesting a role in bone growth and maintenance (Andress1992Human). It also has IGF-independent activities, such as stimulating osteoblast proliferation through direct cell association (Andress1992Human).

IGFBP5 interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which can influence IGF-I activity and cellular responses such as cell migration and protein synthesis (Beattie2006Insulinlike). These interactions highlight its role in tissue localization and function, contributing to its diverse biological activities.

## Clinical Significance
IGFBP5 is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In cancer, IGFBP5 is associated with both tumor suppression and promotion, depending on the context. It is linked to poor prognosis in osteosarcoma, gastric cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and breast cancer, where it can influence cancer cell growth through its interaction with IGF signaling and proteases (Duan2020InsulinLike). In breast cancer, IGFBP5 is involved in drug resistance, particularly to PI3K inhibitors and tamoxifen, and its expression enhances the effectiveness of tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancers (Waters2022Insulinlike). In prostate cancer, increased IGFBP5 expression is associated with progression to androgen independence (Waters2022Insulinlike).

In diabetic kidney disease (DKD), IGFBP5 expression is upregulated, contributing to endothelial inflammation and disease progression by enhancing glycolysis in endothelial cells (Song2022IGFBP5). Genetic deletion of IGFBP5 in mice has shown protective effects against DKD, reducing renal inflammation and glomerulopathy (Song2022IGFBP5).

In diabetic neuropathy, IGFBP5 is upregulated, leading to motoneuron degeneration and axon loss by inhibiting IGF1 signaling pathways (Simon2015Dysregulated). This dysregulation results in impaired motor function and sensory defects (Simon2015Dysregulated).

## Interactions
IGFBP5 interacts with several proteins and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a significant role in modulating the activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). It binds to IGF-I and IGF-II, affecting their availability and function by inhibiting their binding to receptors, which impacts IGF-mediated receptor autophosphorylation (Kalus1998Structure). IGFBP5 also interacts with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) with high affinity, which is significant for controlling its abundance in the ECM and modulating IGF-I actions (Nam1997InsulinLike). 

IGFBP5 binds to various ECM proteins, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), osteopontin (OPN), vitronectin, and fibronectin, which can influence its ability to modulate IGF-I activity (Nam2000Thrombospondin; Beattie2006Insulinlike). The interaction with TSP-1 and OPN enhances the cell growth response to IGF-I, suggesting these proteins enhance IGF-I action (Nam2000Thrombospondin). IGFBP5 also binds to heparin and heparan sulfate, which can inhibit its interaction with IGF-I, indicating overlapping binding sites (Clemmons2001Use; Beattie2006Insulinlike). These interactions highlight IGFBP5's role in modulating IGF activity through its binding to various ECM components.
