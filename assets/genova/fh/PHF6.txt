# PHF6

## Overview
PHF6 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the PHD finger protein 6, a chromatin adaptor protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by two atypical PHD-like zinc finger domains, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and histones, although it does not bind histones in a conventional manner. PHF6 is integral to the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex and plays a role in transcriptional processes, including initiation and elongation, as well as ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle. Mutations in the PHF6 gene are linked to Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome and various hematological malignancies, underscoring its clinical significance (Jain2023Börjeson–Forssman–Lehmann; Todd2016The; Todd2015PHF6).

## Structure
The PHF6 protein is encoded by the PHF6 gene located on the X chromosome and is involved in chromatin regulation. It is composed of 365 amino acids and features two nearly identical zinc finger domains, ZaP1 and ZaP2, derived from a PZP motif. These domains are atypical PHD domains, characterized by a Cys4-His-Cys2-His type zinc finger, which do not bind histones but can interact with double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner (Todd2015PHF6).

PHF6 contains two nuclear localization sequences and a nucleolar localization sequence, confirming its presence in the nucleus and nucleolus. The ZaP1 domain is specifically involved in nucleolar localization, which can be disrupted by mutations (Todd2015PHF6). The protein interacts with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex through the retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), with the interaction facilitated by positively charged residues of PHF6 binding to a negatively charged pocket on RBBP4 (Liu2015Structural).

PHF6 is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as ATM, PLK1, and CDK2, which may influence its localization and function (Todd2015PHF6). The protein is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary importance (Liu2015Structural).

## Function
The PHF6 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It contains two atypical PHD-like zinc finger domains, which are involved in binding to histones and DNA, facilitating its function as a chromatin adaptor protein (Todd2012PHF6; Todd2015PHF6). PHF6 interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, influencing transcriptional processes by either repressing or activating transcriptional initiation (Todd2015PHF6). It also associates with the PAF1 complex to regulate transcriptional elongation, suggesting its involvement in forming a larger NuRD-PAF1 supercomplex (Todd2015PHF6).

PHF6 is active in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it participates in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and processing. It localizes to the sub-nucleolar fibrillar center and dense fibrillar component, binding to rDNA-coding sequences to regulate rRNA transcription (Todd2016The). The protein's interactions with UBF and its role in repressing rRNA transcription highlight its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cell cycle regulation (Todd2015PHF6).

In hematopoietic cells, PHF6 is involved in myeloid differentiation and gene expression regulation, interacting with transcription factors and complexes like LMO2 to maintain genome integrity (Stanulović2020PHF6). Its expression is particularly high in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/precursor cells, indicating a role in hematopoiesis (Eisa2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHF6 gene are associated with Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), an X-linked intellectual disability disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, distinctive facial features, obesity, and hypogonadism. Affected males typically exhibit intellectual disability, large ears, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism, and truncal obesity, while females with de novo mutations may show overlapping symptoms with additional features such as linear skin hyperpigmentation and dental anomalies (Jain2023Börjeson–Forssman–Lehmann; Zweier2013A).

PHF6 mutations are also implicated in hematological malignancies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In T-ALL, PHF6 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its mutations are often associated with NOTCH1 mutations, contributing to leukemogenesis (Chao2010T‐cell; Kurzer2021PHF6). In AML, PHF6 mutations frequently co-occur with RUNX1 mutations, leading to poor prognosis and adverse risk features (Kubota2024Molecular).

PHF6 mutations can disrupt normal chromatin interactions, affecting gene expression and contributing to disease pathogenesis. These mutations are concentrated in the zinc finger domains, crucial for chromatin binding, and can lead to altered differentiation and survival outcomes in cancer (Kubota2024Molecular; Mittal2024PHF6).

## Interactions
PHF6 (PHD finger protein 6) is involved in several significant protein interactions, particularly with components of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. It interacts with proteins such as CHD4, HDAC1, RBBP4, and RBBP7, indicating a role in chromatin remodeling processes (Todd2012PHF6; Kurzer2021PHF6). PHF6 also associates with the SWI/SNF complexes, specifically the PBAF and ncBAF families, and interacts with subunits like SMARCA4, BRD9, and PBRM1, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation (Mittal2024PHF6).

PHF6 binds to double-stranded DNA via its atypical PHD2 domain and is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with histone acetyltransferase p300, affecting histone H3 acetylation at lysine 14 and 27 (Kurzer2021PHF6; Mittal2024PHF6). It also interacts with the PAF1 transcription elongation complex, influencing neuronal migration (Kurzer2021PHF6).

In the context of DNA damage response, PHF6 binds to H3K56ac-marked nascent DNA and interacts with RRM2, suggesting a role in replication stress and DNA repair processes (Depestel2023The). PHF6's interaction with LMO2 during hematopoiesis and leukemia further highlights its involvement in gene expression regulation and genome integrity (Stanulović2020PHF6).
