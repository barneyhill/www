# CD8B2

## Overview
CD8B2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CD8 beta chain family, which is integral to the CD8 co-receptor complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the immune system by facilitating the recognition of antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. The protein encoded by CD8B2, known as CD8B family member 2, is primarily involved in T-cell activation and differentiation, contributing to the adaptive immune response. Although CD8B2 is annotated as a pseudogene, it retains a 210 amino acid open reading frame similar to CD8B, with minor amino acid substitutions. The expression patterns of CD8B2 differ significantly from those of CD8B, with reduced expression in whole blood and increased expression in brain tissues, suggesting a potential unique function in the brain (Dougherty2018Transcriptional).

## Structure


## Function
CD8B2 is a gene that encodes a protein related to the CD8 beta chain family, which is part of the CD8 co-receptor complex. This complex is essential for the immune response, particularly in the recognition of antigens presented by MHC class I molecules. The CD8B2 protein is involved in T-cell activation and differentiation, playing a role in the adaptive immune system. It is primarily active on the surface of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, aiding in the stabilization of the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (Dougherty2018Transcriptional).

Despite being annotated as a pseudogene, CD8B2 maintains the 210 amino acid open reading frame (ORF) of CD8B with four amino acid substitutions. However, the expression similarity between CD8B and CD8B2 is low, indicating a divergence in their expression patterns across tissues. This suggests that CD8B2 may have a different or less understood role compared to CD8B in healthy human cells (Dougherty2018Transcriptional). CD8B2 shows a loss of expression in whole blood and a gain in brain tissues, including the cortex, suggesting it is expressed in different cell types and may have a unique function in the brain (Dougherty2018Transcriptional).
