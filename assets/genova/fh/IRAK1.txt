# IRAK1

## Overview
Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase protein, which plays a critical role in the innate immune response. The IRAK1 protein is involved in the signaling pathways activated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs), leading to the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and MAPK, which are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Liu2008Interleukin‐1; Nguyen2009Regulation). Structurally, IRAK1 contains an N-terminal death domain, a central kinase domain, and C-terminal domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its kinase activity (Gottipati2008IRAK1:; Gosu2012Molecular). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its function and stability (Gottipati2008IRAK1:). Dysregulation of IRAK1 has been implicated in several autoimmune diseases and cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal immune function and disease pathogenesis (Kaufman2012Fine; Rhyasen2014IRAK).

## Structure
The IRAK1 protein is composed of several distinct domains, including an N-terminal death domain, a central kinase domain, and C-terminal C1 and C2 domains. The death domain, spanning amino acid residues 1-103, is crucial for interactions with other proteins, such as MyD88, facilitating the formation of signaling complexes (Gottipati2008IRAK1:; Nguyen2009Regulation). The kinase domain, located between residues 199-522, contains an activation loop and is essential for the protein's kinase activity, which is critical for certain signaling pathways (Gottipati2008IRAK1:; Gosu2012Molecular). Key residues within the kinase domain, such as Lys-239 and Asp-340, are vital for its function (Gottipati2008IRAK1:).

IRAK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and degradation (Gottipati2008IRAK1:). The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other IRAK family members through death domain interactions (Gottipati2008IRAK1:). Alternative splicing of IRAK1 results in several isoforms, such as IRAK1b and IRAK1c, which have distinct regulatory roles and lack kinase activity (Gottipati2008IRAK1:). These splice variants can act as dominant negative regulators in signaling pathways, affecting IRAK1's ability to undergo phosphorylation and sumoylation (Gottipati2008IRAK1:).

## Function
IRAK1 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of the innate immune response. It is primarily involved in the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways following the recognition of pathogens by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) (Nguyen2009Regulation). Upon activation by TLRs, IRAK1 is recruited to the receptor complex, where it undergoes phosphorylation, a crucial step for its full activation. This phosphorylation leads to the dissociation of IRAK1 from the receptor complex and the subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules such as TRAF6, ultimately resulting in the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB (Nguyen2009Regulation).

IRAK1 is also involved in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus and binding to specific gene promoters (Liu2008Interleukin‐1). It enhances the transcriptional activities of NF-κB by facilitating the phosphorylation of p65/RelA and histone H3, which are associated with active transcription (Ringwood2008The; Liu2008Interleukin‐1). These processes are essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRAK1 gene are associated with several autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1059702 in the IRAK1 gene results in a serine to phenylalanine substitution, which is linked to increased NF-κB activity, a key factor in immune response regulation. This SNP is associated with lower mRNA levels of MECP2, another gene implicated in SLE risk (Kaufman2012Fine). Missense mutations in IRAK1 have also been identified as contributing to SLE by potentially affecting protein stability and function (Adnan2024MISSENSE).

In neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), IRAK1 polymorphisms, particularly the rs1059703 SNP, are associated with disease susceptibility, especially in females (Shi2020IRAK1). The IRAK1 gene is also implicated in systemic sclerosis (SSc), where its expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in male patients and those with severe skin involvement (Vreca2018Impact).

In cancer, IRAK1 is overexpressed and activated in myeloid malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), contributing to disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of IRAK1 in these conditions can lead to apoptosis and impaired progenitor cell function (Rhyasen2014IRAK).

## Interactions
IRAK1 (interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Upon stimulation by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IRAK1 interacts with the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), facilitating its recruitment to the IKK complex, a critical step for NF-κB activation (COOKE2001Functional). This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, where IRAK1 co-immunoprecipitates with NEMO only upon IL-1β stimulation (COOKE2001Functional).

IRAK1 also undergoes Lys63-linked polyubiquitination, which is essential for its interaction with NEMO. This ubiquitination occurs at lysine residues 134 and 180 and is catalyzed by TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The polyubiquitination of IRAK1 is necessary for the binding of NEMO and subsequent NF-κB activation (Conze2008Lys63Linked).

IRAK1 interacts with other proteins such as viperin and TRAF6, forming a complex that is crucial for viperin activation. IRAK1 acts as a mediator, enabling the association between viperin and TRAF6, which do not interact directly without IRAK1 (Dumbrepatil2019Viperin). Additionally, IRAK1 interacts with CaMKII isoforms, specifically CaMKIIγ and CaMKIIδ, through its death domain, which is critical for this interaction (Kim2014Role).
