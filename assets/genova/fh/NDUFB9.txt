# NDUFB9

## Overview
NDUFB9 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B9, a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is part of the LYR protein family and plays a critical role in the electron transport chain, which is essential for cellular respiration and ATP production. NDUFB9 is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and contributes to the assembly and stability of complex I by interacting with other subunits and accessory proteins, such as NDUFAB1. The protein's structural integrity is vital for maintaining the function of complex I, and mutations in the NDUFB9 gene can lead to complex I deficiency, resulting in various mitochondrial diseases (Haack2011Mutation; Padavannil2022The).

## Structure
The NDUFB9 protein is a subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial complex I, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. It is part of the LYR protein family and interacts with the acyl carrier protein (ACP) NDUFAB1-β, which is essential for the early stages of complex I assembly (Padavannil2022The). The NDUFB9 subunit is associated with the membrane domain of complex I and contains a helical bundle structure. A notable mutation, Leu64Pro, occurs in the last α-helix of this bundle, affecting the phosphopantetheine (PNS) cofactor's hydrophobic pocket and destabilizing the NDUFAB1/NDUFB9 complex (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian).

NDUFB9 forms part of a supernumerary cage within complex I, contributing to the stability of the membrane domain. It interacts with other subunits, such as ND5, and does not replace any preexisting functionality but uses the surface of ND5 as a platform (Zhu2016Structure; Padavannil2022The). The protein's interaction with ACPs and LYR proteins suggests a role in linking complex I assembly and activity to fatty acid metabolism (Elurbe2016The). The structural integrity of NDUFB9 is vital for maintaining the stability and function of complex I.

## Function
NDUFB9 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is the first enzyme in the electron transport chain. This complex plays a crucial role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process that contributes to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This proton gradient is essential for ATP synthesis, the primary energy currency of the cell (Haack2011Mutation).

NDUFB9 is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is necessary for the proper assembly and stability of complex I. The presence of NDUFB9 ensures efficient electron transfer and proton translocation, which are critical for maintaining the electrochemical gradient required for ATP production (Haack2011Mutation). In healthy human cells, NDUFB9's function is vital for energy production, supporting various cellular processes and overall organismal energy homeostasis (Haack2011Mutation).

Mutations in NDUFB9 can lead to complex I deficiency, a condition that impairs mitochondrial function and can result in various mitochondrial diseases. The gene's role in maintaining complex I integrity highlights its importance in cellular energy metabolism (Haack2011Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFB9 gene, which encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, have been linked to complex I deficiency, a condition that affects mitochondrial function and is associated with a range of mitochondrial diseases. One specific mutation, Leu64Pro, has been identified as causative of complex I deficiency. This mutation occurs in the last α-helix of the NDUFB9 helical bundle, affecting the structure of the phosphopantetheine (PNS) hydrophobic pocket and destabilizing the NDUFAB1/NDUFB9 complex (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). 

Patients with NDUFB9 mutations can exhibit significantly reduced complex I activity, as demonstrated in fibroblasts from affected individuals. For instance, a homozygous missense mutation (c.191T/C, p.Leu64Pro) in patient 35838 resulted in only 21% and 39% of the lowest control value for complex I activity. Complementation experiments confirmed the causative nature of this mutation, as expression of wild-type NDUFB9 restored complex I activity (Haack2011Mutation). 

These mutations can lead to clinical phenotypes such as progressive hypotonia and increased serum lactate, highlighting the importance of NDUFB9 in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Correia2021Severe).

## Interactions
NDUFB9 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is crucial for electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. NDUFB9 interacts with other subunits within complex I to facilitate its assembly and stability. The study by Haack et al. identified NDUFB9 as a novel gene associated with complex I deficiency, highlighting its role in the assembly and stability of the complex. Mutations in NDUFB9 can lead to reduced levels of the protein and decreased complex I activity, which can be rescued by expressing wild-type NDUFB9, indicating its essential role in maintaining complex I function (Haack2011Mutation).

NDUFB9 also interacts with NDUFAB1, a mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein that acts as an accessory subunit critical for complex I assembly. NDUFAB1 interacts directly with NDUFB9 and NDUFA6, both members of the LYRM family, through the insertion of its acyl-chain into a hydrophobic channel in NDUFB9 and the formation of salt-bridge contacts. This interaction network is important for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Dibley2020The). These interactions underscore the importance of NDUFB9 in the structural and functional integrity of mitochondrial complex I.
