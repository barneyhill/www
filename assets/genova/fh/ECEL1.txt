# ECEL1

## Overview
The ECEL1 gene encodes the endothelin-converting enzyme-like 1, a type II integral membrane protein that belongs to the M13 family of zinc-containing endopeptidases. This protein is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the regulation of neuropeptide and peptide hormone activity, although its specific physiological substrates remain unidentified (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). Structurally, ECEL1 is characterized by a short cytosolic domain, a transmembrane segment, and a large extracellular domain containing the active site, which is crucial for its enzymatic function (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, and exists in different glycosylation states (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). Clinically, mutations in the ECEL1 gene are associated with distal arthrogryposis type 5D (DA5D), a disorder characterized by congenital contractures and distinctive facial features, highlighting its importance in neuromuscular development and function (McMillin2013Mutations).

## Structure
The ECEL1 protein is a type II integral membrane protein, characterized by a short cytosolic domain, a transmembrane segment, and a large extracellular domain containing the active site. It is a member of the M13 family of zinc-containing endopeptidases and is primarily expressed in the central nervous system (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). The protein consists of 775 amino acids and includes motifs characteristic of Zn2+-metallopeptidases, such as H612EXXH and G671ENIAD (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting).

The secondary structure of ECEL1 includes 31 α-helices and 12 β-sheets, with α-helices 24 and 27 containing the active site residues. Its tertiary structure is similar to that of human ECE1, with two major domains enclosing a cavity that contains the active site. The N-terminal domain has a fold similar to thermolysin and contains the active site residue, while the other domain may control substrate access (Holmes2013Comparative).

ECEL1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at three sites. The protein exists in different glycosylation states, with a 95 kDa form in the endoplasmic reticulum and a 105 kDa form on the cell surface (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting).

## Function
The ECEL1 gene encodes the endothelin-converting enzyme-like 1, a member of the M13 family of zinc-containing endopeptidases. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in the regulation of neuropeptide and peptide hormone activity, although its specific physiological substrates remain unidentified (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). ECEL1 is a type II integral-membrane protein with a large extracellular domain containing the active site, and it is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with a smaller portion reaching the cell surface (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting).

In healthy human cells, ECEL1 is thought to play a role in the central control of breathing, as studies on knockout mice have indicated its importance in this function (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). The enzyme's stability in the ER suggests a specific retention and physiological role within this compartment, potentially related to its enzymatic function or interaction with other proteins (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting). Despite its known activity with synthetic substrates, the precise molecular processes and organismal outcomes of ECEL1's activity in healthy human cells are not fully understood (BENOIT2004Endothelinconverting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ECEL1 gene are associated with distal arthrogryposis type 5D (DA5D), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital contractures of the hands and feet, as well as distinctive facial features such as ptosis (McMillin2013Mutations). DA5D is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in ECEL1, which encodes a member of the neprilysin family of zinc metalloendopeptidases. These mutations lead to poor neuromuscular junction formation and muscle contractility issues (Alesi2021A).

Clinical features of ECEL1-related conditions include knee extension contractures, micrognathia, distal joint contractures, clubfoot, ptosis, and scoliosis (Umair2019Biallelic). The gene's mutations have been linked to various phenotypes, including facial dysmorphism, camptodactyly, toe and foot contractures, and knee deformities (Umair2019Biallelic). In some cases, mutations in ECEL1 also result in neuromuscular diseases (NMD) and fetal arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), with muscle abnormalities observed in affected fetuses (Dohrn2015ECEL1).

The ECEL1 gene is crucial for proper motor neuron function, and its mutations can lead to defects in axon guidance and motor innervation, contributing to the symptoms of congenital contracture disorders (Nagata2017Distinct).
