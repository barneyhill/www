# GLP1R

## Overview
The GLP1R gene encodes the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. This receptor is primarily expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it mediates the effects of the incretin hormone GLP-1, enhancing insulin secretion and promoting beta-cell proliferation. Structurally, GLP-1R is characterized by a large extracellular domain and a seven-transmembrane domain, which are essential for ligand binding and receptor activation (Graaf2016GlucagonLike; Koole2013Recent). Beyond its metabolic functions, GLP-1R is also involved in cardiovascular health, influencing ventricular function and reducing ischemic damage (Baggio2018GLP1). Due to its significant role in glucose homeostasis and potential therapeutic applications, particularly in type 2 diabetes, GLP-1R is a critical target for drug development (Challa2012Regulation; Koole2013Recent).

## Structure
The GLP1R (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. It is composed of 463 amino acids, forming a single polypeptide chain (Graaf2016GlucagonLike; Koole2013Recent). The receptor features a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD), which is characteristic of GPCRs (Graaf2016GlucagonLike; Zhang2017Cryo-EM). The ECD is crucial for ligand binding and is stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds, forming a 'Sushi domain' or 'short consensus repeat' (Underwood2010Crystal; Koole2013Recent).

The 7TMD consists of seven alpha-helices connected by intracellular and extracellular loops, with a C-terminal helix 8 (Graaf2016GlucagonLike). The receptor's structure is further stabilized by glycosylation, which is essential for proper trafficking and cell surface expression (Graaf2016GlucagonLike). The ECD and 7TMD work together in a two-domain model for ligand binding, where the ECD initially binds the C-terminal region of the ligand, allowing the N-terminal region to interact with the 7TMD (Graaf2016GlucagonLike; Zhang2017Cryo-EM).

The GLP1R does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. However, its interaction with ligands and G proteins involves significant conformational changes, particularly in the transmembrane helices, which are crucial for receptor activation (Zhang2017Cryo-EM).

## Function
The GLP1R gene encodes the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a member of the B1 family of G protein-coupled receptors. This receptor is primarily expressed in pancreatic beta cells and plays a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion. Upon binding with the incretin hormone GLP-1, GLP-1R activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. This activation triggers cAMP-dependent pathways, including protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac), which enhance insulin release and promote beta-cell proliferation while preventing apoptosis (Li2020GLP1R; Koole2013Recent).

GLP-1R is involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), a process essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis. It also influences peripheral insulin sensitivity and inhibits glucagon release, contributing to improved glucose metabolism (Koole2013Recent). Beyond the pancreas, GLP-1R activity affects appetite regulation, gastric emptying, and energy metabolism, making it a significant target for type 2 diabetes therapeutics (Challa2012Regulation; Koole2013Recent).

In the cardiovascular system, GLP-1R is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, where it plays a role in improving ventricular function and reducing infarct size during ischemic events (Baggio2018GLP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GLP1R gene are associated with several metabolic disorders, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GLP1R gene, such as rs6458093 and rs3765467, have been linked to an increased risk of GDM. The rs6458093 variant is associated with lower beta cell function and higher postprandial glucose levels, particularly in younger individuals and those with higher BMI (Luo2022Genetic). Conversely, the GA genotype of rs3765467 is associated with a decreased risk of GDM in older subjects (Luo2022Genetic).

In the context of T2DM, SNPs like rs3765467 and rs10305492 impair GLP1R function, affecting insulin secretion and promoting beta cell apoptosis, which can reduce the efficacy of treatments like Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (Li2020GLP1R). The GLP1R variant Arg131Gln is associated with a decreased risk of T2DM and lower glucose levels in an East Asian population (Kwak2018Nonsynonymous). Additionally, rare GLP1R variants are overrepresented in individuals with severe obesity and are linked to an increased risk of T2DM (Handley2023Rare).

## Interactions
The GLP1R (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor) is a G protein-coupled receptor that engages in various interactions with proteins, primarily influencing insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. It interacts with several peptide agonists, including GLP-1, exendin-4, oxyntomodulin, and exendin-P5, which bind to the receptor and activate different signaling pathways (Deganutti2022Dynamics). The receptor's interaction with these peptides involves conserved binding at the transmembrane domain, although exendin-P5 shows more divergent interactions (Deganutti2022Dynamics).

GLP1R also forms complexes with G proteins, particularly the Gs protein, which is crucial for its signaling function. This interaction leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in cyclic AMP levels, promoting insulin secretion (Koole2013Recent). The receptor's engagement with G proteins is consistent across different peptide bindings, suggesting a common interaction network (Zhang2021Structure).

Additionally, GLP1R interacts with the Fab7F38 antibody, which binds to its extracellular domain (ECD) and stabilizes the receptor in an inactive state. This interaction does not overlap with the peptide-binding site, indicating a non-competitive mechanism (Mizera2021LigandReceptor). The receptor's ECD also plays a role in transitioning between inactive and active states, which is essential for peptide binding and activation (Mizera2021LigandReceptor).
