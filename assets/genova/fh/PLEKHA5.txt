# PLEKHA5

## Overview
PLEKHA5 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing A5, which is a member of the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH) and Trp-Trp (WW) domains, which are integral to its function in cellular processes such as membrane association, protein-protein interactions, and intracellular signaling. The PH domain facilitates binding to phosphoinositides, which are critical for membrane localization, while the WW domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as PDZD11, influencing microtubule dynamics and copper homeostasis (Yamada2012Identification; Sluysmans2021WW). PLEKHA5 plays a significant role in the regulation of copper efflux and mitotic progression, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and congenital disorders (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5; Jilaveanu2015PLEKHA5).

## Structure
PLEKHA5 encodes a protein that is part of the pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family. The protein exists in two main splice variant isoforms: a long form (L-PLEKHA5) and a short form (S-PLEKHA5). L-PLEKHA5 consists of 1282 amino acids and includes 32 exons, while S-PLEKHA5 has 1116 amino acids and 26 exons (Yamada2012Identification). Both isoforms contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a Trp-Trp (WW) domain. The PH domain is located between amino acids 170-267 in L-PLEKHA5 and is involved in binding phosphoinositides such as PI3P, PI4P, PI5P, and PI(3,5)P2, which are crucial for membrane association and signaling pathways (Yamada2012Identification; ZOU2013A). The WW domain, located between amino acids 59-88, is essential for interactions with PDZD11 and association with cytoplasmic microtubules (Sluysmans2021WW).

The PH domain of PLEKHA5 is characterized by a β-barrel of seven antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal amphiphilic α-helix, which is a common structural motif in eukaryotic proteins (Yamada2012Identification). The protein's subcellular localization is influenced by cooperative protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions, with the PH domain directing localization to the lateral plasma membrane (Sluysmans2021WW).

## Function
PLEKHA5 is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins and its localization within the cell. It contains pleckstrin homology (PH) and Trp-Trp (WW) domains, which facilitate its association with cytoplasmic microtubules and the lateral plasma membrane in epithelial cells (Sluysmans2021WW). The WW domains are essential for PLEKHA5's interaction with PDZD11, a protein that it helps stabilize and localize along microtubules (Sluysmans2021WW).

PLEKHA5 plays a significant role in copper homeostasis by interacting with PDZD11 to target the Menkes ATPase ATP7A to the cell periphery, which is crucial for copper efflux (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5). This interaction is necessary for the proper localization and function of ATP7A, particularly under conditions of elevated copper levels, thereby maintaining low intracellular copper concentrations (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

In addition to its role in copper regulation, PLEKHA5 is involved in the spatial regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) during mitosis. It acts as a microtubule-specific adaptor, facilitating the recruitment of APC/C to the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is essential for the ubiquitination of mitotic effector proteins and progression of mitosis (Cao2022Proximity).

## Clinical Significance
PLEKHA5 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to its role in cancer progression and metastasis. In metastatic melanoma, PLEKHA5 is associated with brain metastasis, where its expression is significantly up-regulated in cerebrotropic melanoma cells and patients with early brain metastases. High PLEKHA5 expression correlates with decreased brain metastasis-free survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for brain metastasis propensity in melanoma (Jilaveanu2015PLEKHA5). PLEKHA5 is thought to facilitate the passage of melanoma cells across the blood-brain barrier and their invasion into the brain, possibly through interactions with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Jilaveanu2015PLEKHA5).

In addition to melanoma, PLEKHA5 has been linked to diffuse-type gastric carcinoma (DGC), particularly in cells with Met gene amplification. PLEKHA5 is crucial for the survival of Met-addicted carcinoma cells, and its knockdown induces apoptotic cell death, suggesting a role in drug resistance and tumor survival (Nagamura2021PLEKHA5).

PLEKHA5 has also been associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NS-CL/P). Specific variants in PLEKHA5, such as c.1769A>G (p.Tyr590Cys), have been identified in affected individuals, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of NS-CL/P (Cox2018Mutations).

## Interactions
PLEKHA5 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its WW domains, which are crucial for its association with other proteins. One significant interaction is with PDZD11, a protein that helps control the localization of transmembrane proteins. This interaction is mutually interdependent and is essential for the anterograde trafficking of the copper pump ATP7A to the cell periphery, which is crucial for copper efflux (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5; Sluysmans2021WW). The WW domains of PLEKHA5 specifically interact with the N-terminal proline-rich region of PDZD11, similar to PLEKHA7 (Sluysmans2021PLEKHA5).

PLEKHA5 also interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a key regulator of mitosis. This interaction is mediated by PLEKHA5's proline-rich domain, which facilitates the recruitment of APC/C to the microtubule network, enhancing the efficiency of CDC20 loading onto APC/C. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination of microtubule-localized substrates during mitosis (Cao2022Proximity). PLEKHA5's interaction with APC/C is important for normal mitotic progression, as its depletion leads to defects in APC/C-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of substrates (Cao2022Proximity).
