# PHB2

## Overview
Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is a gene located on chromosome 12p13.31 that encodes the protein prohibitin 2, a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the prohibitin family, prohibitin 2 is primarily known for its role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. It is a transmembrane protein that forms complexes with prohibitin 1 (PHB1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to mitochondrial stability and quality control. Beyond its mitochondrial functions, prohibitin 2 also acts as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus, influencing gene expression and cell cycle progression. The protein is implicated in several critical pathways, including mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics, and interacts with various proteins to modulate cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and other processes. Due to its involvement in these pathways, alterations in PHB2 expression and function are associated with a range of diseases, including cancer and cardiac conditions (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin; Yan2019PHB2).

## Structure
Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is a protein encoded by the PHB2 gene located on chromosome 12p13.31, producing a 299-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 33.3 kDa (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin). The primary structure of PHB2 includes several domains: an N-terminal transmembrane domain (amino acids 1-36), a central prohibitin domain (amino acids 36-201), and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (amino acids 188-264) (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin). The coiled-coil domain is characterized by a heptad repeat region that facilitates interactions with other proteins, forming complexes critical for mitochondrial function (Liu2023The).

PHB2's secondary structure includes a transmembrane alpha-helix at the N-terminus, which is long enough to reach into the mitochondrial interior, and a coiled-coil structure at the C-terminus (Winter2007Molecular). The tertiary structure of PHB2 is not explicitly detailed, but it is known to form tetrameric complexes with PHB1, contributing to a large ring structure in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin).

PHB2 undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at sites such as S91, S176, and S243, which affect its role in cellular processes like myocyte differentiation and apoptosis (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin). The protein has 13 documented splice variants, with 7 coding for PHB2 isoforms (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin).

## Function
Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function in healthy human cells. It forms a complex with prohibitin 1 (PHB1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for mitochondrial stability and the protection of mitochondrial proteins from degradation (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin; Osman2009Prohibitins). PHB2 is involved in mitochondrial quality control through its role as a mitophagy receptor, facilitating the autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria via the PINK1-PRKN pathway (Yan2019PHB2). It also regulates mitochondrial dynamics by affecting the activity of proteins involved in mitochondrial division and fusion, such as OPA1 (Oyang2022The).

In the nucleus, PHB2 acts as a transcriptional regulator, interacting with various transcription factors to influence gene expression and cell cycle progression (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin). It is also known to suppress the transcription of target genes, impacting cellular differentiation and apoptosis (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin). PHB2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing mitochondrial-related diseases (Bavelloni2015Prohibitin; Peng2015Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the PHB2 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and cardiac conditions. In cancer, PHB2 can function as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the context. It is overexpressed in several cancer types, including ovarian cancer, where it affects chemotherapy sensitivity, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where high expression correlates with poor survival (Qi2023Essential). In colorectal cancer, PHB2 promotes tumor growth and energy metabolism, while in hepatocellular carcinoma, it represses miR-34a, facilitating cell proliferation and metastasis (Qi2023Essential). PHB2's interactions with proteins like AKT and RACK1 in non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer promote proliferation and migration (Qi2023Essential).

In cardiac conditions, PHB2 deficiency leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in heart failure. This is evidenced by cardiac-specific knockout models in mice, which show severe heart failure symptoms and reduced lifespan (Wu2020Prohibitin). PHB2's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity is also crucial in neurodegenerative diseases, where its disruption is linked to increased apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction (Signorile2019Prohibitins:).

## Interactions
Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. PHB2 interacts with Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) to form a complex that is essential for mitophagy, a process of mitochondrial degradation. This interaction is mediated through PHB2's direct binding to LC3-II, a protein involved in autophagy, while PHB1 interacts indirectly through PHB2 (Wei2017Prohibitin). PHB2 also binds specifically to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator, which is important for mitochondrial function and the assembly of cytochrome-c oxidase in the electron transport chain (Strub2010Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate).

In the context of muscle differentiation, PHB2 interacts with mDia1, a RhoA effector, through its central and carboxy regions. This interaction is crucial for muscle differentiation, as PHB2 modulates the anti-myogenic activity of mDia1, allowing for efficient differentiation (Saleh2019Cytoplasmic). PHB2 also plays a role in the stabilization of PINK1 in depolarized mitochondria through interactions with the PARL-PGAM5 axis, which is essential for PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy (Yan2019PHB2). These interactions highlight PHB2's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and mitochondrial dynamics.
