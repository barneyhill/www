# CTAG1A

## Overview
CTAG1A, also known as NY-ESO-1, is a gene that encodes the cancer/testis antigen 1A protein, which is predominantly expressed in various tumors and normal testis tissue. This protein is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, a group of proteins that are typically restricted to the testis in normal tissues but are aberrantly expressed in a range of cancers. The CTAG1A protein is involved in transcriptional regulation and is a component of the KEOPS transcription complex, playing a role in telomere maintenance and transcription processes (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). Its interactions with other proteins, such as MAGEC1 and PRAME, suggest a role in specialized transcription complexes, particularly in the context of tumor biology (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). Due to its restricted expression pattern and immunogenic properties, CTAG1A is a significant target for cancer immunotherapy, with potential applications in the treatment of various malignancies, including lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers (Kulkarni2012Cancertestis; Vlasenkova2023Characterization; Jin2018Cancertestis).

## Structure
CTAG1A, also known as NY-ESO-1, is a protein encoded by the CTAG1A gene, characterized by its expression in various tumors and normal testis tissue. The primary structure of CTAG1A consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, which forms the basis for its functional properties. The secondary structure of the protein may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of the protein, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its role in cancer immunotherapy. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple protein subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

CTAG1A may undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. These modifications are important for the protein's function and regulation within the cellular environment. The presence of specific domains or motifs within CTAG1A is relevant to its role in cancer immunotherapy, although detailed information on these structural features is not specified in the context. Overall, the structural characteristics of CTAG1A are integral to its function as a cancer/testis antigen.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
CTAG1A, also known as NY-ESO-1, is a cancer/testis antigen with significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its aberrant expression. In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, high expression of CTAG1A is associated with a negative impact on overall survival, especially in patients with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis (Jin2018Cancertestis). This suggests its potential as a prognostic marker and a target for immunotherapy in lung cancer (Jin2018Cancertestis).

In prostate cancer, CTAG1A expression is more frequent in advanced stages, such as castration-resistant prostate cancer, compared to localized tumors. This indicates its potential as a biomarker for disease progression and a target for therapeutic interventions (Kulkarni2012Cancertestis).

CTAG1A is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where its expression and mutations correlate with patient survivability. It is one of the cancer/testis antigens identified as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in this malignancy (Vlasenkova2023Characterization).

Overall, CTAG1A's restricted expression in normal tissues and its immunogenicity make it a promising target for cancer immunotherapy across various cancer types.

## Interactions
CTAG1A, also known as NY-ESO-1, is a cancer/testis antigen that participates in various protein interactions, particularly within multiprotein complexes. It is a homolog of the yeast Pcc1p transcription factor and is part of the KEOPS transcription complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation and telomere maintenance (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). CTAG1A forms a network with other cancer/testis antigens such as MAGEC1 and PRAME, creating a clique where these proteins are interconnected (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). CTAG1A and MAGEC1 physically interact within intracellular protein complexes, suggesting a role in specialized transcription complexes in developing germ cells (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel).

The protein is also associated with RNA polymerase II subunits, indicating its involvement in transcription processes (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). The interactions of CTAG1A with other proteins, such as MAGEC1, may support tumor growth by recruiting gametogenic germ cell transcription programs (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel). Additionally, CTAG1A is linked to sarcoma biology through its network neighbors, including RANBP2 and TLE1, which are implicated in sarcoma pathways (Papanikolaou2022SystemsLevel).
