# A2M

## Overview
Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a gene that encodes a large plasma glycoprotein known as alpha-2-macroglobulin, which functions primarily as a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor. This protein is categorized as a protease inhibitor due to its ability to trap and inhibit a wide range of proteases through a unique 'snap-trap' mechanism. Upon proteolytic cleavage of its bait region, A2M undergoes a conformational change that allows it to encapsulate active proteases, thereby preventing them from interacting with larger substrates. Beyond its role in protease inhibition, alpha-2-macroglobulin is involved in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation, inflammation, and the clearance of damaged proteins. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in several clinical conditions, notably neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where mutations and polymorphisms in A2M may influence disease risk and progression (Vandooren2021Alpha2Macroglobulin; Guo2015Association; Zhang2023Alpha).

## Structure
The human alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a large plasma glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with 1,451 amino acid residues, featuring glucosamine-based oligosaccharide groups attached to specific asparagine residues (SottrupJensen1984Primary). The secondary structure is characterized by a low alpha-helix content and a significant beta-sheet content, forming small domains (SottrupJensen1984Primary).

The tertiary structure of A2M includes a bait region that is crucial for trapping proteases. This region undergoes proteolytic cleavage, leading to a conformational change that entraps the proteinase (SottrupJensen1984Primary). The protein also contains a thioester domain (TED) with a reactive thioester bond, which becomes exposed upon cleavage in the bait region, facilitating structural rearrangement (Goulas2017Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, A2M is a tetramer composed of disulfide-linked dimers, forming a dimer of dimers. This arrangement allows the protein to accommodate and trap peptidases within a central cavity (Kolodziej2002The; Goulas2017Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bridges and N-glycosylation, which are notable post-translational modifications (Goulas2017Structural). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is exposed upon activation, facilitating interaction with cell-surface receptors (Goulas2017Structural).

## Function
Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a crucial protein in human physiology, primarily recognized for its role as a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor. It functions by forming a tetrameric cage around active proteases, preventing them from interacting with large substrates while allowing the digestion of small peptides. This mechanism, known as the 'snap-trap' or 'venus-flytrap' mechanism, is activated upon proteolytic cleavage of its 'bait region,' leading to a conformational change that traps active proteases (Vandooren2021Alpha2Macroglobulin; SottrupJensen1984Primary).

A2M is involved in immune responses, particularly in inflammation and infection. It enhances antigen presentation by macrophages, affecting both MHC-I and MHC-II pathways, which are crucial for T-cell activation. A2M also binds to receptors like LRP-1 and GRP78, leading to increased intracellular calcium and the release of inflammatory mediators (Vandooren2021Alpha2Macroglobulin).

In addition to its role in immune modulation, A2M interacts with reactive oxygen species, which can alter its structure and function. This interaction can lead to the dissociation of A2M into dimers with chaperone activity, affecting its ability to inhibit proteases (Vandooren2021Alpha2Macroglobulin). A2M also plays a role in the removal of damaged extracellular proteins and has implications in inflammation, immunity, and infections (Vandooren2021Alpha2Macroglobulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the A2M gene have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The A2M gene encodes alpha-2-macroglobulin, a protein involved in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which are central to AD pathology. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the A2M gene, such as the G allele of rs226380, have been linked to a decreased risk of AD in Asian populations, while the V allele of the I/V polymorphism increases AD risk in females (Zhang2023Alpha). A novel heterozygous mutation in the A2M gene, affecting the N-glycosylation site, has been identified in a patient with early-onset AD, leading to reduced binding of Aβ and suggesting a pathogenic role (Qiu2023Novel).

The A2M gene is also implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). A meta-analysis found that the rs669 polymorphism in A2M is associated with an increased risk of PD, particularly in Asian populations, although another polymorphism, rs3832852, showed no significant association (Guo2015Association). These findings highlight the potential role of A2M in neurodegenerative diseases through its involvement in protein accumulation and clearance.

## Interactions
Alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) is a versatile protein known for its interactions with a wide range of proteases and other proteins. A2M can bind to various proteinases, including serine, thiol, carboxyl, and metal proteinases, through a mechanism that involves a conformational change upon binding, effectively trapping the enzyme and inhibiting its activity (Barrett1973The). This interaction is typically irreversible and specific to active proteinases, as A2M does not bind to inactive forms or non-proteolytic enzymes (Barrett1973The).

In the context of prostate cancer, A2M has been shown to interact with components of the clotting cascade, such as thrombin and plasmin, as well as plasma kallikrein and carboxypeptidase B2 (Burgess2008Prostate). A2M also forms non-covalent associations with proteins lacking proteolytic activity, including beta inhibin chains and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) (Burgess2008Prostate).

A2M's interaction with plasmin involves both covalent and non-covalent binding modes, with the covalent binding being susceptible to disruption by hydroxylamine (Pochon1987Some). These interactions highlight A2M's role in regulating proteolytic activity and its potential involvement in various biological pathways.
