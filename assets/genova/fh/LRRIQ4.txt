# LRRIQ4

## Overview
The LRRIQ4 gene encodes the protein leucine rich repeats and IQ motif containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an IQ motif. These structural features suggest that the protein may be involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially playing a role in cellular signaling pathways. While the specific biological functions of LRRIQ4 remain to be fully elucidated, proteins with LRR domains are often implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, signal transduction, and immune response. The IQ motif, known for binding calmodulin and other EF-hand proteins, indicates a possible role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways. Further research is needed to clarify the precise functions and interactions of the LRRIQ4 protein within cellular contexts.
