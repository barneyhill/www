# ZFYVE21

## Overview
ZFYVE21 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger FYVE-type containing 21 protein, also known as ZF21. This protein is characterized by the presence of a FYVE domain, which is crucial for its localization to endosomes and interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), and a noncanonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (Nagano2010ZF21; Nagano2011ZF21a). ZF21 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as focal adhesion disassembly, cell motility, and endosomal signaling. It is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and participates in non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, impacting endothelial cell activation and inflammatory responses (Nagano2010ZF21; Fang2019ZFYVE21). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as Rubicon and RNF34, form complexes that are essential for inflammasome activity, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases and cancer (Li2023A; Nagano2011ZF21).

## Structure
The ZFYVE21 protein, also known as ZF21, is characterized by the presence of a FYVE domain and a novel noncanonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The FYVE domain is known for binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and is crucial for the protein's localization to endosomes and its interaction with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Nagano2010ZF21; Nagano2011ZF21a). The FYVE domain of ZFYVE21 shows sequence conservation with EEA1, suggesting a similar fold (Nagano2011ZF21a).

The C-terminal region of ZFYVE21, which lacks sequence homology with known domains, adopts a compact, globular fold consisting of seven β-strands and two α-helices. These β-strands form two antiparallel β-sheets arranged orthogonally to create a β-sandwich structure, closed off by the C-terminal α-helix. This structure is characteristic of the canonical PH domain fold, with an additional α-helix tethered to the C-terminal α-helix (Nagano2011ZF21a). The C-terminal region is important for binding β-tubulin, which is significant for focal adhesion disassembly and cancer metastasis (Nagano2011ZF21a).

ZFYVE21 has two isoforms predicted based on mRNA splice variants, encoding 234 or 252 amino acids. The shorter variant is ubiquitously expressed, while the longer variant's expression is more variable (Nagano2010ZF21).

## Function
ZFYVE21, also known as ZF21, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of focal adhesion (FA) disassembly, which is essential for cell adhesion and motility. It is involved in the microtubule-dependent dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr 397, a critical step for FA disassembly. ZFYVE21 interacts with FAK and other proteins such as m-calpain and SHP-2, facilitating the turnover of FAs and promoting cell migration (Nagano2010ZF21; Nagano2011ZF21). 

The protein contains a FYVE domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, allowing it to localize to the plasma membrane and endosomes. This localization is important for its function in FA dynamics and cell motility (Nagano2010ZF21). ZFYVE21 is also involved in non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, acting as a Rab5 effector that modulates phosphoinositide levels on endosomes, which is crucial for endothelial cell activation and inflammatory responses (Fang2019ZFYVE21). 

In endothelial cells, ZFYVE21 forms a signaling complex with Rubicon and RNF34, promoting inflammasome activity and the production of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its role in immune responses (Li2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ZFYVE21 gene have been implicated in several disease conditions. In cancer, particularly metastatic colorectal carcinomas, ZFYVE21 expression is increased, suggesting its role in cancer progression by promoting cell migration and metastasis. The protein is crucial for the disassembly of focal adhesions, a process essential for cancer cell migration and metastasis, and its depletion reduces migratory activity, which can be restored by expressing wild-type ZFYVE21 (Nagano2011ZF21).

ZFYVE21 is also involved in complement-mediated inflammation, particularly in conditions like allograft vasculopathy. It acts as a complement-induced Rab5 effector, activating non-canonical NF-κB signaling, which is crucial for endothelial cell activation and inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of ZFYVE21 has been shown to reduce inflammation and tissue injury in models of allograft vasculopathy, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Fang2019ZFYVE21).

In addition, ZFYVE21 forms part of a signaling complex with Rubicon and RNF34, promoting inflammasome activity in endothelial cells. This complex is implicated in complement-induced vascular injury and inflammation, with potential clinical significance in diseases characterized by endothelial inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (Li2023A).

## Interactions
ZFYVE21 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily forming a complex with Rubicon and RNF34, known as the ZFYVE21-Rubicon-RNF34 (ZRR) complex. This complex is crucial for promoting inflammasome activity in endothelial cells by stabilizing Rubicon and RNF34 on Rab5 endosomes, preventing their degradation (Li2023A). The interactions within the ZRR complex are mediated by specific protein domains, including the FYVE domain of ZFYVE21, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on endosomal membranes, facilitating its recruitment to Rab5+ vesicles (Li2023A; Fang2019ZFYVE21).

ZFYVE21 also plays a role in non-canonical NF-κB signaling by interacting with Rab5 and promoting the recruitment of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) to endosomes. This interaction is essential for the activation of NF-κB signaling pathways (Fang2019ZFYVE21). Additionally, ZFYVE21 is involved in the ubiquitination and removal of the caspase-1 pseudosubstrate Flightless I (FliI), enhancing caspase-1 activation (Li2023A). These interactions highlight ZFYVE21's role in regulating endosomal signaling and inflammasome activity, making it a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases (Li2023A).
