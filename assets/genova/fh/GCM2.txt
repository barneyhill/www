# GCM2

## Overview
GCM2, or glial cells missing transcription factor 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor crucial for the development and function of the parathyroid glands. The protein product of GCM2 is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes essential for parathyroid differentiation and survival, including the parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene. This regulation is vital for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. GCM2 interacts with other transcription factors, such as MafB and Gata3, to synergistically activate PTH gene expression, which is critical for parathyroid development. Mutations in GCM2 can lead to disorders of calcium metabolism, such as hypoparathyroidism and hyperparathyroidism, highlighting its clinical significance in endocrine health (Liu2007Gcm2; Han2015Gata3; KamitaniKawamoto2011MafB).

## Function
The GCM2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the parathyroid glands. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of genes essential for parathyroid differentiation and survival (Liu2007Gcm2). GCM2 is crucial for the expression of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a key regulator of calcium homeostasis in the body. It synergistically interacts with the transcription factor MafB to activate the PTH gene promoter, which is vital for parathyroid development and function (KamitaniKawamoto2011MafB).

In healthy human cells, GCM2 is involved in the specification of the parathyroid domain during embryonic development. It ensures the survival and differentiation of parathyroid precursor cells, preventing apoptosis and promoting the expression of differentiation markers such as PTH, calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), and CCL21 (Liu2007Gcm2). The gene's activity is essential for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis, as it regulates PTH secretion, which influences bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and intestinal calcium absorption (Yamada2019Gcm2). Mutations in GCM2 can lead to hypoparathyroidism, characterized by low PTH levels and disrupted calcium balance (Yuan2014Generation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GCM2 gene are associated with several disorders related to calcium metabolism. Loss-of-function mutations in GCM2 can lead to familial isolated type 2 hypoparathyroidism, an autosomal dominant or recessive condition characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low or undetectable serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. This condition often results in seizures due to low calcium levels (GarcíaCastaño2021Five). The R110W mutation in the DNA-binding domain of GCM2 is linked to isolated hypoparathyroidism, impairing the gene's DNA-binding ability and transactivation function (Tomar2010Presence).

Conversely, gain-of-function mutations in GCM2 are implicated in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP). These mutations, such as p.K388E and p.V382M, enhance the transactivating function of GCM2, leading to excessive PTH production and hypercalcemia. Such mutations are associated with more aggressive parathyroid tumors, including carcinoma and atypical adenoma (Song2020Germline; Riccardi2019Analysis). The p.Tyr394Ser variant is notably prevalent among Ashkenazi Jewish populations with FIHP and sporadic PHPT, suggesting a significant ethnic association (Guan2017Ethnicity). These genetic insights highlight the critical role of GCM2 in maintaining calcium homeostasis and its potential impact on parathyroid-related disorders.

## Interactions
GCM2, a transcription factor involved in parathyroid development, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It has been shown to interact with the transcription factors Gata3 and MafB, forming a complex that synergistically activates the parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene expression. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of the PTH gene, as GCM2 and MafB bind to specific sites in the distal enhancer region of the PTH gene, known as ECR4, to stimulate transcription (Han2015Gata3).

GCM2 also interacts with SP1, a transcription factor that binds to the GC box in the PTH promoter. This interaction suggests that GCM2, along with Gata3 and MafB, may form a transcriptional complex with SP1, influencing PTH gene expression (Han2015Gata3).

The R110W mutation in the DNA-binding domain of GCM2 significantly reduces its DNA-binding ability, affecting its interaction with DNA but not its nuclear localization. This mutation is associated with isolated hypoparathyroidism, highlighting the importance of GCM2's DNA-binding function in its role as a transcription factor (Tomar2010Presence).
