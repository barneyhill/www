# SERPINA11

## Overview
SERPINA11 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family A member 11, which belongs to the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors. This protein is characterized by its role in regulating serine proteases and maintaining extracellular matrix homeostasis, crucial for tissue integrity and development. Structurally, SERPINA11 shares significant homology with other serpins, such as SERPINA1, and features a reactive center loop essential for its inhibitory function. The protein is primarily expressed in the liver, with lower levels in other tissues, indicating a specialized role in physiological processes. Mutations in SERPINA11 have been associated with a perinatal lethal disorder and have implications in tumor progression and extracellular matrix-related pathologies (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11; Badola2006Correlation).

## Structure
SERPINA11 is a protein predicted to have 422 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa. It shares 41% sequence homology with SERPINA1, another member of the serpin family, suggesting a similar structural framework (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11). The protein is predicted to contain a 19-residue N-terminal signal peptide, which targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating its role in the secretory pathway (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11). 

The tertiary structure of SERPINA11 is expected to resemble that of SERPINA1, characterized by a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, a common feature among serpins. This structure includes an exposed reactive center loop (RCL), formed by residues 366-397, which is crucial for its function as a protease inhibitor (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11). The RCL's flexibility allows it to interact with proteases, facilitating the unique inhibitory mechanism of serpins (HUNTINGTON2011Serpin).

Post-translational modifications of SERPINA11 include four predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, which may influence its stability and function (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11). A specific variant, c.672C>A;pTyr224*, results in a truncated protein lacking the RCL, leading to a complete loss of function (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11).

## Function
SERPINA11 is a member of the serpin superfamily, which primarily functions as serine protease inhibitors. This gene is hypothesized to play a crucial role in regulating serine proteases and maintaining extracellular matrix homeostasis. The SERPINA11 protein is predicted to have 422 amino acid residues and shares a 41% sequence homology with SERPINA1 (Alpha1 antitrypsin) (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11). It is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently to the extracellular matrix, where it is involved in protease inhibition, a function critical for maintaining tissue integrity and preventing damage (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11).

In healthy human cells, SERPINA11 exhibits a restricted expression pattern, with very high expression in the liver and significantly lower expression in other tissues such as the breast and prostate. This expression pattern suggests that SERPINA11's function is tightly regulated and may be crucial for specific physiological processes in these tissues (Badola2006Correlation). The protein's role in extracellular matrix homeostasis is particularly important during embryonic development, where it helps inhibit serine proteases involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINA11 gene have been linked to a novel serpinopathy characterized as a perinatal lethal disorder. This condition is associated with biallelic loss of function variants in SERPINA11, leading to significant disruptions in the extracellular matrix, particularly affecting fetal lung development. Affected fetuses exhibit abnormalities such as pericardial effusion and hydrops, with histopathological evaluations revealing extracellular matrix disruptions in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. The disorder is thought to result from uninhibited serine protease activity due to the loss of SERPINA11's protease inhibitory function, which is crucial for embryonic development (Aggarwal2024SERPINA11).

Alterations in SERPINA11 expression have also been implicated in tumor progression, particularly in diploid breast tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma. These changes may facilitate extracellular matrix reorganization, promoting tumor cell spread. A specific mutation, p.Gly368Arg, has been identified as potentially enhancing protein endohydrolysis at the extracellular matrix, contributing to the deterioration of its components. This mutation, along with other genetic factors, may play a role in the pathogenesis of anterior cruciate ligament non-contact injuries by affecting the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (Caso2016Wholeexome).
