# GP6

## Overview
The GP6 gene encodes glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a type I transmembrane receptor that is predominantly expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes. GPVI is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in platelet activation and aggregation, particularly in response to collagen exposure at sites of vascular injury. The protein is essential for the initial interaction with collagen, facilitating subsequent platelet adhesion and thrombus formation. GPVI functions by forming a complex with the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), triggering a signaling cascade that involves Src family kinases and phospholipase Cγ2. Beyond hemostasis, GPVI is implicated in non-hemostatic processes such as inflammation and tissue repair, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders (Kato2003The; Rayes2019Functional).

## Structure
The GP6 gene encodes glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a type I transmembrane protein crucial for platelet function. GPVI consists of 319 amino acids, including a 20-amino-acid signal sequence, and is organized into three main domains: the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic region (Martins2019From; ZAHID2012The). The extracellular domain features two immunoglobulin-like domains (D1 and D2), which are oriented at 90° and are crucial for binding to collagen. These domains are connected by a mucin-like Ser/Thr-rich region, providing structural flexibility (Martins2019From; ZAHID2012The).

The transmembrane domain of GPVI consists of 19 amino acids and includes a charged residue, Arg272, which forms a salt bridge with Asp11 of the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ) (ZAHID2012The). The cytoplasmic region contains 51 amino acids and includes a basic amino acid-rich region for calmodulin binding and a proline-rich domain for docking Src family tyrosine kinases, such as Fyn and Lyn (Martins2019From; ZAHID2012The).

GPVI forms a complex with the FcRγ-chain, essential for its signaling function, and appears on the platelet surface in an oligomeric form (Martins2019From). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which are crucial for its function (Nurden2019Clinical).

## Function
Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) is a platelet membrane receptor that plays a crucial role in platelet activation and aggregation, particularly in response to collagen exposure at sites of vascular injury. GPVI is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets (Rayes2019Functional). It functions by forming a complex with the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Upon activation, GPVI triggers a signaling cascade involving Src kinases and phospholipase Cγ2, leading to platelet activation (Rayes2019Functional).

GPVI is essential for the initial interaction with collagen, which is necessary for subsequent engagement of other collagen receptors, supporting platelet adhesion and aggregation at wound sites (Kato2003The). It also interacts with other ligands such as laminin, fibronectin, and fibrin, contributing to thrombus growth and stabilization (Rayes2019Functional; Alshehri2015Fibrin). The receptor is involved in non-hemostatic processes, including inflammation and tissue repair, and its shedding is thought to limit platelet activation in intact vessels (Rayes2019Functional). GPVI's role in these processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in thrombotic and inflammatory disorders (Rayes2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the GP6 gene, which encodes the platelet-specific collagen receptor glycoprotein VI, are associated with several clinical conditions. In Korean women, specific GP6 polymorphisms, such as rs1654410 T>C and rs1671153 T>G, have been linked to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), suggesting that genetic variations in GP6 may influence platelet function and contribute to this condition (Siddesh2014Plateletspecific; An2020Association). These polymorphisms are thought to increase platelet aggregation, which may lead to thromboembolic disorders and affect pregnancy outcomes (Siddesh2014Plateletspecific).

In Chilean families, a specific adenine insertion mutation in exon 6 of the GP6 gene results in a truncated GPVI protein, leading to a mild bleeding disorder characterized by impaired platelet aggregation in response to collagen (Matus2013An). This mutation causes a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in reduced GPVI expression and function (Matus2013An).

GP6 mutations have also been associated with sticky platelet syndrome (SPS) and arterial thrombosis, conditions that can lead to heart attacks and strokes due to the role of GP6 in platelet activation and aggregation (An2020Association).

## Interactions
Glycoprotein VI (GPVI), encoded by the GP6 gene, is a platelet receptor that interacts with several proteins to mediate platelet activation and aggregation. GPVI forms a complex with the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ), which is essential for its signaling function. This interaction involves a salt bridge between R272 in GPVI's transmembrane domain and a negatively charged aspartic acid in the FcRγ-chain (Martins2019From). Upon ligand binding, GPVI activates Src family kinases, specifically Fyn and Lyn, which phosphorylate the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the FcRγ-chain. This phosphorylation event recruits and activates Syk, leading to the formation of a signaling complex that includes adapter proteins like LAT and SLP-76, and effector molecules such as phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) (Bigalke2011Platelet; Nurden2019Clinical).

GPVI also interacts with integrin αIIbβ3, playing a role in outside-in signaling and platelet spreading (Mangin2018Immobilized). Additionally, GPVI's cytoplasmic domain binds to calmodulin, which is involved in intracellular signaling pathways (Nurden2019Clinical). These interactions are crucial for platelet adhesion, activation, and thrombus formation, highlighting GPVI's role in hemostasis and thrombosis.
