# QPRT

## Overview
The QPRT gene encodes the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a vital coenzyme involved in numerous cellular processes, including energy metabolism, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Youn2016Structural). As a transferase, this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of quinolinic acid and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate into nicotinic acid mononucleotide, a precursor in the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway (Youn2016Structural). The protein is predominantly found in a hexameric form, which is essential for its enzymatic stability and function (Youn2016Structural). QPRT's activity is crucial for maintaining quinolinic acid homeostasis, particularly in the brain, where its dysregulation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases due to the neurotoxic nature of quinolinic acid (Youn2016Structural). Additionally, QPRT has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and kidney disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yan2023A; Zhou2021Copy).

## Structure
The human quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) is a key enzyme in de novo NAD biosynthesis, existing primarily as a hexamer in its quaternary structure. This hexameric form is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and a critical N-terminal short helix, α1, which plays a significant role in maintaining the hexameric assembly (Youn2016Structural). The enzyme's monomer consists of 12 α-helices and 12 β-strands, forming two distinct structural domains: an N-terminal open-faced α/β-sandwich domain and a C-terminal open TIM α/β-barrel domain (Youn2016Structural).

The dimeric form of QPRT is characterized by a head-to-tail interaction, with active sites located at the interface between the α/β-barrel of one subunit and the β-sandwich of the other. The hexamer is formed by the trimerization of these dimers, a configuration that is common among eukaryotic QPRTs (Youn2016Structural). Conformational changes in loops L and O at the dimer-dimer interface are crucial for substrate binding and enzyme turnover, highlighting the dynamic nature of the enzyme's structure (Youn2016Structural). These structural features are essential for the enzyme's function and stability, particularly in the context of its role in NAD biosynthesis.

## Function
Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) is a key enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a crucial coenzyme involved in various cellular processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, genomic repair, chromatin modulation, and apoptosis (Youn2016Structural). QPRT catalyzes the conversion of quinolinic acid (QA) and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) into nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN), a precursor to NAD+ (Youn2016Structural). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining quinolinic acid homeostasis in the brain, as QA is a neurotoxin that can cause neuronal damage and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Youn2016Structural).

Structurally, QPRT exists as a hexamer in eukaryotes, including humans, and this hexameric form is crucial for its stability and function (Youn2016Structural). The enzyme's activity is regulated by conformational changes at the dimer-dimer interface, which are essential for its catalytic mechanism (Youn2016Structural). The N-terminal helix is critical for hexamer formation, and structural studies have shown that QPRT's hexameric form is necessary for cooperative reactant binding (Youn2016Structural). QPRT also inhibits active caspase-3, suppressing apoptosis, and has been identified as a potential target for anticancer drug development (Youn2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the QPRT gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of kidney health, QPRT is associated with susceptibility to solitary functioning kidney, a condition under congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The loss of QPRT affects cell-cycle progression and proliferation in human embryonic kidney cells, potentially increasing susceptibility to acute kidney injury by reducing renal NAD+ levels and increasing urinary quinolinate (Zhou2021Copy).

In neurodegenerative disorders, QPRT deficiency leads to the accumulation of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite, which is linked to conditions such as Huntington's disease. QPRT knockout mice exhibit increased neuronal degeneration in the striatum, associated with altered expression of kynurenine pathway enzymes and NMDA receptor subunits, suggesting a role in excitotoxic neurodegeneration (Fukuoka2012Quinolinate).

In cancer, particularly breast cancer, high QPRT expression is associated with poor prognosis, including worse survival outcomes and increased drug resistance. It is linked to the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Yan2023A; Liu2021Quinolinate).

## Interactions
Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function and potential role in disease processes. In the context of breast cancer, QPRT has been identified to interact with proteins such as PKLR, AMBP, and APOC3, which are part of its protein-protein interaction networks. These interactions suggest that QPRT may play a role in cancer progression and could be a target for therapeutic interventions (Yan2023A).

In neuronal differentiation, QPRT has been identified as an interaction partner of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) candidate gene neuroligin 3 (NLGN3). This interaction suggests a role for QPRT in postsynaptic density formation, which is crucial for synaptic function and neuronal communication (Haslinger2018Loss).

QPRT is also involved in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, which is linked to cancer progression and neurological disorders. Its interactions within this pathway influence tumor biology through NAD+ synthesis and tryptophan metabolites, impacting cell cycle regulation and potentially affecting cancer progression (Yan2023A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of QPRT in cellular metabolism and disease.
