# NAT8L

## Overview
The NAT8L gene encodes the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 8 like, which plays a crucial role in the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain. This enzyme is categorized as an acetyltransferase, responsible for catalyzing the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to L-aspartate, resulting in the production of NAA, a molecule integral to neuronal function and metabolism (Wiame2009Molecular; Ariyannur2010Methamphetamineinduced). The NAT8L protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in processes such as myelination and energy metabolism, with additional expression in adipose tissues influencing lipid turnover (Pessentheiner2013NAT8L). Its interactions with various proteins, including those involved in dopamine signaling and mitochondrial function, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes. Alterations in NAT8L expression or function have been linked to neurological and psychiatric conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Miyanishi2021Striatal; Toriumi2013Deletion).

## Structure
The NAT8L protein, encoded by the NAT8L gene, is involved in the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain. Its molecular structure has been studied using computational modeling techniques due to the lack of an experimental crystal structure. The active site of NAT8L is specifically designed for the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to aspartate, facilitated by the spatial arrangement within the binding pocket, which includes both α-helical and β-sheet segments (Ariyannur2010Methamphetamineinduced; Polyakov2020Structure).

The tertiary structure of NAT8L has been modeled to reveal the enzyme's active site and the mechanism of acetyl transfer during NAA formation. Specific residues, such as Arg220 and Glu101, play crucial roles in the catalytic activity by positioning the acetyl-CoA cofactor and forming a salt-bridge, respectively (Polyakov2020Structure). The protein is also suggested to have a membrane-anchoring region, with Arg133 interacting with lipid heads (Polyakov2020Structure).

NAT8L is present in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, as indicated by colocalization studies using MitoTracker Red CMXRos in SH-SY5Y cells (Ariyannur2010Methamphetamineinduced). The protein's localization and function are influenced by its structure, which is crucial for its role in acetyl-CoA metabolism.

## Function
The NAT8L gene encodes the enzyme aspartate N-acetyltransferase, which is responsible for the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in neurons. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-aspartate and acetyl-CoA into NAA, a process that is crucial for neuronal function and metabolism (Wiame2009Molecular; Ariyannur2010Methamphetamineinduced). NAA is one of the most concentrated organic molecules in the human brain and plays a significant role in brain energy metabolism and lipid synthesis (Ariyannur2010Methamphetamineinduced). 

NAT8L is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in myelination by providing acetate for acetyl-CoA synthesis, which is then used for fatty acid generation (Pessentheiner2013NAT8L). The enzyme is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, as it lacks a mitochondrial or signal peptide, indicating its cytosolic localization (Wiame2009Molecular). 

In addition to its role in the brain, NAT8L is also expressed in adipose tissues, particularly in brown adipocytes, where it influences lipid turnover and energy metabolism. Overexpression of NAT8L in these cells increases glucose incorporation into lipids, lipolysis, mitochondrial mass, and oxygen consumption, suggesting an accelerated lipid turnover and energy expenditure (Pessentheiner2013NAT8L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NAT8L gene have been linked to several neurological and psychological conditions. A notable mutation is a 19-bp deletion in the first exon of NAT8L, leading to hypoacetylaspartia, characterized by undetectable levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain. This condition results in symptoms such as developmental delay, seizures, and microcephaly (Wiame2009Molecular). 

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, NAT8L dysregulation is associated with a deficit in NAA production, as observed in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). This dysregulation is linked to decreased NAA and glutamate levels, suggesting a role in the disease's progression (Sen2019Generation).

NAT8L is also implicated in psychiatric disorders. Alterations in its expression are associated with increased sensitivity to social defeat stress, a model for studying depression. This is mediated through the Shati/Nat8l–BDNF pathway, which affects histone acetylation and BDNF signaling, potentially contributing to treatment-resistant depression (Miyanishi2021Striatal).

In methamphetamine dependence, deletion of NAT8L increases dopamine D1 receptor density, enhancing sensitivity to methamphetamine and affecting reward-related behaviors (Toriumi2013Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NAT8L in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
NAT8L, also known as N-acetyltransferase 8 like, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the adaptor protein (AP)-2 complex, which is crucial for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. NAT8L binds to three of the four components of the AP-2 complex, suggesting a role in receptor internalization and localization, particularly affecting the dopamine D1 receptor. This interaction is linked to the regulation of dopamine signaling and methamphetamine sensitivity (Toriumi2013Deletion).

NAT8L is also associated with tubulins, indicating a potential role in microtubule stabilization. However, the deletion of NAT8L does not lead to a decrease in dopamine D1 receptors, suggesting that microtubule destabilization does not necessarily result in GPCR down-regulation (Toriumi2013Deletion).

In the context of energy metabolism, NAT8L overexpression in brown adipocytes enhances mitochondrial function and energy expenditure, mediated by interactions with PPARα, a nuclear receptor involved in regulating gene expression related to energy metabolism (Pessentheiner2013NAT8L). These interactions highlight NAT8L's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including neurotransmitter regulation and energy metabolism.
