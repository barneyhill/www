# MED12

## Overview
The MED12 gene encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 12, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of the cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) module within the Mediator complex, which serves as a bridge between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II, facilitating transcriptional regulation. MED12 is characterized by its structural domains, including HEAT-repeat domains that enable extensive protein-protein interactions, crucial for its function in various signaling pathways such as Wnt, Notch, and Sonic hedgehog. These pathways are essential for cellular growth, differentiation, and development. MED12's role extends to the regulation of super-enhancers and neural stem cell identity, acting as both a coactivator and corepressor of gene transcription depending on the cellular context (Philibert2007Role; Kim2016Mediator; van2021MED12Related).

## Structure
The MED12 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcription regulation. Its molecular structure is characterized by several distinct regions and domains. The N-terminal region of MED12, known as Med12N, is essential for activating CDK8 kinase activity. This region adopts an extended conformation that interacts with CDK8 and CycC, stabilizing the T-loop and RHYT segment of CDK8, which is crucial for its activation (Chen2024Structural; Li2021Structure).

MED12 contains five HEAT-repeat domains (HEAT-I to V), which form a horseshoe-shaped solenoid structure, providing a large surface area for protein-protein interactions. These domains contribute to the structural scaffold of MED12, facilitating interactions with other components of the CKM, such as MED13 (Chen2024Structural; Li2021Structure).

The C-terminal region of MED12, Med12C, forms an α-helix that engages with the Kinase and Central-lobes, ultimately binding the MED13 PIWI domain (Chen2024Structural). MED12 also exhibits conformational heterogeneity, which is significant for its role within the CKM complex (Chen2024Structural). Disease-linked mutations in MED12 often localize near the T-loop and RHYT segment, affecting its interaction with CDK8 and CycC (Li2021Structure).

## Function
The MED12 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Mediator complex, which plays a vital role in the regulation of transcription in human cells. MED12 is part of the CDK8 module within the Mediator complex, which is essential for eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. This complex acts as a bridge between cell type-specific transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery, facilitating the interaction between gene-specific regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase II (Philibert2007Role; van2021MED12Related).

MED12 is involved in several cellular pathways, including the Wnt, Notch, and Sonic hedgehog pathways, which are crucial for cellular growth, differentiation, and development (Philibert2007Role; Donnio2017MED12related). It interacts with β-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway to regulate transcription expression from targeted genes (Philibert2007Role). MED12 also plays a significant role in the regulation of super-enhancers, which are clusters of enhancers that drive high levels of gene expression, and is involved in the physical and functional interaction between enhancers and promoters (van2021MED12Related).

In neural stem cells, MED12 is crucial for maintaining cell identity by regulating gene expression programs related to cell adhesion and the cell cycle (Kim2016Mediator). It acts as both a coactivator and corepressor of gene transcription, depending on the context, and is involved in balancing neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (Kim2016Mediator).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED12 gene are associated with a range of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome (FG syndrome) and Lujan-Fryns syndrome are both linked to MED12 mutations, which can lead to intellectual disabilities and distinct physical features (Ding2008Mediator; Srivastava2020Insights). In males, these mutations often result in X-linked mental retardation, characterized by symptoms such as macrocephaly and hypotonia (Srivastava2020Insights). In females, de novo missense and protein truncating variants in MED12 have been associated with a spectrum of conditions, including intellectual disability and Hardikar syndrome, which involves facial clefting and other anomalies (van2021MED12Related).

MED12 mutations are also implicated in the development of uterine leiomyomas, benign tumors of the uterus. These mutations, particularly in exon 2, disrupt the binding of MED12 to the CCNC-CDK8 complex, promoting tumor growth through pathways like Wnt and mTOR (Srivastava2020Insights; McGuire2012Whole). In breast fibroepithelial tumors, similar mutations affect estrogen signaling, contributing to tumorigenesis (Srivastava2020Insights). The gene's involvement in various signaling pathways underscores its role in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
MED12 is a key component of the Mediator complex, primarily interacting with the CDK8 kinase module. It plays a crucial role in activating CDK8 kinase activity by making extensive contacts with CDK8, while having minimal interaction with Cyclin C. MED12's interaction with CDK8 involves several specific sites, including residues that wrap around CDK8 and contact its T-loop, which is essential for activation (Klatt2020A). The interaction does not require phosphorylation of the T-loop, as MED12 binding functionally replaces this common activation mechanism (Klatt2020A).

MED12 also participates in transcriptional repression by forming a trimeric complex with REST and G9a, stabilizing the interaction necessary for the repression of neuronal gene expression in nonneuronal cells (Borggrefe2011Interactions). Additionally, MED12 interacts with various transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes, influencing gene expression through its involvement in the Mediator complex (Borggrefe2011Interactions).

In yeast, MED12 (Srb8) interacts with other Mediator subunits such as Med11, Med17, Med18, Med20, Med21, and Med22, as shown by pair-wise two-hybrid analysis (Guglielmi2004A). These interactions highlight MED12's role in the structural and functional integrity of the Mediator complex.
