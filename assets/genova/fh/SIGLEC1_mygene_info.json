the immunoglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein is a lectin-like adhesion molecule that binds glycoconjugate ligands on cell surfaces in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It is a type I transmembrane protein expressed only by a subpopulation of macrophages and is involved in mediating cell-cell interactions. The protein plays an important role in multiple human diseases and bacterial and viral infections has been shown to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection.
