# ZCCHC7

## Overview
ZCCHC7 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 7 protein, which is a nucleolar protein involved in RNA processing and degradation. This protein is a component of a human TRAMP-like complex, playing a crucial role in the maturation and degradation of various RNA substrates, including rRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs. ZCCHC7 interacts with key components of the nuclear exosome, such as the exonuclease RRP6, to facilitate RNA turnover and maintain nucleolar homeostasis. The protein's function is essential for proper rRNA biogenesis and the degradation of aberrant RNA molecules. Clinically, ZCCHC7 has been associated with several diseases, including thyroid carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where its expression levels and interactions may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets (Yin2023Differential; Wang2021The; AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide).

## Function
ZCCHC7 is a nucleolar protein involved in RNA processing and degradation in healthy human cells. It is identified as the putative human ortholog of yeast Air1 and Air2 proteins, which are part of the TRAMP complex involved in RNA degradation by the exosome. In humans, ZCCHC7 co-purifies with the nucleolar fraction of MTR4 and the exonuclease RRP6, a catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome, indicating its role in RNA processing and degradation (AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide). ZCCHC7 forms a TRAMP-like complex with PAP-associated domain-containing protein 5 (PAPD5) and RNA helicase hMTR4/DOB1/SKIV2L2, which is involved in recognizing and polyadenylating abnormal coding and noncoding RNAs. This complex functions as a cofactor of nuclear exosomes to promote RNA degradation, particularly in the nucleolus (Wang2021The).

ZCCHC7 plays a crucial role in rRNA biogenesis, as its loss of function leads to the accumulation of by-products from 47S pre-rRNA processing. It is involved in the maturation of noncoding RNA substrates, such as rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) (AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide). The protein is also implicated in the 3ʹ-end adenylation of abortive RNA polymerase I transcripts, marking them for degradation by the nuclear exosome (Wang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
ZCCHC7 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA metabolism and its interactions within cellular processes. In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), ZCCHC7 is differentially expressed, with higher levels observed in THCA patients compared to normal controls. This altered expression is associated with tumor immunity, as ZCCHC7 shows positive correlations with immune cells such as B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells, while being negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells. The diagnostic efficiency of ZCCHC7 in THCA is highlighted by an AUC value of 0.78, indicating its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Yin2023Differential).

Beyond thyroid carcinoma, ZCCHC7 is also involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where it is disrupted by sequences 3ʹ of FRG1B and LOC1499503, suggesting its role as a genetic target in this condition (Wang2021The). The gene's involvement in RNA degradation processes, particularly through its interaction with the nuclear exosome, further underscores its potential implications in diseases related to RNA metabolism dysregulation (Wang2021The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZCCHC7 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ZCCHC7 is a nucleolar protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing and degradation through its interactions with various proteins and complexes. It is a component of a human TRAMP-like complex, interacting with PAP-associated domain-containing proteins 5 (PAPD5) and 7 (PAPD7), which are human orthologs of yeast TRF4-2 and TRF4-1, respectively. These interactions are mediated by the four ZCCHC domains of ZCCHC7, which facilitate its role in rRNA biogenesis (AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide).

ZCCHC7 also interacts with the nuclear exosome complex, particularly with the catalytic subunit RRP6. This interaction is crucial for the turnover of 5' ETS-derived fragments from pre-rRNA, contributing to nucleolar homeostasis. RRP6 is essential for maintaining the interaction between ZCCHC7, PAPD5, and the exosome, while MTR4 is not required for this assembly (Sudo2016Interaction).

In the context of B cell lymphomas, ZCCHC7 is involved in genomic alterations and interacts with PAX5, a transcription factor. Mutations in PAX5 can enhance its interaction with ZCCHC7, potentially affecting ribosomal RNA processing (LeemanNeill2023Noncoding).
