# OLFML1

## Overview
OLFML1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactomedin like 1, a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the olfactomedin protein family. This protein is characterized by its olfactomedin (OLF) domain, which is involved in various biological processes, including neurogenesis, cell adhesion, and signaling. OLFML1 is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the small intestine, liver, lung, heart, and spleen, and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and the regulation of the cell cycle. It is particularly significant in osteoblasts, where it modulates the Hippo signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. This regulation is essential for maintaining bone homeostasis and preventing excessive mineralization. Additionally, OLFML1 is implicated in clinical conditions such as congenital scoliosis due to its role in bone development and differentiation (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike; Wan2008hOLFML1).

## Structure
The OLFML1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein characterized by a significant signal peptide at its N-terminus and a large olfactomedin (OLF) domain at the C-terminus (Wan2008hOLFML1). The primary structure of OLFML1 includes an open reading frame of 1209 nucleotides, encoding a protein with homologues across various species, indicating a high degree of conservation (Wan2008hOLFML1). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, specifically N-glycosylation, which is confirmed by the presence of three potential N-glycosylation sites (Wan2008hOLFML1). This glycosylation is essential for its secretion and function, as demonstrated by the reduction in protein size upon treatment with the deglycosylating enzyme PNGase F (Wan2008hOLFML1).

The OLF domain is a characteristic feature of the olfactomedin protein family, which is involved in various biological functions such as neurogenesis and cell adhesion (Wan2008hOLFML1). The protein's localization to the Golgi apparatus and its secretion dynamics suggest a role in cell signaling and proliferation (Wan2008hOLFML1). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
OLFML1 (olfactomedin like 1) is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in cell proliferation and the regulation of the cell cycle. It is highly expressed in tissues such as the small intestine, liver, lung, heart, and spleen, with weaker expression in other tissues like the placenta and kidney (Wan2008hOLFML1). The protein is involved in promoting cell cycle progression, as evidenced by its ability to increase the S-phase population and decrease the G0/G1 phase population in HeLa cells, indicating its role in enhancing cellular proliferation (Wan2008hOLFML1).

In osteoblasts, OLFML1 is involved in the regulation of mineralization and the Hippo signaling pathway. It acts as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization by modulating the levels of the YAP transcriptional coactivator, a component of the Hippo pathway (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike). This regulation is crucial for maintaining bone homeostasis and preventing excessive mineralization, which is important for normal bone development and function (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike).

The protein is secreted into the extracellular space, where it likely interacts with the extracellular matrix, influencing cell communication and tissue organization (Wan2008hOLFML1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the OLFML1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. A de novo missense mutation in OLFML1 has been associated with congenital scoliosis (CS), a condition characterized by a lateral curvature of the spine due to vertebral anomalies. This mutation is linked to impaired osteoblast differentiation and abnormal bone development, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of CS (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike). The gene is prominently expressed in osteoblasts, and its knockdown leads to the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting osteoblast mineralization. Conversely, gain of function retains YAP in the cytoplasm, inhibiting mineralization, indicating that OLFML1 regulates mineralization in osteoblasts (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike).

OLFML1 is also associated with genetic risk for abnormal bone development, although detailed mechanisms are not fully elaborated (CárdenasLeón2022Matricellular). In the nervous system, OLFML1 is expressed in developing and adult neuronal tissues, including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, and hippocampus. It may play a role in regulating neural crest cell production and normal responses to olfactory stimuli, although specific diseases related to these functions are not detailed (Dammalli2017Proteomic).

## Interactions
OLFML1, a member of the olfactomedin protein family, participates in significant interactions within cellular processes, particularly in osteoblasts. It is known to inhibit the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell growth and apoptosis. OLFML1 affects the localization of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Hippo pathway. Specifically, OLFML1 retains YAP in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting the Hippo signaling pathway and controlling osteoblast mineralization (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike). This interaction suggests an inhibitory relationship between OLFML1 and YAP, which is essential for preventing excessive mineralization in osteoblasts.

The study also demonstrated that silencing OLFML1 using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in osteoblasts led to increased expression of Ctgf, a target gene of the Hippo signaling pathway, and resulted in the accumulation of YAP in the nucleus. This indicates that OLFML1 acts as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation by modulating YAP levels during mineralization (Murakami2018Olfactomedinlike). These interactions highlight the role of OLFML1 in cellular signaling and its potential implications in bone development and related disorders.
