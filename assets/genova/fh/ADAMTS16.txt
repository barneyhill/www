# ADAMTS16

## Overview
ADAMTS16 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 16, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family of extracellular metalloproteinases. This protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, including thrombospondin type 1 repeats and a PLAC domain, and is part of the metzincin superfamily, known for its zinc-dependent proteolytic activity (schnellmann2017characterization; Takeda2016ADAM). ADAMTS16 plays a crucial role in the degradation and reorganization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), influencing processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression (schnellmann2017characterization). It is particularly significant in renal and gonadal development, blood pressure regulation, and cardiac fibrosis, where it interacts with key proteins like fibronectin and TGF-β (Yao2019ADAMTS16; Joe2009Positional). The gene's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions such as hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy (Yao2019ADAMTS16; Mougin2021ADAMTS).

## Structure
ADAMTS16 is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. It contains five thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR1) and a PLAC domain at its C-terminus (schnellmann2017characterization). The protein undergoes C-terminal processing, likely within the trans-Golgi network or extracellularly, and can oligomerize, a process not dependent on its enzymatic activity (schnellmann2017characterization). The oligomerization involves constructs lacking the C-terminal TSR1 and PLAC domains, indicating these domains are not essential for oligomer formation (schnellmann2017characterization).

ADAMTS16 is part of the metzincin superfamily, which includes a conserved active site sequence crucial for zinc ion coordination, a characteristic feature of these metalloproteinases (Takeda2016ADAM). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, typical of M12B proteinases, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ADAMTS16 are not provided (Takeda2016ADAM). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common in the ADAMTS family (Zeng2006Glycosaminoglycanbinding). The specific molecular mechanisms and substrates of ADAMTS16 remain largely unclear, despite its known associations with various physiological and pathological processes (schnellmann2017characterization).

## Function
ADAMTS16 is a member of the ADAMTS family of extracellular metalloproteinases, which are involved in the degradation and reorganization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This protein plays significant roles in processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression (schnellmann2017characterization). In healthy human cells, ADAMTS16 is implicated in renal and gonadal development, blood pressure regulation, and ECM remodeling. It is highly expressed in embryonal and adolescent kidney tissues, suggesting a role in organ development (schnellmann2017characterization). ADAMTS16 influences cell behavior, particularly in cell migration and filopodia formation, by degrading fibronectin (FN), which may prevent FN-integrin binding and inhibit filopodia development (schnellmann2017characterization).

ADAMTS16 is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure, with variants of the gene being associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in humans (Joe2009Positional). It is expressed in the kidney, a key organ in blood pressure homeostasis, and likely functions as a metalloproteinase (Joe2009Positional). The protein's role in ECM interactions and its influence on other proteinases, such as MMP3, suggest it may regulate ECM composition and impact various physiological processes (schnellmann2017characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ADAMTS16 has been implicated in several pathological conditions due to its role in tissue remodeling and cell signaling. In the context of cardiac health, ADAMTS16 is significantly upregulated in mouse models of pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, where it acts as a novel regulator of cardiac fibroblast activation and TGF-β signaling. This upregulation is associated with increased cardiac fibrosis, as ADAMTS16 promotes the conversion of latent TGF-β to its active form, exacerbating cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (Yao2019ADAMTS16). The RRFR motif of ADAMTS16 is critical for its interaction with TGF-β, and a tetrapeptide derived from this motif can exacerbate cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy (Yao2019ADAMTS16).

In vascular health, ADAMTS16 has been linked to thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and hypertension. Upregulation of ADAMTS16 in TAA tissues suggests its involvement in the progression of these aneurysms. A genetic rat model with an Adamts16 defect showed a connection between Adamts16 and blood pressure regulation, with mutant rats exhibiting lower blood pressure and reduced arterial stiffness (Mougin2021ADAMTS). These findings indicate that ADAMTS16 may play a significant role in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
ADAMTS16 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in extracellular matrix remodeling and cardiac fibrosis. It is known to activate latent TGF-β by interacting with the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β through a specific RRFR motif. This interaction is crucial for the activation of TGF-β, which promotes cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy (Yao2019ADAMTS16). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between ADAMTS16 and LAP-TGF-β, highlighting the importance of the RRFR motif in this process (Yao2019ADAMTS16).

ADAMTS16 also interacts with fibronectin (FN), a key extracellular matrix protein. It degrades FN, which affects filopodia formation and cell migration by preventing FN-integrin interactions (schnellmann2017characterization). This degradation likely influences cell adhesion and migration, as observed in various cell lines (schnellmann2017characterization).

Additionally, ADAMTS16 has been shown to interact with other matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP14 and MMP3. While it does not significantly affect MMP14 activity, it may influence MMP3 expression and processing, suggesting a complex role in ECM remodeling and proteinase regulation (schnellmann2017characterization).
