# F13A1

## Overview
The F13A1 gene encodes the A subunit of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII-A), a crucial enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade. FXIII-A is a transglutaminase that plays a vital role in stabilizing blood clots by cross-linking fibrin molecules, thereby enhancing clot strength and resistance to fibrinolysis (Muszbek2011Factor; Cai2020A). The gene is expressed in various cell types, including those of bone marrow and mesenchymal origin, and is involved in processes beyond coagulation, such as wound healing and tissue repair (Muszbek2011Factor; Mitchell2019Let’s). Structurally, FXIII-A is characterized by a complex arrangement of domains, including a catalytic core and β-barrel domains, which facilitate its enzymatic activity (Muszbek2011Factor; Yee1994Threedimensional). Clinically, mutations in F13A1 can lead to Factor XIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder, and have been implicated in metabolic dysfunctions related to obesity (Peyvandi2003Phenotypegenotype; Kaartinen2020Transglutaminases).

## Structure
The F13A1 gene encodes the A subunit of coagulation factor XIII, a transglutaminase involved in blood clot stabilization. The primary structure of the FXIII-A subunit consists of 732 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 83 kDa (Grundmann1986Characterization; Muszbek2011Factor). The mature protein begins with an acetylated serine residue (Muszbek2011Factor).

The secondary structure includes a mix of alpha helices and beta sheets, organized into four main domains: the β-sandwich, catalytic core, β-barrel 1, and β-barrel 2 (Hayashi2015Blood; Yee1994Threedimensional). The β-sandwich domain is composed of two four-stranded antiparallel sheets, while the catalytic core contains a catalytic triad (Cys314, His373, Asp396) similar to cysteine proteases (Muszbek2011Factor; Yee1994Threedimensional). The β-barrel domains have a '3+4' sheet structure, akin to the fibronectin III fold (Yee1994Threedimensional).

In its quaternary structure, FXIII-A forms a dimer in tissues and a heterotetramer with two B subunits in plasma (Muszbek2011Factor; Yee1994Threedimensional). The B subunits stabilize the A subunits and prolong their lifespan in plasma (Hayashi2015Blood). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are typical for proteins of this family.

## Function
The F13A1 gene encodes the A subunit of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII-A), a transglutaminase enzyme crucial for stabilizing blood clots. In plasma, FXIII circulates as a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic A subunits and two carrier B subunits (FXIII-A2B2). Upon activation by thrombin and calcium ions, the B subunits dissociate, and the A subunits become active, catalyzing the cross-linking of fibrin molecules. This process enhances the mechanical strength and stability of the fibrin clot, protecting it from shear stress and degradation by the fibrinolytic system (Muszbek2011Factor; Cai2020A).

FXIII-A is also involved in various cellular functions, including wound healing and tissue repair. It is expressed in cells of bone marrow and mesenchymal lineage, such as monocytes/macrophages and osteoblasts, where it participates in receptor-mediated phagocytosis and proangiogenic processes. These activities are essential for tissue repair and wound healing, as FXIII-A enhances endothelial cell migration and proliferation while suppressing apoptosis (Muszbek2011Factor; Mitchell2019Let’s).

In platelets, FXIII-A is concentrated in the cytoplasm and translocates to the surface upon activation, playing a role in protein cross-linking during platelet activation and clot retraction (Muszbek2011Factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F13A1 gene, which encodes the A subunit of coagulation factor XIII, are primarily associated with Factor XIII deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by severe bleeding symptoms, including intracranial hemorrhage, umbilical cord bleeding, and impaired wound healing (Peyvandi2003Phenotypegenotype; Mikkola1996Four). The disorder results from various mutations, such as missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, which lead to the absence or dysfunction of the FXIII A subunit, impairing blood clot stabilization (Mikkola1996Four; Vysokovsky2004Seven).

In addition to bleeding disorders, alterations in F13A1 expression have been linked to obesity-related conditions. The gene is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue, contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions (Kaartinen2020Transglutaminases). F13A1's role in adipose tissue involves interactions with immune pathways, suggesting its involvement in maintaining a pro-inflammatory environment, which may exacerbate obesity-related health issues (Kaartinen2020Transglutaminases).

Overall, mutations and altered expression of F13A1 have significant clinical implications, affecting both hemostatic processes and metabolic health.

## Interactions
The F13A1 gene encodes the A subunit of coagulation factor XIII (FXIII-A), which participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in coagulation and cellular processes. FXIII-A forms a tetrameric complex with two A subunits and two B subunits, with the B subunits acting as carriers and inhibitors (Muszbek2011Factor). Upon activation by thrombin and calcium ions, FXIII-A cross-links fibrin chains, stabilizing the clot and protecting it from fibrinolysis by linking α2-antiplasmin to fibrin (Muszbek2011Factor; Mitchell2019Let’s).

FXIII-A interacts with various proteins involved in platelet function, including actin, myosin, vinculin, and filamin, facilitating cytoskeletal rearrangements during platelet activation (Muszbek2011Factor; Mitchell2019Let’s). It also associates with heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in platelets (Muszbek2011Factor). In angiogenesis, FXIII-A binds to the αvβ3 integrin receptor, enhancing interactions with VEGFR-2 and promoting cell survival and proliferation (Muszbek2011Factor).

FXIII-A's interactions extend to the fibrinolytic system, where it cross-links plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) to fibrin, modulating fibrinolysis (Muszbek2011Factor). These interactions highlight FXIII-A's multifaceted role in coagulation, wound healing, and cellular functions.
