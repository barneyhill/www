# KRTAP20-3

## Overview
KRTAP20-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 20-3, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is characterized by their high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of keratinized tissues. The expression of KRTAP20-3 is primarily observed in hair follicles, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments to provide structural support and stability (Qiu2020aarFDC).
