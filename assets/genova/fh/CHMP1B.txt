# CHMP1B

## Overview
CHMP1B is a gene that encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 1B, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III). This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, membrane remodeling, and cytokinesis. As a member of the ESCRT-III complex, CHMP1B plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the sorting of receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), directing them towards lysosomal degradation or recycling pathways (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B). The protein's structure is characterized by multiple α-helices, with specific domains facilitating interactions with other proteins, such as spastin and IST1, which are essential for its function in cellular division and nucleic acid stabilization (Yang2008Structural; Talledge2018The). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, regulate CHMP1B's activity, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B).

## Structure
CHMP1B is a protein that is part of the ESCRT-III complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting and membrane scission processes. The primary structure of CHMP1B consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the CHMP1B gene. Its secondary structure includes six predicted α-helices (α1-6), with the N-terminal domain (α1-5) being conserved among CHMP proteins, and the C-terminal α6 containing a MIT-interacting motif (MIM1) (Maemoto2011Calpain7).

The tertiary structure of CHMP1B involves the folding of these helices, with the C-terminal helix fitting into a groove between helices α1 and α3 of the spastin MIT domain, forming hydrophobic and polar interactions (Yang2008Structural). The quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form complexes with other proteins, such as spastin and IST1, indicating its role in multimeric assemblies (Maemoto2011Calpain7; Yang2008Structural).

CHMP1B undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination at lysine residues K87 and K90, which are crucial for its function in multivesicular body biogenesis and receptor sorting (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B). These modifications regulate its transition between inactive and active conformations (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B).

## Function
CHMP1B is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which is essential for various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting and membrane remodeling. In healthy human cells, CHMP1B plays a critical role in cytokinesis by recruiting the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin to the midbody, a structure that forms during the final stages of cell division. This interaction is crucial for the proper execution of cytokinesis, as spastin facilitates the severing of microtubules, enabling the final separation of daughter cells (Yang2008Structural).

CHMP1B is also involved in the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the sorting of receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), directing them to lysosomal degradation or recycling pathways. This function is regulated by ubiquitination, which serves as a checkpoint for CHMP1B's polymerization at endosomes, influencing its transition from an inactive to an active conformation (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B).

Additionally, CHMP1B can form copolymers with IST1, encapsulating and protecting nucleic acid oligomers, which suggests a role in nucleic acid binding and stabilization (Talledge2018The). These activities highlight CHMP1B's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell signaling pathways.

## Interactions
CHMP1B interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with IST1, another ESCRT-III protein, to assemble around nucleic acids. This interaction is facilitated by the C-terminal MIM1 helix of CHMP1B, which is essential for copolymerization with IST1. The resulting IST1-CHMP1B filaments enwrap and protect nucleic acids from nucleases, with nucleic acids like dsDNA, ssDNA, and ssRNA stimulating the copolymer formation (Talledge2018The).

CHMP1B also interacts with calpain-7, an atypical calpain, at its second α-helical region. This interaction is enhanced by IST1, suggesting that IST1 may induce a conformational change in CHMP1B, exposing the calpain-7 binding site (Maemoto2011Calpain7).

In cytokinesis, CHMP1B recruits the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin to the midbody. This interaction involves the C-terminal tail of CHMP1B and the MIT domain of spastin, characterized by a large structural interface and specific hydrogen bonding (Yang2008Structural).

CHMP1B also interacts with USP8 through its α-helices 4, 5, and 6, forming part of a protein complex involved in endocytosis (Crespo-Yàñez2018CHMP1B). Additionally, CHMP1B has been shown to interact with AMSH, a protein involved in endosomal sorting, as well as other proteins like VPS4A and TRAF4AF1, indicating a broad interaction profile (Tsang2006A).
