# HSPA14

## Overview
HSPA14 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 14, also known as HSP70L1. This protein is a member of the Hsp70 family, which is known for its role as a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, assembly, and degradation. Unlike other Hsp70 proteins, HSPA14 exhibits unique structural features, such as an incomplete ATP-binding domain and a divergent substrate-binding domain, which suggest specialized functions within the cell (Brocchieri2008hsp70). HSPA14 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it forms part of the mammalian Ribosome Associated Complex (mRAC), assisting in the interaction with nascent polypeptide chains and playing a significant role in stress-mediated translational control (Meller2019Fluorescent). The protein's interaction with ribosomes is enhanced under stress conditions, such as heat shock, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses (Meller2019Fluorescent). Additionally, HSPA14 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in the context of metastasis and transformation activities, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Wu2011Induction).

## Structure
HSPA14, a member of the Hsp70 family, exhibits a unique structural profile. The primary structure of HSPA14 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional domains. The secondary structure of HSPA14 is composed of 34.78% α helix, 24.90% extended strand, 5.14% β turn, and 35.18% random coil, indicating a diverse array of structural elements (Chen2024GenomeWide).

HSPA14 is characterized by an ATP-binding domain (ABD), which is a common feature among Hsp70 proteins, although it is noted to be incomplete in the HSPA14-b isoform (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The substrate-binding domain (SBD) is partially or completely lost in HSPA14, suggesting a divergence in function compared to other Hsp70 proteins (Brocchieri2008hsp70). 

HSPA14 lacks the TPR1 domain-binding motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions in other Hsp70 family members, indicating a potential difference in its interaction capabilities within the human interactome (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The protein also forms dimers, particularly under stress conditions such as heat shock, which may influence its association with ribosomes (Meller2019Fluorescent). 

Splice variant isoforms of HSPA14 include HSPA14-a, with 14 splice sites, and HSPA14-b, with 4 splice sites within the coding region and one in the 3' UTR (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

## Function
HSPA14, also known as HSP70L1, is a member of the Hsp70 family of heat shock proteins, which function as molecular chaperones involved in protein folding, assembly, and degradation. In healthy human cells, HSPA14 is part of the mammalian Ribosome Associated Complex (mRAC), a ribosome-specific co-chaperone system that assists general cytosolic Hsp70s in interacting with nascent polypeptide chains. This interaction is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions (Meller2019Fluorescent).

HSPA14 is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in stress-mediated translational control by modulating its interaction with ribosomes. Under heat shock conditions, HSPA14's association with ribosomes increases, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that enhances its function during cellular stress (Meller2019Fluorescent). This increased association is hypothesized to result from an enhanced tendency of HSPA14 to form dimers during heat shock, which may facilitate its role in protein folding and stress response (Meller2019Fluorescent).

HSPA14 is also involved in the ubiquitin system and protein-degradation pathways, although its specific functions in these processes are not fully detailed (Brocchieri2008hsp70). Its unique sequence divergence in the substrate-binding domain suggests it may have evolved functions distinct from the classic peptide-recognition mechanism typical of other Hsp70 proteins (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

## Clinical Significance
HSPA14, a member of the Hsp70 family, has been implicated in cancer progression due to its altered expression levels. Overexpression of HSPA14, induced by NBS1 overexpression, has been associated with increased metastatic and transformation activities in vitro. This is particularly evident in lung cancer cells, where HSPA14 contributes to enhanced migration and invasion capabilities. The study by Wu et al. suggests that HSPA14, along with HSPA4, plays a significant role in the NBS1-induced metastatic processes, highlighting a novel NBS1-HSF4b-HSPA4/HSPA14 axis that may be crucial in cancer metastasis and transformation activities (Wu2011Induction).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), genetic alterations in the HSPA family, including HSPA14, have been explored for their potential association with the disease. Although the specific impact of HSPA14 mutations in HNSCC is not detailed, the study by Laksita et al. underscores the importance of the HSPA family in cancer, suggesting that targeting these genes could have therapeutic potential (Laksita2021Genetic). These findings indicate that changes in HSPA14 expression or function may contribute to cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
HSPA14, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It has been shown to physically interact with HspBP1, a protein known to interfere with HIV transcription. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation assays in HIV-infected cells, where HSPA14 was pulled down with HspBP1 antibodies, indicating a direct physical interaction (Bi2023Expression).

HSPA14 also plays a role in ribosome interactions, particularly under stress conditions such as heat shock. It is a subunit of the mammalian Ribosome Associated Complex (mRAC) and has been observed to increase its association with polysomes following heat shock. This increased association is linked to HSPA14's tendency to form dimers, a process that is not mediated by RNA, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction (Meller2019Fluorescent).

In the context of cancer, HSPA14 is implicated in the metastatic and transformation activities induced by NBS1 overexpression. It is involved in a complex with MPP11, which suggests potential interactions with ribosomal components, although specific details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Wu2011Induction).
