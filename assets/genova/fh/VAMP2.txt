# VAMP2

## Overview
VAMP2, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, is a gene that encodes a crucial component of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) complex, which is integral to synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in neurons. The protein product of VAMP2, also known as synaptobrevin-2, is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane, facilitating efficient synaptic transmission. VAMP2 interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, to form a complex that is essential for the precise and regulated release of neurotransmitters. This protein is predominantly active in the presynaptic terminal of neurons, contributing to rapid and efficient neuronal communication. Mutations in the VAMP2 gene can lead to neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal synaptic activity and neurodevelopment (Salpietro2019Mutations; Simmons2020Overcoming).

## Structure
VAMP2, also known as synaptobrevin-2, is a membrane protein integral to the SNARE complex, which is essential for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. The primary structure of VAMP2 consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa (Luchini2022Dark). Its secondary structure includes both alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with the transmembrane domain (TMD) expected to be a single-pass alpha-helix. The presence of beta-sheet structures is influenced by the protein-lipid ratio and the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids (FezouaBoubegtiten2019The; Luchini2022Dark).

The tertiary structure of VAMP2 is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its function in the SNARE complex. This domain allows VAMP2 to interact with other SNARE proteins, forming a stable four-helix bundle necessary for membrane fusion (Wang2020Different). VAMP2's quaternary structure involves its interaction with syntaxin-1 and SNAP25, facilitating the assembly of the SNARE complex (Wang2020Different).

VAMP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may play a role in its function and regulation (Lakomek2019Structural). The protein's structure and function are highly sensitive to its lipid environment, with cholesterol and negatively charged phospholipids significantly influencing its conformation and membrane association (FezouaBoubegtiten2019The; Wang2020Different).

## Function
VAMP2, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, is a critical component of the SNARE complex, which is essential for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release in neurons. This protein facilitates the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane, a process crucial for efficient synaptic transmission and communication between neurons (Salpietro2019Mutations; Simmons2020Overcoming). VAMP2 interacts with other SNARE proteins, such as SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1, to form a complex that mediates the precise and regulated release of neurotransmitters (Simmons2020Overcoming).

In addition to its role in neurotransmitter release, VAMP2 is involved in the fast endocytosis of neuronal membranes, which replenishes synaptic vesicles for subsequent rounds of exocytosis (Simmons2020Overcoming). This protein is primarily active in the presynaptic terminal of neurons, where it contributes to the rapid and efficient communication between nerve cells (Salpietro2019Mutations).

Mutations in the VAMP2 gene can disrupt these processes, leading to neurological disorders characterized by symptoms such as developmental delays and cognitive impairments (Simmons2020Overcoming). The gene's expression is notably high in brain regions associated with motor and cognitive functions, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal synaptic activity and neurodevelopment (Salpietro2019Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VAMP2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder features. Patients often present with early onset hypotonia, speech delay, microcephaly, and behavioral abnormalities (Bogue2023VAMP2). Seizures are common, with generalized-onset seizures such as tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures being frequently reported (Cali2022Epileptic). 

VAMP2 mutations, particularly those affecting the SNARE motif, can impair synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release, leading to severe neurological symptoms (Tang2020SNAREs). Missense variants within the SNARE domain often result in a more severe phenotype due to a dominant-negative effect, while loss-of-function variants tend to result in milder phenotypes (Bogue2023VAMP2). 

Alterations in VAMP2 expression have been linked to various neurological diseases, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. Reduced expression of VAMP2 has been observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients, correlating with cognitive dysfunction (Felício2023Noncoding; Vallortigara2016Decreased). These findings highlight the critical role of VAMP2 in maintaining normal synaptic function and its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) is a crucial component of the SNARE complex, interacting with several proteins to facilitate synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. VAMP2 forms a stable complex with synaptophysin, a protein found in synaptic vesicles, which is significant for neurotransmitter release. This interaction involves the N-terminal segment of VAMP2 and is essential for the vesicle docking and fusion process (White2021Room; Washbourne1995Vesicleassociated).

VAMP2 also interacts with syntaxin and SNAP-25 to form the core SNARE complex necessary for calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release. This complex is vital for the exocytotic machinery in neurons (White2021Room). Additionally, VAMP2 can bind with SNAP23 and syntaxin-4, although SNAP23 does not enhance VAMP2's binding to syntaxin-4 as SNAP25 does (Foster1998Binary).

Electrostatic interactions between VAMP2 and acidic phospholipids play a significant role in vesicle fusion. The juxtamembrane domain of VAMP2 associates with acidic phospholipid head groups, which is crucial for its function in membrane fusion (Williams2009Evidence). These interactions are modulated by factors such as salt concentration and the presence of specific lipids (Williams2009Evidence).
