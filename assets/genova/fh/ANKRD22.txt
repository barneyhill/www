# ANKRD22

## Overview
ANKRD22 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 22 protein, which is characterized by its ankyrin repeat motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. The protein is a monotopic membrane protein that localizes to lipid droplets (LDs) within cells, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism and storage. Its structure includes a hydrophobic 'hairpin' motif and is subject to post-translational modifications such as N-myristoylation, which aids in its intracellular targeting. ANKRD22 is implicated in various cellular processes, including metabolic regulation and cancer progression, through its interactions with other proteins. It has been studied in the context of several cancers, where its expression levels and interactions influence disease outcomes, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Pan2020ANKRD22; Utsumi2021ANKRD22; Chen2023ANKRD22).

## Structure
ANKRD22 is an ankyrin repeat protein that contains four copies of the ankyrin motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Yin2017ANKRD22). The protein is composed of 191 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 21,849 Daltons (Qiu2019ANKRD22). ANKRD22 is characterized as an N-myristoylated hairpin-like monotopic membrane protein, with its amino and carboxyl termini facing the cytoplasm (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). The protein's structure includes a hydrophobic 'hairpin' motif, which is crucial for its localization to lipid droplets (LD) and is facilitated by a conserved Proline residue (Pro98) (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). 

N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification, is significant for the intracellular targeting of ANKRD22 to LDs, although it is not absolutely required (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, particularly the positively charged residues, plays a critical role in its localization to LDs (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). ANKRD22 is not an N-glycosylated protein, as indicated by the lack of change in band pattern upon treatment with glycopeptidase F (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). The protein's localization and function are influenced by its structural features, including the ankyrin repeat domains and post-translational modifications.

## Function
ANKRD22 encodes a protein that is an N-myristoylated hairpin-like monotopic membrane protein specifically localized to lipid droplets (LDs) in cells. This protein is involved in lipid metabolism and storage, as it localizes to LDs, which are organelles responsible for storing neutral lipids such as triglycerides and sterol esters (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). The protein's localization to LDs is influenced by its unique membrane topology, characterized by a conserved proline residue (Pro98) that is crucial for maintaining its hairpin-like structure, allowing both ends of the hydrophobic domain to face the cytosol (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). 

ANKRD22 is synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and sorted to LDs, with its N-myristoylation playing a significant role in its intracellular localization and function (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). The protein's membrane domain functions as a type II signal anchor sequence, generating a single-pass membrane protein with N-cyto/C-exo topology (Utsumi2021ANKRD22). While the specific function of ANKRD22 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in lipid droplet dynamics suggests it may be involved in important metabolic and signaling functions on the phospholipid monolayer surface of LDs (Utsumi2021ANKRD22).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD22 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. In cervical cancer, ANKRD22 is overexpressed and contributes to cancer stem cell growth and resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. This is mediated through the NUSAP1/Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that targeting ANKRD22 could improve treatment outcomes (Pan2023ANKRD22). In breast cancer, ANKRD22 knockdown reduces malignancy by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Wu2020ANKRD22).

In colorectal cancer, ANKRD22 is involved in metabolic reprogramming, promoting glycolysis and supporting cancer-initiating cell survival, which is linked to poor prognosis (Pan2020ANKRD22). In non-small cell lung cancer, high ANKRD22 expression is associated with increased tumor progression and shorter overall survival, making it a potential therapeutic target (Yin2017ANKRD22).

Conversely, in prostate cancer, high ANKRD22 expression is associated with improved prognosis and longer disease-free survival, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role (Qiu2019ANKRD22). In ovarian cancer, ANKRD22 influences the immunosuppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, affecting immune response and prognosis (Chen2023ANKRD22).

## Interactions
ANKRD22 interacts with several proteins involved in metabolic processes and cancer progression. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, ANKRD22 interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 1 (PDK1), a key regulator of glycolysis. This interaction inhibits PDK1's kinase activity, promoting glycolysis by upregulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (Pan2020ANKRD22). ANKRD22 also interacts with ATP synthase subunits and ADP/ATP translocase 2 (ANT2), with ANT2 showing the highest abundance. The interaction between ANKRD22 and ANT2 is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments, with ANT2 binding to the N-terminal fragment of ANKRD22 (Pan2020ANKRD22).

ANKRD22 interacts with the lipid transport protein E-Syt1 in CRC cells, binding at the synaptotagmin-like mitochondrial lipid-binding protein (SMP)-LTD domain. This interaction is crucial for lipid accumulation and mitochondrial degeneration in colorectal cancer initiating cells (CCICs) (Pan2020ANKRD22). ANKRD22 also interacts with Myosin-9, which stabilizes p53 and facilitates its nuclear accumulation, suggesting a role in p53 regulation (Pan2020ANKRD22).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ANKRD22 promotes the transcriptional up-regulation of E2F1 by enhancing the transcriptional activity of the E2F1 gene promoter, influencing cell cycle progression (Yin2017ANKRD22).
