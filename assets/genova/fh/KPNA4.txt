# KPNA4

## Overview
KPNA4, or karyopherin subunit alpha 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the importin α family, which plays a pivotal role in the nuclear import of proteins. The protein, also known as importin α3, functions as an adaptor in the classical nuclear transport pathway, facilitating the translocation of proteins with nuclear localization signals (NLS) into the nucleus by forming a complex with importin β1. This process is crucial for the regulation of various cellular activities, including the import of key regulatory proteins such as p53 and NF-κB, which are involved in apoptosis and cellular stress responses. KPNA4's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease progression, including cataract formation and cancer (Ping2021KPNA4; DíazGarcía2020Human).

## Structure
KPNA4, also known as importin α3, is a protein involved in nuclear transport. It is a member of the importin α family and is characterized by a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal importin β-binding (IBB) domain and a C-terminal nuclear localization sequence (NLS) binding motif. The NLS binding motif is formed by ten armadillo (ARM) repeat units, each composed of three α-helices, which together create a super-helical twist, resulting in an elongated molecule (DíazGarcía2020Human).

The IBB domain, approximately 60 residues long, is crucial for binding to importin β, facilitating transport through the nuclear pore complex. In the absence of importin β, the IBB domain can mimic an NLS region, occupying ARM motifs involved in NLS recognition, serving an auto-inhibitory role (DíazGarcía2020Human). KPNA4 exhibits a mainly helical secondary structure, as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, with minima at 208 and 222 nm (DíazGarcía2020Human).

KPNA4 tends to form oligomeric species, including homodimers and possibly higher-order oligomers, which may serve as a regulatory mechanism for heterodimer formation with other importin α isoforms (DíazGarcía2020Human). The protein's flexibility and low conformational stability are essential for its function in recognizing complex cargo sequences (DíazGarcía2020Human).

## Function
KPNA4, also known as importin-α3, is a member of the importin α family of adaptor proteins that play a critical role in the nuclear import of proteins. It functions within the importin-α/importin-β1 pathway, which is essential for classical nuclear transport processes. KPNA4 recognizes and binds to nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins, forming an importin-α/cargo complex. This complex then recruits importin-β1 to form a trimeric structure, facilitating the transport of cargo proteins through the nuclear pore into the nucleus (Ping2021KPNA4).

In healthy human cells, KPNA4 is involved in the nuclear import of key regulatory proteins such as p53 and NF-κB. The proper nuclear import of p53 is crucial for regulating apoptosis and cellular stress responses, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Ping2021KPNA4). KPNA4 is highly expressed in the lens, where it plays a significant role in maintaining lens transparency and preventing cataract formation by ensuring the correct nuclear transport of p53 (Ping2021KPNA4). Disruption in KPNA4 function can lead to ectopic accumulation of proteins like p53, resulting in cellular dysfunction and disease (Ping2021KPNA4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in KPNA4 expression or its interactions have been implicated in several diseases. In cataract formation, KPNA4 is crucial for the nuclear import of the p53 protein. Disruption of KPNA4 function leads to p53 accumulation in the lens center, contributing to cataract development. This is particularly evident under oxidative stress conditions, where KPNA4 upregulation is observed in response to hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells (Ping2021KPNA4).

In cancer, KPNA4 plays a significant role in tumor progression. In osteosarcoma, KPNA4 expression is elevated due to its regulation by LINC00467, which acts as a molecular sponge for miR-217. This interaction promotes osteosarcoma cell viability, migration, and invasion (Yan2021LINC00467). In glioblastoma, miR-181b targets KPNA4, inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reducing tumor aggressiveness. High miR-181b expression correlates with better prognosis, highlighting KPNA4's role in glioblastoma progression (Wang2015Upregulation).

In lung adenocarcinoma, KPNA4 is upregulated by the lncRNA ST7-AS1, which sponges miR-181b-5p. This axis promotes malignancy by facilitating EMT and metastasis (Hu2020LncRNA). These findings underscore KPNA4's clinical significance in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
KPNA4, also known as karyopherin subunit alpha 4, is involved in nuclear transport processes and interacts with various proteins to facilitate their nuclear import. It forms a complex with importin beta, which is essential for the transport of proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) into the nucleus (Ping2021KPNA4). KPNA4 specifically mediates the nuclear transport of the Ras-responsive element-binding protein 1 (RREB1), which is crucial for sustaining Ras/ERK pathway signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Hazawa2019Diseasespecific). The interaction between KPNA4 and RREB1 is modulated by the phosphorylation of KPNA4 at Ser60, enhancing the formation of the KPNA4/RREB1 complex (Hazawa2019Diseasespecific).

KPNA4 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, mediating its nuclear import. In the context of cataract formation, KPNA4 dysfunction leads to the cytoplasmic retention of p53, affecting its apoptotic function (Ping2021KPNA4). Additionally, KPNA4 is involved in the nuclear transport of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer, which is necessary for NF-κB-responsive gene activation and maintaining the mesenchymal state in cancer cells (Wang2015Upregulation). These interactions highlight KPNA4's role in various cellular processes and its potential impact on disease progression.
