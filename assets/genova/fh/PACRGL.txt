# PACRGL

## Overview
PACRGL is a gene that encodes the parkin coregulated-like protein, which is involved in microtubule dynamics and axoneme formation. This protein shares a 23% sequence identity with PACRG, yet it exhibits distinct functional characteristics due to differences in its structure, such as the inability to bind MEIG1. Despite these differences, PACRGL retains conserved residues that facilitate interactions with tubulin, suggesting its role in microtubule assembly or stability. The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with particularly high levels in sperm, indicating a potential role in reproductive biology. PACRGL is hypothesized to function as an inner-junction protein, contributing to the regulation of microtubule doublets and singlet-to-doublet transitions in ciliary structures (Khan2021Crystal).

## Structure
The PACRGL protein shares 23% sequence identity with PACRG and has been modeled using the crystal structure of PACRG as a template. This model indicates that PACRGL has a very short loop between helices a6 and a7, which suggests it cannot interact with FAP20, a protein involved in axonemal doublet microtubules (Khan2021Crystal). Unlike PACRG, PACRGL does not bind MEIG1 due to the lack of conservation of key residues necessary for this interaction (Khan2021Crystal). Despite these differences, PACRGL retains conserved residues involved in tubulin interaction, indicating it may have multiple tubulin binding sites. Single-molecule microscopy assays have shown that PACRGL can recruit tubulin to microtubules more efficiently than the PACRG:MEIG1 complex, and it forms cross-links with tubulin dimers, confirming its ability to bind microtubules and tubulin (Khan2021Crystal).

PACRGL is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with particularly high expression in sperm, and its distribution correlates with PACRG, MEIG1, and other axonemal proteins, suggesting overlapping functions (Khan2021Crystal). The protein may function as an inner-junction protein, potentially binding at sites distinct from PACRG, and might interact with another adaptor protein due to its inability to bind MEIG1 (Khan2021Crystal).

## Function
PACRGL is a protein that plays a role in microtubule dynamics and axoneme formation, which are critical for cellular processes such as motility and intracellular transport. It shares some sequence homology with PACRG, although it does not bind to MEIG1 due to the absence of key residues necessary for this interaction. Despite this, PACRGL retains the ability to interact with tubulin, as several tubulin-interacting residues are conserved between PACRG and PACRGL. These interactions suggest that PACRGL is involved in microtubule assembly or stability, potentially influencing cellular structure and function (Khan2021Crystal).

PACRGL is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with particularly high expression in sperm, indicating its potential role in reproductive biology. Its tissue distribution shows some correlation with PACRG, MEIG1, and other axonemal proteins, suggesting overlapping functions in axoneme structures found in motile cilia and flagella. PACRGL is speculated to be an inner-junction protein, crucial for regulating microtubule doublets and singlet-to-doublet transitions in non-motile primary cilia (Khan2021Crystal). These functions highlight PACRGL's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in ciliary function.

## Interactions
PACRGL, a protein with 23% sequence identity to PACRG, is involved in interactions with tubulin, a key component of microtubules. Unlike PACRG, PACRGL does not bind to MEIG1 due to the absence of conserved residues necessary for this interaction. However, PACRGL retains the ability to bind tubulin, sharing conserved tubulin-interacting residues with PACRG. Experiments have demonstrated that PACRGL can recruit tubulin to microtubules more efficiently than the PACRG:MEIG1 complex, suggesting that PACRGL possesses multiple tubulin binding sites and functions similarly to PACRG in terms of tubulin interaction (Khan2021Crystal).

PACRGL is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, with high expression levels in sperm. Its tissue distribution correlates with PACRG, MEIG1, and other axonemal proteins, indicating potential overlapping functions. PACRGL may act as an inner-junction protein, possibly binding at sites distinct from PACRG. Inner-junction proteins are crucial in the 9 + 2 axoneme structures of motile cilia and flagella, as well as in regulating microtubule doublets and singlet-to-doublet transitions in non-motile primary cilia (Khan2021Crystal).
