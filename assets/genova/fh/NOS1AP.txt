# NOS1AP

## Overview
NOS1AP, or nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous and cardiovascular systems. The protein encoded by NOS1AP is characterized by its interaction with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through specific structural motifs, including a PDZ-binding domain and an ExF site, which are crucial for its functional roles in cellular signaling and morphology (Li2017Efficient). NOS1AP is implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell structure and motility, and plays a significant role in neuronal development by affecting dendritic spine formation and synaptic connectivity (Richier2010NOS1AP; Majmundar2021Recessive). Clinically, variations in the NOS1AP gene have been associated with several disorders, including schizophrenia, Long QT Syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome, highlighting its importance in both neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular health (Crotti2009NOS1AP; Freudenberg2015Neuronal; Majmundar2021Recessive).

## Structure
NOS1AP, or nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein, is characterized by its interaction with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through specific motifs and structural elements. The primary structure of NOS1AP includes a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus, which is crucial for its interaction with nNOS. This motif, along with an internal ExF site, plays a significant role in binding to the nNOS PDZ pocket (Li2017Efficient).

The secondary structure of NOS1AP involves predicted β-sheets around the ExF motif and α-helices, which are important for maintaining the structural integrity necessary for efficient binding (Li2017Efficient). The ExF motif, located between residues 429-431, is highly conserved and critical for interaction with nNOS (Li2015Unexpected).

The tertiary structure of NOS1AP is essential for its function, as denaturation of the C-terminal region significantly reduces binding affinity, indicating that a native conformation is required for the concerted action of the ExF and PDZ motifs (Li2017Efficient). The structural integrity of NOS1AP is maintained by an independent element, possibly an alpha-helical structure, which is crucial for its interaction with nNOS (Li2017Efficient).

NOS1AP exists in different splice variant isoforms, such as the long form (NOS1AP-L) and short form (NOS1AP-S), which differ in their domain composition and functional interactions (Candemir2016Interaction).

## Function
NOS1AP (nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and neuronal development. In healthy human cells, NOS1AP is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, which is essential for maintaining cell structure and movement. It localizes to actin-rich structures such as filopodia and podosomes, promoting their formation and thereby facilitating cell adhesion and motility (Majmundar2021Recessive).

NOS1AP functions upstream of the GTPase CDC42, a key regulator of actin dynamics, and its overexpression increases active CDC42 levels, promoting filopodia formation (Majmundar2021Recessive). In the context of neuronal cells, NOS1AP is involved in dendritic spine development and synapse formation. It interacts with the protein Scrib, forming a complex with β-Pix, Git1, and PAK proteins, which are important for synaptic vesicle dynamics and dendritic spine morphology (Richier2010NOS1AP).

NOS1AP also plays a role in the development of dendritic structures in hippocampal neurons, where its long isoform (NOS1AP-L) regulates dendrite outgrowth and branching, influencing neuronal connectivity and function (Carrel2009NOS1AP). These functions highlight NOS1AP's importance in maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOS1AP gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In schizophrenia, NOS1AP is considered a susceptibility gene, with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly linked to the disorder. Altered NOS1AP levels have been observed in the brains of schizophrenia patients, potentially affecting dendritic spine development and contributing to the pathology of the disease (Wang2016Research; Freudenberg2015Neuronal; Wratten2009Identification).

NOS1AP variants also play a role in cardiac conditions, particularly as genetic modifiers in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Variants in NOS1AP have been associated with the occurrence of symptoms and the severity of the condition, influencing the risk of life-threatening cardiac events in individuals with LQTS (Crotti2009NOS1AP).

In nephrology, recessive variants in NOS1AP have been implicated in causing glomerulopathy and nephrotic syndrome. These variants impair actin remodeling in podocytes, leading to podocyte dysfunction and glomerular diseases such as proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis (Majmundar2021Recessive).

NOS1AP is also linked to mood disorders, including PTSD and bipolar disorder, where specific SNPs are associated with increased symptoms and severity (Wang2016Research).

## Interactions
NOS1AP, also known as nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence neuronal signaling and morphology. It interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) through its PDZ-binding domain, affecting dendrite branching in hippocampal neurons (Carrel2009NOS1AP). This interaction is crucial for modulating the effects of NOS1AP on dendritic patterning, as blocking nNOS can attenuate the reduction in dendrite branching caused by NOS1AP-L, the long isoform of the protein (Carrel2009NOS1AP).

NOS1AP also forms a complex with carboxypeptidase E (CPE), which is significant for its role in dendrite patterning. This interaction is mediated through the middle region of NOS1AP (amino acids 181-307) and is essential for the regulation of dendrite morphology via a CPE-mediated pathway (Carrel2009NOS1AP).

In addition to these interactions, NOS1AP binds to TDP-43, a protein involved in mRNA stability. TDP-43 directly binds to NOS1AP mRNA, playing a crucial role in maintaining its stability (Cappelli2022NOS1AP). NOS1AP's interaction with the nNOS PDZ domain is also influenced by its C-terminal IAV motif and an internal ExF site, which are necessary for efficient binding (Li2017Efficient). These interactions highlight NOS1AP's role in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes.
