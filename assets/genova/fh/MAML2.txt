# MAML2

## Overview
MAML2 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily through its role as a coactivator in the Notch signaling pathway. The MAML2 protein is part of the Mastermind-like family, which includes MAML1 and MAML3, and is characterized by its ability to interact with the Notch transcription complex, facilitating the transcription of Notch target genes (Nam2006Structural). Beyond its involvement in Notch signaling, MAML2 also plays a role in the regulation of other pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo signaling pathways, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Kim2020MAML12; Sinha2021Repression). Clinically, MAML2 is significant due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations, such as the MECT1-MAML2 fusion, which is implicated in various cancers, including mucoepidermoid carcinoma, where it acts as an oncogenic driver (Wu2005Transforming). The study of MAML2 and its interactions provides insights into its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Structure
The MAML2 protein is a transcriptional coactivator involved in the Notch signaling pathway. It contains a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) that is crucial for its function. The MAML2 protein is part of the Mastermind-like family, which includes MAML1 and MAML3, and these proteins share structural similarities, particularly in their ability to bind to the Notch transcription complex (Nam2006Structural). The TAD domain of MAML2 is involved in interactions with coactivators such as p300/CBP, which are essential for transcriptional activation (Wu2005Transforming).

The CRTC1-MAML2 fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, retains the TAD domain of MAML2 and interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300. This interaction is characterized by a specific binding segment within the TAD, which forms a helical structure upon binding (Clark2015Molecular). The fusion protein is constitutively nuclear and acts as a potent coactivator of CREB, leading to aberrant activation of CREB target genes (Clark2015Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, play a role in modulating the function of MAML2, particularly in the context of its fusion with MECT1, which enhances transcriptional activity by recruiting p300/CBP (Wu2005Transforming).

## Function
MAML2 (mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 2) is a crucial component in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. MAML2 functions as a transcriptional coactivator by forming a complex with the intracellular domain of Notch receptors and the CSL transcription factor, facilitating the transcription of Notch target genes such as HES-1 (Wu2002Identification). This complex displaces transcriptional co-repressors and recruits additional co-activators, leading to the activation of Notch target genes (McElhinny2008Mastermindlike).

MAML2 is also involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, acting independently of its role in Notch signaling. It promotes the turnover of β-catenin, even when the destruction complex is inhibited, providing an alternative pathway for β-catenin degradation. This function is crucial in conditions of high Wnt and SOX9 levels, where MAML2 limits Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Sinha2021Repression). MAML2's role in β-catenin turnover is independent of proteasomal and lysosomal systems, suggesting a unique mechanism of action (Sinha2021Repression).

MAML2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcriptional machinery to regulate gene expression in response to specific cellular signals (McElhinny2008Mastermindlike).

## Clinical Significance
MAML2 rearrangements, particularly the MECT1-MAML2 fusion, are significant in the context of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), a common malignant tumor of the salivary glands. This fusion results from a t(11;19) translocation and is a key oncogenic driver in MEC, leading to the constitutive activation of CREB-dependent transcription, which is crucial for tumorigenesis (Wu2005Transforming; Chen2021The). The presence of the MECT1-MAML2 fusion allows for the molecular classification of MECs into fusion-positive and fusion-negative tumors, with fusion-positive cases generally associated with better clinical outcomes, including lower risk of recurrence and longer survival (Behboudi2006Molecular).

MAML2 rearrangements are also used diagnostically to differentiate MEC from adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC), as ASC typically does not exhibit these rearrangements. This distinction is important because ASC is more aggressive than MEC (Thierauf2022Diagnostic). In primary pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (PMEC), MAML2 rearrangement is associated with lower pathological grades and better overall survival, serving as an independent protective factor (Zhu2014MAML2). The fusion's role in aberrant activation of cAMP/CREB-regulated genes suggests potential therapeutic targets for tumors involving MAML2 alterations (Coxon2005Mect1Maml2).

## Interactions
MAML2 (Mastermind-like transcriptional coactivator 2) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. MAML2 interacts with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP, which are crucial for its role in activating the CREB pathway. This interaction is mediated by the MAML2 TAD domain, which binds to p300/CBP, facilitating transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling (Wu2005Transforming; Clark2015Molecular). The MECT1-MAML2 fusion protein, resulting from chromosomal translocations, also recruits p300/CBP, bypassing normal signaling pathways to activate CREB target genes (Wu2005Transforming).

MAML2 is also known to interact with the Notch signaling pathway. It forms a complex with the intracellular domain of Notch and the DNA-binding protein CSL, facilitating transcriptional activation (Wu2021LINC01152). In glioblastoma multiforme, MAML2 is involved in a regulatory feedback loop with LINC01152, modulating the expression of Notch pathway target genes (Wu2021LINC01152).

Additionally, MAML2 interacts with YAP/TAZ, transcriptional coactivators involved in the Hippo signaling pathway, promoting their nuclear localization and enhancing their transcriptional activity (Kim2020MAML12). These interactions highlight MAML2's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
