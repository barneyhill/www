# CALB1

## Overview
The CALB1 gene encodes calbindin 1, a calcium-binding protein that plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling and homeostasis within various cell types. Calbindin 1 is categorized as a calcium-binding protein due to its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate the binding of calcium ions. This protein is crucial for buffering intracellular calcium levels, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing apoptosis. It is particularly significant in neuronal tissues, where it helps sustain neuronal firing and function, especially in regions like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is vital for cognitive processes such as working memory. Alterations in CALB1 expression have been linked to several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, highlighting its importance in neuroprotection and resilience against neurodegenerative changes (Datta2024Key; Harris2016Calbindin). Additionally, CALB1 interacts with various proteins, influencing pathways related to calcium signaling and cancer, further underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular physiology (Schmidt2012Three; Cao2019CALB1).

## Structure
Calbindin 1 (CALB1) is a calcium-binding protein characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that coordinate calcium ions. The protein contains six EF-hand motifs, four of which actively bind calcium ions (Noble2018The). These motifs are arranged in three pairs and are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Noble2018The). The X-ray crystallography analysis reveals that CALB1 adopts a 'kidney-bean' shape upon calcium binding, with a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination geometry involving specific amino acid residues and a water molecule, except for EF3, which uses Glu119 instead of water (Noble2018The).

The protein undergoes structural changes upon calcium binding, indicative of its role as a calcium sensor (Noble2018The). The human calbindin-D28K crystal structure shows significant differences from the NMR structure of rat calbindin-D28K, despite high sequence identity, with the human structure being less compact and having increased intramolecular distances (Noble2018The). CALB1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function. However, specific details on these modifications and isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
CALB1, or calbindin 1, is a calcium-binding protein that plays a critical role in calcium signaling and homeostasis within cells. It functions primarily as a calcium buffer, helping to stabilize intracellular calcium concentrations, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing apoptosis. In human lens epithelial cells, CALB1 overexpression stabilizes calcium distribution and concentrations following UVB irradiation, reducing apoptosis rates by modulating the expression of apoptotic proteins such as Bad and Bcl-2 (Liu2020Protective).

In neurons, CALB1 is involved in buffering calcium levels, which is crucial for sustaining neuronal firing and function, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). This region is important for cognitive functions such as working memory. CALB1 helps protect neurons from excessive calcium levels that can lead to pathology, especially as calbindin levels decrease with age or inflammation (Datta2024Key). CALB1's role in maintaining calcium homeostasis is vital for neuronal health and resilience to stress, contributing to its protective effects against neurodegenerative changes (Datta2024Key).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CALB1 gene, which encodes the calcium-binding protein calbindin 1, have been implicated in various neurological disorders. In Alzheimer's disease models, reduced CALB1 expression exacerbates the disease phenotype, while its overexpression in Parkinson's models has shown neuroprotective effects (Harris2016Calbindin). CALB1 downregulation is also observed in Huntington's disease, where it is associated with neuronal loss in the neostriatum, suggesting that impaired calcium buffering may contribute to neuronal cell death (Czeredys2013Expression).

In the context of tauopathies, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau), CALB1 is downregulated in neurons with MAPT mutations, leading to disrupted calcium homeostasis and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration (Minaya2023Conserved). This downregulation is linked to reduced intracellular calcium levels, which are crucial for neuronal development and function (Minaya2023Conserved).

CALB1 expression is also altered in other conditions, such as Ataxia telangiectasia, where decreased CALB1 mRNA levels are associated with deficient excitability of Purkinje neurons, contributing to the disease's pathology (CanetPons2018Ataxia). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CALB1 in maintaining neuronal health and its potential role in various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
Calbindin 1 (CALB1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a calcium-binding protein. It interacts with myo-inositol monophosphatase-1 (IMPase), Ran-binding-protein-M (RanBPM), and caspase-3, with these interactions occurring in both its apo- and Ca2+-bound forms. The interaction with IMPase has been demonstrated in situ in Purkinje neurons and is influenced by synaptic activation and increased intracellular Ca2+ levels (Schmidt2012Three). CALB1 also associates with TRPV5 channels in the kidney, which are involved in calcium reabsorption (Schmidt2012Three).

In the context of ovarian cancer, CALB1 enhances the interaction between the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the MDM2 proto-oncogene. This interaction suggests that CALB1 may promote the degradation of p53 via MDM2, impacting the regulation of downstream target genes such as p21 and p27, which are involved in cell senescence (Cao2019CALB1). These interactions highlight CALB1's role in modulating cellular processes through its interactions with key proteins in calcium signaling and cancer pathways.
