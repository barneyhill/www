# PICALM

## Overview
The PICALM gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein, a key player in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a fundamental cellular process responsible for the internalization and trafficking of various molecules, including proteins and lipids. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in facilitating the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) by binding to clathrin and adaptor proteins such as AP2, thereby influencing the size and shape of these vesicles (Ando2022PICALM). PICALM is crucial for maintaining synaptic function and neurotransmission in neurons, as well as regulating iron homeostasis and cell proliferation through its involvement in transferrin receptor endocytosis (Scotland2012The). Beyond its cellular functions, PICALM is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and certain hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance (Ando2022PICALM; Mercer2015Modulation).

## Structure


## Function
The PICALM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process essential for the internalization and intracellular trafficking of molecules such as proteins and lipids. This process is vital for regulating the protein content of the cell membrane, particularly in neurons, where it modulates synaptic strength and maintains sustained neurotransmission (Unknownauthors2013Genetic). PICALM is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), which transport molecules from the cell membrane to endosomes. It binds to clathrin heavy chains and adaptor proteins like AP2, recruiting them to the cell membrane and regulating the size and shape of CCVs (Ando2022PICALM).

In addition to its role in endocytosis, PICALM is involved in iron homeostasis and cell proliferation. It regulates the endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (TfR), which is crucial for iron uptake in cells. PICALM deficiency leads to increased surface expression of TfR and reduced efficiency of TfR internalization, resulting in features of iron deficiency and impaired cell proliferation (Scotland2012The). PICALM is also implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic function (Ando2022PICALM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PICALM gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and certain hematological malignancies. In Alzheimer's disease, PICALM has been identified as a significant genetic susceptibility locus, with various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to late-onset AD (LOAD) (Ando2022PICALM; Xu2014The). These genetic variants are thought to influence AD risk by affecting gene expression and altering pathways involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, Aβ transcytosis, and tau pathology (Ando2022PICALM; Thomas2016Decreasing). PICALM's role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and its interaction with other AD-related proteins suggest its involvement in both Aβ-dependent and Aβ-independent pathways (Ando2022PICALM).

In hematological malignancies, PICALM is implicated through chromosomal translocations, particularly in leukemias. These translocations can lead to altered cellular processes such as endocytosis and iron homeostasis, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Mercer2015Modulation; Scotland2012The). PICALM's involvement in iron metabolism is also significant, as its deficiency can lead to iron deficiency and proliferation defects, which are relevant in both neurodegenerative and hematological conditions (Scotland2012The).

## Interactions
PICALM (phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and Alzheimer's disease pathology. PICALM interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing adaptor proteins (PTB-APs) such as Numb, JIP1b, and GULP1. These interactions are mediated by the NPXY motif of APP, and PTB-APs modulate the PICALM-APP interaction, affecting APP internalization and processing (Merthan2019The).

PICALM also interacts with clathrin and adaptor protein 2 (AP2), which are essential for the formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. The carboxy-terminal region of PICALM is crucial for binding clathrin, and mutations in this region can impair endocytosis (Scotland2012The). Additionally, PICALM binds to SNARE proteins like VAMP2, VAMP3, and VAMP8, which are involved in vesicle fusion processes (Hattersley2021PICALM).

PICALM is also implicated in the autophagic degradation of APP-CTF through its interaction with LC3, functioning as an autophagic cargo receptor in conjunction with AP2 (Tian2013Adaptor). These interactions highlight PICALM's multifaceted role in cellular transport and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
