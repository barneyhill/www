# GFRA1

## Overview
GFRA1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1) is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor protein, which plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. The GFRA1 protein functions as a co-receptor, primarily facilitating the activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is crucial for neuronal survival, differentiation, and development (Airaksinen2002The). It is involved in various biological processes, including the maintenance of motor and sensory neurons, development of the enteric nervous system, and spermatogonial stem cell renewal (Godmann2010Epigenetic; Airaksinen2002The). GFRA1's interactions extend beyond the nervous system, influencing cancer treatment resistance and playing a role in several diseases, such as colorectal cancer and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (AlHamed2022Missense; Dong2020Hypomethylation). The gene's expression and function underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.

## Structure
GFRA1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that serves as a co-receptor for the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The primary structure of GFRA1 consists of 429 amino acids, and it is anchored to the cell membrane via a GPI-anchor, which is a common post-translational modification for this protein (Bhakta2018An). GFRA1 is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its interaction with ligands and other proteins (Bosco2018Preclinical).

The tertiary structure of GFRA1 allows it to form a specific 3D conformation necessary for its function as a receptor. This structure facilitates its interaction with GDNF and the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, forming a functional receptor complex. The quaternary structure involves the formation of a complex with GDNF and RET, which is essential for signal transduction (Simi2010Assembly).

GFRA1 can interact with all four GDNF family ligands, including GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin, highlighting its role as a promiscuous co-receptor (Sidorova2010Persephin). The protein's ability to bind these ligands is crucial for its role in promoting neuronal survival and differentiation.

## Function
GFRA1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor that plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family. It primarily functions by binding to GDNF, facilitating the activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, which is essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, and development (Airaksinen2002The). GFRA1 is involved in the recruitment of RET to lipid rafts, microdomains on the cell membrane that are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which is necessary for effective signal transduction (Paratcha2001Released; Airaksinen2002The).

In the nervous system, GFRA1 is widely expressed and is critical for the survival and maintenance of certain neuronal populations, including motor and sensory neurons (Airaksinen2002The). It is also involved in the development of the enteric nervous system, where it supports the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of enteric precursor cells (Airaksinen2002The). Beyond its role in the nervous system, GFRA1 is important for spermatogonial stem cell renewal, maintaining the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, which is crucial for continuous sperm production (He2007Gfra1; Godmann2010Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GFRA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), hypomethylation of GFRA1 leads to its upregulation, which is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor invasiveness. This process is linked to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical step in cancer metastasis, through the activation of the AKT pathway. GFRA1 hypomethylation is considered a potential biomarker for CRC metastasis and poor prognosis (Dong2020Hypomethylation).

In the context of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), a novel homozygous missense variant in GFRA1 (c.362A>G; p.(Tyr121Cys)) has been identified. This variant is associated with bilateral renal agenesis and severe renal cystic dysplasia, suggesting a crucial role for GFRA1 in kidney development. The variant disrupts the structural organization of the GFRα1 protein, leading to pathogenicity (AlHamed2022Missense).

Reduced expression of GFRA1 is linked to Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) and associated enterocolitis (HAEC) in mice. Gfra1 hypo/hypo mice exhibit impaired neuronal progenitor colonization, resulting in aganglionosis and gastrointestinal abnormalities. This underexpression highlights the importance of GFRA1 in the development of the enteric nervous system (Porokuokka2019Gfra1).

## Interactions
GFRA1 (GDNF family receptor alpha 1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor that primarily interacts with the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). This interaction is crucial for the activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, forming a complex that facilitates signal transduction essential for neuronal survival and differentiation (Ibáñez2017Biology; Airaksinen2002The). The GDNF-GFRA1 complex can recruit RET to lipid rafts on the plasma membrane, where it interacts with the lipid-anchored adaptor protein FRS2, or it can exist in a soluble form outside the rafts, interacting with the adaptor protein Shc (Airaksinen2002The).

GFRA1 also interacts with the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM), where it can antagonize NCAM-mediated cell adhesion and exert biological effects independently of GDNF or RET (Ibáñez2017Biology). In glioblastoma, the GDNF/GFRA1 signaling pathway contributes to resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy, with GFRA1 playing a role in cell survival and resistance mechanisms (Avenel2024GDNFGFRA1). These interactions highlight GFRA1's role in various cellular processes, including neuronal development and cancer treatment resistance.
