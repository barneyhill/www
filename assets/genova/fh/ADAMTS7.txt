# ADAMTS7

## Overview
ADAMTS7 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 7, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) family. This protein is a secreted extracellular metalloprotease characterized by a complex multi-domain structure, including a metalloprotease domain and thrombospondin type 1 motifs, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and interactions with the extracellular matrix (Colige2019Proteomic; Hanby2013Biochemistry). ADAMTS7 plays a significant role in the assembly and degradation of the extracellular matrix, influencing processes such as tendon health and vascular smooth muscle cell migration (Colige2019Proteomic; Mead2018The). It is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, where it affects vascular remodeling and plaque stability (Mead2018ADAMTS; You2015ADAMTS7). The regulation of ADAMTS7 activity involves interactions with other proteins and endogenous inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in vascular conditions (Colige2019Proteomic).

## Structure
ADAMTS7 is a large extracellular metalloprotease, part of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. The protein is over 250 kDa and consists of 15 domains, including a Prodomain, a metalloprotease (MP) domain, and several thrombospondin type 1 motifs (Colige2019Proteomic). The Prodomain is located N-terminal to the MP domain and is predicted to maintain latency until removed by proprotein convertases (Colige2019Proteomic). The MP domain contains a highly conserved zinc-binding sequence, HEXXHXXGXXH, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hanby2013Biochemistry).

ADAMTS7 also features a mucin domain enriched in serines, threonines, and prolines, which is heavily O-glycosylated and modified by chondroitin sulfate chain attachment (Somerville2004ADAMTS7B). This domain contributes to the protein's unique structure and potential interactions with the extracellular matrix (Somerville2004ADAMTS7B). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which influences its cellular localization and substrate recognition (Somerville2004ADAMTS7B).

The C-terminal ancillary domains of ADAMTS7 are important for substrate specificity, although the exact domains required for efficient substrate cleavage are not fully identified (Hanby2013Biochemistry). The protein is secreted but partially retained in the pericellular region, indicating interactions with cell surface components (Somerville2004ADAMTS7B).

## Function
ADAMTS7 is a secreted metalloproteinase involved in the assembly and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue integrity and function. In healthy human cells, ADAMTS7 is expressed in tendons, where it contributes to tendon health by preventing degenerative changes such as heterotopic ossification (HO) and ectopic chondrogenesis. It achieves this by suppressing chondrocyte differentiation, thereby maintaining the tendon phenotype and structure (Mead2018The).

ADAMTS7 is also active in the cardiovascular system, where it influences vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration by modulating the ECM composition and the availability of growth factors. This activity is particularly relevant in the context of injury or inflammation in the arterial wall (Colige2019Proteomic). The protease is known to cleave specific substrates such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBP) 3 and 4, which are involved in elastic fiber formation and organization (Colige2019Proteomic). The regulation of ADAMTS7 activity is mediated by endogenous inhibitors like TIMP-4, which is prevalent in cardiovascular tissues (Colige2019Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAMTS7 gene are significantly associated with various cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAMTS7, such as rs3825807, which are linked to CAD. This specific SNP results in a Ser214 to Pro substitution, which is associated with reduced cardiovascular events and lower severity of obstructive CAD by affecting ADAMTS7 function and reducing vascular smooth muscle cell migration (Mead2018ADAMTS; You2015ADAMTS7).

ADAMTS7 is involved in the degradation of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), influencing vascular smooth muscle cell migration and neointima formation, processes crucial to atherosclerosis development (You2015ADAMTS7). Elevated plasma levels of ADAMTS7 have been observed in patients with severe obstructive CAD, and its expression is increased in atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in symptomatic patients, indicating a vulnerable plaque phenotype (Mead2018ADAMTS).

Mouse models have demonstrated that knockout of ADAMTS7 results in a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion areas, suggesting a protective effect against atherosclerosis (Bauer2015Knockout). These findings highlight the potential of targeting ADAMTS7 for therapeutic strategies in atherosclerosis and related vascular conditions (Bauer2015Knockout).

## Interactions
ADAMTS7 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. One of its primary interactions is with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), where ADAMTS7 binds to and degrades COMP. This interaction is mediated by the four C-terminal thrombospondin (TSP) motifs of ADAMTS7 and the EGF-like domain of COMP, and is enhanced by divalent cations (Liu2006ADAMTS‐7:). This degradation process is significant in the context of arthritis, as COMP is a key extracellular matrix protein in cartilage (Liu2006ADAMTS‐7:).

The granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) also interacts with ADAMTS7, inhibiting its ability to degrade COMP. GEP binds directly to ADAMTS7 through its granulin repeat units, which are sufficient for this interaction. This binding disrupts the interaction between ADAMTS7 and COMP, preventing COMP degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Guo2010Granulin‐epithelin).

ADAMTS7 is also involved in cardiovascular processes, where it interacts with latent TGF-β-binding protein 4 (LTBP4), influencing elastogenesis and cardiovascular elasticity. This interaction is regulated by TIMP-4, an efficient inhibitor of ADAMTS7, suggesting a regulatory role in cardiovascular tissues (Colige2019Proteomic).
