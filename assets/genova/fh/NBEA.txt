# NBEA

## Overview
The NBEA gene encodes neurobeachin, a large multidomain scaffolding protein that plays a pivotal role in synaptic function and membrane trafficking. Neurobeachin is characterized by its BEACH domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, WD40 repeats, Armadillo repeat domain, and Concanavalin A-like lectin domain, which collectively facilitate its involvement in synaptic targeting and protein-protein interactions (Repetto2018Molecular; Nair2012Neurobeachin). As a scaffolding protein, neurobeachin is crucial for the regulation of neurotransmitter receptor trafficking, particularly AMPA and GABA receptors, thereby influencing synaptic strength and plasticity (Repetto2018Molecular; Nair2012Neurobeachin). Additionally, neurobeachin is implicated in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at excitatory synapses and is involved in post-Golgi membrane trafficking, which is essential for synapse formation and function (Niesmann2011Dendritic; Repetto2018Molecular). Mutations in the NBEA gene have been associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Boulin2021Functional; Nuytens2013Haploinsufficiency).

## Structure
Neurobeachin (NBEA) is a large, multidomain protein with a molecular weight of approximately 327 kDa, involved in synaptic function and membrane trafficking. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: a BEACH domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, WD40 repeats, an Armadillo repeat domain, and a Concanavalin A-like lectin domain (Repetto2018Molecular; Nair2012Neurobeachin).

The BEACH domain of NBEA is characterized by a unique polypeptide backbone fold, which includes several segments named e1 to e7 and 11 alpha-helices. This domain is highly conserved and is closely associated with a novel PH domain, forming a single functional unit. The PH domain has a seven-stranded beta-sandwich core, similar to other PH domains, but with unique insertions and low sequence homology (Jogl2002Crystal).

The WD40 repeats facilitate protein-protein interactions, while the Armadillo domain is involved in filopodia formation. The PH-BEACH domain complex is crucial for synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors and controlling spine density (Repetto2018Molecular; Lauks2012Synapse).

NBEA also contains an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) motif, which binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, influencing its localization and function (Lauks2012Synapse). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may affect its activity and interactions (Repetto2018Molecular). Multiple splice variants of NBEA exist, potentially impacting its function and localization (Repetto2018Molecular).

## Function
The NBEA gene encodes the neurobeachin protein, a multidomain scaffolding protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in neurons. Neurobeachin plays a significant role in synaptic function by regulating the trafficking and localization of neurotransmitter receptors, such as AMPA and GABA receptors, to synapses. This regulation is crucial for maintaining synaptic strength and proper synaptic transmission (Repetto2018Molecular; Nair2012Neurobeachin).

Neurobeachin is associated with the Golgi apparatus and is involved in post-Golgi membrane trafficking, influencing the sorting and targeting of proteins necessary for synapse formation and function (Niesmann2011Dendritic; Volders2011The). It is also implicated in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at excitatory synapses, which is essential for the motility and structural integrity of dendritic spines (Repetto2018Molecular).

In addition to its role in synaptic transmission, neurobeachin is involved in the generation of transport vesicles and membrane trafficking, particularly in neuronal cells. It interacts with the trans-Golgi network and is thought to facilitate the trafficking of pre-and postsynaptic components, which is vital for synaptic plasticity and function (Niesmann2011Dendritic; Volders2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NBEA gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. NBEA haploinsufficiency, where a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient for normal function, has been associated with autism-like behaviors in mice, such as increased self-grooming, decreased sociability, and impaired spatial learning and memory. These behaviors are linked to changes in synaptic plasticity and molecular processes, including increased phosphorylation of CREB and higher levels of BDNF in the hippocampus (Nuytens2013Haploinsufficiency).

In humans, NBEA variants have been linked to neurodevelopmental delay and childhood epilepsy. A specific missense variant, p.Gly1967Arg, was identified in a child with neurodevelopmental delay and seizures, suggesting a strong hypomorphic or complete loss-of-function mutation. This variant affects the Domain of Unknown Function 1088 of Neurobeachin, highlighting its importance for NBEA function (Boulin2021Functional).

NBEA has also been associated with migraine in individuals with bipolar disorder, suggesting a role in a specific bipolar disorder subphenotype characterized by co-occurring migraine (Jacobsen2015Genome). Additionally, NBEA is considered a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in multiple myeloma, with recurrent deletions observed in patients (O’Neal2009Neurobeachin).

## Interactions
Neurobeachin (NBEA) is a multidomain protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a crucial role in synaptic function. One of its key interactions is with synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102), a member of the PSD-95 family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs). SAP102 is involved in the trafficking and membrane insertion of NMDA receptors. The interaction between NBEA and SAP102 occurs through the C-terminal part of NBEA, which includes the DUF, PH, BEACH, and WD40 domains. A mutation in the PH domain of NBEA disrupts this interaction, highlighting the importance of the PH-BEACH domains' conformation for binding (Lauks2012Synapse).

NBEA also interacts with the RII regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which may influence the synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors (Lauks2012Synapse). Additionally, NBEA is involved in the regulation of glutamate and GABA receptor targeting to synapses. It interacts with SAP102 for glutamate receptor signaling, while its interaction with protein kinase A subunit II (PKA II) affects GABA receptor surface expression (Farzana2015Neurobeachin). These interactions underscore NBEA's role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release.
