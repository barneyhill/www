# GIT2

## Overview
GIT2 is a gene that encodes the protein GIT ArfGAP 2, a multidomain scaffolding protein involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell motility, focal adhesion dynamics, and DNA repair. The protein is characterized by its ArfGAP domain, which facilitates GTP hydrolysis, and other domains such as ankyrin repeats, Spa2-homology domain (SHD), coiled-coil (CC) domain, and focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain, which enable it to interact with numerous cellular partners (Kim2003The; van2018GIT2—A). GIT ArfGAP 2 plays a critical role in regulating cell motility by modulating focal adhesion turnover and actin cytoskeleton dynamics, primarily through interactions with proteins like paxillin and bPIX (Frank2006GIT2). Additionally, it is involved in the DNA damage response, acting as a substrate for ATM kinase and facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage (Lu2015Nuclear). Alterations in GIT2 expression or function are associated with age-related diseases, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (van2018GIT2—A; Martin2016GIT2).

## Structure
GIT2 is a multidomain scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. It contains several key domains, including an ArfGAP domain, which facilitates GTP hydrolysis on Arf1 and Arf6, and ankyrin repeats that stabilize transmembrane proteins (van2018GIT2—A). The Spa2-homology domain (SHD) is crucial for interactions with proteins such as PIX, FAK, and Piccolo, while the coiled-coil (CC) domain is associated with transcriptional regulation and dimerization of GIT proteins (Kim2003The; van2018GIT2—A). The focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain targets plasma membrane-bound integrin complexes and serves as a binding site for paxillin (van2018GIT2—A).

GIT2 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including a truncated version known as GIT2-short, which lacks the FAT domain and is highly expressed in immune cells (van2018GIT2—A). Post-translational modifications, particularly tyrosine phosphorylation, are prominent and influence GIT2's activity and interactions (van2018GIT2—A). The protein's modular structure allows it to interact with a broad spectrum of partners, acting as a hub in organizing complex molecular signaling networks (Martin2016GIT2).

## Function
GIT2 (GIT ArfGAP 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell motility and focal adhesion (FA) turnover in healthy human cells. It functions as a repressor of focal adhesion turnover and membrane protrusion, primarily through signaling pathways involving Rac1 and Cdc42. GIT2 inhibits lamellipodial extension and FA turnover, acting as an inhibitor of cell spreading and FA dynamics (Frank2006GIT2). 

GIT2 is part of a complex with proteins such as paxillin and bPIX, which are involved in FA turnover and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It is rapidly targeted to nascent focal complexes, suggesting its role in their maturation to focal adhesions (Frank2006GIT2). GIT2 also interacts with CrkII, repressing Crk-dependent actin polymerization and cell spreading (Frank2006GIT2).

In addition to its role in cell motility, GIT2 is involved in DNA repair processes. It is a substrate of ATM kinase and promotes DNA repair by facilitating the recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. GIT2's involvement in the DNA damage response is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Lu2015Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GIT2 gene are associated with several age-related diseases and metabolic disorders. GIT2 is implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, with studies showing that GIT2 knockout mice exhibit reduced insulin levels and impaired glucose tolerance, conditions that mimic diabetes (Martin2016GIT2). In diabetic models, such as db/db mice, GIT2 expression is upregulated, and its interactions with proteins involved in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation are disrupted, suggesting a role in managing metabolic stress (Martin2016GIT2).

GIT2 is also linked to age-related immune system dysregulation. Its deficiency leads to impaired immune responses, increased susceptibility to inflammatory conditions, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels (van2018GIT2—A). In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, GIT2 is crucial for maintaining DNA integrity in the central nervous system. GIT2 knockout mice show increased DNA damage in cortical neurons, indicating its protective role against DNA damage (van2018GIT2—A).

Furthermore, GIT2 is involved in bone health, with its deletion leading to decreased bone mineral density and defects in osteoblast maturation, contributing to osteoporosis (van2018GIT2—A). These findings highlight GIT2's significant role in various metabolic and age-related conditions.

## Interactions
GIT2 (GIT ArfGAP 2) is involved in various protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with paxillin, a structural protein involved in focal adhesion dynamics, which recruits GIT2 to focal adhesions (FAs) and is essential for its function in inhibiting cell spreading and FA turnover (Frank2006GIT2). GIT2 also forms complexes with the SH2-SH3 adaptor protein Crk, which is involved in cell motility, and this interaction is crucial for inhibiting Crk-dependent actin remodeling (Frank2006GIT2).

GIT2 interacts with bPIX, a member of the Dbl family of Rho GEFs, which stabilizes GIT2 and facilitates its entry into focal complexes, although bPIX is not required for the effects of GIT2 knockdown on cell motility (Frank2006GIT2). GIT2 is phosphorylated by Src/FAK at specific residues, which is necessary for its binding to paxillin at FAs (Zhou2016Expanding).

In the context of DNA damage response, GIT2 interacts with several key proteins, including ATM kinase, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, MDC1, 53BP1, and p53, forming multiprotein complexes that respond to DNA damage (Lu2015Nuclear). These interactions are enhanced upon exposure to ionizing radiation or cisplatin, indicating GIT2's role in DNA repair processes (Lu2015Nuclear).
