# WDR48

## Overview
WDR48 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 48 protein, which is characterized by its WD-40 repeat domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, allowing WDR48 to play a pivotal role in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of deubiquitination. The protein acts as a regulatory subunit for several ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), including USP12 and USP46, enhancing their activity and stability. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as it influences processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. WDR48's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in tumor suppression and its potential implications in cancer biology, particularly in the context of its interactions with other proteins and its role in signaling pathways (Han2021USP1WDR48; Gangula2013WD; Yin2015Structural).

## Function
WDR48, also known as WD repeat domain 48, plays a crucial role in regulating cell survival signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It functions primarily by forming a complex with the deubiquitinase USP12, which stabilizes the tumor suppressor phosphatase PHLPP1. This stabilization is essential because PHLPP1 dephosphorylates and inactivates Akt, a protein kinase that promotes cell survival and growth. By maintaining PHLPP1 stability, WDR48 acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis (Gangula2013WD).

WDR48 is also involved in the activation of other ubiquitin-specific proteases, such as USP46, by enhancing their activity. This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA repair and protein homeostasis. WDR48's role in modulating the activity of these proteases is facilitated by its WD-40 repeat domains, which interact with the proteases to stabilize them and enhance their catalytic turnover (Yin2015Structural).

In the cellular context, WDR48 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to processes like cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis (Gangula2013WD).

## Clinical Significance
The WDR48 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the WDR48 gene forms a complex with USP1, enhancing TGF-β signaling, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. This complex stabilizes TAK1, promoting EMT and migration of TNBC cells. Inhibition of WDR48 expression significantly reduces TGF-β-induced EMT, migration, and invasion, suggesting that alterations in WDR48 expression or its interaction with USP1 could contribute to the aggressive nature of TNBC (Han2021USP1WDR48).

WDR48 also interacts with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear proteins in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), playing a role in cell growth regulation. The EBNA3 family of EBV proteins recruits WDR48 to deubiquitination complexes, impacting the regulation of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A. This interaction is crucial for LCL growth, indicating that disruptions in WDR48's interactions with viral proteins could affect cell growth and transformation processes, potentially linking it to oncogenic pathways (Ohashi2015The).

## Interactions
WDR48, also known as WD repeat domain 48, is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of deubiquitination processes. It is known to form complexes with ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) such as USP46 and USP12, enhancing their deubiquitinating activity. WDR48 binds to the fingers subdomain of USP46, stabilizing substrate binding and enhancing the enzyme's activity without inducing significant conformational changes around the catalytic center (Zhu2019Structural). WDR48 can also independently and synergistically activate USPs when in complex with WDR20 (Dahlberg2014The).

In addition to its role with USP46, WDR48 forms a complex with USP12, which is associated with the phosphatase PHLPP1. This interaction stabilizes PHLPP1 by promoting its deubiquitination, thereby suppressing Akt-dependent cell survival signaling (Gangula2013WD). WDR48 also interacts with USP1, where it plays a role in stabilizing TAK1, a key component of the TGF-β signaling pathway, enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in triple-negative breast cancer cells (Han2021USP1WDR48).

WDR48's interactions are crucial for its regulatory functions, impacting various cellular processes, including cell survival signaling and protein stability.
