# NUP62

## Overview
NUP62 is a gene that encodes the nucleoporin 62 protein, a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is essential for the regulation of molecular transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nucleoporin 62 is categorized as a nucleoporin protein and is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including FXFG repeats and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its role in nuclear trafficking and structural integrity within the NPC (Stochaj2006The; Hashizume2013Nucleoporin). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and centrosome homeostasis, and interacts with multiple proteins to maintain cellular function (Crampton2009Oxidative; Hashizume2013Nucleoporin). Mutations in the NUP62 gene have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (BaselVanagaite2006Mutatednup62causes).

## Structure
NUP62 is a nucleoporin protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The protein is organized into distinct domains, including an N-terminal region with FXFG repeats and a C-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain. The FXFG repeats are involved in binding soluble transport factors such as NTF2, facilitating nuclear trafficking (Stochaj2006The; Hashizume2013Nucleoporin).

The coiled-coil domain of NUP62 is essential for its structural role within the NPC, forming a parallel three-helix bundle that can exist in homodimeric or homotrimeric states. This domain is crucial for interactions with other nucleoporins like Nup54 and Nup58, forming a trimeric assembly that is central to the NPC's function (Ulrich2014The; Dewangan2017The). The coiled-coil structure is characterized by hydrophobic interactions at the interface, contributing to the protein's stability and dynamic behavior in solution (Dewangan2017The).

NUP62 undergoes post-translational modifications, including O-glycosylation, which may influence its interactions and stability within the NPC (Guan1995Structural). The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, adding to its functional diversity (Hashizume2013Nucleoporin).

## Function
NUP62 encodes a nucleoporin protein that is a critical component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In healthy human cells, Nup62 is involved in several key molecular processes. It plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, particularly in the Crm1-mediated nuclear export pathway, by providing docking sites for carriers during their movement across the NPC (Crampton2009Oxidative). Nup62 is located at both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the central channel of the NPC, facilitating the movement of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Crampton2009Oxidative).

Nup62 is also essential for maintaining centrosome homeostasis and proper cell cycle progression. It localizes to centrosomes and is involved in regulating centrosome amplification and centriole separation, which are crucial for spindle orientation during mitosis (Hashizume2013Nucleoporin). The protein interacts with centrosomal markers such as γ-tubulin and SAS-6, indicating its role in centrosome and centriole maturation and synthesis (Hashizume2013Nucleoporin). Nup62's involvement in these processes is vital for maintaining spindle bipolarity and preventing aneuploidy, which can lead to carcinogenesis (Hashizume2013Nucleoporin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NUP62 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. A missense mutation in NUP62, resulting in a glutamine to proline substitution (Q391P), is linked to autosomal recessive infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN). This condition is characterized by symmetrical degeneration of the basal ganglia, leading to developmental regression, movement disorders, and optic atrophy. The Q391 residue is highly conserved across species, indicating its critical role in protein function. Despite the mutation, the p62 protein remains correctly targeted to the nuclear pore complex, suggesting that the disease mechanism does not involve protein mislocalization (BaselVanagaite2006Mutatednup62causes).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), NUP62 is found to mislocalize to the cytoplasm, where it colocalizes with TDP-43, a protein known to form pathological inclusions. This mislocalization is associated with TDP-43 insolubility and may contribute to the pathology of these diseases. NUP62's interaction with TDP-43 is suggested to exacerbate transport defects and promote protein aggregation, potentially impacting other neurodegenerative disorders (Gleixner2022NUP62).

## Interactions
NUP62 is a nucleoporin protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is involved in various protein interactions. It forms a complex with other nucleoporins such as NUP58 and NUP54, contributing to the central channel of the NPC (Buss1995Macromolecular). NUP62 interacts with γ-tubulin and SAS-6 at the centrosome, which is essential for centrosome homeostasis and function during mitosis (Hashizume2013Nucleoporin). It also associates with Nup358 and Nup214, particularly during interphase, indicating its role in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Stochaj2006The).

NUP62 is involved in the nuclear import of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in complex with hsp90, interacting with importin β and other chaperones like hsp70 and p23, which help prevent cargo aggregation during translocation (Echeverría2009Nuclear). The interaction with the MUC1-C oncoprotein is mediated through the central threonine-rich linker region of NUP62, facilitating its nuclear import via a nonclassical pathway (Leng2007Nuclear). These interactions highlight NUP62's role in facilitating the movement of various proteins across the nuclear envelope, underscoring its importance in cellular transport mechanisms.
