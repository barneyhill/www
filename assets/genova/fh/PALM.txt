# PALM

## Overview
The PALM gene encodes the protein paralemmin, a prenyl-palmitoyl–anchored phosphoprotein that plays a significant role in cellular membrane dynamics. Paralemmin is primarily associated with the plasma membrane in neurons, where it is involved in the formation and maturation of dendritic spines and filopodia, essential for synaptic connectivity and plasticity (Arstikaitis2008Paralemmin1). The protein's structure is characterized by a COOH-terminal cluster of cysteine residues that undergo lipid modifications, crucial for its membrane association (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin). Paralemmin's interactions with other proteins, such as Pdlim5 in neurons and NEXN in cardiac cells, underscore its role in maintaining cellular structure and function (Guo2024In; Srivastava2024Role). Additionally, paralemmin is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, where it influences cell migration and adhesion (Albrecht2013Paralemmin1).

## Structure
Paralemmin (PALM) is a prenyl-palmitoyl–anchored phosphoprotein primarily associated with the plasma membrane, particularly in neurons. The protein is characterized by a primary structure rich in acidic residues, especially glutamate, and contains few cysteines and aromatic amino acids. It has a COOH-terminal cluster of three cysteine residues that undergo prenylation and palmitoylation, which are crucial for its hydrophobicity and membrane association (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin). The COOH terminus also features a CaaX prenylation consensus sequence, a common motif for lipid modification (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin).

The NH2-terminal region of paralemmin displays a periodicity of acidic, basic, hydrophobic, and glutamine residues, with potential leucine zippers and high coiled-coil potential, suggesting a complex secondary structure (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin). Paralemmin's electrophoretic heterogeneity is attributed to its post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, and differential splicing of its mRNA, which is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin).

Paralemmin is not continuously distributed along the neuronal plasmalemma but appears in clusters and patches, indicating a role in plasma membrane dynamics and cell process formation (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin). The protein's structure and modifications suggest it may function similarly to other proteins involved in membrane dynamics, such as GAP-43 and MARCKS (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin).

## Function
Paralemmin-1, encoded by the PALM gene, is a prenyl-palmitoyl–anchored phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in plasma membrane dynamics and cell process formation, particularly in neurons. It is involved in the induction of filopodia and the maturation of dendritic spines, which are essential for synaptic connectivity and plasticity. Paralemmin-1 modulates the formation of filopodia, which serve as precursors to dendritic spines, and its interaction with proteins like Shank1b enhances spine maturation, indicating a synergistic effect on spine induction (Arstikaitis2008Paralemmin1).

The protein's function is regulated by palmitoylation and alternative splicing, with different splice variants having distinct effects on spine development. Paralemmin-1 enhances membrane expansion at dendritic protrusions upon neuronal activity, suggesting its role in activity-driven changes in neuronal structures (Arstikaitis2008Paralemmin1). It is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and is involved in cell process formation, as indicated by its colocalization with GAP-43, a protein known for its role in this process (Kutzleb1998Paralemmin).

In addition to its role in neurons, paralemmin-1 is expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells, where it modulates cell migration, adhesion, and maturation, although it is not essential for the development of the lymphatic system (Albrecht2013Paralemmin1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The PALM (paralemmin) protein is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. PALM is known to interact with the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and membrane dynamics (Srivastava2024Role). In neurons, PALM forms a complex with Pdlim5, a scaffold protein, which is essential for dendritic branching. This interaction is supported by proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies, indicating a stable Pdlim5:PalmD complex (Srivastava2024Role). The C-terminal LIM domain of Pdlim5 is critical for binding to PALM, highlighting the specificity of this interaction (Srivastava2024Role).

In cardiac cells, PALM interacts with proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton, such as NEXN. This interaction is important for stabilizing the junctional membrane complex and maintaining cardiac function under stress conditions (Guo2024In). PALM's role in cardiac protection is further emphasized by its ability to stabilize NEXN, which is crucial for the organization of transverse tubules and junctional membrane complexes (Guo2024In). These interactions suggest that PALM plays a significant role in both neuronal and cardiac cellular structures, influencing their morphology and function.
