# TRPV6

## Overview
TRPV6 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6, a calcium-selective ion channel protein. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis within epithelial cells. TRPV6 is highly selective for calcium ions (Ca2+) and is constitutively open, facilitating the entry of calcium driven by the electrochemical gradient. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, such as the intestines, where it is essential for calcium absorption, contributing to processes like bone mineralization and muscle function (Xin2019Cellautonomous; Walker2023Biochemistry). The channel's activity is modulated by various factors, including phosphoinositol lipids and calmodulin, which help regulate calcium-induced inactivation to prevent cellular calcium overload (Yelshanskaya2020Structure). Mutations in the TRPV6 gene have been associated with conditions such as transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism and chronic pancreatitis, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining calcium balance (Oracz2021Loss; Suzuki2018TRPV6).

## Structure
The TRPV6 protein is a calcium-selective ion channel that forms a tetrameric structure composed of four identical subunits, each 725 residues long. The tetramer is organized into two main compartments: a transmembrane domain and an intracellular skirt. The transmembrane domain contains six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) and a pore loop between S5 and S6, forming a central ion channel pore. The S1-S4 domain, which acts as a voltage sensor in other channels, is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions in TRPV6, suggesting it remains static during gating (Yelshanskaya2020Structure).

The intracellular skirt is formed by intersubunit interactions involving the N-terminal helix, ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), and a C-terminal hook, which are crucial for the channel's function (Yelshanskaya2020Structure). The ARD is monomeric in solution and does not bind ATP or calmodulin significantly, unlike TRPV1-ARD (Phelps2008Structural). The TRPV6-ARD features a large twist between the fourth and fifth repeats and variability in the third finger loop, which contains putative regulatory phosphorylation sites (Phelps2008Structural).

TRPV6 undergoes conformational changes during its transition between closed, open, and inactivated states, with significant changes occurring in the channel core region, particularly affecting the central ion conducting pathway (Yelshanskaya2020Structure). The α-to-π helical transition in the pore-lining helix S6 is a unique feature of TRPV6, contributing to its gating mechanism (Yelshanskaya2020Structure).

## Function
The TRPV6 gene encodes a calcium-selective ion channel that plays a crucial role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in epithelial cells. This channel is highly selective for Ca2+ ions and is constitutively open, allowing calcium entry driven by the electrochemical gradient (Xin2019Cellautonomous; Walker2023Biochemistry). TRPV6 is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues such as the intestines, where it facilitates the apical entry of calcium into cells, which is essential for processes like bone mineralization and muscle function (Walker2023Biochemistry; van2017TRP).

In healthy human cells, TRPV6 is involved in calcium signaling and is essential for various cellular functions, including placental calcium transport and fetal bone development (Walker2023Biochemistry). The channel's activity is modulated by factors such as phosphoinositol lipids, which directly activate TRPV6, and by interactions with proteins like calmodulin, which mediate Ca2+-induced inactivation to prevent calcium overload (Yelshanskaya2020Structure). TRPV6 also plays a role in maintaining epithelial cell quiescence by regulating intracellular calcium levels, which suppresses proliferative signaling pathways (Xin2019Cellautonomous). This regulation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cytotoxicity due to excessive calcium entry (Walker2023Biochemistry).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRPV6 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions due to their impact on calcium homeostasis. One significant condition associated with TRPV6 mutations is transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism (TNHP), characterized by elevated parathyroid hormone levels and skeletal abnormalities in neonates. This condition arises from impaired maternal-fetal calcium transport through the placenta, often due to biallelic pathogenic variants in TRPV6, which disrupt calcium transport necessary for fetal bone mineralization (Suzuki2018TRPV6).

TRPV6 variants have also been linked to chronic pancreatitis (CP), particularly in nonalcoholic early-onset cases. Studies have identified several TRPV6 variants that are overrepresented in CP patients compared to controls. These variants often result in a loss of function, affecting calcium signaling in pancreatic tissue and contributing to the pathogenesis of CP (Zou2020TRPV6).

The role of TRPV6 in these conditions underscores its importance in maintaining calcium balance in various tissues. Disruptions in TRPV6 function can lead to significant clinical manifestations, highlighting the need for further research into its genetic and functional implications.

## Interactions
TRPV6 interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and localization. One significant interaction is with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein. CaM binds to TRPV6 in a calcium-dependent manner, specifically to the transmembrane domain and consensus CaM-binding motifs located in the N and C termini of TRPV6. This interaction modulates TRPV6 activity, with CaM positively affecting its function upon calcium binding (Lambers2004Regulation).

TRPV6 also interacts with the S100A10-annexin 2 complex, which is crucial for its proper localization and function. S100A10 binds to a conserved sequence in the C-terminal tails of TRPV6, facilitating its trafficking to the plasma membrane (van2003Functional).

The protein RGS2 has been identified as a novel binding partner of TRPV6, inhibiting its activity by affecting channel gating properties directly at the cell surface (Schoeber2008Identification).

Nipsnap1 is another auxiliary protein that inhibits TRPV6 activity. It binds to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminus of TRPV6, regulating its activity directly at the cell surface without affecting its cell surface expression (Schoeber2008Identification).

Rab11a is involved in the trafficking of TRPV6 to the plasma membrane, with a specific binding region in TRPV6 essential for its proper localization (van2006Direct).
