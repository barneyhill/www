# HMGCLL1

## Overview
HMGCLL1 is a gene that encodes the protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase like 1 (er-cHL), which plays a significant role in metabolic processes, particularly in ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. The er-cHL protein is structurally similar to mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase, sharing a high degree of sequence homology and featuring a TIM-barrel structure, which is common among enzymes involved in metabolic reactions (Arnedo2019More). This protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is involved in the biosynthesis of ketone bodies, crucial for energy production and metabolic regulation, especially during fasting or low carbohydrate intake (Yen2022A). HMGCLL1 has also been identified as a predictive biomarker for the response to imatinib therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Park2018HMGCLL1).

## Structure
The HMGCLL1 gene encodes a protein known as er-cHL, which is involved in ketone body biosynthesis. The primary structure of the er-cHL protein is highly homologous to the mitochondrial HMG-CoA lyase (mHL), with an 83% identity in amino acid sequence (Arnedo2019More). The secondary structure of er-cHL features a TIM-barrel structure, a common motif in enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions. This structure includes an auxiliary domain composed of a β-sheet and two α-helices (Arnedo2019More).

The tertiary structure of er-cHL is characterized by a TIM-barrel fold, which is part of the beta/alpha barrel scaffold, one of the oldest protein families (Arnedo2019More). The protein also contains a conserved N-myristoylation motif at its N-terminal sequence, which is likely related to its association with cellular membranes, specifically on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Arnedo2019More).

The er-cHL protein does not have a well-defined quaternary structure, as it is found both associated with and dissociated from the membrane, indicating a weak interaction with the membrane (Arnedo2019More). The critical amino acids for catalytic activity and Mg+2 binding are conserved between mHL and er-cHL, suggesting functional similarities (Arnedo2019More).

## Function
HMGCLL1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in metabolic processes, particularly in ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. The protein is homologous to HMG-CoA lyase and is involved in the production of acetoacetic acid and acetyl-CoA, which are crucial components in energy production and metabolic regulation within cells (Zhang2024Establishment). HMGCLL1 is typically active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the biosynthesis of ketone bodies, a process essential for energy homeostasis, especially during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake (Yen2022A).

In healthy human cells, the protein encoded by HMGCLL1 plays a role in lipid metabolism, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting various physiological functions. The gene's activity is linked to metabolic regulation, and its expression levels can influence metabolic pathways that are critical for normal cellular function (Blaj2022Structural). Although the specific function of HMGCLL1 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in ketogenesis suggests a significant role in energy metabolism and regulation (Zhang2024Establishment).

## Clinical Significance
The HMGCLL1 gene has been identified as a predictive biomarker for the response to imatinib therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Variations in this gene, particularly the TCGAATAC haplotype, are associated with a lower probability of achieving a deep molecular response (DMR) to treatment. This haplotype correlates with higher expression levels of the HMGCLL1 gene and its isoform IS3, which is linked to a reduced DMR rate with imatinib therapy (Park2018HMGCLL1).

Research has shown that blocking the IS3 isoform using small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduces cell growth in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cell lines. This suggests that genetic variations affecting the expression of specific isoforms like IS3 may influence the effectiveness of CML treatment (Park2018HMGCLL1). The study also highlights the potential of IS3si as a therapeutic strategy for targeting CML stem cells and overcoming resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Park2018HMGCLL1).

While the HMGCLL1 gene's role in other diseases is not well-documented, a decrease in its expression has been observed in various cancer types, indicating a potential role in cancer biology (Arnedo2019More).
