# APBA3

## Overview
APBA3, or amyloid beta precursor protein binding family A member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease and immune response. The protein, also referred to as Mint3, is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and two PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with membrane proteins, including the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) (Hara2011Deletion; Tanahashi1999Genomic). APBA3 plays a crucial role in the trafficking and processing of APP, influencing amyloid-beta production, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Jiang2014Trafficking). Additionally, APBA3 is involved in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activity, which is essential for energy metabolism in macrophages under hypoxic conditions (Hara2017Control). The protein's interactions extend to other cellular components, such as the membrane protease MT1-MMP/MMP14 and GPX4, suggesting its involvement in broader cellular functions, including oxidant detoxification and immune response modulation (Karunakaran2022GPX4associated; Uematsu2016Mint3Apba3).

## Structure
The APBA3 protein, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding family A member 3, is characterized by specific domains that are crucial for its function. It contains a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain and two PDZ domains located at the C terminus. These domains facilitate binding to membrane proteins, including the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Hara2011Deletion; Tanahashi1999Genomic). The PTB domain is essential for its interaction with APP, and the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

APBA3 is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, though specific splice variants are not detailed in the available information. The protein's role in macrophage function and energy metabolism is highlighted, particularly in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activity, which is crucial for ATP production in hypoxic conditions (Hara2011Deletion; Hara2017Control). However, the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the APBA3 protein.

## Function
APBA3, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding family A member 3, is involved in several critical cellular processes. It encodes a protein that interacts with the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), playing a significant role in APP trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of APP metabolism and amyloid-beta production, which are key factors in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Jiang2014Trafficking).

In healthy cells, APBA3 is involved in modulating the processing of APP by binding to its C-terminal domain. It also regulates the factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (FIH-1) via its N-terminal domain. This regulation affects the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which is essential for glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions (Park2020Association). APBA3 enhances HIF-1 activity by suppressing FIH-1, which otherwise inhibits HIF-1 transcriptional activity in an oxygen-dependent manner. This function is particularly important in macrophages, where APBA3 supports glycolysis-dependent ATP production, crucial for energy metabolism (Hara2017Control).

APBA3 is also implicated in synaptic function and neuronal communication, primarily active in the cytoplasm and associated with vesicular trafficking (Tanahashi1999Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the APBA3 gene, also known as Mint3, have been implicated in various immune and inflammatory responses. APBA3 plays a significant role in macrophage function, and its deficiency can lead to impaired macrophage activities, such as reduced ATP production, motility, and cytokine secretion. This impairment is linked to increased resistance to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock in mice, suggesting that APBA3 influences the body's response to septic shock (Hara2011Deletion). 

In the context of influenza virus infection, Mint3 depletion in mice results in reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, leading to less severe lung inflammation and improved survival rates. This suggests that Mint3 contributes to the excessive activation of the immune system during severe influenza pneumonia, and its inhibition could potentially serve as a therapeutic target to mitigate severe inflammatory responses without affecting viral clearance (Uematsu2016Mint3Apba3).

Additionally, Mint3 interacts with the Furin protein, regulating its localization within the trans-Golgi network. This interaction may have implications for various biological processes, although specific diseases directly linked to APBA3 mutations or expression alterations are not detailed in the provided context (Han2008Interaction).

## Interactions
APBA3, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding family A member 3, is involved in several protein-protein interactions. It is a member of the X11 protein family and interacts with the Alzheimer's β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its phosphotyrosine interacting domain (PID). This interaction is significant for the regulation of APP processing, which affects the secretion of soluble APP and amyloid β-peptides, potentially influencing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Tanahashi1999Genomic).

APBA3 also plays a role in the trafficking of APP from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. A deficiency in APBA3 can reroute APP trafficking to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, highlighting its importance in APP processing and trafficking (Jiang2014Trafficking).

In the context of macrophages, APBA3 interacts with the membrane protease MT1-MMP/MMP14 to suppress the inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1). This interaction is crucial for promoting ATP production via glycolysis and activating HIF-1, which is important for macrophage function during normoxia (Uematsu2016Mint3Apba3).

APBA3 is also noted as a novel interactor of GPX4, suggesting its involvement in a cellular oxidant detoxification module, although specific details of this interaction are not fully elucidated (Karunakaran2022GPX4associated).
