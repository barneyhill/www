# OR5A2

## Overview
The OR5A2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily A member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of musk odors, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by binding to specific musk compounds. The OR5A2 protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is characterized by its ability to recognize and differentiate between various structural classes of musk compounds, including macrocyclic musks, nitromusks, polycyclic aromatic musks, and alicyclic musks. This broad tuning capability is essential for the perception of the unique musky odor quality. Genetic variations in the OR5A2 gene can influence an individual's sensitivity to musk odors, with certain variants potentially leading to specific anosmia for these compounds (Li2021From; Yoshikawa2022Diverse).

## Structure


## Function
OR5A2 is an olfactory receptor that plays a crucial role in the perception of musk odors. It is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR5A2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific musk compounds, contributing to the unique musky odor quality (Yoshikawa2022Diverse).

The receptor is sensitive and selective to musk compounds across four structural classes: macrocyclic musks, nitromusks, polycyclic aromatic musks, and alicyclic musks. This broad tuning allows OR5A2 to differentiate between odorants with or without the unique perceptual quality of musk compounds (Li2021From; Yoshikawa2022Diverse).

Genetic variations in OR5A2, such as the P172L variant, can affect sensitivity to musk compounds, potentially leading to specific anosmia for these odors in some individuals (Yoshikawa2022Diverse). The receptor's activity is crucial for the selective sensing of diverse musk compound structures, offering insights into the molecular basis of musk odor perception (Yoshikawa2022Diverse).
