# DBNDD1

## Overview
The DBNDD1 gene encodes the protein dysbindin domain containing 1, which is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with a significant presence of acidic residues, such as glutamate and aspartate, as well as serine and threonine. This protein is predominantly cytoplasmic and is expressed in most human tissues, excluding the ovary, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. The DBNDD1 protein is characterized by its proline-rich composition and is involved in various cellular processes, including the negative regulation of protein kinase activity. It is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the canonical form consisting of 158 amino acids. The protein's structure includes regions of disorder interspersed with segments of local order, and it contains phosphorylation sites that suggest interactions with kinases such as casein kinase 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5. The dysbindin domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in cellular functions (Wiedemann2022Backbone).

## Structure
The DBNDD1 protein, encoded by the DBNDD1 gene, is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) characterized by a high content of acidic residues such as glutamate and aspartate, along with serine and threonine. It is a proline-rich cytoplasmic protein expressed in nearly all organs except the ovary, adipose tissue, and bone marrow (Wiedemann2022Backbone). The canonical form of DBNDD1 consists of 158 amino acids, with three known isoforms produced by alternative splicing (Wiedemann2022Backbone).

The primary structure of DBNDD1 includes a sequence with a short stretch of helical propensity between residues L77 and S95. The protein has two reported phosphorylation sites at S95 and S119, with S95 proposed as a casein kinase 1 interaction site and S119 potentially modified by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Wiedemann2022Backbone). Sequence alignment indicates high conservation of the dysbindin domain across various species, suggesting a conserved structure and function (Wiedemann2022Backbone).

The secondary structure predictions indicate that the first 50 amino acids are fully disordered, followed by a region with some local order, and another fully disordered stretch between residues E98-R113. Partial local order is predicted for the C-terminal part (residues E140-D158) (Wiedemann2022Backbone). Experimental insights into the tertiary and quaternary structures are limited, but the protein is predicted to negatively regulate protein kinase activity (Wiedemann2022Backbone).

## Clinical Significance
The DBNDD1 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic mutations. In prostate cancer (PCa), DBNDD1 expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and this upregulation is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. The gene's expression is influenced by androgen receptor (AR) regulation, and it is more abundant in AR-positive PCa cells (Tram2023Dysbindin). DBNDD1 is also linked to immune cell infiltration in PCa, with its expression negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and Treg cells, suggesting a role in immune evasion and tumor progression (Tram2023Dysbindin).

In melanoma, DBNDD1 has been identified as a novel susceptibility gene, with significant associations found through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Fang2019Functional). The gene is also associated with breast cancer, where specific SNPs in DBNDD1 have been linked to the disease (Cao2019HiSSI). Additionally, DBNDD1 levels are decreased in Parkinson's disease mouse models, indicating a potential role in neurodegenerative conditions (Wiedemann2022Backbone). These findings suggest that DBNDD1 may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers and neurological disorders.
