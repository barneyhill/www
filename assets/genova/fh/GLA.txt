# GLA

## Overview
The GLA gene encodes the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), a lysosomal hydrolase critical for the catabolism of glycosphingolipids. This enzyme is categorized as a glycoprotein and functions as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the active site necessary for its catalytic activity (Garman2004The; Li2024GLA). α-Gal A is responsible for hydrolyzing terminal α-D-galactose residues from glycolipids, such as globotriaosylceramide, within lysosomes, thereby preventing their pathological accumulation (Smid2014Diagnostic). Mutations in the GLA gene can lead to Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficient α-Gal A activity and subsequent substrate accumulation, resulting in multi-systemic manifestations (Filoni2010Functional; GervasArruga2015Increased). Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of α-Gal A is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of Fabry disease and developing targeted therapeutic strategies (Nelson2014Autophagylysosome; Lombardi2019Translational).

## Structure
The GLA gene encodes the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which is a homodimeric glycoprotein. Each monomer consists of two domains: a (β/α)8 barrel domain containing the active site and an antiparallel β-sandwich domain. The active site is formed by residues from seven loops in the first domain, with key residues including D170 and D231, which are crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism (Garman2004The). The enzyme's quaternary structure is a homodimer, with dimerization influenced by specific residues at the dimer interface (Garman2004The).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at three N-linked carbohydrate sites, N139, N192, and N215, which are important for lysosomal targeting. The N215 site is particularly critical for efficient trafficking to the lysosome (Garman2004The). The enzyme also contains five disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining its structural integrity (Garman2004The; Qiu2015Impact).

Mutations in the GLA gene can lead to Fabry disease, with over 600 mutations identified, including missense mutations that affect the enzyme's folding and stability (Qiu2015Impact). Structural analysis of these mutations helps in understanding the molecular basis of the disease (Sugawara2008Structural).

## Function
The GLA gene encodes the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which plays a crucial role in the degradation of glycosphingolipids within lysosomes. In healthy human cells, α-Gal A catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal nonreducing α-D-galactose residues in α-D-galactosides, including substrates like globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) (Li2024GLA; Smid2014Diagnostic). This enzymatic activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of these substrates, which can lead to cellular dysfunction and disease if not properly degraded (Monticelli2023Curcumin; Smid2014Diagnostic).

The enzyme functions as a homodimer, with each monomer containing an active site necessary for its catalytic function (Li2024GLA). It is synthesized in a precursor form, imported into the endoplasmic reticulum for glycosylation, and then targeted to lysosomes where it becomes active (Monticelli2023Curcumin). Within lysosomes, α-Gal A is involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, contributing to the degradation of autophagic substrates and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Nelson2014Autophagylysosome). Proper function of α-Gal A is critical for normal cellular metabolism, preventing the pathological accumulation of glycosphingolipids and ensuring the efficient recycling of cellular components (Smid2014Diagnostic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLA gene are primarily associated with Fabry disease (FD), a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. This condition results from deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids such as globotriaosylceramide in various tissues. Clinical manifestations of FD include symptoms like acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, and renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular involvement (Filoni2010Functional; GervasArruga2015Increased).

The severity of Fabry disease can vary widely, influenced by specific GLA mutations and other genetic factors. Over 400 mutations have been identified, with missense mutations being the most common. These mutations can lead to a range of phenotypes, from classic Fabry disease with severe symptoms to milder, late-onset variants (Schäfer2005Thirtyfour; Lukas2013Functional). Some mutations result in residual enzyme activity and may respond to pharmacological chaperones, which has therapeutic implications (Oliveira2019<p>Multiple).

Alterations in the expression of the GLA gene, such as those caused by intronic variants, can also contribute to Fabry-like symptoms. These variants may affect mRNA regulation and enzyme activity, leading to different disease phenotypes (GervasArruga2015Increased). Additionally, certain promoter variants can alter transcription factor binding, potentially impacting gene expression and contributing to the pathogenesis of Fabry disease (GervasArruga2015Increased).

## Interactions
The GLA gene encodes the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal), which is involved in the lysosomal degradation pathway. This enzyme can form complexes with other lysosomal enzymes and may interact with chaperone proteins that assist in its folding and stability. In the context of Fabry Disease, the interaction between wild-type and missense variants of the GLA gene can lead to dominant-negative effects. This occurs when wild-type α-Gal forms heterodimers with missense variants, resulting in reduced enzyme activity. Such interactions are particularly evident in co-expression experiments where wild-type recombinant α-Gal is expressed with variants like W209C/R or C56W/R, leading to decreased specific activity due to the formation of dysfunctional heterodimers (Lombardi2019Translational).

The study of translational readthrough of GLA nonsense mutations also highlights the potential for amino acid substitutions to result in the assembly of wild-type and missense monomeric variants. This can lead to a mix of functional homodimers and dysfunctional heterodimers, impacting the overall enzyme function and contributing to the pathological phenotypes observed in Fabry Disease (Lombardi2019Translational).
