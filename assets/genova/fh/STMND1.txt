# STMND1

## Overview
STMND1 (stathmin domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is essential for cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and ciliary function. The protein, characterized by its stathmin domain, plays a critical role in modulating microtubule stability by binding to tubulin, thereby influencing cell shape, motility, and division (Amare2023Association). STMND1 is notably expressed in ciliated epithelial cells of the human fallopian tube, suggesting a specialized function in ciliary motility and maintenance (Lindskog2024A). Additionally, the protein is implicated in neural processes, particularly in neuron projection development and junctions, indicating its involvement in complex cellular signaling pathways (Loosse2016Nuclear; Amare2023Association). Despite its involvement in various cellular functions, the full spectrum of STMND1's roles and its clinical significance remain areas of active research.

## Function
STMND1 (stathmin domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences microtubule stability by binding to tubulin, thereby affecting cell shape, motility, and division (Amare2023Association). This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular functions and organismal development.

In the context of the human fallopian tube, STMND1 is selectively expressed in ciliated epithelial cells, suggesting a role in ciliary function. It is predicted to be involved in the regulation of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, which are essential for cilium motility, biogenesis, and maintenance (Lindskog2024A). Although STMND1 is not well-characterized in cilia resources, its presence in ciliated cells indicates a potential novel role in ciliary processes (Lindskog2024A).

Additionally, STMND1 has been associated with neuron projection development and is active in neuron junctions, indicating its involvement in neural processes (Amare2023Association). The gene's regulation may also be influenced by interactions with other proteins, such as FE65 and TIP60, highlighting its complex role in cellular signaling pathways (Loosse2016Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
The STMND1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly associated with its mutations are not well-documented. In the context of bipolar disorder, genetic variations near the STMND1 gene have been linked to the clinical response to lithium treatment. A study identified a locus near STMND1 that reached genome-wide significance for its association with lithium response, suggesting that genetic variations in this region may influence treatment outcomes (Amare2023Association).

In cases of partial deletion of chromosome 6p, which includes the STMND1 gene, there is a noted variability in clinical phenotypes. These can include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and various dysmorphisms. The clinical manifestations of such deletions are influenced by gene-dosage effects and structural variations affecting gene regulation (Vrachnis2021Partial).

Additionally, STMND1 has been identified as a downregulated gene in the context of influenza A virus infection, particularly in pathways related to cytoskeletal protein binding. However, the specific clinical significance or disease association of STMND1 mutations in this context is not detailed (Donátová2024Changes). Overall, while STMND1 is involved in several pathways, its direct clinical significance requires further investigation.
