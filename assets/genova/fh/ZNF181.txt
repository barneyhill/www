# ZNF181

## Overview
ZNF181 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 181, a member of the KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box zinc finger) family of transcription regulators. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 181 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. The gene's expression and function have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as 19q13.11 deletion syndrome and potential influences on substance use behaviors. Additionally, ZNF181 has been implicated in cancer research, where its expression correlates with aberrantly methylated long non-coding RNAs, suggesting a role in tumor progression and cell growth (Melo2015Cutis; Chowdhury2013Phenotypic; Minică2015Heritability; Zhi2018Profiling).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF181, a member of the KRAB-ZNF family of transcription regulators, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in gene expression and cellular processes. Mutations or deletions involving ZNF181 are associated with 19q13.11 deletion syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech disturbances, growth retardation, and microcephaly (Melo2015Cutis; Chowdhury2013Phenotypic). The haploinsufficiency of ZNF181 and other zinc finger genes in this region is thought to contribute to the cognitive and developmental impairments observed in affected individuals (Melo2015Cutis).

In the context of cannabis use initiation, ZNF181 has been identified as one of the genes with a strong association signal, although it did not reach genome-wide significance (Minică2015Heritability). This suggests a potential genetic influence on substance use behaviors, although further research is needed to establish a definitive link.

ZNF181 is also mentioned in cancer research, where its expression is correlated with certain long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are aberrantly methylated in cancers, indicating a possible role in tumor progression and cell growth (Zhi2018Profiling). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in diverse pathological conditions.
