# RNASE3

## Overview
RNASE3 is a gene that encodes the protein eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, and is involved in various immune functions, including antimicrobial activity and immune modulation. ECP is characterized by its ability to bind and destabilize microbial membranes, contributing to its role in host defense mechanisms. Despite its ribonucleolytic activity, ECP's bactericidal and cytotoxic effects are largely independent of this enzymatic function. The protein's interactions with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and nucleic acids further underscore its multifaceted role in immune responses. Genetic variations in RNASE3 have been linked to susceptibility to diseases such as malaria and asthma, highlighting its clinical significance in inflammatory and infectious conditions (Lu2020Human; Lee2019Functional; Adu2011Polymorphisms).

## Structure
RNASE3, also known as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), is a member of the ribonuclease A superfamily characterized by a conserved catalytic domain. The protein structure features a prominent α-helix and β-sheet configuration typical of ribonucleases. RNASE3 is noted for its high isoelectric point, which contributes to its ability to bind and destabilize microbial membranes, although its enzymatic activity is less potent compared to other RNases (FernándezMillán2022Exploring).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its function. A single nucleotide polymorphism at residue 97 (R/T97) is significant, as the presence of a threonine creates an N-glycosylation site, reducing cytotoxicity and affecting its interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lu2020Human).

RNASE3's tertiary structure is extraordinarily stable, which contributes to its cytotoxic effects. This stability allows RNASE3 to internalize into cells, escape proteolytic degradation, and accumulate in the cytosol, thereby overcoming the concentration of ribonuclease inhibitor and degrading cytosolic RNA molecules (Maeda2002RNase). The protein's stability and structural features are crucial for its antimicrobial and immune-modulatory functions.

## Function
RNASE3, also known as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), is a ribonuclease involved in various immune functions. It is primarily expressed in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, and plays a significant role in host defense mechanisms. RNASE3 exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including antiviral, antibacterial, and antihelminthic properties. Its antiviral and helminthotoxic effects are dependent on its ribonucleolytic activity, while its bactericidal and cytotoxic effects are not (Lu2020Human; Lee2019Functional).

In healthy human cells, RNASE3 contributes to innate immunity by neutralizing pathogens and participating in inflammatory responses. It destabilizes bacterial membranes and targets intracellular components, such as nucleic acids, leading to bacterial cell agglutination and elimination (Lu2020Human; Lee2019Functional). RNASE3 also modulates immune responses by activating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, which is crucial for cytokine and chemokine production (Lu2020Human).

RNASE3 is involved in tissue healing and remodeling, and its expression is regulated by infections. It can induce autophagy and help eradicate intracellular mycobacteria, suggesting a role in immune response modulation (Lu2020Human). The protein's activity is not solely dependent on its catalytic function, as it can modulate immune pathways through both catalytic-dependent and independent modes (Lu2020Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RNASE3 gene, which encodes eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of malaria, specific polymorphisms in RNASE3 have been linked to increased susceptibility to cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malaria (SM). The c.371G.C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.R124T), is associated with increased risk of CM in Ghanaian children, as it affects the cytotoxicity of ECP (Adu2011Polymorphisms). Similarly, the +499G/C polymorphism has been associated with severe malaria in the Senegalese population, with the G-G-T haplotype showing a significant association with increased severity (Diop2018Genetic).

In addition to malaria, RNASE3 polymorphisms have been implicated in allergic conditions and asthma. The ECP434(G>C) polymorphism is linked to non-allergic asthma and altered lung function in smokers, while the ECP c.-38(A>C) polymorphism is associated with atopy (Jönsson2010Associations). These genetic variations suggest that RNASE3 plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases, potentially through its interactions with immune pathways and receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lu2020Human).

## Interactions
RNASE3, also known as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that contribute to its role in immune modulation. RNASE3 has been shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), activating the EGFR pathway through direct binding. This interaction is mediated by specific conserved residues in RNASE3, which overlap with those in RNASE5 and EGF, although some differences suggest a distinct mechanism (Lu2020Human). A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 97 in RNASE3 affects its binding affinity to EGFR, influencing cytotoxicity and disease severity (Lu2020Human).

RNASE3 also interacts with nucleic acids, exhibiting ribonucleolytic activity that is associated with antiviral responses. It is involved in the activation of interferon-induced pathways and interacts with endosomal receptors like TLRs 7-9, which are involved in detecting nucleic acids (Lu2020Human). Additionally, RNASE3 binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin, with a high binding affinity that inhibits its RNase activity. This interaction involves specific residues identified through molecular docking and NMR spectroscopy (Boix2012Structural). These interactions highlight RNASE3's multifaceted role in immune response and host defense.
