# FAM185A

## Overview
FAM185A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 185 member A. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including circadian rhythm regulation and immune response modulation. While the specific functional category of the protein remains to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid carcinoma, and cervical cancer. The gene's expression patterns and genetic variants have been associated with disease progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Notably, FAM185A's role in circadian functions and its expression in response to hypoxic conditions suggest its involvement in complex physiological pathways (Zhang2023New; Hu2016GWAS; Han2021Systematic).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM185A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and genetic variants. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), FAM185A is identified as a key circadian gene associated with the disease. Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly resting Mast cells, suggesting a role in immune response modulation in OSA. The gene's expression is significantly higher in rat lung tissues under intermittent hypoxia, a condition related to OSA, indicating its potential involvement in the physiological response to hypoxia (Zhang2023New).

In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), FAM185A is part of a prognostic model based on survival-associated alternative splicing (AS) events. Its expression is lower in thyroid cancer cells compared to normal cells, suggesting clinical significance in THCA progression and potential as a predictive marker for survival outcomes (Han2021Systematic).

FAM185A is also associated with circadian rhythm regulation. A genome-wide association study identified an intronic variant of FAM185A, rs3972456, which may play a role in circadian functions, although further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis (Hu2016GWAS).

In cervical cancer, circFAM185A, a circular RNA derived from FAM185A, is overexpressed in cancer samples and affects cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Tianzhao2021Profiling).
