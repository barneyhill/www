# DGCR6L

## Overview
The DGCR6L gene encodes the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 6-like protein, which is part of a family of proteins involved in various cellular processes. Located on chromosome 22q11.2, DGCR6L is of particular interest due to its association with the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a condition that can lead to a range of developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. The protein encoded by DGCR6L is thought to play a role in neural development and function, potentially through its interactions with other proteins such as the GABA B receptor subunit, GABA B1. Dysregulation of DGCR6L has been linked to increased susceptibility to anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, highlighting its importance in neuropsychiatric health (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
DGCR6L, located in the 22q11.2 region, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its dysregulation. In individuals with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), lower expression levels of DGCR6L have been significantly associated with an increased frequency of anxiety disorders. This correlation is particularly evident in children with 22q11DS, where lower DGCR6L expression is linked to higher internalizing behaviors indicative of anxiety (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation). The gene's dysregulation may also be influenced by other epigenetically regulated genes within the 22q11DS interval, suggesting a complex interaction that affects neuropsychiatric outcomes (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation).

DGCR6L's interaction with the GABA B receptor subunit, GABA B1, has potential implications for schizophrenia, as independent studies have linked DGCR6 to schizophrenia susceptibility (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation). The gene's expression levels have been studied in relation to neuropsychological outcomes, with findings indicating that alterations in DGCR6L expression may be linked to anxiety disorders in the context of 22q11DS (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation). These associations highlight the clinical significance of DGCR6L in contributing to the psychopathological outcomes observed in 22q11DS.
