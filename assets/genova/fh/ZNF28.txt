# ZNF28

## Overview
ZNF28 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 28, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating the transcription of target genes. This regulatory function is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, as it modulates the transcriptional landscape within the nucleus. By ensuring that genes are expressed at the appropriate times and contexts, zinc finger protein 28 plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the organism's overall development and health.

## Structure


## Function
ZNF28, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences. This binding capability allows ZNF28 to regulate gene expression by modulating the transcription of target genes. The protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by influencing the transcriptional landscape within the nucleus, where it is predominantly active. Through its regulatory functions, ZNF28 contributes to the proper functioning and maintenance of cellular activities, ensuring that genes are expressed at the right time and in the appropriate context. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting the organism's overall development and health.
