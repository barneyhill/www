# GPR26

## Overview
GPR26 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 26, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and is involved in various physiological processes, including mood regulation and energy homeostasis. GPR26 is unique in its constitutive activity, meaning it can activate intracellular signaling pathways in the absence of a ligand, primarily through coupling with Gs proteins to elevate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The receptor's role in mood regulation is underscored by studies in mice, where its absence leads to increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Additionally, GPR26 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression being epigenetically silenced in certain tumors, such as gliomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a potential antitumor function (Zhang2011GPR26deficient; Liu2021Constitutive; Boulay2009The).

## Structure
GPR26 is a constitutively active orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) composed of 337 amino acids. Its primary structure includes a 10-residue N-terminus, a 287-residue 7-transmembrane (7TM) domain, and a 40-residue cytoplasmic domain (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The 7TM domain spans residues 11-297, characteristic of GPCRs, which typically consist of seven transmembrane alpha-helices. GPR26 is predicted to contain 12.8% disordered residues, including a short N-terminus (residues 1-5) and two intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) located at residues 227-241 and 317-337. The first IDPR is part of the intracellular loop-3 (ICL3) (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The protein lacks an N-linked glycosylation motif in its short amino terminus (Lee2000Cloning). Notably, GPR26 has an arginine residue at position 251 in transmembrane region 6 and a lysine residue at position 270 in transmembrane region 7, a feature shared with the purinergic P2Y receptor cluster, although it does not function as a nucleotide receptor (Lee2000Cloning). The rat and human GPR26 proteins are 95% identical in the overlapping region, indicating a high degree of conservation (Lee2000Cloning). The structure does not include details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor are there any known prominent folds or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
GPR26 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Liu2021Constitutive; JONES2007Tissue). It is coupled to Gs proteins, leading to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in target cells through its constitutive activity, meaning it can activate signaling pathways without a ligand (Zhang2011GPR26deficient; JONES2007Tissue).

GPR26 plays a significant role in the regulation of mood and emotional behaviors. In mice, the absence of GPR26 results in increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors, which are associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein (pCREB) in the central amygdala (Zhang2011GPR26deficient). This suggests that GPR26 is involved in the phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor that is part of the GPCR-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, which is crucial for emotion regulation (Zhang2011GPR26deficient).

In addition to its role in mood regulation, GPR26 is implicated in appetite control and energy homeostasis through modulation of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation (Liu2021Constitutive).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPR26 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders and cancers. In the context of mood regulation, GPR26 deficiency in mice has been associated with increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors. This is linked to reduced levels of phosphorylated CREB in the central amygdala, suggesting a role in emotional regulation through the GPCR-cAMP-PKA-pCREB signaling pathway (Zhang2011GPR26deficient). GPR26 knockout mice also show a higher preference for ethanol, indicating a potential connection between GPR26 and alcohol use behaviors (Zhang2011GPR26deficient).

In cancer, GPR26 is epigenetically silenced in human gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, where its expression is reduced due to methylation of its 5' CpG island. This silencing is associated with decreased intracellular cAMP levels, which may contribute to tumor progression (Boulay2009The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GPR26 is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and reduce tumor growth, suggesting an antitumor role (Liu2021Constitutive). The ubiquitin ligase HECTD3 has been identified as a regulator of GPR26 degradation, further influencing its antitumor function in liver cancer (Liu2021Constitutive).

## Interactions
GPR26 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD3, which plays a crucial role in its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This interaction is significant for the regulation of GPR26 protein levels and its antitumor activity. The ubiquitination of GPR26, particularly at the lysine 286 (K286) site, is facilitated by HECTD3, leading to its degradation via the proteasome pathway. Overexpression of HECTD3 results in decreased GPR26 levels, while knockdown of HECTD3 increases GPR26 protein levels, indicating a direct regulatory relationship (Liu2021Constitutive).

GPR26 also exhibits constitutive activity by coupling with various G proteins, including Gs, Gi1, G15, and Gq. This coupling influences intracellular signaling pathways, such as the cAMP pathway, which is linked to its role in anxiety, depression, and emotion regulation (Lu2024Constitutive; JONES2007Tissue). The interaction with Gs proteins is particularly noted for its role in increasing basal cAMP levels, demonstrating GPR26's ability to activate signaling pathways without ligand binding (JONES2007Tissue). These interactions highlight GPR26's involvement in both protein degradation and signal transduction processes.
