# GGT5

## Overview
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) is a gene that encodes the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase 5, a member of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of gamma-glutamyl compounds, including the antioxidant glutathione, and plays a crucial role in amino acid transport and cellular detoxification processes (Luo2024GGT5). GGT5 is characterized by its heterodimeric structure, formed through the proteolytic cleavage of a single polypeptide chain, and is subject to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which affect its stability and function (Wickham2011Gammaglutamyl). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and kidney, and is associated with the cell membrane, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress (Luo2024GGT5; Wang2022Identification). GGT5 has also been identified as a significant biomarker in certain cancers, such as gastric cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient prognosis (Zhao2024GGT5:; Wang2022Identification).

## Structure
GGT5 (gamma-glutamyltransferase 5) is an enzyme that belongs to the gamma-glutamyltransferase family, characterized by a heterodimeric structure. This structure is formed through the proteolytic cleavage of a single polypeptide chain, resulting in two subunits. The active site of the enzyme is located in the larger subunit, which is crucial for its enzymatic function in glutathione metabolism. 

A notable feature of GGT5 is its post-translational modification, particularly glycosylation, which is common among members of the gamma-glutamyltransferase family. Glycosylation can influence the enzyme's stability, activity, and cellular localization. The specific domains and prominent folds of GGT5 are not detailed in the provided context, nor are any splice variant isoforms mentioned. 

The structural characteristics of GGT5, including its heterodimeric nature and glycosylation, are essential for its role in cellular processes involving glutathione metabolism. These features may also impact the enzyme's interaction with other cellular components and its overall functional capacity within the human body.

## Function
Gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of gamma-glutamyl compounds, including glutathione, a critical antioxidant in cells. GGT5 is one of the two extracellular enzymes known to cleave gamma-glutamyl bonds, which is essential for the metabolism of compounds like glutathione and its conjugates (Wickham2011Gammaglutamyl). It catalyzes the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional groups, playing a role in amino acid transport and cellular detoxification (Luo2024GGT5).

GGT5 is highly expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, and alveolar macrophages, where it is associated with the cell membrane (Luo2024GGT5). Its primary function in healthy human cells is related to maintaining glutathione balance, which is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Wang2022Identification). The enzyme's activity in glutathione metabolism is significant for detoxification processes and the regulation of cellular redox states (Luo2024GGT5).

In lymphoid tissues, GGT5 is crucial for the catabolism of S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (GGG), which supports the confinement of P2RY8-expressing B cells within germinal centers, thereby playing a role in immune cell organization and function (Gallman2021Abcc1).

## Clinical Significance
GGT5 (gamma-glutamyltransferase 5) has been identified as a significant biomarker in various cancers, particularly gastric cancer. High expression levels of GGT5 are associated with poor prognosis, including worse overall survival and progression-free intervals in gastric cancer patients (Zhao2024GGT5:; Wang2022Identification). Elevated GGT5 expression correlates with advanced pathological stages, higher T stages, and poorer histological grades, indicating a more aggressive disease phenotype (Wang2022Identification). 

In gastric cancer, GGT5 is linked to epithelial–mesenchymal transformation (EMT), a process that enhances cancer cell migration and invasion, contributing to poor disease-free survival and overall survival rates (Luo2024GGT5). GGT5 expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration, influencing the tumor microenvironment and potentially impacting the response to immunotherapy. High GGT5 expression correlates with increased levels of regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells, while negatively correlating with resting CD4 memory T cells, suggesting a role in immune evasion (Zhao2024GGT5:).

These findings suggest that GGT5 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer, with its overexpression indicating a more aggressive disease and poorer patient outcomes (Zhao2024GGT5:; Wang2022Identification).
