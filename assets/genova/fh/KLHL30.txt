# KLHL30

## Overview
KLHL30 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 30, which is part of the Kelch-like family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their structural domains, including the BTB/POZ domain, BACK domain, and Kelch motifs, which facilitate their role in forming Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Peng2023Genomic). The KLHL30 protein is particularly significant in skeletal muscle, where it is involved in myogenic differentiation and muscle-specific gene expression (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). As a member of Clade 3 within the KLHL family, KLHL30 is evolutionarily related to other KLHL proteins and is a target of the p53 protein, suggesting its involvement in stress response and cellular processes (Shilovsky2023Regulation; Rusin2024The). While its precise functions are not fully elucidated, KLHL30's role in muscle development and potential implications in cancer biology highlight its importance in cellular regulation and disease (Fu2022Kelchlike; Chen2021Transcriptome).

## Structure
KLHL30 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of specific structural domains. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and five to six Kelch motifs, which are typical features of KLHL proteins (Peng2023Genomic). These domains facilitate the formation of a Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex by interacting with Cullin3, acting as adapters to recruit substrates for ubiquitination (Peng2023Genomic). The Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure (Peng2023Genomic).

KLHL30 is part of Clade 3 within the KLHL family, indicating its evolutionary relationships with other KLHL proteins (Shilovsky2023Regulation). The protein has a relatively low number of cysteine residues compared to other KLHL proteins, which may influence its functional properties (Shilovsky2023Regulation). KLHL30 is also identified as a target of the p53 protein, with its expression being strongly upregulated in response to stress factors, although its precise function remains largely unknown (Rusin2024The). The protein's role in cellular processes is suggested to be significant, particularly in myoblast differentiation (Rusin2024The).

## Function
KLHL30 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in skeletal muscle. It is highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissues, where it is associated with a muscle-specific super-enhancer, indicating its role in muscle-specific gene expression and potential involvement in muscle function or development (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). KLHL30 is part of the Kelch-like family of proteins, which are known to form E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes with Cullin3, mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of substrate proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating protein turnover (Shi2019Kelchlike).

In myoblasts, KLHL30 plays a significant role in myogenic differentiation. Its overexpression increases the cell population in the G0/G1 phase and reduces the proportion in the S phase, acting as a negative regulator of myoblast proliferation. This regulation is evidenced by decreased expression of cell proliferation markers such as ki-67, PCNA, and CCND1 (Chen2021Transcriptome). KLHL30 also enhances the expression of myogenic transcription factors like MYOD, MYOG, and MEF2C, promoting myoblast differentiation and myotube formation (Chen2021Transcriptome). These functions underscore KLHL30's critical role in muscle development and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
KLHL30 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its altered expression levels and mutations. In gastrointestinal tumors, KLHL30, along with other Kelch-like proteins, shows decreased expression, which is associated with poor survival outcomes. This suggests that KLHL30 may act as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression could contribute to tumor progression, making it a potential prognostic biomarker in these cancers (Fu2022Kelchlike).

In the context of muscle development, KLHL30 is identified as a critical regulator of myoblast differentiation. Its expression is upregulated during myogenic differentiation, and overexpression enhances the expression of myogenic transcription factors, promoting myoblast differentiation and myotube formation. Conversely, knockdown of KLHL30 results in decreased myoblast differentiation and increased cell proliferation, indicating its role as a negative regulator of myoblast proliferation. These findings suggest that alterations in KLHL30 expression could have implications for muscle-related diseases (Chen2021Transcriptome).

KLHL30 is also overexpressed in glioma tissue compared to normal brain tissue, indicating a potential role in glioma risk and outcomes (Madden2013Circadian). However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with KLHL30 mutations or expression alterations are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
