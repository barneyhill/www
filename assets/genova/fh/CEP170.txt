# CEP170

## Overview
CEP170, or centrosomal protein 170, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to the function and structure of the centrosome, a key organelle involved in cell division. The protein encoded by CEP170 is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a pivotal role in microtubule organization and mitotic spindle assembly, essential processes for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. Phosphorylation of the CEP170 protein by Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is crucial for its localization to the centrosome and its interaction with other proteins, such as Kif2b and dynein, which are vital for maintaining microtubule dynamics and spindle integrity (Pillai2015Tank). Disruptions in CEP170 function or expression are associated with various clinical conditions, including microcephaly and cancer, underscoring its importance in cellular and developmental processes (Xu2021Chromosome; Khadija2022Clinical).

## Structure


## Function
CEP170, or centrosomal protein 170, is a critical component of the centrosome, an organelle essential for organizing microtubules during cell division. In healthy human cells, CEP170 plays a significant role in maintaining centrosome integrity and function, particularly during mitosis. It is involved in microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle function, which are crucial for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Pillai2015Tank).

CEP170 is phosphorylated by the kinase TBK1 at multiple serine and threonine residues, a modification necessary for its interaction with other proteins such as Kif2b, a kinesin family member. This interaction is important for targeting CEP170 to the mitotic spindle, thereby ensuring proper microtubule dynamics during mitosis (Pillai2015Tank). The phosphorylation of CEP170 by TBK1 is also essential for its centrosomal localization and function during mitosis (Pillai2015Tank).

CEP170 interacts with alpha tubulin, although this interaction is not affected by TBK1 inhibition, suggesting a specific role for TBK1 in modulating CEP170's function during mitosis (Pillai2015Tank). Overall, CEP170 is crucial for accurate cell division and genomic stability, contributing to the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle and ensuring effective chromosome segregation.

## Clinical Significance
CEP170 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its interactions. In the context of 1q43q44 deletion syndrome, CEP170 is deleted, which may contribute to microcephaly and other brain disorders due to its role in neurogenesis (Khadija2022Clinical). The gene is also involved in a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network that promotes melanoma metastasis. Overexpression of CEP170, along with other genes, acts as a miRNA sponge, sequestering tumor suppressor miRNAs and promoting the expression of pro-metastatic genes, thereby enhancing melanoma progression (Xu2021Chromosome).

CEP170 is part of the WDR62-CEP170-KIF2A pathway, crucial for cilium disassembly in neural progenitor cells. Disruptions in this pathway, such as those caused by CEP170 mutations, are linked to primary microcephaly, a condition characterized by reduced brain size due to impaired neural progenitor cell proliferation (Zhang2019Modeling). Additionally, CEP170 is associated with centrosome dysfunction, which can lead to ciliopathies, affecting multiple organ systems and resulting in conditions like retinal dystrophy, obesity, and neurocognitive defects (Jaiswal2021Centrosome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CEP170 in various developmental and cancer-related disorders.

## Interactions
CEP170 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in centrosome dynamics and mitosis. One of the primary interactions is with Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphorylates CEP170 during mitosis. This phosphorylation is essential for CEP170's proper localization to centrosomes and its interaction with the microtubule depolymerase Kif2b, which is necessary for mitotic spindle formation and function (Pillai2015Tank). The interaction between TBK1 and CEP170 is specific, as demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays, and is not influenced by other kinases like PLK1 (Pillai2015Tank).

CEP170 also interacts with the motor protein dynein, which is important for the structural integrity and function of the mitotic spindle apparatus (Pillai2015Tank). The interaction with dynein is facilitated by TBK1-mediated phosphorylation, which is crucial for the localization of another protein, NuMA, to spindle poles (Pillai2015Tank). These interactions highlight the role of CEP170 in maintaining microtubule dynamics and ensuring proper mitotic progression. The disruption of these interactions, such as through TBK1 inhibition, leads to defects in mitosis and centrosome amplification (Pillai2015Tank).
