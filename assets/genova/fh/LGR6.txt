# LGR6

## Overview
LGR6, or leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. The LGR6 protein is a transmembrane receptor involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation resolution, tissue regeneration, and stem cell biology. It is structurally similar to other members of the LGR family, such as LGR4 and LGR5, sharing a conserved framework that facilitates ligand binding and signal transduction (Chen2013The; Wang2013Structural). LGR6 is notably expressed in tissues like the epidermis and small intestine, where it plays a critical role in mediating the effects of signaling molecules such as Maresin 1 and R-spondins, which are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway (Chiang2023Maresin; Chang2022Structural). The receptor's involvement in cellular processes such as phagocytosis, osteogenic differentiation, and skin regeneration underscores its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and its potential implications in clinical conditions like osteoporosis and cancer (Snippert2010Lgr6; Liu2019LGR6).

## Structure
LGR6 is a member of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a large extracellular domain with multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that facilitate ligand binding. The LGR6 ectodomain consists of 17 LRR modules, similar to LGR4 and LGR5, forming a solenoid structure that is crucial for its function (Chen2013The; Wang2013Structural). The LRR modules include noncanonical LRR11 and LRR12, which disrupt the typical asparagine ladder, resulting in two separate smooth beta sheets (Wang2013Structural).

The extracellular domain of LGR6 adopts a horseshoe-like architecture, similar to that of LGR4, with a twisted solenoid structure (Chang2022Structural). This structure is involved in the recognition of ligands such as R-spondins and Norrin, which are important for Wnt signaling pathways (Wang2013Structural; Chang2022Structural). The LGR6 receptor is also known to interact with Maresin 1 (MaR1), leading to increased cAMP levels and enhanced phagocytosis in immune cells (Chiang2023Maresin).

LGR6 shares approximately 45% identity with LGR4 and LGR5, indicating a conserved structural framework among these receptors (Chiang2023Maresin). The receptor is part of the type B LGR family, which is characterized by a unique hinge region between the C-terminal LRR and the transmembrane domain (Van2012An). The LGR6 receptor may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
LGR6 is a receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of inflammation resolution and tissue regeneration. It is a member of the glycoprotein hormone receptor subfamily of rhodopsin-like GPCRs and is highly expressed in tissues such as the epidermis, dermis, testis, ovary, and small intestine (Chiang2023Maresin). LGR6 is involved in mediating the actions of Maresin 1 (MaR1), a proresolving lipid mediator, by promoting phagocytosis and reducing chemotaxis in immune cells like macrophages and monocytes (Chiang2023Maresin). This interaction is crucial for the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair, as MaR1 activates LGR6, leading to increased cAMP levels and the phosphorylation of proteins involved in immune response regulation (Chiang2023Maresin).

LGR6 also plays a role in skin biology, where it marks a distinct population of stem cells in the hair follicle, contributing to the formation of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and interfollicular epidermis (Snippert2010Lgr6). These LGR6+ cells are involved in long-term wound repair and skin regeneration (Snippert2010Lgr6). Additionally, LGR6 is implicated in osteogenic differentiation by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for bone formation and homeostasis (Liu2019LGR6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LGR6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly osteoporosis and certain cancers. In osteoporosis, genetic variants in LGR6, such as rs10920362, have been associated with increased risk and changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in the Han Chinese population. These variants may influence osteoporosis risk through their impact on gut microbiota composition, affecting bone health via inflammation-related pathways (Di2021Integrative). In postmenopausal Chinese women, specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in LGR6, including rs199693693 (K82N) and 1:202287949 (R840G), have been linked to BMD and T-score, suggesting a role in osteoporosis pathogenesis (Li2020Targeted).

In cancer, LGR6 expression has been studied in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). High LGR6 expression in HPV+ OPSCC patients is associated with a lower 5-year overall survival rate, indicating that LGR6 could serve as a prognostic marker for identifying high-risk patients (Jank2020Epithelial). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LGR6 in both bone health and cancer prognosis.

## Interactions
LGR6 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in different cellular processes. One notable interaction is with Maresin 1 (MaR1), a specialized proresolving mediator. MaR1 specifically activates LGR6, leading to enhanced phagocytosis and phosphorylation of proteins such as ERK and cAMP response element-binding protein in phagocytes. This interaction is crucial for MaR1's proresolving functions in inflammation (Chiang2023Maresin).

LGR6 also forms part of a complex with the long intergenic noncoding RNA LITTIP and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HnRNPK). This complex is involved in regulating cementogenesis via the Wnt signaling pathway. LITTIP binds to LGR6 mRNA and HnRNPK, promoting LGR6 expression and influencing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is essential for cementogenic activities (Li2023LITTIPLgr6HnRNPK).

In the context of myogenic differentiation, LGR6 is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) through RARα and RARγ receptors. It activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is crucial for myoblast differentiation and fusion. This signaling pathway is modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which downregulates LGR6 expression (Kitakaze2023AllTrans).
