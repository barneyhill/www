# AFF2

## Overview
The AFF2 gene, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 2, encodes the protein FMR2, which is a critical component in the regulation of transcription and RNA splicing. FMR2 functions as a transcription factor and RNA-binding protein, playing a significant role in the organization of nuclear speckles and the modification of pre-mRNA splicing factors. It is a part of the super elongation complex (SEC) and its variants, which are essential for RNA polymerase II elongation. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in various brain regions, indicating its importance in brain development and function. Mutations in AFF2 are linked to several neurological disorders, including Fragile X E syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Bensaid2009FRAXEassociated; Zou2022AFF2; Melko2013Loss).

## Function
The AFF2 gene, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 2, encodes the protein FMR2, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and RNA splicing within the cell nucleus. FMR2 functions as both a transcriptional factor and an RNA-binding protein, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and RNA processing. It is involved in the organization of nuclear speckles, which are subnuclear structures associated with the storage and modification of pre-mRNA splicing factors (Zou2022AFF2).

FMR2 contains two nuclear localization signals, allowing it to shuttle between nuclear speckles and splicing sites. This shuttling enables FMR2 to pick up cargo RNAs and transfer them to the nucleolus for further modifications. The N-terminal region of FMR2 is associated with transcriptional activation, while the C-terminal region modulates splicing through interactions with G-quadruplex RNA-forming structures, which act as exonic splicing enhancers (Zou2022AFF2).

AFF2 is ubiquitously expressed in multiple human brain tissues, with higher abundance in regions such as the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. This expression pattern suggests its essential role in brain development and function (Zou2022AFF2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AFF2 gene, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 2, are associated with several neurological and developmental disorders. The most notable condition linked to AFF2 is Fragile X E syndrome (FRAXE), an X-linked intellectual disability characterized by mild to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic behavior. This condition is caused by the expansion of CCG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the AFF2 gene, leading to its silencing through hypermethylation (Bensaid2009FRAXEassociated; Hillman2001Fragile; Melko2013Loss).

AFF2 mutations are also implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and epilepsy. Missense mutations in AFF2 have been associated with partial epilepsy and ASD, with different mutations affecting distinct regions of the FMR2 protein, suggesting a molecular sub-regional effect (Zou2022AFF2). Additionally, microdeletions involving the AFF2 gene have been linked to developmental delays and mild dysmorphism (Sahoo2011Microdeletion).

The AFF2 gene also plays a role in the regulation of the C9ORF72 allele, which is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Knockout studies have shown that loss of AFF2 can reduce pathological features associated with these conditions (Yuva-Aydemir2019Transcription).

## Interactions
AFF2, also known as ALF transcription elongation factor 2, is involved in several protein interactions as part of its role in transcription regulation. AFF2 is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC) and its variants, SEC-like 2 (SEC-L2) and SEC-like 3 (SEC-L3). These complexes include the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, which consists of CDK9 and cyclin T1, as well as the YEATS domain proteins ENL and AF9 (Luo2012Thea; Luo2012The). 

AFF2 interacts with these components to facilitate RNA polymerase II elongation. While ELL family members are not consistently detected in AFF2-containing complexes, the possibility of their interaction under different conditions is not excluded (Luo2012The). AFF2 is also part of the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP), which is involved in RNAP2-dependent transcriptional activation. This complex includes AFF4, ENL, CDK9, and CyclinT1, and is capable of activating both initiation and elongation of transcription (Yokoyama2019RNA).

These interactions highlight AFF2's role in transcriptional regulation through its participation in multiprotein complexes that modulate RNA polymerase II activity.
