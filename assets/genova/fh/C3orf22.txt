# C3orf22

## Overview
C3orf22, also known as chromosome 3 open reading frame 22, is a gene located on the human chromosome 3. It encodes a protein that is currently not well-characterized in terms of its specific biological function or classification into a known protein family such as kinases or receptors. However, emerging research suggests that the C3orf22 protein may play a role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology and testis-specific functions. The gene has been implicated in protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and is associated with genes involved in cancer development, such as MCM2, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Suhre2024A; Yuan2022MultiOmics). Additionally, C3orf22 exhibits differential allelic loss patterns in certain breast cancer subtypes, further suggesting its involvement in cancer-related pathways (Loo2008Differential). Its expression is notably enriched in the human testis, particularly in spermatogonia, although the implications of this expression pattern remain to be fully elucidated (Djureinovic2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the C3orf22 gene is not well-documented, but it has been implicated in various studies. In a genome-wide association study using the Seer Proteograph platform, C3orf22 was associated with the MAN1C1 gene through a specific SNP located at 3:126249877:A:C. This SNP showed an effect size of -0.420 in the discovery phase and -0.542 in the replication phase, indicating a potential role in protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) (Suhre2024A).

C3orf22 is also mentioned in the context of cancer research. It is one of the genes highly correlated with MCM2, a gene associated with cancer development, suggesting a possible role in promoting cancer (Yuan2022MultiOmics). Additionally, C3orf22 is listed among genes with differential patterns of allelic loss in breast cancer, specifically in estrogen receptor-positive infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) and ductal carcinoma (IDC), indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Loo2008Differential).

In the study of the human testis-specific proteome, C3orf22 was identified as one of the highly enriched genes in the testis, with expression patterns noted in spermatogonia, although its clinical significance in this context remains unclear (Djureinovic2014The).
