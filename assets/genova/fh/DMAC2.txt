# DMAC2

## Overview
DMAC2 is a gene that encodes the protein distal membrane arm assembly component 2, which is integral to the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, a key enzyme in the electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial assembly factor, playing a pivotal role in the stabilization and assembly of the ND4-module within complex I. The proper function of DMAC2 is essential for efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis, which are critical processes in cellular energy production. The gene's expression and the protein's activity are primarily localized in the mitochondria, where they contribute to the integrity and functionality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This underscores the importance of DMAC2 in maintaining cellular respiration and energy metabolism, as well as its role in the evolutionary adaptation of mitochondrial function in metazoans (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial; van2018Does).

## Structure


## Function
DMAC2, also known as distal membrane arm assembly component 2, is a protein involved in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, a crucial component of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. This protein plays a significant role in the stabilization of the ND4-module during the modular assembly of complex I, which is essential for efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis in mitochondria (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial). Complex I is the largest enzyme in the electron transport chain, and its proper assembly is vital for cellular energy production (Fernandez‐Vizarra2020Mitochondrial).

DMAC2 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of complex I subunits, interacting with mitochondrial-encoded membrane arm proteins (van2018Does). The protein's function is critical for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby supporting cellular respiration and energy metabolism (van2018Does). The presence of DMAC2 in the mitochondria underscores its importance in the co-evolution of the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteome, highlighting its role in the adaptation and efficiency of mitochondrial function in metazoans (van2018Does).
