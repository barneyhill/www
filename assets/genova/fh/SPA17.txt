# SPA17

## Overview
SPA17, or sperm autoantigenic protein 17, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is primarily recognized for its role in reproductive biology. The SPA17 protein is categorized as a cell adhesion molecule and is integral to sperm function, particularly in sperm motility and the binding to the zona pellucida of the egg, which is crucial for fertilization (Guyonnet2012Isolation). Beyond its reproductive functions, SPA17 is expressed in various tissues, suggesting additional roles in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Guyonnet2012Isolation). Structurally, the protein is characterized by a four-helix bundle and β-strands, allowing it to form oligomeric complexes, including heterodimers with ROPN1L, which enhance its interactions with A-kinase-anchoring proteins (Dahlin2021Beyond). Clinically, SPA17 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Zhou2019Sperm; Chiriva‐Internati2002Tumor).

## Structure
The SPA17 protein, encoded by the SPA17 gene, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct features. Its primary structure includes a sequence that is highly conserved across species, particularly in the N-terminal domain, which is involved in dimer interactions (WEN2001Characterization). The secondary structure of SPA17 includes a canonical four-helix bundle and β-strands that form a four-stranded β-sheet, which may mediate oligomerization (Dahlin2021Beyond). The tertiary structure is defined by these helical and β-sheet elements, contributing to its overall 3D conformation.

In terms of quaternary structure, SPA17 can form higher-order homo-oligomeric complexes such as dimers and tetramers, as well as heterodimers with ROPN1L, which enhances its affinity for A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (Dahlin2021Beyond). The protein contains specific domains, including a calmodulin-binding domain at the C-terminus and a central domain critical for heparin binding (WEN2001Characterization). SPA17 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function in cellular signaling pathways (Das2022A).

## Function
SPA17 (sperm autoantigenic protein 17) is primarily involved in the processes of fertilization, particularly in sperm-egg interaction. It plays a crucial role in sperm motility and the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida, the outer layer of the egg, which is essential for successful fertilization. This protein is part of the acrosomal matrix (AM) in sperm cells, a structure that undergoes significant changes during the maturation of sperm as they transit through the epididymis (Guyonnet2012Isolation).

SPA17 is associated with cell adhesion, suggesting its involvement in the initial stages of sperm-egg recognition and binding. Although it has not been previously associated with the acrosomal matrix, its presence in this structure indicates a potential role in facilitating the acrosome reaction, a critical step in fertilization where the acrosome releases its contents to allow sperm penetration of the egg (Guyonnet2012Isolation).

In addition to its role in reproduction, SPA17 is expressed in other tissues, indicating potential functions in cell adhesion and signaling beyond the reproductive system. However, specific molecular functions of SPA17 in these contexts are not detailed in the available data (Guyonnet2012Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
SPA17, also known as sperm autoantigenic protein 17, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, SPA17 expression is associated with worse outcomes, particularly in cases with lymph node metastasis. It is more prevalent in non-luminal breast cancer subtypes and correlates with lower disease-free and overall survival rates. Functional studies have shown that SPA17 overexpression enhances the migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target, especially in triple-negative and HER2 positive breast cancers (Zhou2019Sperm).

In ovarian cancer, SPA17 is frequently expressed in epithelial ovarian tumors, with studies indicating its presence in a significant percentage of primary ovarian tumors. This expression pattern suggests that SPA17 could serve as a target for immunotherapy, given its restricted expression in normal tissues and its immunogenic properties. SPA17-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been shown to effectively target and kill ovarian tumor cells, highlighting its potential in developing tumor vaccines (Chiriva‐Internati2002Tumor; Straughn2004Expression).

SPA17's role in cancer prognosis and treatment response varies across different cancer types, indicating its multifaceted roles depending on the tissue context (Naik2022Editorial:).

## Interactions
SPA17, or sperm autoantigenic protein 17, is known for its interactions with various proteins, particularly in the context of sperm function and fertilization. One of the key interactions of SPA17 is with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). When SPA17 forms heterodimers with ROPN1L, another member of the R2D2 clade, it exhibits a significantly higher affinity for AKAP18, with a binding affinity of 82 ± 2.1 nM, compared to the much weaker affinity of 9.6 ± 0.69 μM when SPA17 is in a homomeric form (Dahlin2021Beyond). This suggests that the SPA17-ROPN1L heterodimer is the preferred module for AKAP binding, enhancing the functional repertoire of SPA17 in cellular signaling pathways (Dahlin2021Beyond).

The interaction between SPA17 and ROPN1L is further supported by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and reciprocal pull-down experiments, which confirm the formation of heterodimers and minor tetrameric species (Dahlin2021Beyond). These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of flagella and motile cilia, as they contribute to the organization of the radial spoke complex, a key component in flagellar motility (Dahlin2021Beyond).
