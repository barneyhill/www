# SULT2B1

## Overview
The SULT2B1 gene encodes the enzyme sulfotransferase family 2B member 1, which is part of the cytosolic sulfotransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the sulfation of hydroxysteroids, including cholesterol and pregnenolone, playing a critical role in phase II metabolism. The gene produces two isoforms, SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b, through alternative transcription start sites, with SULT2B1b being more widely expressed in tissues such as the prostate, placenta, skin, and lung. SULT2B1b is particularly significant for its role in cholesterol metabolism, where it catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol sulfate, impacting processes such as keratinocyte differentiation and intracellular lipid homeostasis (Alherz2024Human; Ji2007Human). The enzyme's activity is crucial for regulating the availability of active steroids, influencing various physiological processes and maintaining homeostasis in hormonally responsive tissues (HE2004Different).

## Structure
The SULT2B1 gene encodes two isoforms, SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b, which arise from alternative transcription start sites and differ at their N-terminal sequences (Ji2007Human). Both isoforms share the last 342 amino acids, which are identical, and feature a unique C-terminal region rich in proline and serine residues. This proline-rich tail is not found in other sulfotransferases and is thought to play a role in protein stability, as its removal leads to protein aggregation (Coughtrie2016Function; Ji2007Human).

The SULT2B1 proteins have a Rossmann fold, a common structural motif in nucleotide-binding proteins, which is typical for sulfotransferases (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The C-terminal domain of SULT2B1 is phosphorylated at Ser348, which is associated with nuclear localization in humans (Coughtrie2016Function). SULT2B1b, in particular, has a unique 23-amino acid segment at its N terminus that is critical for cholesterol sulfonation (Ji2007Human).

The quaternary structure of SULT2B1 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but sulfotransferases often form dimers, as seen in other members of the family (Weitzner2009An).

## Function
The SULT2B1 gene encodes two isoforms, SULT2B1a and SULT2B1b, which are involved in the sulfation of hydroxysteroids, including cholesterol and pregnenolone. These enzymes are part of the cytosolic sulfotransferases family and play a crucial role in phase II metabolism by regulating the synthesis, inactivation, and excretion of various endogenous compounds (Alherz2024Human; Ji2007Human). SULT2B1b is more widely expressed and is particularly active in tissues such as the prostate, placenta, skin, and lung, where it catalyzes the sulfonation of cholesterol and 3β-hydroxysteroid hormones (HE2004Different; Ji2007Human).

In the skin, SULT2B1b converts cholesterol into cholesterol sulfate, which is important for barrier formation and keratinocyte differentiation (Ji2007Human). This enzyme also plays a role in intracellular lipid homeostasis by catalyzing the sulfation of cholesterol-oxygenated derivatives, influencing lipid metabolism through nuclear receptors (Alherz2024Human). In the prostate, SULT2B1b is involved in cell differentiation and is associated with maintaining normal prostate cell function (Yang2019Distinct). The enzyme's activity is crucial for regulating the availability of active steroids, which can impact various physiological processes and contribute to maintaining homeostasis in hormonally responsive tissues (HE2004Different).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SULT2B1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. Genetic polymorphisms in SULT2B1, particularly in the SULT2B1b isoform, are associated with autosomal recessive ichthyosis, a skin disorder characterized by imbalances in cholesterol sulfation (Kurogi2021SULT; Alherz2024Human). Specific missense SNPs, such as p.Glu78Lys and p.Ala140Val, have been implicated in this condition, affecting the enzyme's ability to sulfate cholesterol (Alherz2024Human).

In the context of cancer, SULT2B1b expression is linked to various malignancies, including prostate, breast, endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers. High expression levels of SULT2B1b are associated with poor prognosis in these cancers, while its downregulation can reduce cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Alherz2024Human). In prostate cancer, SULT2B1b appears to have a protective effect by reducing active steroid hormone precursors, but its depletion can promote cancer cell survival and invasiveness (Alherz2024Human).

Alterations in SULT2B1 expression are also linked to cardiovascular diseases. High levels of SULT2B1b in lymphocytes are associated with acute myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis, influencing cholesterol metabolism and inflammatory pathways (Alherz2024Human). Genetic variants in the SULT2B1 promoter region, such as rs2665580, are associated with increased expression and inflammation in coronary artery disease (Alherz2024Human).

## Interactions
The SULT2B1 gene, particularly its isoform SULT2B1b, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in biological processes. SULT2B1b interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) through a DR7-type configuration in the upstream promoter of the SULT2B1 gene. This interaction is crucial for the calcitriol-dependent induction of SULT2B1b expression, which is significant in the context of prostate cancer (Seo2013SULT2B1b).

In prostate cancer, SULT2B1b also modulates androgen receptor (AR) activity. It appears to regulate AR activity independently of the liver X receptor (LXR), a known regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. This regulation is linked to the enzyme's role in cholesterol metabolism, as SULT2B1b converts cholesterol to cholesterol sulfate, affecting AR activity and cell growth properties in prostate cancer cells (Vickman2016Cholesterol).

SULT2B1b's interactions extend to its involvement in the sulfation of steroid precursors like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and pregnenolone. Genetic polymorphisms in SULT2B1b can alter its sulfating activity, impacting steroid hormone homeostasis and potentially influencing cancer progression (Alherz2019Effect).
