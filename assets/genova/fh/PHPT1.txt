# PHPT1

## Overview
The PHPT1 gene encodes the enzyme phosphohistidine phosphatase 1, which is a cytosolic protein involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphohistidine residues in proteins. This enzyme plays a critical role in regulating phosphorylation states, impacting various cellular processes such as signal transduction, metabolism, and ion transport (Martin2016Structural; Gong2009Solution). PHPT1 is characterized by a compact elbow-shaped structure with a mixed α/β fold, and it is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular functions (Busam2006First; Gong2009Solution). The protein is particularly notable for its specificity in targeting phosphohistidine residues, distinguishing it from other phosphatases that act on phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine residues (Gong2009Solution). Through its interactions with various proteins, PHPT1 is involved in critical cellular pathways, including the regulation of ion channels and calcium homeostasis (Martin2016Structural; Cai2014Regulation).

## Structure
The PHPT1 protein is a 125-amino acid human cytosolic protein that adopts a compact elbow-shaped structure with a mixed α/β fold. Its secondary structure is characterized by six β-strands flanked by two α-helices, with a single helix and three strands lying approximately perpendicular to each other near the base of the molecule. The core of the protein is defined by a β-sheet, and the N-terminal histidine tag extends from it (Busam2006First). The active site of PHPT1 is defined by several key residues, including Lys 21, Glu 51, Tyr 52, His 53, Arg 78, Tyr 93, and Met 95, which are highly conserved among orthologous proteins, suggesting their importance in maintaining phosphatase activity (Busam2006First). 

The structure of PHPT1 includes a positively charged pocket, which is a potential site for phosphatase activity, defined by two loops with Glu 51 and Tyr 52 on one side and Tyr 93 and Met 95 on the other (Busam2006First). The protein does not require divalent cations for activity and is expressed in various vertebrates but not in fungi or bacteria (Busam2006First). The PHPT1 DNA sequence shows similarity to certain testes-specific proteins in Drosophila, which may also be phosphatases (Busam2006First).

## Function
PHPT1 (phosphohistidine phosphatase 1) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in the dephosphorylation of phosphohistidine residues in proteins. This process is essential for regulating phosphorylation states, which impacts various cellular processes such as signal transduction, metabolism, and ion transport (Martin2016Structural; Gong2009Solution). PHPT1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and is conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its fundamental role in cellular functions (Gong2009Solution).

In terms of molecular activity, PHPT1 specifically targets peptides and proteins containing phosphohistidine, unlike other phosphatases that act on phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine residues (Gong2009Solution). It plays a role in regulating the activity of potassium ion channels, such as KCa3.1, by removing histidine phosphoryl groups, thereby influencing ion transport and cellular signaling (Martin2016Structural). PHPT1 also participates in the regulation of the epithelial calcium channel TRPV5, where it reverses the activation mediated by nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B), thus contributing to calcium homeostasis (Cai2014Regulation).

Structurally, PHPT1 consists of six β-strands flanked by two α-helices, with a substrate-binding site that includes key residues such as His53, which is critical for its catalytic function (Martin2016Structural; Gong2009Solution). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences various signaling pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and viability (Martin2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PHPT1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In pancreatic β-cells, PHPT1 is crucial for the proper trafficking of K ATP channels to the plasma membrane. Knockout mice lacking PHPT1 exhibit neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by excessive insulin secretion and low blood glucose levels, similar to congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) caused by mutations in K ATP channel subunits (Srivastava2018Regulation). These mice also show impaired glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose intolerance with age, despite normal blood glucose levels (Srivastava2018Regulation).

In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high nuclear expression of PHPT1 is associated with larger tumor size, higher Fuhrman nuclear grade, and advanced pathological stages. Patients with elevated PHPT1 expression have worse overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker in ccRCC (Shen2015Nuclear).

PHPT1 has also been identified as a novel genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in PHPT1 are associated with an increased risk of VTE, highlighting its potential involvement in coagulation pathways (He2024Genetic).

## Interactions
PHPT1, or phosphohistidine phosphatase 1, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It interacts with ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), specifically dephosphorylating phospho-His 760, and the β-subunit of G proteins, which is phosphorylated on histidine residue 266. These interactions suggest PHPT1's involvement in dephosphorylating specific phosphohistidine residues in other proteins, indicating its role in signal transduction pathways (Busam2006First).

PHPT1 also interacts with the TRPV5 calcium channel, where it reverses the activation induced by nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B) through histidine phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for regulating TRPV5 channel activity and calcium homeostasis, highlighting PHPT1's role in modulating ion channel function (Cai2014Regulation).

Additionally, PHPT1 has been identified as a phosphatase that reversibly dephosphorylates substrates phosphorylated by NME1/2 histidine kinases. This includes ion channels like KCa3.1 and TRPV5, as well as the G-protein beta subunit GNB1, further underscoring its regulatory role in cellular signaling (Fuhs2017pHisphorylation:).
