# ZNF397

## Overview
ZNF397 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 397, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains. This protein is involved in DNA binding and plays a role in centromere function, particularly during specific phases of the cell cycle. The zinc finger protein 397 contains a SCAN domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions necessary for its localization to the centromere, although it is not essential for survival, as knockout studies in mice show no significant phenotypic effects (Bailey2008ZNF397). ZNF397 is conserved among placental mammals, indicating a potentially conserved function across these species (Bailey2008ZNF397). In addition to its role in centromere function, ZNF397 interacts with the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells, acting as a cofactor for AR-driven transcription, and is implicated in various cancers, including prostate and breast cancers, where its loss is associated with therapy resistance and poor clinical outcomes (Xu2023ZNF397).

## Structure
ZNF397 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its distinct domain structure, which includes a SCAN domain at the N-terminus and nine C2H2-type zinc finger repeats at the C-terminus (Damotte2021Plasma; Bailey2008ZNF397). The SCAN domain is an 84-residue motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and is essential for centromere localization, although it is not sufficient on its own (Bailey2008ZNF397). The zinc finger domains are crucial for DNA binding and centromere localization, with the region spanning amino acids 278-534 containing a nuclear localization signal (Bailey2008ZNF397).

ZNF397 is a mammalian-specific protein, conserved in placental mammals, and shows a high degree of structural similarity between human and mouse orthologues (Bailey2008ZNF397). The protein's localization to the centromere is dependent on both the SCAN domain and the zinc fingers, as demonstrated by domain-swap experiments with related proteins (Bailey2008ZNF397). Different isoforms of ZNF397 can either repress or activate transcription, indicating functional diversity (Damotte2021Plasma). The protein is not essential for survival, as knockout studies in mice show no significant phenotypic effects (Bailey2008ZNF397).

## Function
ZNF397 is a zinc-finger protein that plays a role in centromere function during specific phases of the cell cycle. It localizes to the centromere from interphase to early prophase, co-localizing with CENP-A, a constitutive centromere protein, indicating its involvement in centromere function and chromosomal stability (Bailey2008ZNF397). The SCAN and zinc-finger domains of ZNF397 are crucial for its centromere localization, with the SCAN domain facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for this process (Bailey2008ZNF397).

Despite its role in centromere localization, ZNF397 is not essential for cell division or development, as knockout studies in mice show no significant phenotypic abnormalities (Bailey2008ZNF397). This suggests that while ZNF397 contributes to centromere function, it may not be critical for these processes in healthy cells. The protein is conserved among placental mammals, indicating a potentially conserved function across these species (Bailey2008ZNF397). The exact molecular mechanisms and broader biological implications of ZNF397's function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF397 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly those driven by hormone receptors such as prostate and breast cancers. In prostate cancer, ZNF397 functions as a co-activator of the androgen receptor (AR) and is essential for maintaining AR signaling. Loss of ZNF397 leads to resistance to AR-targeted therapies, such as enzalutamide, by promoting lineage plasticity and a transition from an AR-dependent state to a TET2-driven lineage plastic state. This transition is associated with the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like, stem-like, and neuroendocrine (NE)-like lineages, which contribute to therapy resistance (Xu2023ZNF397).

In breast cancer, ZNF397 loss similarly results in enhanced tumor growth and a shift to a multilineage state, correlating with shorter survival (Xu2023ZNF397). The deficiency of ZNF397 is linked to poor clinical outcomes, including shorter progression-free and overall survival in various cancers, such as prostate, breast, ovarian, and lung cancers (Xu2023ZNF397).

Additionally, ZNF397 has been associated with plasma amyloid β levels, suggesting a potential role in amyloid metabolism, although its clinical significance in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear (Damotte2021Plasma).

## Interactions
ZNF397 is known to interact with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, acting as a cofactor for AR-driven transcription. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the canonical AR-driven transcriptional program, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays that reveal robust interactions between AR and ZNF397. The loss of ZNF397 leads to a significant reduction in AR binding to its target genes, impairing transcriptional activation (Xu2023ZNF397).

ZNF397 also interacts with TET2, a key player in epigenetic modifications. The SCAN domain of ZNF397 blocks the DNA binding of TET2's cysteine-rich dioxygenase (CD) domain. This interaction is significant because, in the absence of ZNF397, TET2 binding to its target genes is upregulated, leading to the activation of alternative transcriptional programs that contribute to therapy resistance in AR-dependent cancers (Xu2023ZNF397).

In addition to its role in cancer, ZNF397 is identified as a centromere protein that localizes to the kinetochore during interphase and early prophase. The SCAN domain of ZNF397 mediates protein-protein interactions, suggesting potential interactions with other centromere proteins, although the SCAN domain alone is not sufficient for centromere localization (Bailey2008ZNF397).
