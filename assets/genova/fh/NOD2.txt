# NOD2

## Overview
NOD2, or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor involved in the innate immune system. The protein product of NOD2 is a member of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, characterized by its ability to detect bacterial components, particularly muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of bacterial cell walls. Upon recognition of MDP, the NOD2 protein undergoes conformational changes that lead to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which are crucial for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides (Strober2005Signalling; Mukherjee2019NOD1). NOD2 is predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, where it plays a vital role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and mucosal immunity (Ferrand2019NOD2). Mutations in the NOD2 gene have been linked to various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Negroni2018NOD2; Ogura2001A).

## Structure
The NOD2 protein is composed of several distinct domains that contribute to its function in the immune response. It includes two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), also known as NACHT, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Strober2005Signalling; Raghuraman2016Casting). The CARD domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating downstream signaling pathways (Raghuraman2016Casting). The NOD domain is responsible for oligomerization and contains subdomains such as the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), helical domains (HD1 and HD2), and the winged-helix domain (WHD) (Maekawa2016Crystal). The LRR domain is crucial for ligand recognition, particularly for binding muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a component of bacterial cell walls (Tanabe2004Regulatory).

The tertiary structure of NOD2 is characterized by a hook-shaped conformation, with the LRR domain forming a horseshoe-like structure stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (Maekawa2016Crystal). The protein's inactive state is maintained by ADP-mediated interactions within the NOD domain, which are crucial for its auto-inhibition (Maekawa2016Crystal). Common post-translational modifications of NOD2 include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and stability.

## Function
The NOD2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing bacterial components, specifically muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a motif found in the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. This recognition triggers the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for host defense (Strober2005Signalling; Mukherjee2019NOD1).

In healthy human cells, NOD2 is primarily expressed in intestinal epithelial cells, including enterocytes, goblet cells, and Paneth cells, where it helps maintain intestinal homeostasis. In Paneth cells, NOD2 is involved in the secretion of antimicrobial peptides like lysozyme and defensins, which are crucial for mucosal immunity (Ferrand2019NOD2). NOD2 also modulates mucin secretion in goblet cells, contributing to the maintenance of the protective mucus layer in the intestine (Ferrand2019NOD2).

NOD2 is typically found in an autoinhibited monomeric state in the cytosol. Upon ligand recognition, it undergoes conformational changes, leading to self-oligomerization and recruitment of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which facilitates downstream signaling (Caruso2014NOD1; Mukherjee2019NOD1). This process is vital for the immune response to bacterial infections and maintaining the balance of gut microflora (Bourhis2007Nod1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NOD2 gene are associated with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Notably, NOD2 mutations such as R334Q, R334W, and L469F are linked to Blau syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammatory arthritis, uveitis, and dermatitis. These mutations are gain-of-function, contrasting with the loss-of-function mutations associated with Crohn's disease (CD) (Negroni2018NOD2). The 3020insC frameshift mutation in NOD2 is particularly associated with increased susceptibility to CD, impairing the gene's ability to respond to bacterial components and activate NF-kB, a key factor in immune response (Ogura2001A).

NOD2 mutations are also implicated in early-onset sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and Behcet's disease (Negroni2018NOD2). In cancer, NOD2 deficiency can lead to dysbiosis and an increased risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (Negroni2018NOD2). Additionally, NOD2 polymorphisms are linked to systemic autoinflammatory diseases, atopic dermatitis, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction (Negroni2018NOD2). The gene's role in maintaining bacterial equilibrium and immune response is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to chronic inflammation and disease (Negroni2018NOD2). Understanding NOD2's regulation and function could improve therapies for these inflammatory disorders (Negroni2018NOD2).

## Interactions
NOD2 interacts with a variety of proteins that modulate its function in immune signaling pathways. It binds to RIP2, a serine-threonine kinase, through CARD-CARD interactions, which is crucial for activating the NF-κB signaling pathway (Lecat2010The). NOD2 also interacts with ATG16L1, a key component in autophagy, through its CARDs, facilitating autophagic processes at bacterial entry sites (Boyle2014Insights).

NOD2's interaction with Erbin, a protein that negatively regulates NF-κB signaling, is mediated by the CARDs of NOD2 and the LRRs of Erbin. This interaction is crucial for NOD2's function, and mutations like L1007fs, associated with Crohn's disease, disrupt this binding (McDonald2005A; Kufer2006Role).

NOD2 also interacts with the short isoform NOD2-S, which inhibits NOD2-induced signaling by binding to its CARD domains and preventing self-association upon MDP stimulation (Rosenstiel2006A). Additionally, NOD2 is involved in mitochondrial antiviral signaling by associating with MAVS, which is essential for IRF3 activation in response to viral infections (Lecat2010The). These interactions highlight NOD2's complex role in immune response regulation.
