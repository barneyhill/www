# RASA4B

## Overview
RASA4B is a gene that encodes the RAS p21 protein activator 4B, a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. This protein plays a critical role in cellular signaling by enhancing the GTPase activity of RAS proteins, thereby acting as a negative regulator of RAS signaling pathways. RAS p21 protein activator 4B is characterized by the presence of specific domains, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the C2 domain, which are involved in membrane association and calcium binding, respectively. These domains are essential for the protein's function in modulating cellular responses to various stimuli. The activity and interactions of RAS p21 protein activator 4B can be influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may alter its conformation and functional interactions. Additionally, alternative splicing of RASA4B can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to diverse functional roles in cellular processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
RASA4B, also known as RAS p21 protein activator 4B, is a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins. The protein is involved in regulating RAS signaling by enhancing the GTPase activity of RAS proteins. Structurally, RASA4B may contain specific domains such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the C2 domain. The PH domain is typically involved in membrane association, which is crucial for the protein's function in cellular signaling pathways. The C2 domain is known for its role in calcium binding, which can influence the protein's activity and interactions.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can significantly affect the activity and interactions of RASA4B. These modifications may alter the protein's conformation and its ability to interact with other molecules, thereby modulating its function in RAS signaling pathways. Additionally, splice variants of RASA4B may exist, leading to different isoforms that could have distinct functions. These isoforms may vary in their domain composition or post-translational modifications, potentially affecting their role in cellular processes. The presence of these domains and modifications highlights the complexity and regulatory potential of RASA4B in cellular signaling.
