# NDUFA9

## Overview
NDUFA9 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A9, a crucial component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is integral to the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. As a subunit of complex I, NDUFA9 plays a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of the complex, particularly in stabilizing the junction between the membrane and matrix arms. The protein is characterized by an α/β short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase fold, which includes an NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold, crucial for its function. Mutations in the NDUFA9 gene can lead to complex I deficiency, contributing to various mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh syndrome (Stroud2013Gene; Baertling2017NDUFA9; van2011Defective).

## Structure
The NDUFA9 protein is a subunit of the mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is a 39 kDa protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of complex I. The primary structure of NDUFA9 includes specific amino acids that are critical for its function, such as arginine at positions 321 and 360, which are involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the complex (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian; van2011Defective).

The secondary structure of NDUFA9 features an α/β short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase fold, which includes an NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold with a parallel 7-strand β-sheet. This domain is responsible for binding NADPH, a co-factor essential for the protein's function (Zhu2016Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, the N-terminal domain of NDUFA9 interacts with core subunits PSST (NDUFS7) and 30 kDa (NDUFS3), while the C-terminal domain interacts with the long matrix loop of ND3 (Zhu2016Structure). The quaternary structure of NDUFA9 involves its integration into the hydrophilic arm of complex I, where it stabilizes the junction between the membrane and matrix arms, a critical step for complex I assembly and function (Stroud2013Gene).

## Function
The NDUFA9 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. This complex facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for generating a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, ultimately driving ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Baertling2017NDUFA9; van2011Defective).

In healthy human cells, NDUFA9 is integral to the assembly and stability of complex I. It stabilizes the junction between the membrane and matrix arms of the complex, a critical step in the late stages of complex I assembly (Stroud2013Gene). The protein is part of the Q-module located in the proximal matrix arm of complex I, and its presence is necessary for the proper incorporation of other subunits into the mature complex (Baertling2017NDUFA9).

NDUFA9's role is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of complex I, and its absence or mutation can lead to complex I deficiency, affecting cellular energy production and potentially leading to mitochondrial diseases (Baertling2017NDUFA9; van2011Defective).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFA9 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I. These mutations can lead to complex I deficiency, which is a hallmark of several severe conditions, including Leigh syndrome. Leigh syndrome is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as respiratory and metabolic acidosis, hyperlactataemia, profound hearing loss, apnoeas, retinitis pigmentosa, and brain abnormalities (van2011Defective).

Specific mutations, such as the c.962G>C variant, result in a more severe phenotype, including neonatal fatality. This mutation changes a highly conserved arginine at position 321 to proline, disrupting the protein's secondary structure and leading to a loss of an alpha helix. This alteration impairs complex I activity, as demonstrated by the inability of mutant NDUFA9 to restore complex I function in patient fibroblasts (Baertling2017NDUFA9; van2011Defective).

Other NDUFA9 variants, like c.1078C>T, are associated with reduced abundance of complex I and complex IV, though they result in less severe clinical outcomes compared to the c.962G>C variant (Baertling2017NDUFA9). These findings underscore the critical role of NDUFA9 in mitochondrial function and its potential involvement in mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
NDUFA9 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain. It is involved in the assembly and stability of complex I, particularly in stabilizing the junction between the membrane and matrix arms of the complex. Disruption of the NDUFA9 gene leads to impaired complex I assembly, resulting in the loss of complex I activity and the formation of a subcomplex lacking matrix arm subunits (Stroud2013Gene).

NDUFA9 interacts with other subunits within complex I, including the matrix arm subunits NDUFS2 and NDUFS3, which are absent in the 600-kDa subcomplex formed in NDUFA9-deficient mitochondria. In contrast, NDUFS5, associated with the membrane arm, remains present in this subcomplex (Stroud2013Gene). The absence of NDUFA9 also affects the import and assembly of matrix arm subunits NDUFS4 and NDUFA12 (Stroud2013Gene).

NDUFA9 is also identified as a direct target of miR-34a-5p, a microRNA involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. This interaction suggests a regulatory role at the protein level, potentially affecting NDUFA9's function in complex I (Hart2023miR34a5p).
