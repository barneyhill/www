# PEX19

## Overview
PEX19 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19, a protein integral to the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes, which are essential organelles involved in lipid metabolism and detoxification processes. The PEX19 protein functions as a chaperone and import receptor, specifically targeting peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) for proper insertion into the peroxisome membrane. It is characterized by a tripartite domain structure, with distinct regions facilitating interactions with various peroxins, such as Pex3p and Pex14p, which are crucial for its role in peroxisomal biogenesis (Fransen2005Analysis). Mutations in the PEX19 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger Spectrum Disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic function (Sacksteder2000Pex19; Bülow2018Unbalanced).

## Structure
The PEX19 protein is a key component in peroxisomal biogenesis, functioning as a receptor and chaperone for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs). It is a 299-residue protein with a distinct structural organization comprising a flexible N-terminal region and a structured C-terminal domain. The N-terminal region is crucial for interactions with Pex3p and Pex14p, facilitating docking at the peroxisome membrane (Fransen2005Analysis). The C-terminal domain forms a helical bundle, which is essential for binding PMP-targeting signals (mPTS) with moderate affinity (Schueller2010The; Kato2019Structure).

The C-terminal domain includes a farnesylation site, a post-translational modification that induces conformational changes, enhancing the protein's ability to bind PMPs by forming hydrophobic pockets (Emmanouilidis2017Allosteric). The farnesyl group is accommodated within a hydrophobic cavity formed by the domain's alpha-helices, stabilizing the structure and facilitating PMP recognition (Emmanouilidis2017Allosteric).

PEX19's structure is characterized by a tripartite domain organization, with specific regions dedicated to binding different peroxins, highlighting its multifunctional role in peroxisomal protein interactions (Fransen2005Analysis).

## Function
PEX19 is a predominantly cytosolic protein that functions as a chaperone and import receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) in human cells. It plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of peroxisomes by binding to a wide range of PMPs, including PMP70, PMP34, ALDR, PEX10, PEX12, PEX14, and PEX3, facilitating their proper targeting and insertion into the peroxisome membrane (Sacksteder2000Pex19). PEX19 stabilizes newly synthesized PMPs in the cytosol, preventing their misfolding and degradation, and directs them to the peroxisome membrane (Jones2004PEX19).

PEX19's interaction with PMPs is characterized by a reversible protein-protein interaction, with a dissociation constant of approximately 005 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Sacksteder2000Pex19). It is essential for the import of class 1 PMPs, as its inhibition leads to defects in PMP import and a reduction in peroxisome numbers (Jones2004PEX19). PEX19 does not affect the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, highlighting its specific role in PMP import (Jones2004PEX19). The absence or dysfunction of PEX19 can lead to peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, due to the mislocalization or degradation of PMPs (Sacksteder2000Pex19).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX19 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger Spectrum Disorders (ZSD), which are characterized by the absence of functional peroxisomes. These disorders result in metabolic abnormalities such as the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and branched fatty acids, as well as a depletion of ether lipids like plasmalogens, which are crucial for brain and lung health (Waterham2012Genetics; Lyschik2022PEX19). Zellweger syndrome, the most severe form of PBDs, is linked to mutations in PEX19, leading to the absence of peroxisomal structures and multiple metabolic dysfunctions (Sacksteder2000Pex19; Bülow2018Unbalanced).

PEX19 mutations can also cause mitochondrial abnormalities due to unbalanced lipolysis and increased free fatty acid accumulation, which contribute to mitochondrial damage and dysfunction (Bülow2018Unbalanced). These mitochondrial issues are linked to neurodegeneration and other symptoms observed in PBDs (Bülow2018Unbalanced). The interaction between PEX19 and other peroxisomal proteins, such as PEX3, is crucial for peroxisome formation, and disruptions in these interactions can exacerbate the clinical manifestations of these disorders (Muntau2003The).

## Interactions
PEX19 is a key player in peroxisomal biogenesis, interacting with various peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) to facilitate their import and assembly. It binds to multiple PMPs, including Pex3p, Pex10p, Pex11pβ, Pex12p, Pex13p, Pex14p, Pex16p, and Pex26p, with strong interactions particularly noted with Pex3p and Pex16p (Fransen2001Human; Matsuzono2006Functional). The interaction with Pex3p is essential for PEX19's function and translocation to peroxisomes, as Pex3p acts as a receptor for PEX19 (Snyder1999Pex19p; Sato2010Structural). 

PEX19 contains a CaaX farnesylation motif at its C-terminus, which is crucial for binding to certain peroxins like Pex10p, Pex11pβ, Pex12p, and Pex13p, but not necessary for Pex3p and Pex16p interactions (Fransen2001Human; Matsuzono2006Functional). The protein's domain structure is tripartite, with specific regions responsible for binding different peroxins. The N-terminal 51 amino acids are crucial for Pex3p binding, while residues 60-91 are necessary for interaction with Pex14p (Fransen2005Analysis). PEX19 also interacts with Pex14, where it binds in an orientation almost opposite to that of Pex5, highlighting its unique binding characteristics (Neufeld2009Structural).
