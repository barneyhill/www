in acidic pH environments. This protein is also expressed in the brain and choroid plexus where it transports folates into the central nervous system. This protein further functions as a heme transporter in duodenal enterocytes, and potentially in other tissues like liver and kidney. Its localization to the apical membrane or cytoplasm of intestinal cells is modulated by dietary iron levels. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive hereditary folate malabsorption disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
