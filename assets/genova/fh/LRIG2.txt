# LRIG2

## Overview
LRIG2, or leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways. The LRIG2 protein is characterized by its structural motifs, including leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRβ and EGFR. These interactions are crucial for modulating cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis, particularly in the context of glioblastoma and other cancers (Xiao2019[Corrigendum]; Simion2014The). Unlike its family member LRIG1, which functions as a tumor suppressor, LRIG2 is often associated with oncogenic activities, promoting tumor growth and progression through enhanced receptor signaling (Hoesl2019The). Clinically, mutations in the LRIG2 gene are linked to urofacial syndrome, a rare disorder affecting bladder function and facial expression, highlighting its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Grenier2022Neurogenic).

## Structure
The LRIG2 protein is an integral membrane protein characterized by its leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and immunoglobulin-like domains. The protein structure includes a signal peptide, an extracellular region with 15 LRRs, and three immunoglobulin-like domains, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (Xiao2019[Corrigendum]; Simion2014The). These structural motifs are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in the regulation of growth factor receptors.

The extracellular domains and the juxtamembrane portion of the cytoplasmic domains of LRIG2 show homology with other LRIG family members, although the remainder of the cytoplasmic domain diverges significantly, potentially imparting unique functions to LRIG2 (Simion2014The). The protein's structure facilitates its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFRβ, enhancing its expression and activation, which is significant in glioblastoma cell proliferation (Xiao2019[Corrigendum]).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of LRIG2 are not provided, the protein's domain architecture suggests a complex structure that supports its functional roles in cellular signaling pathways. The protein's involvement in various signaling pathways indicates potential post-translational modifications that could affect its function and localization, although these are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
LRIG2 is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways, particularly those involving receptor tyrosine kinases. Unlike its family member LRIG1, which acts as a tumor suppressor, LRIG2 does not significantly decrease the expression of growth factor receptors such as EGFR, ERBB2, or PDGFRA/B (Simion2014The). LRIG2 is co-expressed with Heparanase-2 (HPSE2) in human fetal bladder nerves, suggesting a role in peripheral nerve function (Simion2014The).

In the context of neural development, LRIG2 is implicated in the patterning of nerves in the urinary bladder, as evidenced by studies in mice. It is expressed in pelvic ganglia and contributes to the formation of nerve structures in the bladder (Roberts2019Lrig2). LRIG2 is also involved in auditory processing, where it is necessary for the neuronal response to sound, indicating its role in sensory neural functions (Simion2014The).

LRIG2's molecular activities include influencing the kinetics of immediate-early gene expression following PDGF-B stimulation, which may be functionally important in certain signaling pathways (Simion2014The). However, the precise molecular functions of LRIG2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRIG2 gene are associated with several medical conditions, most notably urofacial syndrome (UFS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. UFS is characterized by a dysfunctional bladder and a distinctive facial grimace. Biallelic variants in LRIG2, including stop or frameshift mutations, are linked to the full UFS phenotype, while missense variants are associated with severe functional bladder outlet obstruction without the facial grimace (Grenier2022Neurogenic). In Lrig2 mutant mice, these mutations lead to neurogenic defects in bladder outflow tract relaxation, resulting in functional bladder outflow obstruction (Grenier2022Neurogenic).

LRIG2 is also implicated in tumor biology. High expression levels of LRIG2 correlate with poor survival in patients with oligodendroglial brain tumors and are associated with tumor progression in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). LRIG2 promotes tumor growth by enhancing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) signaling pathways, which are often aberrant in GBM (Xiao2019[Corrigendum]; Rondahl2013Lrig2Deficient). These findings suggest that LRIG2 may act as a tumor promoter in certain cancers, contrasting with the tumor-suppressing role of LRIG1.

## Interactions
LRIG2 is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various signaling pathways. In glioblastoma cells, LRIG2 physically interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its activation and the downstream PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, contributing to glioblastoma progression (Xiao2014Soluble). LRIG2 also interacts with PDGFRβ, another receptor tyrosine kinase, enhancing its signaling activation. This interaction leads to increased phosphorylation of PDGFRβ and its downstream pathways, including Akt and Stat3, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation in glioblastoma cells (Xiao2019[Corrigendum]).

In skin carcinogenesis, LRIG2 interacts with thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), a protein involved in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. This interaction may stabilize LRIG2 and influence tumor progression through modulation of matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP2 (Hoesl2019The). LRIG2's role in skin cancer is also linked to its interaction with the EGFR/ERBB4-MAPK signaling pathway, where it promotes tumor progression by enhancing receptor activation and downstream signaling (Hoesl2019The). These interactions highlight LRIG2's role as an oncoprotein in various cancers, contributing to tumor growth and progression through modulation of key signaling pathways.
