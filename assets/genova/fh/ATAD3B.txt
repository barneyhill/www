# ATAD3B

## Overview
ATAD3B is a gene that encodes the ATPase family AAA domain-containing 3B protein, which is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the organization and segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Desai2017ATAD3; Merle2012ATAD3B). ATAD3B functions as a negative regulator of its paralog, ATAD3A, by forming hetero-oligomers that influence mitochondrial morphology and network organization (Merle2012ATAD3B). The protein is also involved in cholesterol metabolism and interacts with various mitochondrial components, including ribosomes and nucleic acids, highlighting its importance in mitochondrial translation and RNA metabolism (He2012Mitochondrial). Alterations in the ATAD3B gene are associated with several human diseases, including mitochondrial encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy metabolism (Lu2022ATAD3B).

## Structure
ATAD3B is a mitochondrial protein with a unique structure compared to its paralog ATAD3A. The primary structure of ATAD3B includes an additional C-terminal domain of 62 amino acids, enriched with hydrophobic amino acids and cysteine residues, due to a point mutation in the stop codon of ATAD3A (Merle2012ATAD3B). This C-terminal domain is localized in the intermembrane space (IMS) and is sensitive to trypsin digestion, indicating a distinct sub-mitochondrial positioning compared to ATAD3A (Merle2012ATAD3B).

ATAD3B has several isoforms, including Q5T9A4-1 (ATAD3Bl, 72-648 amino acids), Q5T9A4-2 (19-166 amino acids), and Q5T9A4-3 (ATAD3Bs, 66-602 amino acids), which arise from alternative translation initiation sites and splicing events (Li2014Expression). The existence of other potential variants, such as those with 482, 299, and 116 amino acids, has been suggested but not experimentally confirmed (Li2014Expression).

ATAD3B interacts with ATAD3A, forming hetero-oligomers, and influences mitochondrial network shape by acting as a dominant negative regulator of ATAD3A (Merle2012ATAD3B). The protein's role in mitochondrial dynamics and its re-expression in cancer cells highlight its functional significance.

## Function
ATAD3B is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) organization and cellular homeostasis. It is part of the AAA+ ATPase family and is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in the organization and segregation of mtDNA. ATAD3B is associated with the mitochondrial nucleoid complex, which is crucial for mtDNA metabolism and stability (Desai2017ATAD3; Merle2012ATAD3B).

In healthy human cells, ATAD3B functions as a negative regulator of the ubiquitous ATAD3A protein. It forms hetero-oligomers with ATAD3A and modulates its interaction with the mitochondrial nucleoid complex, impacting mitochondrial structure and function (Merle2012ATAD3B). This regulatory role is associated with mitochondrial fragmentation phenotypes, suggesting that ATAD3B influences mitochondrial morphology and network organization (Merle2012ATAD3B).

ATAD3B is also involved in cholesterol metabolism within mitochondria, co-purifying with enzymes involved in sphingolipid synthesis, which form membrane micro-domains with cholesterol. This interaction is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper mitochondrial function (Desai2017ATAD3). Overall, ATAD3B's activities are crucial for the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the ATAD3B gene are linked to several human diseases, primarily due to its critical role in mitochondrial function. Dysfunction in ATAD3B can lead to mitochondrial encephalopathy, a condition characterized by brain dysfunction due to mitochondrial abnormalities. It is also associated with various heart dysfunctions, including hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia such as QTc interval prolongation, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death (Lu2022ATAD3B). The gene's involvement in mitochondrial metabolism and mtDNA maintenance is crucial, and disruptions can result in cerebellar dysfunction, developmental delay, hypotonia, optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, and psychiatric disorders. These conditions are linked to the gene's role in brain energy metabolism, mitochondrial functions, and redox balance (Lu2022ATAD3B).

In the context of antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia, a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ATAD3B gene, rs200050752, has been identified as significantly associated with changes in the QTc interval, a measure of cardiac electrical activity. This association underscores the gene's potential impact on cardiac health in patients undergoing such treatments (Lu2022ATAD3B).

## Interactions
ATAD3B is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the mitochondria. It co-fractionates with mitochondrial RNA and co-purifies with mitochondrial ribosomes, indicating a role in mitochondrial translation or RNA metabolism. This interaction is supported by the co-purification of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins MRPS18B and MRPL11 with a tagged version of ATAD3B expressed in HEK293T cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments further confirm the interaction of ATAD3B with mitochondrial ribosomes, capturing four subunits of the 55S ribosome using an anti-ATAD3 antibody (He2012Mitochondrial).

ATAD3B also interacts with CRIF1 and the mitochondrial DNA polymerase POLG1, with CRIF1 being a likely partner based on immunoprecipitation results (He2012Mitochondrial). Overexpression of ATAD3B in HEK293T cells affects mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and topology, suggesting that ATAD3B may aggregate separately from mtDNA, leading to a loss of function of endogenous ATAD3 (He2012Mitochondrial). Additionally, ATAD3B is identified as a physical partner of SFXN1, along with HSD10 and TIM50, in a study using high-throughput methods to explore protein interactions (Tifoun2022A). These interactions highlight ATAD3B's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics and nucleoid organization.
