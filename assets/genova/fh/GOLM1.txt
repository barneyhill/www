# GOLM1

## Overview
Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein, also known as Golgi phosphoprotein 2 (GOLPH2) or Golgi protein 73 (GP73). This protein is predominantly localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in the processing, modification, and trafficking of proteins and lipids synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. As a key component of the cellular secretory pathway, GOLM1 is involved in maintaining Golgi structure and function, which is essential for cellular homeostasis (Xu2017PDGFA/PDGFRα-regulated). The protein is constitutively expressed in various epithelial cells, including those in the prostate, stomach, and central nervous system, and is highly phosphorylated, which influences its role in cellular secretion and membrane composition (Ding2019GOLM1). GOLM1's interactions with other proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Dymeclin, further underscore its importance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Denais2011Dymeclin; Zhu2016GOLM1regulated).

## Structure


## Function
Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1), also known as Golgi phosphoprotein 2 (GOLPH2) or Golgi protein 73 (GP73), is a type II transmembrane protein located in the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the processing and transport of proteins synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, assisting in their trafficking through the Golgi apparatus. GOLM1 plays a crucial role in modifying proteins and lipids, ensuring their proper sorting and delivery to various cellular destinations, which is essential for maintaining Golgi structure and function (Xu2017PDGFA/PDGFRα-regulated).

In healthy human cells, GOLM1 is constitutively expressed in epithelial cells, particularly in the prostate, stomach, and central nervous system (Ding2019GOLM1). It is highly phosphorylated and involved in the regulation of cellular secretion and membrane composition, impacting various cellular processes. The protein's activity is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by facilitating the proper functioning of the secretory pathway (Xu2017PDGFA/PDGFRα-regulated). Despite its fundamental role in protein trafficking, specific details about its molecular activities in healthy cells remain less explored in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
The GOLM1 gene, encoding Golgi membrane protein 1, is implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), a specific polymorphism, rs10868366, in the GOLM1 gene is associated with structural brain changes. Individuals with the GG genotype of this polymorphism exhibit a significant reduction in gray matter volume in the left frontal gyrus, suggesting a potential risk factor for cognitive deficits in AD (Inkster2012Genetic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GOLM1 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues, serving as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis. High GOLM1 expression correlates with poor overall survival, indicating its role as an independent prognostic factor (Chen2013Expression; Wang2020Golgi). GOLM1 is also involved in the progression of uveal melanoma (UVM), where its high expression is linked to worse prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target and a marker for immunotherapy response (Liang2022GOLM1).

In prostate cancer, GOLM1 is significantly upregulated, with higher expression levels associated with worse overall survival, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Sun2021Identification).

## Interactions
GOLM1, also known as GP73, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function and role in disease processes. It physically interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). This interaction is crucial for the enhancement of downstream AKT/S6K activation and cell migration, which are important in cancer metastasis (Zhu2016GOLM1regulated). GOLM1 also interacts with Dymeclin, a protein associated with Golgi organization and protein secretion pathways. This interaction was validated through GST pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a role in maintaining Golgi structure and function (Denais2011Dymeclin).

GOLM1 is cleaved by proprotein convertases, particularly furin, during its trafficking from the Golgi to endosomes. This cleavage is essential for its release into the extracellular environment, where it may interact with other proteins or serve as a biomarker for diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (Bachert2007Endosomal). The presence of coiled-coil domains in GOLM1 suggests potential for further protein-protein interactions, although specific partners beyond those mentioned are not detailed in the provided context (Kladney2000GP73).
