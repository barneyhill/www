# ZSWIM6

## Overview
ZSWIM6 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger SWIM-type containing 6 protein, which is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and DNA binding. The protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its SWIM-type zinc finger domain, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. ZSWIM6 is highly conserved across species, underscoring its functional significance, particularly in neurodevelopmental processes. It is expressed in a developmentally regulated manner in the brain, with notable expression in regions such as the telencephalon and striatum. The protein is implicated in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and the ubiquitin pathway, interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Mutations in the ZSWIM6 gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including acromelic frontonasal dysostosis and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (Smith2014Exome; Tischfield2017Loss; Palmer2017A).

## Structure
The ZSWIM6 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its molecular structure. It contains a SWIM-type zinc finger domain, which is implicated in DNA and protein binding, located between amino acids 246-283 (Palmer2017A). This domain is similar to those found in SWI2/SNF2 and MuDR proteins. The protein also features a BC-box between amino acids 72-79 and a Cul2-box between 99-107, suggesting a role in ubiquitin-mediated processes (Palmer2017A). Additionally, it has a Cut8/STS1-like domain spanning amino acids 285-482 and a C-terminal Sin-3 like domain from 1,148-1,215, which is involved in gene regulation in neuronal progenitors (Palmer2017A).

The ZSWIM6 protein is encoded by 14 exons and has a molecular weight of approximately 133.5 kDa (Palmer2017A). The presence of these domains suggests a complex tertiary structure, although specific details on the secondary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The protein's structure and function may be influenced by post-translational modifications, although these are not detailed in the context. The c.2737C>T variant results in a truncated protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which may have a dominant-negative effect (Palmer2017A).

## Function
The ZSWIM6 gene encodes a protein that contains a zinc finger SWIM domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and DNA binding. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and signal transduction, and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Smith2014Exome). ZSWIM6 is highly conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Smith2014Exome).

In healthy human cells, ZSWIM6 is associated with neurodevelopmental processes. It is expressed in a developmentally regulated manner in the brain, with high expression in regions such as the telencephalon, midbrain, hindbrain, and retina during early development, and later becoming restricted to the striatum (Palmer2017A). The protein's structure includes an all-alpha-helical topology with conserved regions that suggest a role in maintaining biochemical function (Smith2014Exome).

ZSWIM6 is thought to be involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription through interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes (Tischfield2017Loss). It may also play a role in the ubiquitin pathway, as suggested by its association with disorders of ubiquitination (Palmer2017A). The precise molecular mechanisms and functions of ZSWIM6 in healthy cells remain areas for further research.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZSWIM6 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders. A recurrent de novo mutation, c.3487C>T, in the ZSWIM6 gene is linked to acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), a rare disorder characterized by craniofacial, brain, and limb malformations. This mutation disrupts a highly conserved protein domain, potentially affecting protein-protein interactions and the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Smith2014Exome).

Another variant, p.Arg913Ter, is associated with severe intellectual disability without frontonasal or limb malformations. This variant is thought to have a dominant-negative effect due to the presence of a truncated protein that escapes nonsense-mediated decay. Affected individuals often exhibit neurological symptoms such as spasticity, neuropathy, and autism spectrum disorder traits (Palmer2017A).

ZSWIM6 has also been implicated in schizophrenia and educational attainment, with its expression linked to brain regions involved in these conditions. Knockout studies in mice have shown that loss of ZSWIM6 results in striatal abnormalities and motor regulation issues, suggesting its role in neurodevelopmental processes (Tischfield2017Loss).

## Interactions
ZSWIM6 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. The protein contains a SWIM-type zinc finger domain, which is known for its role in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. One significant interaction is with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HECW2, which is associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy. This interaction suggests a role for ZSWIM6 in the ubiquitin pathway, potentially influencing protein degradation and cellular signaling processes (Tischfield2017Loss).

The ZSWIM6 protein also shares a region similar to Sin3 proteins, which are known to interact with REST proteins involved in gene repression. This suggests that ZSWIM6 may participate in transcriptional regulation through interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes (Smith2014Exome). The p.Arg1163Trp mutation in ZSWIM6 is predicted to disrupt the protein's surface charge pattern, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, indicating the importance of these interactions in maintaining normal protein function (Smith2014Exome).

In addition, ZSWIM6 is implicated in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription, potentially through interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes, which may be relevant to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Tischfield2017Loss).
