# CHRNA10

## Overview
The CHRNA10 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 10 subunit, a component of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family, which is categorized as a ligand-gated ion channel. This protein is primarily involved in synaptic transmission and is expressed in various tissues, including the inner ear and lymphoid tissues. The alpha 10 subunit, when co-assembled with the alpha 9 subunit, forms functional receptors that play a critical role in the efferent cholinergic response of cochlear hair cells, influencing auditory processing and sensory perception (Lustig2001Molecular; Ehringer2010Association). Additionally, the CHRNA10 protein is implicated in calcium-dependent processes due to its high calcium permeability, which may also affect immune system regulation (Lustig2001Molecular). While the gene has been studied for its potential associations with nicotine and alcohol dependence, no direct link to specific diseases has been established (Schaaf2014Nicotinic; Zuo2016Associations).

## Structure
The CHRNA10 gene encodes a protein that is part of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family, specifically the alpha 10 subunit. The complete cDNA sequence of CHRNA10 is 1959 base pairs long, with a coding sequence of 1353 nucleotides, predicting a protein of 451 amino acids (Lustig2001Molecular). The primary structure of the CHRNA10 protein is its amino acid sequence, which shares 90% identity with the rat CHRNA10 and 53% identity with the human CHRNA9 (Lustig2001Molecular).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of membrane proteins, with four hydrophobic regions predicting membrane-spanning regions I through IV (Lustig2001Molecular). The protein also contains four signature cysteine residues near the putative ligand-binding domain (Lustig2001Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a three-dimensional conformation, forming the ligand-binding domain and membrane-spanning regions (Lustig2001Molecular). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of CHRNA10 with other nAChR subunits to form a functional receptor complex (Lustig2001Molecular). The CHRNA10 protein is expressed in the human inner ear, tonsil tissue, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Lustig2001Molecular).

## Function
The CHRNA10 gene encodes the α10 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is part of the ligand-gated ion channel family involved in synaptic transmission. This receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the inner ear, tonsil tissue, and peripheral blood lymphocytes, such as B-cells and T-cells (Lustig2001Molecular). The α10 subunit, when co-expressed with the α9 subunit, forms functional receptors that are involved in the transmission of the inner-ear efferent cholinergic response, contributing to sensory processing and neural communication (Lustig2001Molecular; Ehringer2010Association).

In the inner ear, the α10 subunit is suggested to play a role in mediating the inhibitory efferent effect on cochlear hair cells, potentially influencing auditory processing (Lustig2002Chromosome). The receptor's high calcium permeability and ability to bind α-bungarotoxin are shared physiological features with other nAChRs, which may contribute to calcium-dependent processes in both hair cells and lymphocytes (Lustig2001Molecular). The presence of α10 in lymphoid tissue suggests a potential role in the parasympathetic regulation of the immune system, as nicotine can induce anergy in lymphocytes by impairing their response to antigen-induced signaling (Lustig2001Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
The CHRNA10 gene, encoding the alpha 10 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been studied for its potential role in nicotine and alcohol dependence. Research indicates that rare variants in CHRNA10 are nominally associated with alcohol dependence in African Americans and nicotine dependence in European Americans (Zuo2016Associations). These associations suggest that CHRNA10 may contribute to the genetic predisposition to these dependencies, although the associations are not as strong as those observed with other nicotinic receptor genes like CHRNA5-A3-B4 (Zuo2016Associations).

In terms of auditory function, studies on mice lacking the α10 subunit have shown that its absence does not significantly alter the spiking activity or the developmental expression of voltage-gated and calcium-sensitive potassium channels in cochlear inner hair cells (GómezCasati2009Electrical). This suggests that while the α10 subunit is involved in early cochlear development, it is not essential for the functional maturation of these cells (GómezCasati2009Electrical).

Despite these findings, there are no known diseases or conditions directly linked to mutations or alterations in the CHRNA10 gene according to current genetic disease databases (Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

## Interactions
The CHRNA10 gene encodes the alpha 10 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which primarily form heteromeric complexes with the alpha 9 subunit. These receptors are involved in synaptic transmission in cochlear hair cells and are regulated by various protein interactions. 

CHRNA10 interacts with the auxiliary subunit TMIE, which influences channel gating by slowing deactivation, suggesting a direct interaction with the receptor. This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a stable association between α9α10 nAChRs and TMIE (Gu2020Hair). TMIE, along with other proteins such as TMEM132e, is necessary for the functional expression of α9α10 receptors, acting as an auxiliary subunit that modulates receptor activity (Gu2020Hair).

The α9α10 nAChRs also interact with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), which enhances the surface expression of these receptors. ChAT synergizes with other proteins to promote α9α10 channel function, highlighting its role in receptor assembly and surface expression (Gu2020Hair). These interactions are crucial for the biogenesis and functional expression of α9α10 receptors, impacting auditory processes and potential therapeutic targets for hearing loss (Gu2020Hair).
