# ZSCAN26

## Overview
ZSCAN26 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 26, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, and are often involved in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a leucine-rich region that facilitates protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ZSCAN26 may play a role in transcriptional regulation through complex formation with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of ZSCAN26 remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply a potential role in gene expression modulation and cellular processes that require precise transcriptional control.
