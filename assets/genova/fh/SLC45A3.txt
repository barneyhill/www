# SLC45A3

## Overview
SLC45A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 45 member 3, also known as Prostein. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family, which is involved in the transport of molecules across cellular membranes. SLC45A3 functions as a proton-dependent sugar transporter, playing a role in pH regulation and ion homeostasis within cells (Lewis2021“SLComics”). It is expressed in various tissues, including the renal tubule and the central nervous system, where it is primarily located in oligodendrocytes, contributing to myelination and fatty acid metabolism (Zhang2023SLC45A3). In the prostate, SLC45A3 is regulated by androgen and is implicated in cellular metabolism and growth, with alterations in its expression linked to prostate cancer (Qin2016Role). The gene's involvement in various physiological and pathological processes underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states.

## Function
SLC45A3, also known as Prostein, is a member of the solute carrier family involved in transporting molecules across cellular membranes. It functions as a proton-dependent sugar transporter, potentially influencing pH regulation and ion homeostasis in cells (Lewis2021“SLComics”). SLC45A3 is broadly expressed along the renal tubule and is proposed to function as an osmolyte transporter in the medullary collecting duct, similar to other transporters like Slc6a12 and Slc5a3, which are involved in osmotic regulation and glucose metabolism (Lewis2021“SLComics”).

In the context of the central nervous system, SLC45A3 is primarily located in oligodendrocytes, which are crucial for myelination. It plays a role in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and fatty acid metabolic processes, particularly following intracerebral hemorrhage (Zhang2023SLC45A3). The gene's expression in oligodendrocytes suggests its involvement in maintaining the integrity of white matter and potentially ameliorating brain injury (Zhang2023SLC45A3).

SLC45A3 is also expressed in the prostate, where it may play a role in cellular metabolism and growth. Its expression is regulated by various factors, including androgen, which can influence its levels in prostate cancer cells (Qin2016Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC45A3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly prostate cancer. The SLC45A3-ELK4 chimeric RNA, resulting from cis-splicing between SLC45A3 and ELK4, is associated with prostate carcinogenesis. This chimeric RNA is expressed at higher levels in some prostate cancer samples compared to benign tissues, and its silencing can lead to cell growth arrest in prostate cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Qin2016Role). Additionally, the SLC45A3-ERG gene fusion, although less common than TMPRSS2-ERG, is present in a subset of prostate cancer cases and is driven by androgen and estrogen, encoding truncated ERG proteins (Esgueva2010Prevalence).

In multifocal prostate cancer, loss of SLC45A3 expression is associated with the 'triple hit' phenotype, which includes ERG overexpression and PTEN loss, and is linked to a shorter time to PSA recurrence, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Segalés2023Immunohistochemical). Beyond cancer, SLC45A3 has been implicated in pulmonary hypertension, where its overexpression in the lungs of affected rats suggests a role in the disease's development (Le2020In). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC45A3 in various pathological conditions.
