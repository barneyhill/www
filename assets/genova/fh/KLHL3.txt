# KLHL3

## Overview
KLHL3 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 3, which is a crucial component of the BTB-BACK-Kelch family of proteins. This protein functions as a substrate adaptor in Cullin3 (Cul3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, playing a significant role in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure. The KLHL3 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including the BTB, BACK, and Kelch domains, which facilitate its interaction with WNK kinases, particularly WNK4. These interactions are essential for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of WNK4, thereby influencing renal sodium-chloride reabsorption and potassium secretion. Mutations in the KLHL3 gene can lead to conditions such as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, also known as Gordon syndrome, which is marked by hypertension and electrolyte imbalances (Wakabayashi2013Impaired; Boyden2012Mutations).

## Structure
The KLHL3 protein is a member of the BTB-BACK-Kelch family, characterized by distinct structural domains that facilitate its function as a substrate adaptor in Cullin3 (Cul3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. The protein contains an N-terminal BTB domain, a BACK domain, and a C-terminal Kelch domain. The BTB domain is involved in dimerization and forms a three-stranded beta-sheet flanked by seven alpha-helices, with the first two helices contributing significantly to the dimerization interface (Ji2013Crystal). The BACK domain, spanning residues 150-276, is similar to those found in KLHL11 and Gigaxonin and is expected to consist of four sets of helical hairpins, although only the first five helices could be reliably modeled (Ji2013Crystal).

The Kelch domain forms a β-propeller structure composed of six Kelch repeats, each with four antiparallel β-strands, and is crucial for binding to WNK kinases (Schumacher2014Structural). Mutations in the Kelch domain, such as R528H and N529K, are associated with Gordon's syndrome and affect the protein's binding affinity (Schumacher2014Structural). Phosphorylation at serine 433 in the Kelch domain can impair its interaction with WNK4 by altering the electrostatic environment (Wang2016Phosphorylation). The protein's quaternary structure involves forming a 2:2 complex with Cul3, with two chains of Cul3 NTD bound to two surfaces of a KLHL3 BTB-BACK homodimer (Ji2013Crystal).

## Function
The KLHL3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a substrate adaptor in a Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of WNK4, a kinase involved in the regulation of electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure (Wakabayashi2013Impaired; Shibata2013Kelchlike). In healthy human cells, KLHL3 facilitates the ubiquitination of WNK4, leading to its degradation, which is essential for maintaining proper levels of WNK4 and preventing excessive inhibition of the ROMK potassium channel (Shibata2013Kelchlike). This regulation is vital for controlling renal sodium-chloride reabsorption and potassium secretion, thereby maintaining electrolyte balance and normal blood pressure (Boyden2012Mutations; Shibata2013Kelchlike).

KLHL3 is predominantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney, where it plays a significant role in regulating salt and electrolyte homeostasis (Boyden2012Mutations). The protein's activity in the cytoplasm influences cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of ion transporters in the kidney (Wakabayashi2013Impaired). Mutations in KLHL3 can impair its function, leading to conditions such as pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, characterized by hypertension and electrolyte imbalances (Wakabayashi2013Impaired).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KLHL3 gene are associated with Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), also known as Gordon syndrome, a rare form of monogenic hypertension. This condition is characterized by hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. KLHL3 mutations can be either dominant or recessive, with dominant mutations often clustering in specific regions of the protein, affecting its interaction with substrates and Cullin 3 (CUL3) (Mabillard2019The; Boyden2012Mutations). These mutations disrupt the CUL3-KLHL3 E3 ligase complex, impairing the ubiquitination and degradation of WNK kinases, particularly WNK4, leading to increased activity of the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) in the distal nephron. This results in enhanced renal salt retention and contributes to the symptoms of Gordon syndrome (Wakabayashi2013Impaired; Ohta2013The).

The clinical features of Gordon syndrome, such as low renin hypertension and hyperkalemia, can be effectively managed with thiazide diuretics and a low sodium diet, which normalize blood pressure and serum electrolytes (Park2017Three). The discovery of KLHL3's role in this syndrome highlights its importance in blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis (Boyden2012Mutations).

## Interactions
KLHL3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating blood pressure through its involvement in the ubiquitination and degradation of WNK kinases. KLHL3 forms a complex with Cullin 3 (CUL3), functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets WNK isoforms for ubiquitination. This interaction is essential for the regulation of WNK1 and WNK4, which are involved in electrolyte homeostasis (Ohta2013The; Shibata2013Kelchlike).

Mutations in KLHL3, such as R528H and S432N, can impair its ability to bind WNK isoforms, disrupting the ubiquitination process and leading to conditions like pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII) (Wakabayashi2013Impaired; Ohta2013The). The interaction between KLHL3 and WNK4 involves the binding of the WNK4 acidic degron motif to the Kelch domains of KLHL3, with mutations in these regions significantly reducing binding affinity (Schumacher2014Structural).

Phosphorylation of KLHL3 at serine 433 (S433) also affects its interaction with WNK4 by altering the electrostatic environment, which impairs the binding of the negatively charged acidic motif of WNK4 (Wang2016Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight the critical role of KLHL3 in maintaining blood pressure regulation through its modulation of WNK kinase activity.
