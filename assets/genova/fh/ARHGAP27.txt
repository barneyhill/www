# ARHGAP27

## Overview
ARHGAP27 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 27, which is involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases. These proteins are critical for various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. Rho GTPase activating protein 27 functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which facilitates the conversion of active GTP-bound Rho GTPases to their inactive GDP-bound state, thereby modulating their signaling pathways. The precise role of ARHGAP27 in cellular physiology and its potential implications in human diseases are areas of active research, with studies suggesting its involvement in pathways related to cell morphology and motility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
