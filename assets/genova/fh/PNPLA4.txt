# PNPLA4

## Overview
PNPLA4 is a gene that encodes the protein patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 4, which is a member of the PNPLA family. This protein is categorized as a phospholipase and is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the metabolism of retinol and its esters. PNPLA4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the epidermis, where it plays a significant role in regulating retinol access from storage depots. The protein's enzymatic activities, including retinol transacylase and retinyl ester hydrolase functions, are crucial for various physiological processes such as vision, epithelial cell growth, and immune function. Structurally, PNPLA4 is characterized by a conserved patatin domain and a catalytic dyad, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Holmes2012Vertebrate; Lulić2023The).

## Structure
The PNPLA4 protein, also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 4, is a member of the PNPLA family and is involved in retinol metabolism. It is one of the smallest proteins in this family, consisting of 252-255 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 Da (Holmes2012Vertebrate). The primary structure of PNPLA4 includes a conserved patatin domain, spanning residues 6-176, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Holmes2012Vertebrate).

The secondary structure of PNPLA4 is characterized by five alpha-helices and five beta-sheets. The N-terminal alpha-helix may function as a membrane anchor, although it lacks predicted trans-membrane properties (Holmes2012Vertebrate). The tertiary structure of PNPLA4 is predicted to be similar to that of potato patatin, indicating strong evolutionary conservation. Key structural features include a catalytic dyad composed of Ser43 and Asp163, and an active site motif Gly-Xaa-Ser-Yaa-Gly (Holmes2012Vertebrate).

PNPLA4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and is located in the cytoplasm in a membrane-free form. It contains only the N-terminal domain with the active site, which accommodates the patatin domain and the catalytic dyad (Lulić2023The). The protein's activity is regulated by pH, with hydrolysis being stronger at neutral pH and transacylase activity at acidic pH (Lulić2023The).

## Function
PNPLA4, also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 4, is involved in lipid metabolism, specifically functioning as a retinol transacylase and retinyl ester hydrolase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in retinol-ester metabolism, particularly in the epidermis, where it regulates access to retinol from storage depots. Retinol and its derivatives are essential for various physiological functions, including vision, epithelial cell growth and differentiation, bone tissue growth, immune function, and activation of tumor suppressor genes (Holmes2012Vertebrate).

PNPLA4 is expressed in almost every tissue of the body, including adipose tissue, liver, muscles, kidneys, lungs, placenta, and brain. It is located in the cytoplasm in a membrane-free form, containing only the N-terminal domain with the active site. The enzyme's retinyl ester hydrolase activity in the skin and transacylase activities are inversely regulated by pH, with hydrolysis being stronger at neutral pH and transacylase activity at acidic pH (Lulić2023The).

The protein is characterized by a conserved amino acid sequence and a Ser-Asp catalytic dyad, which is distinct from the Ser-His-Asp/Glu triad found in other lipases. The predicted tertiary structure of PNPLA4 is similar to that of potato patatin, indicating strong evolutionary conservation (Holmes2012Vertebrate).
