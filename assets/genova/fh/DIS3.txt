# DIS3

## Overview
DIS3 is a gene that encodes a protein known as DIS3 homolog, exosome endoribonuclease, and 3'-5' exoribonuclease, which is a critical component of the RNA exosome complex. This protein is categorized as a ribonuclease, possessing both exonucleolytic and endoribonucleolytic activities, which are essential for RNA processing and degradation. The DIS3 protein is primarily located in the nucleus and plays a pivotal role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by degrading a wide range of RNA molecules, including protein-coding RNAs, ribosomal RNA, and long non-coding RNAs. Its activities are crucial for RNA quality control and mRNA decay, thereby shaping the RNA polymerase II transcriptome. Mutations in the DIS3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, such as multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Szczepińska2015DIS3; Kuliński2023Multiple; Tomecki2013Multiple).

## Structure
The DIS3 protein is a catalytic subunit of the RNA exosome complex, crucial for RNA processing and degradation. It contains two main domains: the RNB domain, responsible for 3'-5' exonucleolytic activity, and the PIN domain, which provides endoribonucleolytic activity (Szczepińska2015DIS3; Tomecki2013Multiple). The RNB domain is a conserved region essential for the protein's exoribonucleolytic function, and mutations in this domain can disrupt RNA binding and enzymatic activity (Tomecki2013Multiple). The PIN domain is involved in endoribonucleolytic activity and is considered a potential drug target due to its role in RNA metabolism perturbations (Tomecki2013Multiple).

DIS3 is primarily located in the nucleus, excluding the nucleolus, and forms part of the exosome complex, indicating a quaternary structure (Szczepińska2015DIS3). The exosome complex itself is a macromolecular assembly with a nine-subunit ring that is catalytically inert but influences the enzymatic activities of associated nucleases like DIS3 (Kobyłecki2018Elimination). DIS3's structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its tertiary structure, although specific details on its primary, secondary, or quaternary structures are not extensively detailed in the available literature. There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
The DIS3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the human RNA exosome complex, which is essential for RNA processing and degradation. This protein exhibits both exonucleolytic and endoribonucleolytic activities, facilitated by its RNB and PIN domains, respectively (Tomecki2013Multiple). DIS3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it degrades a wide range of RNA molecules, including protein-coding RNAs, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNAs, introns, long non-coding RNAs, and unstable RNA products like Promoter Upstream Transcripts (PROMPTs) (Saramago2019The).

In healthy human cells, DIS3 plays a vital role in maintaining RNA homeostasis by degrading unnecessary or faulty RNA molecules, thus preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful RNA species (Tomecki2013Multiple). It is involved in the processing of stable RNA species, RNA quality control, and mRNA decay, shaping the RNA polymerase II transcriptome by degrading unwanted transcripts (Szczepińska2015DIS3). DIS3 is also crucial for the processing of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and the formation of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies organized around NEAT1 lncRNA (Szczepińska2015DIS3).

The protein's activities are essential for the survival of vertebrate cells, as its dysfunction can lead to the accumulation of unwanted transcripts and global dysregulation of gene expression (Szczepińska2015DIS3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DIS3 gene are frequently associated with multiple myeloma (MM), a type of hematologic cancer. These mutations, particularly in the RNB domain, impair the exonucleolytic activity of DIS3, leading to disruptions in RNA metabolism and contributing to oncogenic processes. In MM, DIS3 mutations are linked to increased genomic instability and AID-dependent immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocations, which are critical in the disease's progression (Kuliński2023Multiple). 

The G766R variant of DIS3, for example, shows higher chromatin occupancy, which may lead to stalling on RNA substrates and increased DNA damage in activated B cells, promoting oncogenic translocations (Kuliński2023Multiple). Despite these mutations, class switch recombination remains unaffected, suggesting a gain-of-function phenotype that induces oncogenic translocations without disrupting essential exosome functions (Kuliński2023Multiple).

In addition to MM, DIS3 mutations have been identified in other cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations can lead to the accumulation of RNA processing intermediates and affect cell growth and survival, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis (Segalla2015The; Tomecki2013Multiple). The dysfunction of DIS3 is also associated with altered miRNA processing, particularly affecting the let-7 miRNA pathway, which can enhance the translation of oncogenes like MYC and RAS, further contributing to cancer development (Segalla2015The).

## Interactions
The DIS3 protein, a catalytic component of the RNA exosome complex, engages in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms part of the EXO10 complex by associating with the EXO9 core of the exosome and can further interact with Rrp6 to form the EXO11 complex (Kilchert2016The). DIS3 contains both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic active domains, facilitated by its RNB and PIN domains, which are crucial for its interaction with the exosome core (Saramago2019The). The PIN domain also plays a structural role necessary for DIS3's association with the exosome core (Schaeffer2008The).

DIS3 interacts with a wide range of RNA substrates, including protein-coding RNAs, rRNA, tRNAs, snoRNAs, introns, long non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, and unstable RNA products like PROMPTs (Saramago2019The). It is involved in the degradation of unwanted RNA transcripts, including those from unannotated genomic regions and pervasive transcription products (Szczepińska2015DIS3). DIS3's interaction with RNA is facilitated by its cold shock domains (CSD1 and CSD2) and an S1 domain, which contribute to RNA binding (Saramago2019The). The protein also interacts with the NEXT complex, composed of the RNA helicase SKIV2L2 and two RNA-binding proteins, which acts as a cofactor for the nucleoplasmic exosome (Szczepińska2015DIS3).
