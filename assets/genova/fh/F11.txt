# F11

## Overview
The F11 gene encodes coagulation factor XI (FXI), a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. FXI is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as a homodimer, which is essential for its function in hemostasis. The protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising four tandem apple domains and a serine protease catalytic domain, which facilitate its interactions with other components of the coagulation cascade. Upon activation, FXI enhances the conversion of factor IX to its active form, factor IXa, thereby contributing to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation. Mutations in the F11 gene can lead to FXI deficiency, a condition associated with a variable bleeding tendency, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in maintaining normal hemostatic balance (Sennblad2017Genomewide; Saunders2005Factor; Hayakawa2021Essential).

## Structure
Coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a plasma glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. The FXI protein is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of four tandem apple domains (A1, A2, A3, and A4) and a carboxyl-terminal serine protease catalytic domain (Saunders2005Factor; Hayakawa2021Essential). The apple domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, with the A4 domain being particularly important for dimer formation through a disulfide bond involving cysteine 321 (Cys321) (Cheng2003Factor). 

The quaternary structure of FXI is unique among coagulation factors, as it circulates as a dimer linked by noncovalent interactions and a Cys321-Cys321 disulfide bond (Saunders2005Factor). This dimeric structure is essential for FXI's secretion and function, particularly in the activation of factor IX (FIX) on the surface of activated platelets (Cheng2003Factor). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for the stability and function of FXI (Saunders2005Factor). Mutations in the F11 gene can lead to FXI deficiency, affecting the protein's secretion and function (Hayakawa2021Essential). The structural arrangement of FXI domains has been modeled, providing insights into the protein's function and the impact of genetic mutations (Saunders2005Factor).

## Function
The F11 gene encodes coagulation factor XI (FXI), a crucial component of the blood coagulation process. FXI is produced in the liver and circulates in the blood as a homodimer, complexed with high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (Sennblad2017Genomewide). It plays a significant role in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. Upon activation by coagulation factor XII (FXII), activated FXI (FXIa) subsequently activates coagulation factor IX (FIX), which initiates the common pathway of the coagulation cascade, leading to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation (Sennblad2017Genomewide; Hayakawa2021Essential).

FXI is present in plasma at levels of 3 to 7 µg/ml, with activity ranging from 70 to 150 IU/dl in normal human plasma (Hayakawa2021Essential). Structurally, FXI is a homodimer formed via a disulfide bond, essential for its secretion and enzymatic function (Hayakawa2021Essential). The C-terminal α-helix motif of FXI is crucial for its secretion, as it facilitates proper ER-to-Golgi trafficking, ensuring that FXI reaches the bloodstream (Hayakawa2021Essential). FXI's role in the coagulation cascade is vital for hemostasis, as it contributes to the stabilization and propagation of thrombi, which are essential for preventing excessive bleeding following vascular injury (Sennblad2017Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F11 gene, which encodes coagulation factor XI, are associated with Factor XI deficiency, a bleeding disorder also known as hemophilia C. This condition is characterized by a variable bleeding tendency, often triggered by surgery or trauma, particularly in areas with high fibrinolytic activity (Saunders2005Factor; Mitchell2006Spectrum). The disorder is more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews due to specific founder mutations, such as E117X and F283L, which account for a significant proportion of cases in this population (Asakai1989Factor; Mitchell2006Spectrum). In the Basque population, the Cys38Arg mutation is predominant, suggesting a founder effect (Zivelin2002Factor).

Factor XI deficiency can result from various types of mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splicing mutations, which can impair the secretion or function of the protein (ZUCKER2011Point; Zucker2007Characterization). The severity of the deficiency is categorized based on FXI activity levels, with severe cases having less than 15-20 IU/dL and partial cases between 20-70 IU/dL (Ciampa2020Heterozygote). Despite the deficiency, the correlation between FXI activity and bleeding risk is not always straightforward, as other genetic factors may influence the clinical presentation (Saunders2005Factor; Ciampa2020Heterozygote).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor XI (F11) is involved in several critical interactions within the coagulation cascade. It circulates in plasma as a dimer and forms a complex with high molecular weight kininogen (HK), which is essential for its stability and function. The A2 domain of FXI is crucial for binding to HK, and this interaction can influence FXI activation under certain conditions (Emsley2010Structure; Mohammed2018An).

FXI interacts with platelets through the glycoprotein Ib (GP1b) receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). The A3 domain of FXI, particularly residues Ser248 and Arg250, is important for binding to GP1b, while ApoER2 serves as a receptor for FXI on platelets, facilitating platelet adhesion and spreading (Emsley2010Structure; WhiteAdams2009Identification).

FXI is activated by several proteases, including factor XIIa, thrombin, and FXIa itself. Activation involves cleavage at the Arg369-Ile370 bond, resulting in the formation of FXIa, which can then activate factor IX (FIX) to FIXa. This activation is enhanced by polyanions such as polyphosphate and nucleic acids, which facilitate thrombin-mediated activation (Emsley2010Structure; Mohammed2018An).

FXI also interacts with regulatory proteins like tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and ADAMTS13, which it can inactivate, thereby promoting clot formation and stability (Mohammed2018An).
