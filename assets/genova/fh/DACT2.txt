# DACT2

## Overview
DACT2, or Dishevelled Binding Antagonist of Beta Catenin 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a critical pathway for cellular homeostasis and proliferation. The DACT2 protein functions as a tumor suppressor and is categorized as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, primarily localizing in the cytoplasm. It plays a pivotal role in modulating Wnt signaling by antagonizing Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins and regulating the localization and activity of β-catenin, thereby influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis. DACT2's interactions with various proteins, including those in the TGFβ signaling pathway, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes. Its expression is often silenced in several cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, highlighting its significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Wang2014DACT2; Tan2017Upregulation; Zhao2014Methylation).

## Function
DACT2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation in healthy human cells. In normal colon tissue, DACT2 is constitutively expressed and functions as an intrinsic regulator of β-catenin activity, ensuring tight control over the expression of Wnt target genes. It modulates Wnt signaling by antagonizing Dishevelled (Dvl), a key protein in the canonical Wnt pathway, and upregulates E-cadherin, restoring the junctional localization of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes at the cellular membrane. This action is essential for maintaining epithelial integrity and transmitting contact inhibition signals that regulate cell proliferation (Wang2014DACT2).

DACT2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, predominantly localizing in the cytoplasm due to its nuclear export signal. In the nucleus, it disrupts the formation of the β-catenin-LEF1 complex, while in the cytoplasm, it prevents β-catenin's nuclear translocation, thereby maintaining its junctional localization. These activities collectively contribute to the suppression of tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation (Wang2014DACT2).

## Clinical Significance
DACT2 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In papillary thyroid cancer, DACT2 is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced disease stages. This methylation leads to the loss of DACT2 expression, contributing to cancer progression by activating the Wnt signaling pathway (Zhao2014Methylation). In colon cancer, DACT2 is often silenced due to promoter methylation, which correlates with poor survival outcomes. Its reexpression can suppress tumor growth by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2014DACT2).

In gliomas, DACT2 expression is downregulated, correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer prognosis. Overexpression of DACT2 in glioma cells inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor suppression through the inactivation of the YAP signaling pathway (Tan2017Upregulation). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DACT2 is silenced by CpG methylation, and its reexpression reduces cell proliferation and enhances chemosensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2018The).

## Interactions
DACT2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in several signaling pathways. It forms complexes with members of the Dishevelled (Dvl) family, including Dvl1, Dvl2, and Dvl3, as well as with Vangl proteins, specifically Vangl1 and Vangl2 (Kivimäe2011All). DACT2 also interacts with casein kinase 1δ/ε (CK1δ/ε), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC), with a particularly strong interaction with PKC (Kivimäe2011All).

In the context of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, DACT2 binds to β-catenin and disrupts its interaction with lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), thereby inhibiting the formation of the β-catenin-LEF1 complex in the nucleus. This interaction is crucial for DACT2's role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer (Wang2014DACT2). DACT2 also interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors and represses PITX2 transcriptional activity, affecting tooth development (Li2013Dact2).

DACT2's interactions extend to TGFβ signaling, where it binds to Alk4/5 receptors, promoting their degradation and influencing cellular signaling pathways (Kivimäe2011All). These interactions highlight DACT2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and signaling pathways.
