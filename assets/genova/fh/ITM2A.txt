# ITM2A

## Overview
The ITM2A gene encodes the integral membrane protein 2A, a type II transmembrane protein that is part of the BRICHOS superfamily, known for its potential chaperone functions (Zhou2019Integral). This protein is characterized by a BRICHOS domain, which is implicated in binding amyloid fibrils and may play a role in protein folding and preventing aggregation (Cegarra2022Exploring). ITM2A is expressed in various tissues, including the thymus, brain endothelial cells, and mesenchymal tissues, and is involved in processes such as myogenesis, chondrogenesis, and odontogenesis (Cegarra2022Exploring; Pittois1999Genomic). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and N-glycosylation, which are crucial for its role in autophagy and other cellular pathways (Zhou2019Integral; Cegarra2022Exploring). ITM2A has been implicated in various cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and a prognostic biomarker in kidney and bladder cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2019Integral; Zhang2023PanCancer; Jiang2024ITM2A).

## Structure
The ITM2A protein is a 263-amino acid type II transmembrane protein that is part of the BRICHOS superfamily, which is believed to have a chaperone function (Zhou2019Integral). It contains a 100-amino acid BRICHOS domain within its extracellular C-terminal domain, which is a characteristic feature of the BRICHOS family proteins (Zhou2019Integral; Cegarra2022Exploring). The protein is structured with four defined regions: the hydrophobic, linker, extracellular BRICHOS, and intracellular C-terminal domains (Zhou2019Integral). 

The BRICHOS domain is known for its ability to bind amyloid fibrils, suggesting a potential role in protein folding and aggregation prevention (Cegarra2022Exploring). ITM2A is ubiquitously expressed, with high levels in the thymus and specific expression in brain endothelial cells, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes, including myogenesis, chondrogenesis, and odontogenesis (Cegarra2022Exploring). 

Post-translational modifications of ITM2A include phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in autophagy induction in breast cancer cells (Zhou2019Integral). The protein may also undergo N-glycosylation, leading to an apparent molecular weight of 43 and 45 kDa (Cegarra2022Exploring).

## Function
The ITM2A gene encodes a type II integral membrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation. It is expressed in several mesenchymal tissues, with significant expression in chondro- and osteogenic tissues, as well as in skeletal muscle and the nervous system (Lagha2013Itm2a; Pittois1999Genomic). ITM2A is associated with early chondrogenesis and is expressed in chondrocytes of the resting zone of the growth plate, suggesting a role in regulating chondrogenic differentiation (Boeuf2009Enhanced). 

In skeletal muscle, ITM2A is a direct target of the Pax3 transcription factor and is expressed in Pax3-positive multipotent cells of the dermomyotome and differentiating muscle cells of the myotome (Lagha2013Itm2a). It is also present in satellite cells, which are progenitor cells involved in muscle regeneration, although it is not essential for adult myogenesis or muscle repair (Lagha2013Itm2a). The protein may act as an adaptor in promoting membrane receptor function or transmitting signals through intracellular pathways, although its precise molecular function remains to be fully elucidated (Lagha2013Itm2a).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITM2A gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ITM2A is considered a predictive biomarker for prognosis and immunotherapy. High ITM2A expression is associated with better responses to immunotherapy and certain antineoplastic drugs, while low expression correlates with advanced disease stages and poorer overall survival (Zhang2023PanCancer).

In breast cancer, ITM2A acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly downregulated in breast cancer tissues, and low levels are linked to poor prognosis, particularly in nodal-negative patients and those with HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes. ITM2A overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation and enhances autophagy, suggesting its potential role in breast cancer therapy (Zhou2019Integral; Zhang2021ITM2A).

In bladder cancer, low ITM2A expression is associated with higher tumor grade and poor prognosis. ITM2A suppresses bladder cancer progression by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, reducing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Jiang2024ITM2A). These findings highlight ITM2A's potential as a therapeutic target across various cancers.

## Interactions
ITM2A is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its function in cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, ITM2A interacts with vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase), which may interfere with autophagic flux, a process crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Zhou2019Integral). This interaction suggests a role for ITM2A in regulating autophagy through modulation of lysosomal function.

ITM2A is also phosphorylated by the Up-regulated Neu-associated Kinase (HUNK), a serine/threonine kinase. This phosphorylation occurs at threonine 35 (T35) and is crucial for the induction of autophagy. The interaction between ITM2A and HUNK was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, and the phosphorylation is enhanced under starvation conditions, which also increases HUNK activity (Zhou2019Integral).

In the context of skeletal muscle formation, ITM2A is regulated by transcription factors such as Pax3 and Pax7. Pax3 directly binds to a site in the first intron of the ITM2A gene, influencing its expression during muscle development (Lagha2013Itm2a). These interactions highlight ITM2A's involvement in various cellular pathways, including autophagy and muscle differentiation.
