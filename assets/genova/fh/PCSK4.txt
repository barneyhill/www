# PCSK4

## Overview
PCSK4, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 4, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme belonging to the proprotein convertase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the proteolytic processing of precursor proteins into their active forms, a function critical for various physiological processes, particularly in reproductive biology. The PCSK4 protein is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues, such as the testis, sperm, and epididymis in males, and the placenta, ovary, and oocytes in females. It plays a crucial role in sperm development, fertilization, and the processing of key molecules necessary for these processes, including insulin-like growth factors and hormonal peptides (Mishra2012In; GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). The enzyme's activity is modulated by factors such as pH and calcium ions, and it is known to interact with various proteins that regulate its function (Mishra2012In; GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). Given its essential role in reproductive success, alterations in PCSK4 expression or function can lead to significant fertility issues, underscoring its importance in both male and female reproductive health (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein; Tardif2012Alteration).

## Structure
PCSK4 is a serine protease that is part of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type family. The primary structure of PCSK4 includes several key domains: a signal peptide, a pro domain, a catalytic domain, a P domain, and a variable C-terminal domain (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). The signal peptide directs the precursor toward the secretory pathway, while the prodomain acts as an intramolecular chaperone and transient inhibitor. The catalytic domain contains the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad characteristic of serine proteinases (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). 

The secondary structure of PCSK4 features alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a subtilisin-like fold in its tertiary structure. The P domain influences calcium and pH dependence and may mediate attachment to carbohydrates, phospholipids, or membrane receptors (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). 

Post-translational modifications of PCSK4 include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which affect the enzyme's final destination and activity (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). The protein undergoes proteolytic processing, which may involve C-terminal truncation, as indicated by its smaller molecular mass observed in western blots (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). PCSK4 is expressed as a zymogen in the endoplasmic reticulum and undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to become mature (GyameraAcheampong2010The).

## Function
PCSK4, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 4, is a serine protease involved in the proteolytic conversion of secretory precursor proteins into their active forms. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues, including the testis, sperm surface, and epididymis in males, as well as the placenta, ovary, and oocytes in females (Mishra2012In). In healthy human cells, PCSK4 is crucial for reproductive processes, particularly in sperm development and fertilization. It is located on the plasma membrane overlying the acrosome of sperm, where it plays a role in the acrosome reaction and sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida (GyameraAcheampong2010The; GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein).

PCSK4 is involved in the processing of several key fertilization molecules, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) and hormonal peptides like pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which are essential for sperm-egg fusion and successful fertilization (BASAK1999Enzymic; Mishra2012In). The enzyme's activity is optimal near neutral pH and in the presence of calcium ions, and it is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it processes precursor proteins that influence cell signaling and function (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). The high conservation of the PCSK4 sequence among species underscores its critical role in reproductive success (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PCSK4 gene have significant implications for reproductive health, particularly in fertility. In males, PCSK4 is crucial for sperm function, and its absence or dysfunction can lead to severe subfertility. PCSK4-null mice exhibit reduced sperm hyperactivation, impaired fertilization capabilities, and morphological defects in sperm head and acrosome, which collectively contribute to infertility (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein; Tardif2012Alteration). The enzyme is involved in the processing of key proteins necessary for sperm maturation, such as the acrosin-binding protein (ACRBP), and its deficiency results in impaired proacrosin activation and delayed fertilization (Tardif2012Alteration).

In females, PCSK4-null mice show impaired folliculogenesis and potential implantation defects, likely due to altered processing of proIGF2, which is essential for placental and fetal development (GyameraAcheampong2008Proprotein). Dysregulation of PCSK4 activity has also been linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to its role in processing insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), a critical factor for fetoplacental growth (Qiu2005Role). These findings suggest that PCSK4 is vital for normal reproductive function, and its disruption can lead to fertility issues in both males and females.

## Interactions
PCSK4 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in reproductive processes. One notable interaction is with the chaperone GRP78/BiP, which is involved in the folding and trafficking of PCSK4. This interaction was confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, suggesting that GRP78/BiP may assist in the proper folding or stabilization of PCSK4 during its biosynthesis (GyameraAcheampong2010The).

PCSK4 also interacts with the epididymal serpin CRES, which acts as an inhibitor of PCSK4's protease activity. This interaction is significant in the regulation of PCSK4 activity, particularly in the context of sperm maturation and fertilization. CRES can inhibit PCSK4 in vitro, with its dimeric form being more effective than the monomeric form. This suggests that CRES may serve as a natural regulator of PCSK4, affecting the processing of substrates like proIGF-2 (Mishra2012In).

In sperm physiology, PCSK4 is involved in the proteolytic processing of proteins such as ADAM2 and ADAM3, which are crucial for sperm-egg binding. Although PCSK4-null sperm show altered processing of these proteins, the exact physical interactions with PCSK4 are not fully detailed (GyameraAcheampong2010PCSK4null).
