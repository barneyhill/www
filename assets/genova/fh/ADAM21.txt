# ADAM21

## Overview
ADAM21 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 21 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their multifunctional roles, including proteolytic and cell adhesion activities, facilitated by distinct structural domains such as a metalloprotease domain and a disintegrin domain. The ADAM21 protein is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it is involved in neurogenesis, axonal growth, and synapse formation, particularly in regions like the subventricular zone and the olfactory nerve layer. Its expression and activity are also linked to pathological conditions, notably in cancer, where it may influence tumor progression and immune evasion mechanisms (Stone1999Structure–Function; Yang2005A; Arai2022The).

## Structure
ADAM21 is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a complex structure with several distinct domains. The primary structure of ADAM21 includes a signal sequence, a propeptide domain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, and a cysteine-rich region. Most ADAMs, including ADAM21, also have C-terminal domains such as an epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Stone1999Structure–Function; EDWARDS2008The).

The metalloprotease domain is zinc-dependent, containing a consensus sequence crucial for its catalytic activity. The disintegrin domain is involved in adhesion functions, likely interacting with integrins (Stone1999Structure–Function; EDWARDS2008The). The secondary and tertiary structures are stabilized by zinc and a 'Met-turn' structure, which positions the subdomains to create a catalytic cleft (EDWARDS2008The).

ADAM21 is produced as a zymogen, activated by a 'cysteine switch' mechanism involving the dissociation of a cysteine residue from the zinc ion in the catalytic domain (Stone1999Structure–Function). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms for ADAM21 are not detailed, the presence of a pro-domain suggests potential for proteolytic processing (Stone1999Structure–Function).

## Function
ADAM21, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, is involved in several molecular processes, primarily within the central nervous system (CNS) of rodents, which may provide insights into its function in healthy human cells. ADAM21 is expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and rostral migratory stream (RMS), regions associated with neurogenesis and axonal growth. It is implicated in the migration of neuroblasts and the development of axons, suggesting a role in neuronal development and plasticity (Yang2005A).

The protein contains a metalloprotease domain, which may be involved in proteolytic activities, and a disintegrin domain, which can bind to integrin receptors, facilitating cell adhesion and migration. These domains suggest that ADAM21 could influence neuroblast migration by interacting with integrins and possibly modulating the extracellular environment through proteolysis (Hsia2019Functions; Yang2005A).

ADAM21 is also associated with the olfactory nerve layer, indicating its involvement in axonal outgrowth and synapse formation. Its expression in mature olfactory neurons but not in immature ones supports its role in the later stages of neuronal development (Yang2005A).

## Clinical Significance
ADAM21, a member of the ADAM family, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Its expression is notably associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where increased levels of ADAM21 are linked to poor prognosis, including reduced recurrence-free survival and overall survival (Théret2021ADAM; Arai2022The). In the context of cancer, ADAM21 is involved in the shedding of membrane-bound MICA, which impacts natural killer (NK) cell activity and cancer immunosurveillance, suggesting its role in immune evasion mechanisms (Arai2022The).

ADAM21 is also expressed in neuronal precursor cells and is implicated in axon outgrowth and synapse formation, although its specific substrates and interactions in the nervous system remain unclear (Hsia2019Functions). Despite its potential roles, specific mutations or interaction changes of ADAM21 in diseases are not well-documented in the current literature. However, its expression levels and involvement in proteolytic processes suggest it could be a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and possibly other conditions where cell signaling and adhesion are disrupted (Ma2023Pancancer).
