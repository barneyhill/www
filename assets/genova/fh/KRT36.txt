# KRT36

## Overview
KRT36 is a gene that encodes keratin 36, a type I acidic keratin protein, which is a member of the hair keratin family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues, particularly in the hair, nails, and tongue. Keratin 36 is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for providing mechanical stability and resilience to epithelial cells. It is specifically expressed in the cortical cells of hair and the filiform papillae of the tongue, contributing to the differentiation and structural formation of these tissues (Brychtova2020Keratin; Bragulla2009Structure). The gene's expression is also noted in other keratinizing structures, such as nail beds, indicating its broader role in the formation of hard keratinizing structures (Brychtova2020Keratin). Alterations in KRT36 expression have been associated with various clinical conditions, including certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in disease progression (Boldrup2016Gene; Mottaghitalab2021Revealing).

## Structure
Keratin 36 (KRT36) is a type I acidic keratin, part of the hair keratin family, and is involved in the structural integrity of hair and nails. The primary structure of KRT36 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone, which is typical for keratins (Brychtova2020Keratin). The secondary structure of KRT36 includes alpha-helices, which are characteristic of keratin proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update). These dimers further assemble into antiparallel tetramers, which are the building blocks for intermediate filament structures (Ho2022Update).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a stable conformation, while the quaternary structure involves interactions with other keratin proteins to form intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update). KRT36 is specifically expressed in the filiform papillae of the tongue and is downregulated in squamous cell carcinoma of the mobile tongue, indicating its role in tissue-specific expression (Brychtova2020Keratin). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may affect the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications for KRT36 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Keratin 36 (KRT36) is a type I hair keratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues, particularly in the hair and tongue. In healthy human cells, KRT36 is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical stability and resilience to epithelial cells (Bragulla2009Structure). It is specifically expressed in the cortical cells of the hair, contributing to the advanced differentiation of these cells and the formation of hair shafts (Rogers2004The; Bragulla2009Structure).

KRT36 is also a specific marker of the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue, where it is localized in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. These cells are organized in arcs at the periphery of the filiform papillae, contributing to the formation of cornified spines (Brychtova2020Keratin). The expression of KRT36 in the tongue suggests its role in maintaining the structural integrity and normal function of the tongue epithelium (Brychtova2020Keratin).

In addition to its role in hair and tongue, KRT36 is expressed in other keratinizing structures such as nail beds and the hair cortex, indicating its involvement in the formation of hard keratinizing structures (Brychtova2020Keratin).

## Clinical Significance
KRT36, a type I hair keratin gene, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), KRT36 is overexpressed, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression. Specifically, KRT36 is significantly overexpressed in LGG with a log fold change (logFC) of 2.1, and it is also overexpressed in GBM, indicating its involvement in these types of brain tumors (Mottaghitalab2021Revealing).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related to hepatitis B virus (HBV), alterations in the KRT36 gene, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2301354, have been identified as deleterious. These genetic variations are associated with TP53 expression status, which plays a crucial role in the progression of HBV-related HCC (Liao2018Genomewide).

KRT36 expression is also noted in the context of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). It is highly expressed in normal tongue tissue but shows variable expression in tumor-free tongue tissue adjacent to TSCC, suggesting a potential role in the microenvironment of oral cancers (Boldrup2016Gene).

## Interactions
KRT36, or keratin 36, is a type I acidic keratin involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural integrity of epithelial cells. It interacts with other keratins to form heterodimeric coiled-coil structures, which are the building blocks of these filaments. These interactions are crucial for maintaining the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, providing resilience against mechanical stress (Ho2022Update).

In the context of hair follicle development, KRT36 is part of a network of keratin proteins that interact to form the structural components of hair. It is involved in protein-protein interaction networks, as identified in gene network analyses related to hair follicle morphogenesis (He2022Gene). KRT36 has been noted to interact independently within one of the identified interaction networks, suggesting its specific role in hair structure and development.

In pathological conditions, such as frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), KRT36 expression is reduced, which is consistent with the targeting of vellus hairs in FFA. This reduction in KRT36 and other hair keratins is indicative of a systemic immunologic phenomenon affecting the stratum corneum of the forehead (Karim2023Protein).
