# PHF8

## Overview
PHF8 is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 8, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of histone demethylases. This protein is characterized by its ability to demethylate specific lysine residues on histones, thereby playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. The PHF8 protein is particularly involved in the demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2/1) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2), as well as histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), which are associated with transcriptional repression (Lim2013The; Yu2010Structural). The protein's activity is crucial for normal cognitive development and is linked to neuronal differentiation, with mutations in the PHF8 gene associated with Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome (Qiu2010The). PHF8's interactions with various protein complexes underscore its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, highlighting its significance in both cellular and organismal contexts (KleineKohlbrecher2010A).

## Structure
The PHF8 gene encodes a protein with a catalytic domain spanning residues 79-447, featuring a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold typical of 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenases (Yue2010Crystal). This DSBH fold consists of 13 β-strands surrounded by 12 α-helices, with the core structure comprising eight β-strands divided into major and minor β-sheets (Yue2010Crystal). The active site of PHF8 is located at the 'open' end of the DSBH, involving metal binding ligands H247, D249, and H319, and was modeled with Ni(II) during structural analysis (Yue2010Crystal).

PHF8 contains a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is responsible for its histone demethylase activity, and an N-terminal PHD finger domain that binds specifically to H3K4me3/2 peptides (Qiu2010The). The structure of PHF8 is similar to that of FBXL11, with an overall root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.4 Å based on Cα atoms for 326 matching residues (Yue2010Crystal). The PHF8 protein also includes a well-defined deep pocket for binding Nε-methyl-lysine, which is highly conserved among related enzymes (Yue2010Crystal). Mutations such as F279S are linked to Siderius X-linked mental retardation syndrome, affecting the protein's catalytic activity (Qiu2010The; Yue2010Crystal).

## Function
PHF8 (PHD finger protein 8) is a histone demethylase that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. It specifically demethylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2/1) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2), as well as histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me1), which are marks associated with transcriptional repression (Lim2013The; Liu2010PHF8; Yu2010Structural). By removing these repressive marks, PHF8 facilitates the transcriptional activation of genes, particularly those involved in the G2/M transition of the cell cycle, such as CCNB1 and E2F1 (Lim2013The).

PHF8 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to transcription start sites marked by H3K4me3, a modification associated with active transcription, suggesting its role in maintaining an open chromatin state conducive to gene expression (KleineKohlbrecher2010A). It interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex containing CDC20, which targets it for degradation, thus regulating its protein levels during the cell cycle (Lim2013The). This regulation is essential for proper cell cycle progression, as loss of PHF8 leads to prolonged G2 phase and defective mitosis (Lim2013The).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, PHF8 is involved in neuronal differentiation and is linked to cognitive development, with mutations in the gene associated with X-linked mental retardation (Qiu2010The). Its demethylase activity is crucial for normal cognitive function and development, highlighting its importance in both cellular and organismal contexts (KleineKohlbrecher2010A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHF8 gene are associated with Siderius X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) syndrome, which includes symptoms such as mild mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and cleft lip/palate (Loenarz2009PHF8). Truncating mutations, such as the nonsense mutation p.R211X, result in a truncated protein that lacks nuclear localization signals, leading to altered function and contributing to XLMR with or without cleft lip/palate (Laumonnier2005Mutations). These mutations exhibit large intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity, indicating variability in clinical presentation among affected individuals (Laumonnier2005Mutations).

The PHF8 gene encodes an Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent N1-methyl lysine demethylase, which is crucial for histone demethylation. Mutations such as the missense mutation c.836C>T result in a catalytically inactive variant, leading to mild mental retardation and cleft lip/palate (Loenarz2009PHF8). The F279S mutation causes a loss of function by preventing the enzyme from localizing to the nucleus, which is necessary for its role in histone demethylation (Loenarz2009PHF8).

Alterations in PHF8 expression or interactions may also be implicated in certain cancers, as the gene plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Laumonnier2005Mutations).

## Interactions
PHF8 (PHD finger protein 8) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. PHF8 interacts with the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, where it is phosphorylated at Ser-844, enhancing its demethylase activity and promoting cell cycle progression (Sun2015Cyclin). This interaction is dependent on the RXL motif within PHF8 (Sun2015Cyclin).

PHF8 also interacts with HCF-1, a cofactor necessary for the induction of G1/S transition-regulated genes. This interaction is essential for PHF8's role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1/S transition (Liu2010PHF8). PHF8 is part of a multiprotein complex involving MLL1, a histone methyltransferase, and its core components, such as WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2L, indicating its involvement in regulating H3K4 methylation at the rDNA promoter (feng2009jumonji).

PHF8 interacts with the transcription factor ZNF711, which is relevant to X-linked mental retardation. This interaction suggests that ZNF711 may recruit PHF8 to specific gene promoters, influencing transcriptional regulation (KleineKohlbrecher2010A). These interactions highlight PHF8's role in modulating gene activity through its association with various proteins and complexes.
