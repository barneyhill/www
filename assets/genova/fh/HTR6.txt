# HTR6

## Overview
The HTR6 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system by modulating neurotransmission and influencing cognitive processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in regulating synaptic plasticity and neuronal cilia morphology, which are essential for cognitive functions (Barbeito2020HTR6). The 5-HT6 receptor, as a serotonin receptor subtype, is characterized by its seven transmembrane helices and is predominantly localized to primary cilia in neurons and astrocytes. It interacts with various proteins, such as TULP3 and RABL2, which are vital for its ciliary targeting and function (Barbeito2021HTR6). The receptor's signaling involves the activation of Gs proteins and adenylyl cyclase, leading to cAMP synthesis, and it also engages in pathways involving CDK5 and mTOR kinases (Barbeito2021HTR6). HTR6 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including psychiatric disorders and cancer, where its expression and genetic variations can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Zhou2018Pharmacogenetics; Zhang2022Systematic).

## Structure
The HTR6 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in neurotransmission. The receptor is characterized by a typical GPCR structure, which includes seven transmembrane helices, an extracellular N-terminus, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and a cytosolic C-terminus (Fonin2019Multifunctionality; Barbeito2021HTR6). 

HTR6 is prominently localized to primary cilia in the brain, and its ciliary targeting is facilitated by ciliary localization sequences (CLSs) found in the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail. The ATAGQ motif in the third intracellular loop and the LPG motif in the C-terminal tail are crucial for this localization (Barbeito2021HTR6). These motifs interact with proteins such as RABL2 and TULP3, which are involved in the receptor's trafficking to the cilium (Chaumont-Dubel2023Impact).

The receptor signals through Gs proteins and adenylyl cyclase to promote cAMP synthesis and can also stimulate CDK5 and mTOR kinases (Barbeito2021HTR6). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the receptor's function and localization are influenced by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
The HTR6 gene encodes the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with cognition. This receptor plays a significant role in cognitive processes by modulating neurotransmission and influencing synaptic plasticity. It is involved in the regulation of neuronal cilia length, morphology, and composition, which are crucial for its function in cognition (Barbeito2020HTR6).

HTR6 functions by binding serotonin, which stimulates Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP signaling. This signaling pathway is enhanced by the activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. The receptor also constitutively activates cAMP synthesis, a process dependent on its ciliary targeting and neurofibromin. Additionally, HTR6 activates other effectors, such as CDK5 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinases, which are involved in various cellular processes (Barbeito2020HTR6).

The ciliary targeting of HTR6 is essential for its function, relying on specific ciliary targeting sequences (CTSs) located in its C-terminal tails and third intracellular loops. These sequences are crucial for the receptor's localization to neuronal cilia, which is necessary for its role in cognition (Barbeito2020HTR6).

## Clinical Significance
The HTR6 gene, encoding the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and genetic variations. In breast cancer, HTR6 expression is down-regulated in advanced stages compared to in situ tumors. This down-regulation is associated with poorer recurrence-free survival, particularly in Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. The gene's expression is also linked to the immune microenvironment, potentially affecting patient outcomes by regulating immune-related pathways and immune cell infiltration (Zhang2022Systematic).

In schizophrenia, studies have explored the association between HTR6 polymorphisms and treatment responses. The rs6699866 polymorphism in the HTR6 gene has been associated with a better response to risperidone treatment in Han Chinese patients, suggesting a role in modulating therapeutic outcomes (Zhou2018Pharmacogenetics). However, other studies, including a meta-analysis, have found no significant association between HTR6 variants and schizophrenia, indicating the need for further research to clarify these relationships (Kishi2012Serotonin).

Overall, HTR6 is a gene of interest in cancer and psychiatric disorders, with its expression and genetic variations influencing disease progression and treatment efficacy.

## Interactions
The HTR6 gene encodes the 5-HT6 receptor, a serotonin receptor subtype that interacts with various proteins, influencing its localization and function. The receptor is primarily localized in the primary cilium of neurons and astrocytes, where it interacts with proteins such as TULP3 and RABL2, which are crucial for its ciliary targeting. TULP3 acts as a ciliary trafficking adapter, associating with the receptor's C-terminal tail to facilitate its localization to cilia. This interaction is mediated by specific motifs within the receptor, such as the LPG motif, and is essential for the receptor's proper function within the cilium (Barbeito2020HTR6).

RABL2, a small GTPase, also plays a significant role in the ciliary targeting of HTR6 by interacting with the receptor's third intracellular loop (IC3) and C-terminal tail. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's entry into the cilium and is dependent on the RKQ motif within the IC3 region (Barbeito2020HTR6).

The 5-HT6 receptor also interacts with the activated cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk5, which phosphorylates the receptor, influencing neuronal migration and dendritic growth. This phosphorylation is essential for the receptor's role in neurodevelopmental processes (Chaumont-Dubel2023Impact).
