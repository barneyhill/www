# NHLRC3

## Overview
NHLRC3, or NHL repeat containing 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of pluripotency and cancer progression. The NHLRC3 protein is characterized by the presence of NHL repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, suggesting its role as a regulatory protein. In the context of cancer biology, NHLRC3 is implicated in the modulation of gene expression through interactions with long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, particularly in colon cancer, where it may function as a tumor suppressor. Additionally, NHLRC3 has been associated with maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells, drawing structural parallels to Royalactin, a protein from honey bees. This multifaceted role highlights NHLRC3's significance in both developmental biology and disease pathology (Wan2018Honey; Nahalka2021Theoretical; Yang2022DNMBPAS1).

## Clinical Significance
NHLRC3 has been implicated in the progression of colon cancer through its interactions with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). The lncRNA DNMBP-AS1 regulates NHLRC3 expression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that sponges miR-93-5p and miR-17-5p. This interaction prevents these miRNAs from downregulating NHLRC3, leading to increased expression of NHLRC3, which is associated with the inhibition of colon cancer progression (Yang2022DNMBPAS1). The study by Yang et al. suggests that NHLRC3 may have a tumor-suppressive role in colon cancer, as its low expression is linked to a worse prognosis in overall survival for colon cancer patients (Yang2022DNMBPAS1).

The research highlights the potential clinical significance of NHLRC3 in colon cancer, particularly in the context of its interaction with lncRNAs and miRNAs within the ceRNA network. The modulation of the miR-93-5p/17-5p/NHLRC3 axis by DNMBP-AS1 suggests that targeting this pathway could serve as a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer (Yang2022DNMBPAS1). These findings underscore the importance of NHLRC3 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
NHLRC3 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of colon cancer, NHLRC3 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA DNMBP-AS1, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). DNMBP-AS1 sponges microRNAs miR-93-5p and miR-17-5p, preventing them from binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of NHLRC3, thereby increasing its expression. This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where DNMBP-AS1 modulates NHLRC3 levels through miRNA sequestration, impacting colon cancer progression (Yang2022DNMBPAS1).

NHLRC3 also has a role in maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). It is structurally analogous to Royalactin, a protein from honey bees, and supports self-renewal and pluripotency in mESCs by maintaining an undifferentiated state. This function is crucial for stem cell maintenance and derivation, highlighting NHLRC3's involvement in cellular differentiation processes (Wan2018Honey).

Additionally, NHLRC3 is implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation by the membrane protein (M) of SARS-CoV-2, which represses its expression. This interaction may have implications for virus-host interactions and cellular processes related to pluripotency and cell fusion (Nahalka2021Theoretical).
