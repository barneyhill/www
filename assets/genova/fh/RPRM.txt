# RPRM

## Overview
The RPRM gene encodes the reprimo protein, a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in mediating G2 phase arrest in a TP53-dependent manner. This protein is involved in the DNA damage response, acting as a tumor suppressor by halting the cell cycle to facilitate DNA repair or trigger apoptosis if the damage is beyond repair (Buchegger2017Reprimo; Moradi2023DNA). The reprimo protein is characterized by its glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, which are crucial for its stability and function (Buchegger2017Reprimo; Durosara2020Computational). It interacts with key proteins such as ATM, influencing DNA repair pathways and cellular radiosensitivity (Zhang2021RPRM). The regulation of reprimo by p53 and its involvement in critical cellular processes underscore its potential implications in cancer therapy and radiation protection (Zhang2021RPRM).

## Structure
The RPRM (reprimo) gene encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, specifically mediating G2 arrest in a TP53-dependent manner. The protein is composed of 109 amino acids and is highly glycosylated (Buchegger2017Reprimo). The primary structure of the RPRM protein includes motifs such as N-glycosylation sites, an N-myristoylation site, and a cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, which are indicative of its role in cellular processes like growth and development (Durosara2020Computational).

The tertiary structure of the RPRM protein has been modeled and shows structural similarity to the bovine growth hormone gene, suggesting similar functions related to sexual maturation and reproduction (Durosara2020Computational). The transmembrane region is the only domain identified in the RPRM protein, indicating that its function is primarily directed by this domain (Durosara2020Computational).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at serine 98 by CDK4/6, affect the stability and nuclear translocation of the RPRM protein, influencing its interaction with ATM and its role in DNA damage response (Zhang2021RPRM). The unphosphorylated form of RPRM is more stable and readily translocates to the nucleus (Zhang2021RPRM).

## Function
The RPRM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in mediating G2/M phase arrest in response to DNA damage. This function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and preventing the propagation of damaged DNA, which could lead to cancer (Buchegger2017Reprimo). RPRM is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and is involved in halting the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair or to initiate apoptosis if the damage is irreparable (Moradi2023DNA).

In healthy human cells, the RPRM protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm and interacts with the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex to regulate the G2/M transition of the cell cycle (Buchegger2017Reprimo). It also negatively regulates ATM levels, a key protein in the DNA damage response pathway, through CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation, affecting ATM's nuclear translocation and stability (Zhang2021RPRM). This regulation impacts DNA repair processes, including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, thereby influencing cellular radiosensitivity (Zhang2021RPRM). The RPRM protein's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and modulate DNA repair pathways underscores its role as a tumor suppressor and its potential implications in cancer therapy and radiation protection (Zhang2021RPRM).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The RPRM (reprimo) protein interacts with several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. One of its primary interactions is with the ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) protein, a crucial player in the DNA damage response pathway. RPRM binds to ATM and negatively regulates its levels by promoting ATM's nuclear export and proteasomal degradation, particularly following DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Zhang2021RPRM). This interaction is enhanced by irradiation and involves the phosphorylation of RPRM by CDK4/CDK6, which is essential for RPRM's stabilization and nuclear translocation (Zhang2021RPRM).

RPRM also interacts with other proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, such as ATR and DNA-PKcs, suggesting a broader role in inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms (Zhang2021RPRM). In the context of estrogen signaling, RPRM is repressed by a complex involving estrogen receptor α (ERα), histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7), and FoxA1. This repression is independent of HDAC7's deacetylase activity and involves specific histone modifications at the RPRM promoter (Malik2010Histone). These interactions highlight RPRM's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to DNA damage and repair.
