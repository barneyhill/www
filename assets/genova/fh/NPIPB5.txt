# NPIPB5

## Overview
The NPIPB5 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B5, which is a part of a family of proteins involved in the regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. This protein is associated with the nuclear pore complex, a critical structure that facilitates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although the specific functions of NPIPB5 are not fully elucidated, proteins in this family are generally implicated in maintaining nuclear envelope integrity and regulating gene expression by modulating the transport of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. The NPIPB5 protein may play a role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction, although further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions and interactions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
