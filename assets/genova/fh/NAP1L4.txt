# NAP1L4

## Overview
NAP1L4, or nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the nucleosome assembly protein family, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin assembly and remodeling. The protein encoded by NAP1L4 functions as a histone chaperone, facilitating the proper assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes, which are essential for DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation (Park2006Structure). It is characterized by a conserved NAP domain crucial for histone binding and nucleosome assembly, and it interacts with core histones and transcriptional coactivators to modulate gene expression and maintain genomic stability (Rodriguez1997Functional; Tanaka2019Nucleosome). NAP1L4 is also involved in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in diseases like cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mizuhashi2021Nucleosome; Tanaka2019Nucleosome).

## Structure
NAP1L4, also known as nucleosome assembly protein 1 like 4, is a member of the nucleosome assembly protein family involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling. The primary structure of NAP1L4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that includes a nuclear localization signal and two highly acidic segments, which are characteristic features of this protein (Rodriguez1997Functional). The protein is predicted to have a molecular weight of approximately 42,764 Da (Rodriguez1997Functional).

NAP1L4 contains a conserved NAP domain, which is crucial for its function as a histone chaperone. This domain is involved in histone binding and nucleosome assembly, and it is characterized by a dome-shaped architecture with a dimerization helix and an alpha-beta domain in each monomer (Park2006Structure). The acidic C-terminal domain, which is mostly unstructured, contributes to histone binding (Park2006Structure).

NAP1L4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two protein isoforms with differences at their C-termini (Rodriguez1997Functional). These isoforms may have distinct functional roles or localization patterns within the cell. The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Rodriguez1997Functional).

## Function
NAP1L4, a member of the nucleosome assembly protein family, plays a crucial role in chromatin assembly and remodeling, which are essential for DNA replication, repair, and transcription regulation. As a histone chaperone, NAP1L4 facilitates the proper assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes by binding to histones, particularly the H2A/H2B dimer and the H3/H4 tetramer, and assisting in their transport into the nucleus (Park2006Structure). This protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and maintains genomic stability (Tanaka2019Nucleosome).

NAP1L4 is involved in modulating p53 acetylation, which affects cell fate decisions such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It interacts with transcriptional coactivators like CBP/p300 and core histones, forming a multicomponent complex that influences the acetylation of p53 at specific lysine residues. This modulation enhances the expression of p53-responsive genes, such as the cell cycle arrest gene p21, thereby suppressing cell growth and promoting cell cycle arrest (Tanaka2019Nucleosome). NAP1L4's function is cell-cycle dependent, with its presence in the nucleus during the S phase and relocation to the cytoplasm during the G2 phase, regulated by phosphorylation (Park2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
NAP1L4 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. Alterations in its expression levels have been associated with melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Studies have shown that NAP1L4 is overexpressed in melanoma tissues compared to benign nevus tissues, with higher expression levels observed in advanced stages of the disease. This overexpression is linked to increased cell migration and invasion capabilities, suggesting a role in melanoma progression and metastasis. Knockdown of NAP1L4 in melanoma cell lines results in reduced cell migration and invasion, upregulation of p21, and downregulation of Slug, a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (Mizuhashi2021Nucleosome).

In the context of cellular stress responses, NAP1L4 modulates p53 acetylation, influencing cell fate decisions such as apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Knockdown of NAP1L4 decreases p53 acetylation at specific lysine residues, leading to reduced expression of proapoptotic genes like Bax, thereby suppressing apoptosis. This suggests that NAP1L4 plays a role in regulating p53-responsive genes, which could have implications for cell survival and apoptosis in stress conditions (Tanaka2019Nucleosome). These findings highlight the potential of NAP1L4 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly for inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation and invasion.

## Interactions
NAP1L4, also known as nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 4, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a histone chaperone. It interacts with both core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and linker histone H1, facilitating the assembly of nucleosomes by transferring histones onto DNA templates (Rodriguez1997Functional). NAP1L4 has a higher affinity for histones H2A and H2B compared to H3 and H4, and it can stimulate nucleosome assembly in vitro (Rodriguez1997Functional).

NAP1L4 also interacts with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP, which are involved in transcriptional regulation (Wang2020NAP1L4). It forms part of a multicomponent complex with p53, influencing p53 acetylation and modulating its transcriptional activity, particularly under stress conditions (Tanaka2019Nucleosome). This interaction affects the expression of p53 target genes such as p21 and Bax, which are involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Tanaka2019Nucleosome).

In the context of viral interactions, NAP1L4 directly interacts with the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), inhibiting viral replication through the IFN-β signaling pathway (Wang2020NAP1L4). These interactions highlight NAP1L4's role in chromatin dynamics and its potential regulatory functions in various cellular processes.
