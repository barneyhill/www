# PAH

## Overview
The PAH gene encodes the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a critical component in the metabolic pathway that converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. This enzyme is categorized as a hydroxylase and is primarily active in the liver and kidneys. Phenylalanine hydroxylase functions as a homotetramer, with each subunit comprising distinct regulatory, catalytic, and tetramerization domains. The enzyme's activity is dependent on the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and is regulated by phenylalanine itself, which binds to an allosteric site to enhance catalytic efficiency. Mutations in the PAH gene can lead to phenylketonuria (PKU) and other hyperphenylalaninemias, conditions characterized by elevated phenylalanine levels due to impaired enzyme function (Waters1998In; Flydal2013Phenylalanine). Understanding the structure and function of PAH is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of these metabolic disorders and developing therapeutic strategies (Gersting2008Loss; Fusetti1998Structure).

## Structure
The human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme is a multi-domain protein that catalyzes the conversion of l-phenylalanine to l-tyrosine. The primary structure of PAH is encoded by the PAH gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming distinct domains. The enzyme consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain (RD), a central catalytic domain (CD), and a C-terminal oligomerization or tetramerization domain (TD) (Patel2016Structural; Fusetti1998Structure).

The regulatory domain contains an ACT fold, which is common in enzymes for binding small molecule ligands, and is involved in the regulation of PAH activity, including activation by phenylalanine and inhibition by the cofactor BH4 (Patel2016Structural). The catalytic domain is responsible for the iron-mediated incorporation of oxygen into the substrate (Patel2016Structural). The tetramerization domain facilitates the formation of the enzyme's quaternary structure as a homotetramer, which is the native functional state of PAH (Fusetti1998Structure).

PAH undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its activity (Kobe1999Structuralbasisofautoregulationofphenylalaninehydroxylase). The enzyme's structure is crucial for its function, and mutations affecting these domains can lead to phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder (Fusetti1998Structure).

## Function
The PAH gene encodes the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine in humans. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, a reaction that is essential for maintaining normal levels of phenylalanine in the blood and preventing its accumulation, which can lead to neurotoxicity (Flydal2013Phenylalanine; Ge2018Simulations). The reaction requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which acts as a co-substrate, facilitating the hydroxylation process (Flydal2013Phenylalanine).

Phenylalanine hydroxylase is primarily active in the liver and kidney, where it functions as a monomer of 452 amino acids with distinct regulatory, catalytic, and tetramerization domains. These monomers assemble into functional dimeric and tetrameric forms, allowing the enzyme to effectively regulate phenylalanine levels (Scriver2007ThePAH). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phenylalanine itself, which binds to an allosteric site, stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme and enhancing its catalytic efficiency (Ge2018Simulations).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of PAH is crucial for preventing conditions such as hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria, which result from elevated phenylalanine levels due to PAH defects (Waters1998In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAH gene, which encodes the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, are primarily associated with phenylketonuria (PKU) and related hyperphenylalaninemias (HPA). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of phenylalanine due to deficient PAH enzyme activity, leading to potential severe intellectual disability if untreated (Zastrow2018Unique; Eisensmith1992Molecular). The condition is classified into different severities: classic PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP), based on phenylalanine levels and dietary tolerance (Bercovich2008Genotype–phenotype).

The PAH gene exhibits extensive allelic heterogeneity, with over 1000 variants identified, including missense, nonsense, splicing, and frameshift mutations (Zastrow2018Unique; Scriver2007ThePAH). These mutations can lead to misfolding and degradation of the PAH protein, reducing enzyme activity and causing HPA (Waters2003HowPAH). Some mutations may also affect the enzyme's kinetic properties, such as Vmax and Km, or disrupt its regulatory functions (Waters2003HowPAH).

Genotype-phenotype correlations have been studied to understand the clinical implications of PAH mutations, with null mutations often linked to severe PKU phenotypes (Bercovich2008Genotype–phenotype). The variability in clinical outcomes is influenced by the specific mutations and their effects on enzyme activity, as well as environmental and cellular factors (Waters2003HowPAH).

## Interactions
Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is an enzyme that primarily functions as a homotetramer, meaning it forms a complex consisting of four identical subunits. This tetrameric assembly is crucial for its enzymatic activity, which involves the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. The proper assembly and stability of the PAH tetramer are essential for its function, and mutations in the PAH gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to misfolding and aggregation of the protein (Gersting2008Loss; Waters2003HowPAH).

Mutations in the PAH gene can lead to altered protein-protein interactions, affecting the enzyme's oligomeric state. For instance, specific mutations such as I65S and Y417H have been shown to increase dimer formation or monomer presence, disrupting the normal tetrameric structure (Gersting2008Loss). These disruptions can result in decreased enzyme activity and increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation (Gersting2008Loss).

PAH also interacts with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor necessary for its enzymatic activity. BH4 binding is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of PAH, and mutations can affect the binding affinity of BH4, potentially impacting the enzyme's activity and stability (Lopez2021In).
