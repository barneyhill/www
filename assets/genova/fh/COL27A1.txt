# COL27A1

## Overview
The COL27A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain, a unique fibrillar collagen protein that plays a crucial role in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, particularly in bone and cartilage. This protein is characterized by its atypical interruptions in the triple helical domain and a shorter major triple helix compared to classical fibrillar collagens, which contributes to its specialized function in skeletogenesis (BootHandford2003A; Plumb2007Collagen). Collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain is primarily expressed in cartilaginous tissues and is involved in the transition of cartilage to bone during endochondral ossification, a process essential for bone development and growth (Hjorten2007Type). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as SOX9, highlighting its importance in chondrocyte differentiation and bone formation (GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations). Mutations in COL27A1 are linked to skeletal disorders, including Steel syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations).

## Structure
The COL27A1 gene encodes the collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain, a unique member of the fibrillar collagen family. The primary structure of this protein includes a repeating Gly-X-Y sequence, typical of collagens, but with notable interruptions in the triple helical domain (BootHandford2003A; Plumb2007Collagen). The major triple helix is shorter than those of classical fibrillar collagens, consisting of 990 to 997 amino acids, and directly fuses with the N-terminal noncollagenous domain, lacking the N-terminal telopeptide-like region (GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations; Plumb2007Collagen).

The secondary structure forms a triple helix, which is a characteristic feature of collagen proteins. The tertiary and quaternary structures involve the assembly of these helices into thin fibrils within the extracellular matrix (Plumb2011Collagen). The protein also contains a thrombospondin domain at the N-terminus, similar to type B clade collagens (Plumb2011Collagen).

Post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, which are crucial for the stability of the collagen triple helix. The COL27A1 gene may produce splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (BootHandford2003A).

## Function
The COL27A1 gene encodes the pro-alpha chain of type XXVII collagen, a fibrillar collagen involved in the extracellular matrices of bone, cartilage, and other connective tissues. This protein plays a significant role in skeletogenesis, particularly in the transition of cartilage to bone during endochondral ossification. It is primarily expressed in cartilaginous tissues, including the growth plate, where it is more abundant in the resting and proliferative zones compared to hypertrophic cartilage (Hjorten2007Type).

Type XXVII collagen is deposited at sites where cartilage transitions to bone, such as the primary ossification center and the epiphysis in developing long bones. It appears concurrent with cartilage mineralization and just before the invasion of bone cells, suggesting its role in later stages of cartilage modeling, including mineralization, chondrocyte apoptosis, and the formation of acellular spaces that facilitate vascularization (Hjorten2007Type). The protein may interact with type X collagen in the extracellular matrix, providing a scaffold for mineralization and supporting the environment for invading blood vessels (Hjorten2007Type).

In addition to its structural role, COL27A1 is regulated by the transcription factor SOX9, which is crucial for chondrogenesis, and can be upregulated by Lc-Maf in chondrocytes, highlighting its importance in bone development and chondrocyte differentiation (GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL27A1 gene, which encodes the collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain, are associated with Steel syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Steel syndrome is primarily observed in individuals of Puerto Rican descent and is marked by features such as bilateral congenital hip dysplasia, short stature, scoliosis, carpal coalitions, radial head dislocations, and foot deformities (GonzagaJauregui2020Functional; GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations). The p.Gly697Arg variant in COL27A1 is identified as a founder mutation in the Puerto Rican population, causing Steel syndrome when present in a homozygous state (GonzagaJauregui2020Functional; GonzagaJauregui2014Mutations).

In addition to Steel syndrome, novel pathogenic variants in COL27A1 have been reported in other populations, such as Turkish individuals, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of COL27A1-related disorders, collectively termed COL27opathies. These disorders may include additional features like hearing loss and developmental delays (GonzagaJauregui2020Functional). The genetic variations in different populations suggest a broader allelic architecture and support a hypothesis of clan genomics, where rare alleles arise due to consanguinity rather than genetic drift (GonzagaJauregui2020Functional).

## Interactions
Collagen type XXVII alpha 1 chain, encoded by the COL27A1 gene, is involved in various interactions within the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is primarily associated with the transition of cartilage to bone during skeletogenesis, where it may serve as a scaffold for mineralization and support for invading blood vessels. This suggests potential interactions with other ECM components involved in bone development (Hjorten2007Type).

Type XXVII collagen is synthesized by cells that also produce type X collagen, and the two may interact within the ECM. Immunogold electron microscopy has shown that type XXVII collagen forms filamentous meshworks similar to those of type X collagen, although it is found in non-banded fibrous structures devoid of type II collagen (Hjorten2007Type).

The COL27A1 gene is also implicated in interactions with genes of the ECM signaling pathways, which may influence tissue development and integrity. Although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in ECM signaling suggests a role in complex molecular networks that regulate cartilage and bone formation (Sun2023The). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise nature of these interactions.
