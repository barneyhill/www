# CEP128

## Overview
CEP128 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 128, a crucial component of the centrosome involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and plays a significant role in the organization and function of centrioles, particularly in the formation of subdistal appendages (SDAs) on the mother centriole. These appendages are essential for anchoring microtubules, which are vital for maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating cell division (Tischer2021Accessorizing; VasquezLimeta2021Human). CEP128 is also involved in ciliogenesis, where it regulates the localization of centriolin and NIN to centriole subdistal appendages, influencing primary cilia development (Zhang2022CEP128). Additionally, CEP128 has been implicated in spermatogenesis and autoimmune thyroid diseases, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular function and disease (Zhang2022CEP128; Wang2019CEP128).

## Function
CEP128 (centrosomal protein 128) is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of centrioles, particularly in the formation of subdistal appendages (SDAs) on the mother centriole. These appendages are involved in anchoring microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating cell division (Tischer2021Accessorizing; VasquezLimeta2021Human). CEP128 is recruited to the distal part of the centriole wall, where it interacts with other proteins like ODF2, contributing to the assembly and stability of SDAs (Tischer2021Accessorizing).

In healthy human cells, CEP128 is involved in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is important for cell signaling and movement. It regulates the localization of centriolin and NIN to centriole subdistal appendages, influencing primary cilia development (Zhang2022CEP128). Overexpression of CEP128 can suppress ciliation, while its deficiency results in elevated ciliation levels, indicating its regulatory role in ciliogenesis (Zhang2022CEP128). CEP128's activity at the centrosome is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of centrioles and ensuring proper cell cycle progression, impacting overall cellular function and organismal development (Jaiswal2021Centrosome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CEP128 gene have been implicated in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), particularly Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). The study by Wang et al. identified CEP128 as a significant risk locus for these conditions, with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs327463 and rs12050151, being associated with AITD. The rs327463 SNP, a missense mutation resulting in a H732P amino acid substitution, is significantly associated with genetic predisposition to GD and HT, although its influence on susceptibility is not strong, indicating the need for further research (Wang2019CEP128).

CEP128 expression levels are correlated with immune cell composition in GD tissues, particularly with T-follicular helper cells and M1 macrophages. This suggests a role in the pathogenesis of GD through immune response regulation. The gene's expression is also linked to the expression of transcription factors and cytokines involved in immune responses, such as STAT1, STAT3, BCL6, IL21, IL1β, and TNF-α (Wang2019CEP128). Gene set enrichment analysis indicates that CEP128 may be involved in immune pathways like the interferon-γ mediated signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway, which are implicated in GD pathogenesis (Wang2019CEP128).

## Interactions
CEP128 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in ciliogenesis and spermatogenesis. During ciliogenesis, CEP128 interacts with a network of proteins, gaining a high number of proximity interactions (PxIs). It has been identified as a negative regulator of ciliation, with its knockdown leading to increased ciliation and its overexpression suppressing it. CEP128 interacts with 57 proteins that show significant changes in peptide counts in response to ciliation, and knockdown of 25 of these proteins results in ciliation phenotypes, indicating its role in a ciliation modulator circuit (Gupta2015A).

In the context of spermatogenesis, CEP128 regulates the expression of key molecules such as Wbp2nl, Rcbtb2, Prss55, Crisp1, and Defb22, which are involved in reproduction. Variants causing abnormal CEP128 expression inhibit these molecules, leading to sperm development issues (Zhang2022CEP128). CEP128 also interacts with centrosomal proteins and transcription factors to influence cilia development and spermatogenesis. Overexpression of CEP128, particularly the R222Q variant, leads to reduced cilia length and abnormal nuclear morphology, associated with decreased protein levels of centrosomal proteins such as ninein (NIN), centriolin, and CEP170 (Zhang2022CEP128).
