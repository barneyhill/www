# ZRANB2

## Overview
ZRANB2 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger RANBP2-type containing 2 protein, which is a member of the zinc-finger protein family. This protein is characterized by its two RanBP2-type zinc finger motifs, which are essential for its role in RNA binding and splicing regulation. The ZRANB2 protein is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a process critical for generating protein diversity in cells. It functions as a splicing factor by interacting with spliceosomal components and pre-mRNA, influencing the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons. ZRANB2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including growth and differentiation, and has been associated with several cancers, where it affects tumor progression and therapy resistance (Yang2013ZRANB2; Tanaka2020ZRANB2; Li2019ZRANB2SNHG20FOXK1).

## Structure
The ZRANB2 protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, specifically two RanBP2-type zinc fingers (ZnFs), which are crucial for its function in RNA binding and splicing. These ZnFs are located at the N-terminal region and are involved in recognizing single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) with high specificity and micromolar affinity (De2018Engineering; Loughlin2008Crystallization). The RanBP2-type ZnFs have a consensus sequence and consist of two beta-hairpins sandwiching a zinc ion, forming a structural scaffold that facilitates RNA interaction (Partridge2009Crystallographic; Loughlin2008Crystallization).

The ZRANB2 protein also contains a C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, which interacts with spliceosomal proteins, and a glutamic acid-rich region (Park2012Intron; Yang2013ZRANB2). The RS domain is characteristic of the SR-related family of splicing factors and is involved in protein-protein interactions essential for splicing regulation (Yang2013ZRANB2).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can affect the subcellular localization of ZRANB2, influencing its role in splicing (Yang2013ZRANB2). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functional properties (Park2012Intron).

## Function
ZRANB2 is a protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, a critical process for generating protein diversity in human cells. It is part of the supraspliceosome, a complex structure where pre-mRNAs are processed with spliceosomal components and other splicing factors (Yang2013ZRANB2). ZRANB2 contains zinc finger domains that bind single-stranded RNA with high affinity, allowing it to regulate alternative splicing by interacting directly with pre-mRNA at sites resembling the consensus 5' splice site (Yang2013ZRANB2). This protein influences the splicing patterns of various genes, affecting the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons, which in turn alters the resulting protein isoforms (Yang2013ZRANB2).

ZRANB2 is active in the nucleus, where it localizes to supraspliceosomes, indicating its role in splicing regulation at the exon level (Yang2013ZRANB2). The protein's involvement in alternative splicing is crucial for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular functions, such as growth and differentiation (Ohte2012Identification). Its activity in splicing regulation is significant for healthy cellular processes, contributing to the diversity and functionality of proteins within human cells (Yang2013ZRANB2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ZRANB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioma, ZRANB2 is up-regulated, and its knockdown results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation. This suggests that ZRANB2 plays a significant role in glioma progression by stabilizing SNHG20, a long non-coding RNA, which affects the degradation of FOXK1 mRNA, a transcription factor involved in VM formation (Li2019ZRANB2SNHG20FOXK1).

In breast cancer, ZRANB2 is associated with resistance to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. It regulates alternative splicing events, including the ECT2-Ex5+ splice variant, which is linked to drug resistance. High levels of ZRANB2 contribute to increased inclusion of this exon, promoting resistance. The depletion of ZRANB2 partially reverses this resistance, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Tanaka2020ZRANB2).

ZRANB2 is also highly expressed in ovarian serous papillary carcinomas, suggesting a role in tumor development. Its influence on the splicing of cancer-related genes highlights its potential clinical significance in cancer (Yang2013ZRANB2). These findings underscore the importance of ZRANB2 in cancer progression and therapy resistance.

## Interactions
ZRANB2 is a zinc-finger protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing and splicing through its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids. It contains two RanBP2-type zinc fingers that are crucial for RNA recognition, allowing it to bind single-stranded RNA with micromolar affinities (Loughlin2008Crystallization). ZRANB2 interacts with spliceosomal proteins such as U1-70K and U2AF 35, which are essential components of the spliceosome, influencing alternative splice-site selection (Yang2013ZRANB2; Loughlin2008Crystallization).

In the context of glioma, ZRANB2 enhances the stability of the long non-coding RNA SNHG20, which affects the expression of the transcription factor FOXK1, forming a regulatory axis crucial for vasculogenic mimicry formation in glioma cells (Li2019ZRANB2SNHG20FOXK1). ZRANB2 also interacts with Smad proteins, including Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, to suppress BMP signaling, although it does not affect Smad phosphorylation or nuclear localization (Ohte2012Identification).

In breast cancer, ZRANB2 is involved in the regulation of ECT2 pre-mRNA splicing, particularly influencing the inclusion of exon 5, through its binding to specific RNA motifs (Tanaka2020ZRANB2). These interactions highlight ZRANB2's role in modulating RNA splicing and stability, impacting various cellular processes and disease states.
