# WFDC12

## Overview
The WFDC12 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 12 protein, a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family, which is characterized by a conserved four-disulfide core domain. This protein is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated keratinocytes within the epidermis, where it functions as a serine protease inhibitor, playing a critical role in maintaining skin barrier integrity and modulating immune responses (Kalinina2021The; Glasgow2015A). The WFDC12 protein is involved in regulating proteolytic activity by selectively inhibiting specific proteases, such as human neutrophil elastase and kallikrein-related peptidase 7, which are implicated in various skin conditions, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (Kalinina2021The; Zhao2022A). Additionally, WFDC12 has been associated with immunomodulatory activities, influencing cytokine production and immune cell infiltration, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases (Wen2024Versatile; Zhao2022A).

## Structure
The WFDC12 protein is a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) four-disulfide core domain family, characterized by a conserved region with eight cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds. This structural feature is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Unsworth2017Characterisation; Ranganathan1999The). The primary structure of WFDC12 includes a short N-terminal segment, the four-disulfide core, and a C-terminal region of approximately 40 amino acids, although this C-terminal section lacks a recognized domain structure (Unsworth2017Characterisation).

The secondary structure of WFDC12 is likely to involve beta-sheets, stabilized by the disulfide bonds typical of WAP proteins (Ranganathan1999The). The tertiary structure is compact due to the disulfide-linked core, which is a common feature in this protein family (Unsworth2017Characterisation). Homology modeling has confirmed the structure of the disulfide-linked core with high confidence, although the C-terminal domain could not be modeled confidently due to the lack of a specific template (Unsworth2017Characterisation).

In mouse lemurs, the WFDC12 protein is expressed in a 'short form' in urine, with no evidence of a 'long form' being present, suggesting potential splice variant isoforms (Unsworth2017Characterisation).

## Function
The WFDC12 gene encodes a protein that is specifically expressed in terminally differentiated keratinocytes (KCs) within the epidermis. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating epidermal serine protease activity, which is essential for maintaining skin barrier integrity. WFDC12 is upregulated as keratinocytes transition into the stratum corneum, where it functions as a serine protease inhibitor, reducing the proteolytic activity of certain proteases in a dose-dependent manner (Kalinina2021The). It is primarily found in the uppermost granular layer and the stratum corneum, suggesting its involvement in the final stages of keratinocyte differentiation and corneocyte adhesion (Kalinina2021The).

WFDC12 is released by differentiated keratinocytes and localizes to intercellular spaces, potentially playing a role in corneocyte adhesion by controlling the integrity of corneodesmosomes (Kalinina2021The). The protein is water-elutable from the skin surface, indicating it is not tightly bound to corneocytes (Kalinina2021The). In addition to its role in the skin, WFDC12 exhibits immunomodulatory activity, such as inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in response to inflammatory stimuli (Glasgow2015A). These functions highlight WFDC12's role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WFDC12 gene have been implicated in several skin conditions, particularly those involving inflammation and immune dysregulation. In atopic dermatitis (AD), WFDC12 is highly expressed in skin lesions and is associated with the disease's pathogenesis. Overexpression of WFDC12 in the epidermis is linked to increased immune-inflammatory responses, promoting the migration of antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes and enhancing T cell differentiation. This process exacerbates AD symptoms by upregulating inflammatory mediators through the activation of the lipoxygenase pathway in arachidonic acid metabolism (Li2023WFDC12overexpressing; Wen2024Versatile).

In psoriasis, WFDC12 expression is increased in skin lesions and correlates with disease severity. It influences the pathogenesis by affecting immune cell infiltration and cytokine release, particularly promoting Th1 cell differentiation and IFN-γ secretion, which aggravates psoriasis symptoms. WFDC12's role in psoriasis is also linked to disruptions in retinoic acid synthesis and metabolism, potentially influencing disease progression (Wen2024Versatile; Zhao2022A).

In Netherton syndrome, WFDC12 expression is notably higher in non-inflamed skin, possibly as a compensatory mechanism due to increased protease activity from the lack of LEKTI, a protease inhibitor (Kalinina2021The).

## Interactions
WFDC12, a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family, is involved in various interactions that influence its role in skin conditions. It acts as a serine protease inhibitor, specifically inhibiting human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7), but not affecting KLK5 and KLK14. This selective inhibition suggests a role in regulating proteolytic activity in the epidermis, particularly in conditions with abnormal protease activity (Kalinina2021The).

In the context of psoriasis, WFDC12 is associated with the regulation of immune responses. It influences the infiltration of Langerhans cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, which are crucial in the immune-inflammatory process of psoriasis. This interaction is linked to increased levels of IL-12 and IFN-g, promoting Th1 cell differentiation and exacerbating psoriasis symptoms (Zhao2022A).

WFDC12 also interacts with pathways involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation, such as the PPAR signaling pathway and retinoic acid signaling pathway. These interactions suggest that WFDC12 may regulate immune processes and contribute to epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis (Zhao2022A).
