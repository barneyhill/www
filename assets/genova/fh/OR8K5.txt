# OR8K5

## Overview
The OR8K5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily K member 5, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor proteins, including OR8K5, share a characteristic 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is also common to many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. This structural feature allows them to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins, initiating a cascade of intracellular events that ultimately lead to the perception of odors. The OR8K5 gene is one of many olfactory receptor genes, which together form the largest gene family in the human genome.
