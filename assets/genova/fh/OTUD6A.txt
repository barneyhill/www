# OTUD6A

## Overview
OTUD6A is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 6A, which functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by regulating protein stability and activity through the removal of ubiquitin moieties. OTU deubiquitinase 6A is involved in critical cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial dynamics, and stress responses. It achieves these roles by interacting with and stabilizing key proteins, including Aurora kinase A and nucleolin, thereby influencing mitotic entry and cell proliferation. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, highlighting its versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Due to its involvement in these processes, OTU deubiquitinase 6A has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Kim2022Ovarian; Cui2024Deubiquitination; Kim2021OTUD6A).

## Function
OTUD6A (OTU deubiquitinase 6A) functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme, playing a crucial role in regulating protein stability and activity in healthy human cells. It specifically targets Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A), a key regulator of mitosis, by deubiquitinating and stabilizing it, thereby enhancing its kinase activity. This stabilization extends the half-life of Aurora-A and promotes its phosphorylation at threonine 288, a critical activation site, which in turn facilitates the phosphorylation and activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), essential for mitotic entry (Kim2021OTUD6A).

OTUD6A also influences the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes, such as Cyclin G1 (CCNG1) and Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2), suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation (Kim2021OTUD6A). In addition to its role in cell cycle progression, OTUD6A is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by stabilizing Drp1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Shi2020Deubiquitinase).

OTUD6A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis by modulating protein turnover and stability, thus influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and stress responses (Kim2022Ovarian; Kim2021OTUD6A).

## Clinical Significance
OTUD6A (OTU deubiquitinase 6A) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in deubiquitination processes that affect protein stability and cell cycle regulation. In bladder cancer, OTUD6A promotes tumor progression and chemoresistance by stabilizing the CDC6 protein, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. This stabilization leads to decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like gemcitabine and methotrexate through the CDC6-ATR-Chk1 pathway, impacting DNA damage response and contributing to poor survival outcomes in patients (Cui2024Deubiquitination).

OTUD6A also interacts with Aurora kinase A, a protein overexpressed in many cancers, stabilizing and activating it through deubiquitination. This interaction enhances the expression of cancer-related genes, suggesting OTUD6A as a potential therapeutic target in cancers such as colorectal, glioma, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers (Kim2021OTUD6A).

In addition, OTUD6A is involved in regulating cell proliferation through its interaction with nucleolin and caspase-7, proteins associated with the p53 signaling pathway. This regulation is significant in various carcinomas, including colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers, where OTUD6A promotes tumorigenesis by stabilizing proteins that interact with p53 (Kim2022Ovarian).

## Interactions
OTUD6A is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. It interacts with nucleolin, a protein involved in cell proliferation, and caspase-7, which is associated with apoptosis. OTUD6A binds directly to nucleolin, forming a complex with nucleolin and the tumor suppressor p53, suggesting a regulatory mechanism influencing cell survival and proliferation (Kim2022Ovarian). OTUD6A stabilizes nucleolin by deubiquitinating it, specifically targeting K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are typically associated with proteasomal degradation (Kim2022Ovarian).

OTUD6A also interacts with CDC6, a protein crucial for cell cycle progression and DNA replication. It stabilizes CDC6 by removing K6-, K33-, and K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, preventing its degradation and promoting cell proliferation (Cui2024Deubiquitination). The interaction between OTUD6A and CDC6 is necessary for OTUD6A's regulatory function, as demonstrated by the inability of a deubiquitinase-dead mutant of OTUD6A to stabilize CDC6 (Cui2024Deubiquitination).

Additionally, OTUD6A interacts with Aurora kinase A, a critical mitotic regulator. It binds to the kinase domain of Aurora-A, enhancing its stability and activity, which in turn influences cell cycle regulation (Kim2021OTUD6A). These interactions highlight OTUD6A's role in modulating the stability and function of key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
