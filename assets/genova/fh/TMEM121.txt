# TMEM121

## Overview
TMEM121 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 121, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. TMEM121 is associated with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. The protein's expression levels and interactions have been studied in relation to cervical cancer, where it appears to modulate the expression of several cancer-related proteins and influence cell cycle progression. Additionally, TMEM121 has been implicated in intellectual disability as part of the 14q32.33 deletion syndrome and is linked to glycan synthesis in human blood plasma. These diverse roles highlight TMEM121's potential significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Nevado2014New; Yang2022Transmembrane; Sharapov2018Defining).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM121 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genetic mutations. In cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), TMEM121 expression is significantly downregulated compared to normal tissues, with increased promoter methylation observed in cancerous tissues. Despite these changes, there is no significant difference in overall survival between patients with low and high TMEM121 expression levels. The gene is involved in pathways such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is associated with cancer progression, cell migration, and apoptosis, suggesting its role in influencing cancer progression (Yang2022Transmembrane).

TMEM121 is also associated with intellectual disability as part of the 14q32.33 deletion syndrome. This chromosomal deletion affects a region containing TMEM121, among other genes, indicating its potential involvement in the syndrome's clinical features (Nevado2014New).

In the context of glycan synthesis, TMEM121 has been linked to the sialylation of core-fucosylated biantennary monogalactosylated structures in human blood plasma. A variant in the TMEM121 gene leads to an in-frame deletion, suggesting a role in glycan traits, although specific diseases related to this function have not been detailed (Sharapov2018Defining).

## Interactions
TMEM121, a transmembrane protein, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular functions, particularly in the context of cervical cancer. The protein is associated with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cancer progression. TMEM121 expression is positively correlated with AKT1 and negatively correlated with PIK3CB, CASP3, and CDH1, suggesting its involvement in modulating cell migration and apoptosis through this pathway (Yang2022Transmembrane).

Experimental studies in HeLa cells have shown that overexpression of TMEM121 leads to decreased levels of cancer-related proteins such as BCL-2, cyclin D1, and cyclin E2, while increasing the expression of p27 and E-cadherin. This indicates that TMEM121 may inhibit cell proliferation and migration by interacting with these proteins (Yang2022Transmembrane). Conversely, knockdown of TMEM121 results in the inhibition of RB, p53, and p27 protein expression and promotes cyclin E1 expression, further highlighting its regulatory role in cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Yang2022Transmembrane).

TMEM121 also influences the phosphorylation of signaling proteins, promoting P38 phosphorylation and inhibiting AKT phosphorylation, which are critical processes in cell survival and stress response pathways (Yang2022Transmembrane). These interactions underscore TMEM121's potential as a therapeutic target in cervical cancer.
