# LCA5L

## Overview
The LCA5L gene encodes the protein lebercilin LCA5 like, which is implicated in various cellular processes. Lebercilin LCA5 like is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function. It is involved in the organization of microtubules and may have a role in intracellular transport mechanisms. The protein's function is essential for normal cellular operations, and disruptions in its activity can lead to significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of genetic disorders affecting the retina (Qiu2020aarFDC).
