# SKP1

## Overview
The SKP1 gene encodes the S-phase kinase-associated protein 1, a pivotal component of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. As an adaptor protein, SKP1 links F-box proteins to the core SCF complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This process is vital for regulating the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and apoptosis, thereby maintaining genome stability and cellular homeostasis (Thompson2022Aberrant). The structural flexibility of SKP1, particularly in its C-terminal region, allows it to interact with various F-box proteins, underscoring its adaptability and functional diversity (Bhattacharya2022Disorder). Aberrations in SKP1 expression or function are linked to several human disorders, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Thompson2020Reduced; SalasLeal2023Differential).

## Structure
The SKP1 protein is a key component of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in protein degradation pathways. The primary structure of SKP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 19 kDa (Bhattacharya2022Disorder). The secondary structure of SKP1 includes a series of alpha helices and beta sheets, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, which identified the architecture as β1-β2-H1-H2-L1-H3-L2-H4-H5-H6-H7, with a long disordered C-terminal tail (Bhattacharya2022Disorder).

The tertiary structure of SKP1 is characterized by its flexibility, particularly in the C-terminal region, which includes helices H6, H7, and H8. This region shows variability depending on the binding partner, allowing SKP1 to adapt and bind to various F-box proteins (Bhattacharya2022Disorder). The quaternary structure involves SKP1 forming a heterodimer with F-box proteins, which is essential for its function in the SCF complex (Willhoft2017The).

SKP1 contains an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain that interacts with Cullin1, a structural subunit of the SCF complexes (Willhoft2017The). The protein's structural flexibility is crucial for its role in forming complexes with F-box proteins, as the C-terminal undergoes a coil-helix transition upon binding (Bhattacharya2022Disorder).

## Function
The SKP1 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in human cells. This complex is responsible for the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of various substrate proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating numerous cellular pathways (Thompson2022Aberrant). SKP1 functions as an adaptor protein within the SCF complex, connecting F-box proteins, which confer substrate specificity, to the core complex. This facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 conjugating enzyme to the protein target, marking it for degradation by the 26S proteasome (Thompson2022Aberrant).

In healthy human cells, SKP1 is involved in regulating the cell cycle, DNA damage response, apoptosis, and centrosome homeostasis. It plays a significant role in maintaining genome stability by ensuring proper segregation of genetic material into daughter cells (Thompson2022Aberrant). SKP1 is also active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Thompson2020Reduced). Aberrant expression or function of SKP1 can lead to genome instability and is associated with several human disorders, including cancer (Thompson2022Aberrant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SKP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, aberrant SKP1 expression can lead to genome instability by disrupting the SCF complex's role in protein turnover, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. This disruption can result in increased replication stress, double-strand breaks, and chromothripsis, contributing to cancer development and progression (Thompson2020Reduced). SKP1 mutations or reduced expression are associated with chromosome instability (CIN), which is linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor prognosis (Thompson2020Reduced; Lepage2021Reduced).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), decreased SKP1 expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta is implicated in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the formation of Lewy body-like inclusions, exacerbating PD pathology. SKP1 interacts with F-box proteins like FBXO7, and its deficiency can lead to dopaminergic neuron loss and motor disabilities, mimicking PD symptoms (SalasLeal2023Differential; FishmanJacob2023A). These findings suggest that SKP1 expression levels could serve as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between healthy individuals and PD patients (SalasLeal2023Differential).

## Interactions
SKP1, a core component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, participates in various protein interactions essential for its function in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. It acts as an adapter linking F-box proteins to Cul1, facilitating the assembly of the SCF complex. This interaction is crucial for determining substrate specificity, as F-box proteins bind to specific substrates for ubiquitination (Zheng2002Structure).

In Arabidopsis, SKP1, also known as ASK1, interacts with Snf1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) and the a4/PAD1 proteasomal subunit, forming a complex that is important for proteasomal binding. This interaction is modulated by the regulatory protein PRL1, which can disrupt the binding of SKP1/ASK1 to SnRKs (Farras2001SKP1-SnRK).

SKP1 also forms part of the RAVE complex, which includes Rav1 and Rav2, and is involved in the regulation of V-ATPase assembly. This complex highlights SKP1's role beyond ubiquitination, as it does not function as an ubiquitin ligase in this context (Seol2001Skp1).

In humans, SKP1 interacts with cyclin A/Cdk complexes, playing a role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in S phase entry. It binds to Skp2p, which associates with cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression (Bai1996SKP1).
