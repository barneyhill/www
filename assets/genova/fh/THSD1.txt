# THSD1

## Overview
THSD1, or thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular adhesion and signaling, particularly within endothelial cells. The protein, categorized as an adhesion molecule, plays a pivotal role in maintaining focal adhesion stability and regulating autophagy through its interactions with key components such as talin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Xu2023THSD1). THSD1 is essential for vascular integrity, influencing processes that are critical for cell attachment and spreading. Variants in the THSD1 gene have been linked to vascular diseases, including intracranial aneurysms and atherosclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Xu2023THSD1; Haasdijk2016THSD1preserves). The protein's interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and its involvement in the FAK-PI3K-Rac1 signaling pathway underscore its importance in endothelial barrier function and cellular adhesion dynamics (Haasdijk2016THSD1preserves).

## Function
The THSD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy and maintaining focal adhesion (FA) stability in endothelial cells. THSD1 localizes at FAs by interacting with talin, a component of the integrin complex, which connects the extracellular matrix to intracellular adaptors. This interaction helps maintain the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at FAs, which is essential for cell spreading and attachment (Xu2023THSD1). 

THSD1 modulates the Fak-Beclin 1 pathway, which is crucial for autophagy-mediated processes. It enhances FAK kinase activity, leading to the phosphorylation of Beclin 1 at tyrosine 233. This phosphorylation inhibits the binding of ATG14 to Beclin 1, thereby suppressing autophagy and ensuring the stability of FAs (Xu2023THSD1). The loss of THSD1 disrupts this balance, resulting in reduced FAK activity, increased Beclin 1-ATG14 complex formation, and enhanced autophagy, which can lead to the degradation of FAs and potentially impair cell attachment and spreading (Xu2023THSD1).

THSD1 is also essential for vascular integrity, as it maintains FA stability and is connected to vascular diseases like intracranial aneurysms. Variants in the THSD1 gene have been linked to impaired interaction with talin, affecting vascular integrity (Xu2023THSD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the THSD1 gene have been linked to several vascular disorders. In the context of atherosclerosis, THSD1 is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity. Its expression is associated with the regulation of the Rac1-mediated pathway, which is vital for the stability of adherens junctions in endothelial cells. Disruption of this pathway can lead to vascular integrity loss, contributing to diseases like atherosclerosis. In advanced atherosclerosis, THSD1 expression is linked to intraplaque hemorrhaging, and its overexpression in a murine model reduced plaque vulnerability by decreasing vascular leakage and macrophage accumulation (Haasdijk2016THSD1preserves).

THSD1 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Variants of THSD1 have been linked to compromised ability to promote FAK-talin interaction, which is crucial for focal adhesion assembly. Several missense variants identified in patients with IA suggest a connection between THSD1 mutations and IA pathogenesis, as these variants show reduced binding affinity to talin, leading to decreased mature adhesion numbers and cell attachment (Rui2017The).

Additionally, the THSD1 gene has been associated with hemorrhagic stroke (HS). The rs3803264 polymorphism in THSD1 is associated with a decreased risk of HS, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage, but not subarachnoid hemorrhage (Chen2023SNP).

## Interactions
THSD1 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular adhesion and signaling. It forms a multimeric protein complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), talin, and vinculin at nascent focal adhesions. This interaction is essential for the transition from nascent to mature focal adhesions, which is critical for cell attachment and adhesion dynamics (Rui2017The). THSD1 enhances the interaction between FAK and talin, a key step in nascent adhesion assembly, and this interaction is disrupted by certain THSD1 variants, such as the THSD1-R450X truncation variant (Rui2017The).

THSD1 also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing endothelial barrier function through the FAK-PI3K-Rac1 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell junction integrity and endothelial barrier preservation (Haasdijk2016THSD1preserves). The protein's role in focal adhesion dynamics is further supported by its presence in endosomes, where it undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process necessary for its function in increasing mature adhesion numbers and cell attachment (Rui2017The). These interactions highlight THSD1's significant role in cellular adhesion and vascular integrity.
