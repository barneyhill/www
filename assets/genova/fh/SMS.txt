# SMS

## Overview
The SMS gene encodes the enzyme spermine synthase, a critical aminopropyltransferase involved in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of spermidine to spermine, a process essential for maintaining cellular polyamine balance, which is crucial for various cellular functions such as DNA stabilization, gene expression, and ion channel regulation (Lauren2003Xlinked; Pegg2009Mammalian). Spermine synthase is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular growth and differentiation. The proper functioning of this enzyme is vital for normal physiological processes, including brain development and cognitive function (Lauren2003Xlinked). Mutations in the SMS gene are associated with Snyder-Robinson syndrome, an X-linked intellectual disability disorder, and alterations in SMS expression have been implicated in cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (Xiang2022Overexpression; de2008New).

## Structure
The human spermine synthase (SMS) protein is an aminopropyltransferase involved in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, converting spermidine into spermine. The SMS protein is composed of 529 amino acids and forms a dimer of two identical subunits, each consisting of two functional domains: the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is essential for dimerization and shares structural similarity with S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdometDC), while the C-terminal domain contains the active site for spermine synthesis and is homologous to spermidine synthase (Zhang2010Computational).

The dimerization of SMS is critical for its enzymatic activity, as demonstrated by studies using deletion mutants. The 3D structures of human SMS with either spermidine or spermine have been experimentally determined, revealing that residues Asp201 and Asp276 are key to the catalytic reaction (Zhang2010Computational). The structure of SMS includes a Rossmann fold, which is common in proteins that bind nucleotides, such as the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-like N-terminal domain (Zhang2010Computational).

Mutations in the SMS gene, such as G56S, can destabilize the SMS homo-dimer and abolish its enzymatic activity, highlighting the importance of the dimer interface for protein function (Zhang2014Rational).

## Function
The SMS gene encodes the enzyme spermine synthase, which plays a crucial role in polyamine metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of spermidine to spermine. This process is essential for maintaining the balance of polyamines within cells, which are vital for various cellular functions, including DNA stabilization, gene expression, and ion channel regulation (Lauren2003Xlinked; Pegg2009Mammalian). Spermine, along with other polyamines, interacts with nucleic acids, phospholipids, and proteins, influencing critical cellular processes such as transcription, translation, and modulation of ion channel activities (Lauren2003Xlinked).

In healthy human cells, spermine synthase activity ensures a proper spermidine:spermine ratio, which is necessary for normal cellular function (Pegg2009Mammalian). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular growth and differentiation by stabilizing DNA structures and modulating ion channels (Qazi2020Wholeexome). The proper functioning of spermine synthase is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting normal physiological processes, including brain development and cognitive function (Lauren2003Xlinked). Disruptions in spermine synthase activity can lead to significant clinical manifestations, highlighting its importance in human health (de2008New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMS gene, which encodes spermine synthase, are linked to Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), a rare X-linked intellectual disability disorder. This condition is characterized by developmental delay, osteoporosis, facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and other physical abnormalities such as kyphoscoliosis and seizures (de2008New; Qazi2020Wholeexome; Lauren2003Xlinked). Specific mutations, such as the missense mutation p.G56S and the splice site mutation 329 + 5 G4A, lead to significant reductions in spermine synthase activity, resulting in altered polyamine levels and contributing to the clinical manifestations of SRS (Lauren2003Xlinked; de2008New).

Alterations in SMS expression levels have also been implicated in cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of SMS in the tumor microenvironment is associated with immunosuppression, affecting the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapies and correlating with poor prognosis in HCC patients (Xiang2022Overexpression). High SMS expression is linked to more severe tumor stages and worse pathological features, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for HCC (Xiang2022Overexpression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SMS in both genetic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
Spermine synthase (SMS) is involved in polyamine biosynthesis, primarily converting spermidine into spermine. This enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular polyamine levels, which are essential for cell growth and differentiation. SMS interacts with other components of the polyamine metabolic pathway, such as spermidine synthase and ornithine decarboxylase, to regulate these levels (Xiang2022Overexpression).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SMS has been shown to interact functionally with the MYC oncogene to repress the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. This interaction is crucial for CRC cell survival, as SMS deletion leads to increased Bim expression by inhibiting the acetylation of the transcription factor FOXO3a, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and enhance Bim transcription (Guo2020Spermine). MYC further contributes to this repression by inducing miR-19a and miR-19b, which co-repress Bim expression (Guo2020Spermine).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SMS overexpression is associated with immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that SMS may influence immune-related pathways and processes (Xiang2022Overexpression). However, specific physical interactions of SMS with other proteins or nucleic acids in these contexts are not detailed in the available literature.
