# CD58

## Overview
CD58, also known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), is a gene that encodes a cell surface glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD58 protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating cell adhesion and recognition, primarily through its interaction with the CD2 receptor on T cells and natural killer cells. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation, proliferation, and the formation of the immunological synapse, which is essential for effective immune responses (Zhang2021CD58; Sun1999Functional). CD58 exists in two isoforms: a type-I transmembrane form and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form, each with distinct roles in cell adhesion and signaling (Zhang2021CD58). The protein's structure is characterized by two immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its binding interactions (Ikemizu1999Crystal). CD58's involvement in immune modulation and its clinical significance in various diseases, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple sclerosis, underscore its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Hecker2019A; Cao2016Mutations).

## Structure
The CD58 protein, also known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and immune response. Structurally, CD58 consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains: a membrane-distal V-set domain and a membrane-proximal C2-set domain (Ikemizu1999Crystal). The primary structure of CD58 includes a 179-residue ectodomain with significant glycosylation, accounting for 40-70% of its molecular weight, which is crucial for its stability and function (Sun1999Functional).

The secondary structure of CD58 is characterized by nine β-strands forming two antiparallel β-sheets, typical of immunoglobulin-like domains (Wang1999Structure). The tertiary structure reveals a V-set topology with a ligand-binding site on the GFCC'CC'' face, which is largely free of glycosylation (Ikemizu1999Crystal). The interaction with CD2 is primarily driven by electrostatic complementarity, with a highly acidic surface on CD58 interacting with the basic CD2 surface (Ikemizu1999Crystal).

CD58 exists in two isoforms: a type-I transmembrane form and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form. These isoforms differ in their membrane anchoring and functional roles, with the GPI-anchored form residing in lipid rafts and enhancing cell adhesion, while the transmembrane form is involved in signal transduction (Zhang2021CD58).

## Function
The CD58 gene encodes a protein known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), which plays a crucial role in the immune system by facilitating cell adhesion and recognition. CD58 is primarily involved in mediating interactions between T cells and target cells through its binding with CD2, a receptor found on T and natural killer (NK) cells. This interaction is essential for T cell activation, proliferation, and the formation of the immunological synapse, which is critical for effective immune responses (Zhang2021CD58; Sun1999Functional).

CD58 is expressed on a variety of human cells, including hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, and exists in two isoforms: a type-I transmembrane form and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored form. These isoforms are located in different membrane compartments and have distinct roles in cell adhesion and signaling (Zhang2021CD58). The interaction between CD58 and CD2 is characterized by electrostatic attraction, which helps overcome intercellular charge repulsion and optimizes the distance for T cell receptor-ligand interactions (Zhang2021CD58; Sun1999Functional).

CD58 also plays a role in modulating immune responses, influencing processes like cytokine production and cytotoxicity. It enhances the responsiveness of memory T cells and supports the proliferation and function of CD28-deficient CD8+ T cells, which are important for controlling chronic infections (Zhang2021CD58).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD58 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mutations in CD58 are associated with negative protein expression, leading to shorter progression-free and overall survival, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for CD58 (Cao2016Mutations). CD58 is also implicated in resistance to bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) therapy, as its loss disrupts the CD58-CD2 interaction, reducing T-cell cytotoxicity and contributing to therapy resistance in cancers like DLBCL and melanoma (Shen2022Cancer).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CD58 gene are associated with altered expression levels, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility. The MS risk allele is linked to lower CD58 mRNA levels, which may affect immune regulation (Hecker2019A). Similarly, CD58 polymorphisms are associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO), where decreased CD58 expression may influence disease development (Kim2014CD58).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), upregulated CD58 expression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2021Upregulated).

## Interactions
CD58, also known as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), is a cell surface glycoprotein that primarily interacts with the CD2 receptor on T cells and natural killer cells. This interaction is crucial for mediating cell adhesion and signaling, facilitating T cell activation and immune synapse formation. The binding between CD58 and CD2 involves the major beta sheet surfaces of their respective adhesion domains, characterized by electrostatic complementarity. The CD58 binding site on CD2 is a highly charged surface area, while CD58 itself has a negatively charged binding face that complements the positively charged face of CD2 (Ikemizu1999Crystal; Sun1999Functional; Arulanandam1994Interaction).

The interaction between CD58 and CD2 is relatively weak, which allows for dynamic and reversible cell-cell contacts necessary for effective immune responses. This weak interaction is primarily driven by electrostatic contacts rather than hydrophobic interactions, which are common in other protein-protein interactions (Ikemizu1999Crystal). CD58 also interacts with CD48, although with much weaker affinity compared to CD2, suggesting a specialized evolutionary adaptation for CD2 binding (Arulanandam1994Interaction). The interaction between CD58 and CD2 is significant for antigen recognition by T cells and is a target for therapeutic interventions in autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection (Tripathi2021Structurebased).
