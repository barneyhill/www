# OTUB1

## Overview
OTUB1 is a gene that encodes the OTU deubiquitinase, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1, a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, specifically within the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family, which is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitinated proteins, thereby modulating their stability and function (Edelmann2009Structural). The OTUB1 protein is known for its unique ability to inhibit ubiquitin transfer by interacting with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, independent of its catalytic activity (Herhaus2013OTUB1). It is implicated in various cellular signaling pathways, including mTORC1 and TGFβ, and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage response (Herhaus2013OTUB1; Zhao2018OTUB1). Due to its involvement in these critical pathways, OTUB1 has been associated with several diseases, including cancer, lung diseases, and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2021The; Ruiz‐Serrano2021OTUB1).

## Structure
The OTUB1 protein is a deubiquitylating enzyme characterized by a conserved ovarian tumor (OTU) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Edelmann2009Structural). The primary structure of OTUB1 includes a catalytic triad within a papain-like domain, although the conformation of this triad suggests an autoinhibited state, which is unique among cysteine proteases (Edelmann2009Structural). The secondary structure of OTUB1 comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Edelmann2009Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, OTUB1 has a closed conformation in its apo form, which is not competent for catalysis. A conformational change upon ubiquitin binding is proposed to activate the catalytic triad (Edelmann2009Structural). The protein's structure includes specific binding interfaces for ubiquitin, involving significant surface area interactions that are critical for its function (Juang2012OTUB1).

OTUB1 also interacts with E2 enzymes, and its activity can be modulated by specific mutations at the OTUB1-E2 interface (Juang2012OTUB1). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate OTUB1's interactions and activity (Juang2012OTUB1). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The OTUB1 gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating several cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, OTUB1 is involved in the mTORC1 signaling pathway by deubiquitinating and stabilizing DEPTOR, an inhibitor of mTORC1. This action suppresses mTORC1 activity, influencing cell proliferation, cell size, and autophagy (Zhao2018OTUB1). OTUB1 also regulates the stability and activity of the p53 protein by suppressing MDM2-mediated p53 degradation, which is important for the cellular response to stress and DNA damage (Sun2011Positive).

OTUB1 modulates the stability of c-IAP1, a protein involved in TNF receptor-mediated signaling, by cleaving K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, thus affecting cell death pathways and signaling (Goncharov2013OTUB1). In the TGFβ signaling pathway, OTUB1 enhances signaling by inhibiting the ubiquitylation and degradation of active SMAD2/3 proteins, thereby promoting transcriptional responses and cellular migration (Herhaus2013OTUB1). OTUB1's activity is not limited to its catalytic function, as it can also inhibit ubiquitylation through interactions with E2 enzymes (Herhaus2013OTUB1). These functions highlight OTUB1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating critical signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
OTUB1 is implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating protein degradation and cellular signaling. In cancer, OTUB1 is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. It facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreases E-cadherin expression, promoting metastasis in colorectal and glioma cells (Zhu2021The; Zhou2014OTUB1). In colorectal cancer, high OTUB1 expression correlates with greater tumor invasive depth, lymph node involvement, and poor prognosis (Zhou2014OTUB1). OTUB1 also enhances androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer, promoting cell invasion (Saldana2019Otubain).

In lung diseases, OTUB1 is linked to lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It regulates RAS mono-ubiquitination, enhancing RAS activity and cancer progression in lung cancer (Ruiz‐Serrano2021OTUB1). In IPF, OTUB1 contributes to increased lung fibrosis through pro-fibrotic signaling (Ruiz‐Serrano2021OTUB1).

OTUB1 is also involved in neurological diseases, affecting Tau aggregation in Alzheimer's and Lewy body pathology in Parkinson's disease (Zhu2021The). In kidney diseases, it is associated with uric acid levels and may contribute to glomerulonephritis pathogenesis (Zhu2021The). These diverse roles highlight OTUB1's potential as a therapeutic target across multiple conditions.

## Interactions
OTUB1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with various proteins, influencing multiple cellular pathways. It forms complexes with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, such as UBC13, UBE2D2, and UBE2E1, inhibiting their activity by blocking access to E3 ligases and preventing ubiquitin transfer (Que2020Comparison; Juang2012OTUB1). OTUB1 also interacts with phospho-SMAD2/3 in the TGFβ signaling pathway, inhibiting their ubiquitylation and degradation, which enhances TGFβ-mediated gene transcription and cellular migration (Herhaus2013OTUB1).

In the context of cancer, OTUB1 interacts with FOXM1, stabilizing it by decreasing its ubiquitination, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance (Wu2024OTUB1mediated). It also interacts with YAP1 in gastric cancer, enhancing its stability and promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Wu2024OTUB1mediated). OTUB1's interaction with DEPTOR stabilizes this mTORC1 inhibitor, thereby suppressing mTORC1 activity (Zhao2018OTUB1).

OTUB1's interactions are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its subcellular localization and interaction dynamics (Wu2024OTUB1mediated). These interactions highlight OTUB1's role in modulating ubiquitin signaling and its impact on various cellular processes.
