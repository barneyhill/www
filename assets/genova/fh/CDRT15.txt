# CDRT15

## Overview
The CDRT15 gene encodes the protein known as CMT1A duplicated region transcript 15, which is involved in various cellular processes. While the specific functional category of the protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in genetic conditions due to its location within the 17p12 chromosomal region. This region is notable for its association with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Type 1A (CMT1A), a disorder characterized by peripheral neuropathy. The CDRT15 gene has been studied for its role in splicing variations and genetic duplications, which can lead to clinical manifestations such as clubfoot deformity and other developmental anomalies (Lin20205′; Milanovic2024Clinical). Understanding the gene's interactions and mutations is crucial for comprehending its contribution to these conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDRT15 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A study on Serbian patients with clubfoot deformity identified a heterozygous duplication in the genomic region 17p12, which includes the CDRT15 gene. This duplication was classified as pathogenic and was associated with bilateral clubfoot, adenoid hypertrophy, and cryptorchism in a patient. The duplication also encompasses the PMP22 gene, which is linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Type 1A (CMT1A), a hereditary neuropathy characterized by peripheral nerve damage, muscle weakness, and sensory loss (Milanovic2024Clinical).

In another study, the CDRT15 gene was noted for its involvement in splicing variations. Specifically, the 15+2C>T substitution in CDRT15 was found to generate additional transcript bands, suggesting a potential impact on gene expression. However, these +2C>T variants are generally considered non-pathogenic, indicating that while they may alter splicing, they do not typically result in disease (Lin20205′).

These findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of conditions associated with CDRT15, underscoring the importance of genetic analysis in understanding its clinical significance.
