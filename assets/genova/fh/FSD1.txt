# FSD1

## Overview
The FSD1 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III and SPRY domain containing 1, which is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in cellular processes related to microtubule dynamics and ciliogenesis. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, comprising a BBC domain, an FN3 domain, and a SPRY domain, which contribute to its functional capabilities. The SPRY domain is particularly important for microtubule association, while the coiled-coil domain facilitates centrosome localization, underscoring its involvement in axoneme assembly and the anchoring of microtubule asters at centrosomes (Tu2018Microtubule; CarimTodd2001Characterization). FSD1's interactions with other proteins at the centrosome and transition zone are crucial for the assembly and maintenance of cilia, with implications for understanding ciliopathies and other related human diseases (Tu2018Microtubule).

## Structure
The FSD1 protein, encoded by the FSD1 gene located on chromosome 19, is specifically expressed in the brain and has a molecular structure characterized by three distinct domains. The protein includes a BBC domain, spanning residues 4 to 130, which is a coiled-coil region found downstream of some B-box domains. This is followed by an FN3 domain, from residue 165 to 258, which is a fibronectin type 3 internal repeat present in both intracellular and extracellular proteins. Lastly, the protein contains a SPRY domain between residues 353 and 474, a domain of unknown function present in SP1a and in the ryanodine receptor (CarimTodd2001Characterization).

The FSD1 protein has a calculated mass of 55.8 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 6.54. It shares domain content with midline development proteins such as MID1 but lacks the N-terminal ring finger and B-box domains characteristic of the B-box ring finger family. The gene has orthologous counterparts in other species, indicating a high degree of conservation during vertebrate evolution (CarimTodd2001Characterization).

The SPRY domain of FSD1 is capable of microtubule association, while the coiled-coil domain is sufficient for centrosome localization, highlighting its role in cellular processes such as ciliogenesis (Tu2018Microtubule).

## Function
The FSD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics, particularly in anchoring microtubule asters at centrosomes, which is essential for axoneme assembly and ciliogenesis in healthy human cells (Tu2018Microtubule). FSD1 directly binds to microtubules through its SPRY domain, and this interaction is critical for its function in ciliogenesis (Tu2018Microtubule). The protein is localized to the middle region near the subdistal region of the mother centriole, where it contributes to the anchoring of microtubules (Tu2018Microtubule). 

FSD1 is involved in the localization of several proteins at the centrosome and transition zone, including Cep290 and PCM1, which are crucial for the assembly of the transition zone during ciliogenesis (Tu2018Microtubule). The protein forms a ring structure at the centrioles and is essential for maintaining the dynamics of centriolar satellites during interphase (Tu2018Microtubule). FSD1's role in anchoring microtubule asters is vital for the proper assembly and function of cilia, which are important for various cellular processes (Tu2018Microtubule). Its activity is crucial for maintaining healthy cellular processes, as defects in ciliogenesis are linked to various human diseases known as ciliopathies (Tu2018Microtubule).
