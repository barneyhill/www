# PPP2R3A

## Overview
The PPP2R3A gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B''alpha, which is a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, a major serine/threonine phosphatase in mammalian cells. This regulatory subunit belongs to the B''-family and is involved in modulating the activity and specificity of PP2A by interacting with various substrates and other proteins. The protein plays a significant role in cardiac function, influencing processes such as myocardial contractility and cellular excitability through its interactions with key cardiac proteins like the L-type Ca2+ channel and the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) (wu2021potential). Additionally, PPP2R3A is implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, with its dysregulation linked to diseases such as cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor (Dmitriev2020Functional). The protein's activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its versatile role in cellular signaling pathways (Shi2022GREM1PPP2R3A).

## Function
The PPP2R3A gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a major serine/threonine phosphatase in mammalian cells. This subunit is part of the B''-family and has two major splice products, PR72 and PR130, which are highly expressed in the human heart. PPP2R3A plays a crucial role in cardiac function by mediating interactions between the PP2A heterodimer and its substrates, such as the L-type Ca2+ channel and the ryanodine receptor (RyR2), which are essential for cellular excitability and myocardial contractility (wu2021potential).

In cardiomyocytes, PPP2R3A is involved in the dephosphorylation of proteins, influencing cardiac development and function. Its silencing can lead to inhibited myocardial cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cardiac physiology (wu2021potential). PPP2R3A is also implicated in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis by targeting cell cycle regulators and apoptosis inhibitors, which are critical functions in healthy cells (Shi2022GREM1PPP2R3A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, modulating PP2A's substrate specificity and localization, thereby influencing various cellular pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP2R3A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In colon cancer, PPP2R3A is frequently subject to hypermethylation and deletions, leading to a significant decrease in its expression. This downregulation is associated with the suppression of its tumor suppressor functions, contributing to the progression of the disease. The study by Dmitriev et al. found that PPP2R3A expression decreased on average 4.6-fold in colon cancer samples, with a significant decrease in mRNA levels observed in more than 60% of tumor samples (Dmitriev2020Functional). This suggests that PPP2R3A may play a critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions and its dysregulation can lead to tumorigenesis.

The research highlights a negative correlation between mRNA levels and promoter hypermethylation of PPP2R3A, indicating that epigenetic modifications are a key mechanism in its downregulation in cancer (Dmitriev2020Functional). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PPP2R3A in colon cancer and suggest that targeting its expression or the epigenetic modifications affecting it could be a potential therapeutic strategy.

## Interactions
PPP2R3A, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in myocardial cells. A yeast two-hybrid screening identified 19 proteins that potentially interact with PPP2R3A, with COL1A2, GIPC1, and BCL6 showing the highest interaction frequency. COL1A2, a component of type I collagen, is involved in cardiac remodeling and fibrosis and was found to reduce PP2A activity, potentially affecting cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation (wu2021potential). GIPC1, an adaptor protein, is involved in intracellular signaling pathways and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that its interaction with PPP2R3A might influence cardiac cell behavior and function (wu2021potential).

In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, PPP2R3A interacts with GREM1, a protein that regulates fibroblast proliferation and activation. This interaction is significant in the TGF-β1-induced fibroblast proliferation and migration, processes central to fibrosis progression (Shi2021PPP2R3A). These interactions highlight the role of PPP2R3A in regulating complex signaling pathways in both cardiac and pulmonary tissues.
