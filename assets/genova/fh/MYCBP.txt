# MYCBP

## Overview
The MYCBP gene encodes the MYC binding protein, a nuclear protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly through its interaction with the MYC oncogene. As a key component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, MYC binding protein enhances the transcriptional activity of MYC, thereby influencing cell growth and proliferation. It is involved in modulating Gli-mediated transcriptional activation, which is essential for the expression of Hh target genes (Lin2014Regulation). The protein's interactions extend to various molecular networks, including those involving non-coding RNAs, highlighting its significance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer (Ma2021MiR26b5p; Xiong2010Tumorsuppressive).

## Function
MYCBP (MYC binding protein) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with the MYC oncogene. It is involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, where it enhances the transcriptional activity of MYC, influencing cell growth and proliferation. MYCBP is active in the nucleus and is known to facilitate Gli-mediated transcriptional activation, which is crucial for the expression of Hh target genes (Lin2014Regulation).

In the context of Hh signaling, MYCBP interacts with Gli proteins, which are transcription factors involved in the pathway. Upon activation of the Hh pathway, MYCBP dissociates from Sufu, a negative regulator, and enhances its interaction with full-length Gli2 and Gli3 proteins. This interaction is essential for the activation of Hh target genes, suggesting that MYCBP plays a significant role in modulating the expression of these genes (Lin2014Regulation).

MYCBP's role in Hh signaling is further supported by its ability to enhance ptch1 expression in zebrafish embryos, indicating its involvement in regulating gene expression in response to Hh signaling (Lin2014Regulation). Overall, MYCBP is a crucial component in the regulation of Hh signaling, affecting the expression of target genes and contributing to various developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the MYCBP gene have been implicated in various cancers. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MYCBP is upregulated, and its knockdown suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. miR-26b-5p negatively regulates MYCBP expression, acting as a tumor suppressor by impairing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in TNBC (Ma2021MiR26b5p). In gastric cancer, MYCBP is significantly overexpressed, promoting invasion and migration of cancer cells. It is suggested to be a downstream target of the β-catenin/LEF-1 pathway, which is crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion (Gong2018Overexpression).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MYCBP expression is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor gene EYA4. High EYA4 expression correlates with low MYCBP levels, suggesting that MYCBP may promote HCC progression (Zhu2019EYA4). In osteosarcoma, circ_0002669 stabilizes MYCBP expression by preventing its degradation, enhancing tumorigenesis through the circ_0002669/miR-889-3p/MYCBP axis (Zhang2024Circ0002669). In colorectal cancer, the lncRNA LUNAR1 accelerates progression by modulating the miR-495-3p/MYCBP axis, with MYCBP overexpression promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Qian2020lncRNA). These findings highlight MYCBP's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MYCBP (MYC binding protein) is known to interact with the MYC oncoprotein, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. MYCBP binds to the N-terminal region of MYC, facilitating its role in promoting tumorigenesis in various cancers, including gastric cancer (Gong2018Overexpression).

In addition to its interaction with MYC, MYCBP is involved in a complex regulatory network with other molecules. For instance, it interacts with SPAG5 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where SPAG5 enhances c-MYC transcriptional activity through MYCBP. This interaction is significant for cell proliferation and resistance to certain therapies (Li2019SPAG5).

MYCBP also participates in interactions with non-coding RNAs. It is targeted by miR-22, which suppresses MYCBP expression, thereby inhibiting c-MYC's oncogenic activities in cancer cells (Xiong2010Tumorsuppressive). Similarly, miR-26b-5p targets MYCBP in TNBC, acting as a tumor suppressor by reducing MYCBP levels and affecting cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Ma2021MiR26b5p). These interactions highlight MYCBP's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
