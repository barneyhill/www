# CSTF1

## Overview
CSTF1, or cleavage stimulation factor subunit 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the critical process of mRNA 3' end processing, specifically in the polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. The protein encoded by CSTF1 is a key component of the cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF) complex, which plays a vital role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. This protein is characterized by the presence of RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to bind RNA substrates and interact with other proteins within the CSTF complex. CSTF1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its activity and interactions in response to cellular signals. Additionally, CSTF1 can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular processes by altering its interactions with RNA and other protein partners. This structural and functional versatility highlights the importance of CSTF1 in the complex regulation of mRNA processing and gene expression (Shi2009Molecular; Nazeer2011p53).

## Structure
CSTF1, or cleavage stimulation factor subunit 1, is a protein involved in mRNA processing, specifically in the polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. The molecular structure of CSTF1 includes specific domains such as RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its function in recognizing and binding RNA substrates. These domains facilitate the interaction of CSTF1 with other components of the cleavage stimulation factor complex, playing a significant role in the regulation of mRNA processing.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications are essential for the dynamic regulation of CSTF1's function in response to cellular signals and conditions.

CSTF1 also exhibits structural diversity through the presence of splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's structure, potentially affecting its function in mRNA processing. The existence of multiple isoforms allows CSTF1 to participate in a range of cellular processes by altering its interaction with RNA and other protein partners. This structural versatility underscores the importance of CSTF1 in the complex regulation of gene expression.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CSTF1, or cleavage stimulation factor subunit 1, is a component of the CSTF complex involved in mRNA 3' end processing. It interacts with other proteins such as CSTF2 and CSTF3 to form the CSTF complex, which is essential for binding to pre-mRNA and facilitating cleavage and polyadenylation (Shi2009Molecular). CSTF1 also interacts with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which plays a role in transcription termination and mRNA export (Shi2009Molecular).

CSTF1 is known to interact with BARD1 and p53, forming a complex that inhibits mRNA 3' processing, particularly under DNA damage conditions. This interaction is crucial for linking mRNA processing to the DNA damage response (DDR) and tumor suppression (Nazeer2011p53). The interaction between CSTF1 and p53 is dependent on the C-terminal domain of p53, which is essential for its regulatory functions in the DDR (Nazeer2011p53).

The CSTF complex, including CSTF1, is also involved in forming a larger pre-mRNA 3' processing complex with other core components such as CPSF and CF I, which are crucial for the polyadenylation process (Shi2009Molecular).
