# CLCF1

## Overview
Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including immune response and inflammation. The protein product of CLCF1, also known as cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1, functions primarily in the extracellular space where it forms complexes with other proteins, such as cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) and soluble ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (sCNTFR), to activate key signaling pathways like JAK/STAT and SHP2/Ras/MAPK. These pathways are crucial for cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (Crisponi2022CRLF1; Jiang2022CLCF1). CLCF1 is particularly significant in supporting motor and sympathetic neuron survival, promoting astrocyte differentiation, and playing a role in kidney development and function (Pasquin2018Effect; Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike). Mutations in the CLCF1 gene are linked to cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS) and have implications in various cancers and bone metabolism disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike; Jiang2022CLCF1; Yokota2021Cardiotrophin).

## Function
Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines, playing a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. CLCF1 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it interacts with receptors to activate downstream signaling pathways, influencing cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation (Crisponi2022CRLF1; Jiang2022CLCF1).

CLCF1 forms complexes with cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) or soluble ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (sCNTFR), which are crucial for activating pathways such as JAK/STAT and SHP2/Ras/MAPK. These pathways are important for various cellular functions, including immune regulation and inflammation (Crisponi2022CRLF1; Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike). The CRLF1/CLCF1 complex is more potent in inducing STAT3 phosphorylation than the individual CLCF1 subunit, suggesting that the binding of CRLF1 with CLCF1 creates a more stable and optimal conformation for CLCF1, increasing its affinity for CNTFR (Crisponi2022CRLF1).

CLCF1 is involved in supporting motor and sympathetic neuron survival and promoting astrocyte differentiation. It is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in adults, where it may inhibit locomotor activity during the circadian rest period (Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike). Additionally, CLCF1 is implicated in kidney development and function, particularly in nephrogenesis and nephron structure formation (Crisponi2022CRLF1; Pasquin2018Effect).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLCF1 gene are associated with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS), specifically CISS2. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as profuse sweating after exposure to cold, feeding difficulties, and musculoskeletal abnormalities like spinal kyphoscoliosis and muscle contractures. The CLCF1 gene, along with its binding partner CRLF1, forms a complex crucial for signaling through the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR). Mutations in CRLF1 account for the majority of CISS cases, while CLCF1 mutations are responsible for a smaller subset (Crisponi2022CRLF1; Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike).

Alterations in CLCF1 expression levels have been linked to various cancers, including gliomas. High expression of CLCF1 is associated with poor overall survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lower-grade glioma (LGG). It is also correlated with older age, IDH wildtype status, and higher WHO grade in gliomas. CLCF1 is identified as an independent prognostic factor and a potential target for immunotherapy in these cancers (Jiang2022CLCF1).

In the context of osteoporosis, decreased expression of CLCF1 is associated with reduced bone mass in postmenopausal women, suggesting its role in bone metabolism regulation (Yokota2021Cardiotrophin).

## Interactions
Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is known to interact with several proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in various biological processes. CLCF1 forms a stable secreted complex with cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), which acts as a functional heteromeric ligand for the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) complex. This complex is crucial for activating signaling pathways involving gp130, LIFR, and STAT3, supporting motor neuron survival (Elson2000CLF; Sims2015Cardiotrophinlike).

CLCF1 also interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms 2, 3, and 4, forming complexes that are not disrupted by lipids. These interactions are enhanced in the presence of DMPC, suggesting that CLCF1 likely binds ApoE in circulation. The interaction with ApoE increases the biological activity of CLCF1, as evidenced by increased STAT3 phosphorylation (Pasquin2018Effect).

CLCF1 can bind to various plasma lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL), but not high-density lipoproteins (HDL). These interactions suggest that CLCF1 may function as a 'lipocytokine', with its biological activity modulated by lipoproteins (Pasquin2018Effect).
