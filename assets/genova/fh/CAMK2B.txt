# CAMK2B

## Overview
The CAMK2B gene encodes the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKIIβ), a serine/threonine kinase that is a vital component of the CaMKII family. This protein plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, particularly in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. CaMKIIβ is characterized by its ability to bind to filamentous actin (F-actin), which is crucial for its localization to dendritic spines and its role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. The protein's structure includes a kinase domain, a regulatory domain, and a hub domain, which allows it to form oligomeric complexes essential for its function. Alternative splicing of the CAMK2B gene results in various isoforms that differ in their functional properties, such as F-actin binding and nuclear localization. Mutations in CAMK2B have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its importance in proper brain function and development (Cook2018Analysis; Nicole2020CaMKIIβ; Mohanan2022Role).

## Structure
The CAMK2B gene encodes the CaMKIIβ protein, a subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II complex, which plays a crucial role in calcium signaling. The protein structure includes an N-terminal kinase domain, a Ca2+/CaM-binding autoinhibitory regulatory domain, a variable linker region, and a C-terminal hub domain that mediates the formation of 12meric holoenzymes (Cook2018Analysis; Bhattacharyya2019Structural). The kinase and hub domains are highly conserved, while the variable linker region is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in numerous splice variants (Sloutsky2020Heterogeneity).

CaMKIIβ has a longer linker of 200 residues, which contributes to the dynamic organization of the holoenzyme (Bhattacharyya2019Structural). The protein can form large oligomers, typically with 12 or 14 subunits, with the hub domain forming a donut-shaped ring (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). The kinase domains are connected to this hub by regulatory segments, allowing for a compact configuration in the autoinhibited state (Bhattacharyya2019Structural).

Splice variants such as β, β', βe, and β'e differ in their F-actin binding capabilities, with only β and β' containing a filamentous actin binding domain (FABD) (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). The βH and βeH variants lack part of the hub domain, impairing the formation of 12meric holoenzymes and affecting nuclear localization and F-actin interaction (Cook2018Analysis). These structural variations influence the protein's regulatory functions, including T286-autophosphorylation and synaptic plasticity (Cook2018Analysis).

## Function
The CAMK2B gene encodes the CaMKIIβ protein, a crucial component of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) family, which plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. In healthy human cells, CaMKIIβ is involved in regulating synaptic strength and morphology by modulating neurotransmitter release and receptor activity, particularly at glutamatergic synapses (Küry2017De; Mohanan2022Role). 

CaMKIIβ is highly expressed in the brain, where it interacts with the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines, facilitating actin remodeling necessary for synaptic plasticity and neuronal migration (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). It acts as a targeting module that localizes CaMKIIα to synaptic sites, enhancing functional plasticity (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). The protein's kinase activity, particularly its autophosphorylation at Thr287, is critical for maintaining its active conformation and enabling its translocation to post-synaptic densities, where it influences the function of ionotropic glutamate receptors such as AMPAR and NMDAR (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ; Küry2017De).

CaMKIIβ's interaction with F-actin is essential for spine enlargement and long-term potentiation (LTP) maintenance, contributing to learning and memory processes (Mohanan2022Role). Its role in neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity underscores its importance in cortical development and proper brain function (Küry2017De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAMK2B gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. These mutations can lead to conditions such as developmental delay, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. Specific mutations, like the de novo gain-of-function mutation c.328G > A p.Glu110Lys, have been linked to increased enzymatic activity and are associated with developmental delay and acute neuropsychiatric episodes (Dwyer2022Case). Other mutations, such as p.Pro139Leu and p.Glu237Lys, have also been reported, although neuropsychiatric symptoms were not discussed in those cases (Dwyer2022Case).

Clinical manifestations in patients with CAMK2B mutations can include intellectual disability, global developmental delay, seizures, delayed speech, behavioral abnormalities, hypotonia, episodic ataxia, progressive cerebellar atrophy, visual impairments, and gastrointestinal issues (Heiman2021A). The variability in symptoms suggests intrafamilial variability in the expression of the mutation, as seen in cases where a pathogenic CAMK2B variant was inherited from a healthy parent (Heiman2021A).

Research indicates that these mutations affect neuronal migration and protein stability, contributing to the molecular mechanisms underlying intellectual disability (Küry2017De). The dysfunction of CAMK2B is linked to cerebellar symptoms, highlighting its role in neuronal plasticity and learning (Akita2018De).

## Interactions
CaMKIIβ (CAMK2B) is known for its interactions with the actin cytoskeleton, specifically binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) through its filamentous actin binding domain (FABD). This interaction is crucial for the localization of CaMKIIβ to dendritic spines, where it can bundle actin filaments, a function not shared by CaMKIIα (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). CaMKIIβ also forms heterooligomers with CaMKIIα, targeting these complexes to F-actin-rich regions such as dendritic spines and the cell cortex (Shen1998CaMKIIβ). The interaction with F-actin is direct and reversible, allowing CaMKIIβ to anchor CaMKIIα to the actin cytoskeleton (Shen1998CaMKIIβ).

CaMKIIβ interacts with other proteins, including Arc/Arg3.1 and the centrosomal targeting protein PCM1, which are not targets for CaMKIIα (Nicole2020CaMKIIβ). It also plays a role in synaptic plasticity by interacting with postsynaptic density proteins and influencing AMPA receptor conductivity (Shen1998CaMKIIβ). The binding of CaMKIIβ to F-actin is modulated by calcium/calmodulin (CaM) binding, which can lead to its dissociation from actin filaments upon neuronal activation and calcium influx (Lin2008CaMKIIβ).
