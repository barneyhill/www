# FAM237B

## Overview
FAM237B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 237 member B, which is involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) activity. This protein is categorized as a signaling molecule due to its role in activating GPR83, a receptor implicated in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism and anxiety-related behaviors. FAM237B functions as a weak agonist for GPR83, capable of activating the receptor at nanomolar concentrations, and is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, indicating its potential significance in essential biological processes (Li2023Nanomolar; Martinez2022Profiling). The protein's structural features, such as a long α-helix and conserved cysteine residues, suggest the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which may be crucial for its function (Li2023Nanomolar). While FAM237B's precise role in human physiology is not fully understood, its involvement in energy metabolism and potential implications in metabolic disorders, such as obesity, are areas of active research (Li2023Nanomolar; Šimon2024Whole).

## Function
FAM237B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in activating the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) at nanomolar concentrations. GPR83 is primarily expressed in the brain and is associated with energy metabolism and anxiety-related behaviors (Li2023Nanomolar). FAM237B, like its paralog FAM237A, is synthesized as a precursor protein with a mature peptide and a C-terminal propeptide. The mature peptides of FAM237A and FAM237B share significant sequence similarity and structural features, including a long α-helix and conserved cysteine residues, which suggest the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond (Li2023Nanomolar).

In functional assays, FAM237B has been shown to activate GPR83, indicating its potential role in signaling pathways involving this receptor (Li2023Nanomolar). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism, as studies in animal models suggest that it may influence food intake and fat accumulation (Li2023Nanomolar). Additionally, FAM237B is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, highlighting its potential significance in physiological processes (Martinez2022Profiling). However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
FAM237B has been implicated in several conditions related to metabolism and obesity. Studies have identified FAM237B as a candidate gene for obesity, with genetic variants such as missense SNPs and regulatory variants being associated with differences in body fat percentage in mouse models selected for fatness and leanness (Šimon2024Whole). These findings suggest that alterations in FAM237B expression or function may contribute to obesity phenotypes, although the specific clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated (Šimon2024Whole).

FAM237B is also involved in energy metabolism through its interaction with the GPR83 receptor. It acts as an agonist for GPR83, which is linked to energy metabolism and anxiety-related behaviors. The activation of GPR83 by FAM237B at nanomolar concentrations suggests a role in regulating feeding behavior and energy balance, potentially impacting conditions like obesity (Li2023Nanomolar). The gene's evolutionary conservation and its structural similarities with FAM237A, another GPR83 agonist, further support its involvement in metabolic regulation (Li2023Nanomolar). These interactions highlight the potential significance of FAM237B in metabolic disorders, although more research is needed to fully understand its clinical impact.

## Interactions
FAM237B, also known as NPGM, is a protein that interacts with the GPR83 receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. FAM237B is considered a weak agonist for GPR83, capable of activating the receptor at nanomolar concentrations (1-10 nM) (Li2023Nanomolar). The interaction between FAM237B and GPR83 has been studied using a NanoBiT-based ligand-receptor binding assay, which demonstrated a physical interaction through bioluminescence measurements (Li2023Nanomolar). This interaction is significant as it suggests that FAM237B might be an endogenous agonist for GPR83, although it exhibits lower activity compared to its paralog, FAM237A (Li2023Nanomolar).

FAM237B also participates in signaling pathways by recruiting β-arrestin 2 upon binding to GPR83, indicating activation of the Gαq signaling pathway (ÖzArslan2024Exploring; Li2023Nanomolar). This recruitment was confirmed through a NanoBiT-based β-arrestin recruitment assay, supporting the role of FAM237B in modulating GPR83-mediated signaling pathways (Li2023Nanomolar). These interactions highlight the potential role of FAM237B in physiological processes related to GPR83, such as stress-associated physiology, learning, memory, and feeding behavior (ÖzArslan2024Exploring).
