# TRAF4

## Overview
The TRAF4 gene encodes the TNF receptor associated factor 4 protein, which is a member of the TRAF protein family known for their roles in signal transduction and cellular homeostasis. TRAF4 is characterized as an adaptor protein, featuring a RING finger domain, zinc finger motifs, and a TRAF domain, which facilitate its involvement in protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways (Yoon2013Structure; Park2018Structure). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of epithelial cell polarity, immune response modulation, and involvement in signaling pathways such as NF-κB and JNK (Ruan2022The; Rousseau2011TRAF4). TRAF4's interactions with other proteins and its role in maintaining cellular integrity underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can influence tumor progression and treatment outcomes (Iyengar2022TRAF4; Gu2022TRAF4).

## Structure
The TRAF4 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a RING finger domain, multiple zinc finger motifs, and a TRAF domain, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions (Yoon2013Structure). The TRAF domain is divided into two regions: the TRAF-N domain and the TRAF-C domain. The TRAF-C domain is responsible for binding various receptors, while the TRAF-N domain binds intracellular signaling molecules (Park2018Structure).

The TRAF domain of TRAF4 forms a trimeric structure, resembling a mushroom shape, with the TRAF-C domain forming the cap and the TRAF-N domain forming the stalk (Yoon2013Structure; Niu2013Structural). This trimeric assembly is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Niu2013Structural). The TRAF-C domain features an eight-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich and a three-turn helix (Rousseau2013TRAF4).

A unique feature of TRAF4 is an additional flexible loop containing a phosphorylation site at S426, which is crucial for its interaction with the NOD2 receptor protein (Niu2013Structural). This phosphorylation site is exposed and can be phosphorylated by kinases like IKKα (Niu2013Structural). The electrostatic surface of TRAF4 is more negatively charged in the receptor-binding region compared to other TRAF proteins, affecting its interaction with receptors (Park2018Structure).

## Function
TRAF4 (TNF receptor associated factor 4) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial cell polarity and integrity by modulating tight junctions (TJs), which are crucial for cell-cell contact and polarity. TRAF4 shuttles between TJs and the cytoplasm, acting as a signal transducer in intercellular junctions and is linked to the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Rousseau2013TRAF4; Rousseau2011TRAF4).

TRAF4 is also involved in various signaling pathways, including NF-kB and JNK, and requires interaction with other proteins to activate these pathways effectively. It enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation in epithelial cells and contributes to TGF-β-induced EMT (Ruan2022The). In the immune system, TRAF4 acts as a negative regulator of NOD2 signaling, inhibiting NOD2-induced NF-kB activation, which is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis (Niu2013Structural).

Additionally, TRAF4 interacts with phosphoinositides in cellular membranes, which is essential for its localization and function in modulating tight junctions and influencing cell migration (Rousseau2013TRAF4). These activities highlight TRAF4's critical role in cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
TRAF4 (TNF receptor associated factor 4) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression and interactions influencing disease progression and treatment outcomes. In bladder cancer, TRAF4 expression is negatively correlated with cancer progression, acting as a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is epigenetically repressed in aggressive bladder cancer cells, and its knockdown leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting its importance in maintaining epithelial integrity (Iyengar2022TRAF4).

In breast cancer, TRAF4 overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes, particularly in HER2-positive cases, where it contributes to trastuzumab resistance by stabilizing HER2 and enhancing signaling pathways (Gu2022TRAF4). TRAF4 also interacts with p53, leading to its destabilization and reduced apoptosis, which is associated with poor survival outcomes in breast cancer patients (Yi2013SRC3).

In prostate cancer, TRAF4 enhances TrkA receptor activity, promoting metastasis through ubiquitination processes that activate signaling pathways involved in cell migration and invasion (Singh2018TRAF4mediated). In lung cancer, TRAF4 is overexpressed and regulates glycolysis by modulating Akt activation, contributing to tumorigenesis (Li2013TRAF4). These findings highlight TRAF4's potential as a therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
TRAF4 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in multiple cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with β-catenin, enhancing β-catenin-related transcription and protecting it from p53-mediated degradation, although a direct interaction was not observed in mammalian cells (Rozan2006Identification). TRAF4 also interacts with proteins such as Eg5, PRMT5, and MYH-9, which are involved in mitosis, transcriptional regulation, and cytoskeletal dynamics, respectively (Rozan2006Identification).

TRAF4 is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway and interacts with TLR adaptor proteins, suggesting its role as an adaptor protein in receptor-mediated signaling (Rozan2006Identification). It also interacts with the neurotrophic factor receptor p75(NTR) to prevent apoptosis and recruits the E3-ligase SMURF2 to degrade DAZAP2, which is crucial for IL-25 signaling and airway inflammation (Ruan2022The).

In cancer, TRAF4 interacts with proteins like PRMT5 and AKT, promoting cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer by destabilizing tight junctions and enhancing IGF1-induced signaling pathways (Ruan2022The). It also interacts with DR6 and KIF11 in ovarian cancer, enhancing cell migration via the MAPK/ER and PI3K/AKT pathways (Ruan2022The).
