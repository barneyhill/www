# TMEM108

## Overview
TMEM108 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 108, also known as Retrolinkin, which is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly within the central nervous system. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly expressed in the brain, with significant roles in neural development, myelination, and metabolic regulation (Yu2019Transmembrane; Wu2022Transmembrane). TMEM108 is involved in the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, influencing neurogenesis and the proliferation of neuronal precursor cells, as well as playing a role in glucose metabolism and insulin regulation (Yu2019Transmembrane; Yu2021The). The gene's expression patterns and interactions suggest its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Wu2022Transmembrane; Yu2021The).

## Function
TMEM108, also known as Retrolinkin, is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes within the central nervous system. It is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the hippocampus and corpus callosum, where it plays a significant role in neural development and function (Yu2019Transmembrane; Wu2022Transmembrane). TMEM108 is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for adult neurogenesis and the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Yu2019Transmembrane). 

In oligodendrocyte lineage cells, TMEM108 is involved in regulating myelination and the proliferation of these cells, potentially through interactions with the Wnt signaling pathway (Wu2022Transmembrane). The protein's expression is higher in newly formed oligodendrocytes and decreases with age, suggesting a role in early neural development and myelination processes (Wu2022Transmembrane). 

TMEM108 also influences glucose metabolism and insulin regulation, with its expression in tissues such as the brain, liver, and pancreas, indicating a role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Yu2021The). These functions highlight TMEM108's involvement in both neural and metabolic processes, contributing to its significance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TMEM108 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. TMEM108 is identified as a candidate risk gene for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). Studies have shown that TMEM108 mutations can lead to SCZ-like behaviors and metabolic disturbances, including glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, suggesting a shared biological mechanism between SCZ and glucose dysregulation (Yu2021The). TMEM108 is also associated with impaired spatial memory and altered sensorimotor gating, which are relevant to SCZ (Wu2022Transmembrane).

In the context of BD, TMEM108 mutations have been linked to mania-like behaviors and enhanced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation and myelination, potentially affecting BD pathogenesis (Wu2022Transmembrane). The gene's involvement in the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway suggests it may influence adult neurogenesis, which is crucial for mood regulation and cognitive functions (Yu2019Transmembrane).

TMEM108 mutations may also contribute to abnormal myelination processes in the central nervous system, which are associated with psychiatric disorders like SCZ and BD (Wu2022Transmembrane). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating these disorders.

## Interactions
TMEM108, also known as Retrolinkin, is involved in several interactions within cellular processes. It promotes endosomal vesicle retrograde transport in sensory neuronal axons by interacting with the dynactin/dynein cargo adaptor BPAG1n4. In cultured hippocampal neurons, TMEM108 cooperates with endophilin A1 through its proline-rich domain, participating in BDNF-induced dendrite outgrowth by mediating the BDNF-TrkB-ERK signaling pathway. TMEM108 also recruits CYFIP1/2 units of the WAVE1 complex to facilitate the endocytosis of BDNF-TrkB in hippocampal neurons (Yu2021The).

In the context of immune signaling, TMEM108 is associated with interferon (IFN) signaling traits. Although it does not have direct protein-protein interactions with IFN-associated genes, it is implicated in the regulation of IFN signaling. Genetic variants at the TMEM108 locus are associated with traits of the IFN response module, particularly in CD8 T cell and regulatory T cell subsets, suggesting an indirect modulatory role (Sayaman2021Germline).

TMEM108's high isoelectric point has been noted to cause false positives in proteomic screens, indicating potential challenges in identifying its specific interactions through certain experimental methods (Ranaivoson2019A).
