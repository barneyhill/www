# PTTG2

## Overview
PTTG2, or pituitary tumor-transforming gene 2, is a gene that encodes the protein pituitary tumor-transforming 2, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Unlike its homolog PTTG1, PTTG2 does not bind to separase and lacks transactivation activity, indicating distinct functional roles between these proteins (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2). PTTG2 is minimally expressed in normal cells but is overexpressed in several cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Gui2021Overexpressinga; Wu2020Gene). The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity by supporting cell adhesion and preventing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and its expression is influenced by various genetic and molecular pathways (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2; Grzechowiak2020The).

## Structure


## Function
PTTG2, a homolog of the human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in maintaining cell adhesion and regulating apoptosis. Unlike PTTG1, PTTG2 does not bind to separase and lacks transactivation activity, suggesting it does not play a role in sister chromatid separation (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2). PTTG2 is minimally expressed in normal cells and is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity by supporting cell adhesion and preventing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2).

Silencing of PTTG2 in HCT116 cells leads to impaired cell adhesion, increased apoptosis, and morphological changes indicative of EMT, characterized by decreased E-cadherin and increased vimentin levels (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2). These changes are associated with increased levels of E-cadherin repressors Snail and Zeb1, indicating a role in EMT repression and potential involvement in cell invasion processes (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2). PTTG2's role in apoptosis is p53- and p21-dependent, highlighting its involvement in pathways regulating cell death and survival (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2).

## Clinical Significance
PTTG2 is implicated in several cancers due to its overexpression and mutations. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), PTTG2 is significantly overexpressed, with its mRNA and protein levels correlating with advanced cancer stages and higher tumor grades. This overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival, making PTTG2 an independent prognostic factor for shorter survival in KIRC patients (Gui2021Overexpressing; Gui2021Overexpressinga). In breast cancer, PTTG2 is notably overexpressed, particularly in basal subtypes, and is linked to shorter distant metastasis-free survival in progesterone receptor-positive patients. Chemotherapy may improve prognosis in patients with high PTTG2 expression (Wu2020Gene).

In osteosarcoma, elevated PTTG2 expression is associated with poor overall survival and enhanced cell proliferation, establishing it as a prognostic factor for shorter survival (Lu2024Exploring). In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), PTTG2 is upregulated and correlates with poor disease-free survival. Its expression is influenced by TP53 mutations and is associated with changes in pathways like E2F targets and G2M checkpoints (Grzechowiak2020The). Silencing PTTG2 in HCT116 cells induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis, suggesting its role in maintaining cell adhesion and proliferation (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2).

## Interactions
PTTG2, or pituitary tumor-transforming 2, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Unlike its homolog PTTG1, PTTG2 does not bind to separase due to the absence of conserved binding motifs, indicating distinct functional roles between these proteins (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2). PTTG2 also lacks transactivation capacity, as demonstrated by the absence of significant reporter gene activity in luciferase assays (MéndezVidal2013PTTG2).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), PTTG2 expression is associated with TP53 mutation status. It shows positive correlations with mutant p53-interacting partners such as NF-YB, Pin1, PML, and p73, and negative correlations with NF-YA and p63, although these correlations are not strong (Grzechowiak2020The). PTTG2 is also positively correlated with genes like STMN1, DUT, CDC25C, and NFKB2, and negatively correlated with ITGA6, MYC, EGFR, and CYP51A1, suggesting potential interactions or pathways involving PTTG2 in HNSCC (Grzechowiak2020The).

In breast cancer, PTTG2 may interact with the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and Aurora-related signaling pathways, influencing cancer progression through cell cycle regulation and protein degradation (Wu2020Gene). These interactions highlight PTTG2's role in regulating cancer cell dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target.
