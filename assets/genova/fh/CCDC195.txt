# CCDC195

## Overview
The CCDC195 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 195 protein, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a potential role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC195 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural characteristics imply involvement in various cellular pathways. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest in studies exploring their potential implications in human health and disease, although detailed functional and interaction data are still emerging (Qiu2020aarFDC).
