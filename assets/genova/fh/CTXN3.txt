# CTXN3

## Overview
The CTXN3 gene encodes the protein cortexin 3, which is characterized as an integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain. This protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney and brain, where it is believed to play a crucial role in signaling pathways and tissue-specific physiological processes. Cortexin 3 shares significant homology with the brain-specific protein cortexin, suggesting its involvement in neuronal development and synaptic function. The gene produces alternative splice variants, indicating a regulated expression pattern that may contribute to its functional diversity in different tissues. The conservation of CTXN3 across vertebrates underscores its potential importance in maintaining essential cellular functions related to brain and kidney development (Wang2007In).

## Structure
The CTXN3 gene encodes a protein that is 81 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 8933.4 Da. The primary structure of the CTXN3 protein includes a single membrane-spanning domain, suggesting it may function as an integral membrane protein involved in signaling within the kidney and brain (Wang2007In). The transmembrane domain is highly conserved across several species, indicating its potential functional significance (Wang2007In).

Bioinformatics analysis has identified a putative single membrane-spanning domain in the middle of the amino acid sequence, which supports the hypothesis of CTXN3 being an integral membrane protein (Wang2007In). The protein shares 43% identity with the brain-specific protein cortexin, although the function of cortexin remains unknown (Wang2007In).

The study identified two alternative transcript variants of CTXN3, which may result from alternative splicing and could play a role in tissue-specific regulation (Wang2007In). These variants differ in their first exon usage, leading to different mRNA variants with distinct tissue expression patterns (Wang2007In). However, detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the CTXN3 protein is not provided in the available context (Wang2007In).

## Function
The CTXN3 gene, also known as cortexin 3, encodes a protein that is specifically expressed in the kidney and brain, with a significant role in tissue-specific physiological processes. The CTXN3 protein is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain, suggesting its involvement in signaling pathways within these tissues (Wang2007In). The gene produces two alternative splice variants, which are differentially expressed in the kidney and brain, indicating a regulated role in these organs (Wang2007In).

In the brain, CTXN3 is thought to contribute to neuronal development and function, potentially influencing synaptic activity and plasticity. This is supported by its homology with cortexin, a brain-specific protein, and its expression in both adult and fetal brain tissues (Wang2007In). The conservation of CTXN3 across vertebrates suggests its importance in maintaining essential cellular functions related to brain and kidney development (Wang2007In).

The specific molecular activities of CTXN3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, but its tissue-specific expression and conservation across species imply a critical role in cellular signaling and development in the kidney and brain (Wang2007In).

## Clinical Significance
The CTXN3 gene has been implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia, particularly in European-Caucasian males. A significant association was found between the rs6595788 polymorphism in CTXN3 and an increased risk of schizophrenia, with the AG genotype showing a 1.5-fold increase in risk (Šerý2015Association). The G allele of this polymorphism was more frequent in schizophrenic patients, suggesting a higher risk associated with this allele (Šerý2015Association). CTXN3 interacts with the SLC12A2 gene, which is also linked to schizophrenia and neurocognitive traits, potentially influencing brain development processes (Šerý2015Association).

In a Thai population, significant associations were found between SNPs in the CTXN3-SLC12A2 region and schizophrenia, indicating the region's importance in the disease's pathogenesis (Panichareon2012Association). The CTXN3 gene is also linked to amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, relevant to Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a broader role in brain development and function (Šerý2015Association). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of CTXN3 in understanding the genetic basis of schizophrenia and possibly other mental disorders.

## Interactions
CTXN3, or cortexin 3, is a protein encoded by the CTXN3 gene, which has been implicated in various interactions within the human body. Notably, CTXN3 interacts with the SLC12A2 gene, which encodes a transporter involved in ion transport and is functionally linked to ionotropic GABA receptors. This interaction is particularly significant in the developing brain, where GABA acts as an excitatory signaling molecule. The transition from NKCC1 (SLC12A2) to KCC2 (SLC12A5) is crucial for the switch from excitatory to inhibitory GABA signaling, and disruptions in this process may contribute to mental diseases like schizophrenia (Šerý2015Association).

In the context of Behcet’s disease, CTXN3 has been shown to interact with several other proteins, including LRRC3B, ZIC1, and UNC13C, as part of a broader analysis of differentially expressed genes and their roles in immune cell infiltration. These interactions are based on computational predictions and analyses within a protein-protein interaction network (Zhan2021Novel).

Despite these findings, specific details on the physical interactions of CTXN3 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in these processes.
