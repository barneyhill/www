# RNF5

## Overview
RNF5 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 5, a member of the RING finger family of proteins, which are characterized by their RING finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. The RNF5 protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a pivotal role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, ensuring protein quality control by targeting misfolded proteins for degradation. Beyond its role in protein homeostasis, RNF5 is involved in various cellular processes, including immune signaling and metabolic regulation, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions such as muscle disorders, cardiac dysfunction, and cancer (Li2023The; Yang2022E3; Wang2020Acetylation).

## Structure
RNF5 (ring finger protein 5) is a protein encoded by the RNF5 gene in humans. It contains a RING finger domain, which is crucial for its activity as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This domain is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and is essential for the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification that tags proteins for degradation (Khateb2021The; Yang2022E3). The RING domain specifically includes a critical residue, C42, which is necessary for RNF5's function in ubiquitinating and degrading target proteins (Yang2022E3).

RNF5 is an ER-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, indicating its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins (Li2023The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various substrates, such as the SCAP protein involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and the STING protein in cardiac hypertrophy regulation (Yang2022E3; Kuan2020Ring).

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of RNF5 are not provided, its role in ubiquitination and interaction with other proteins suggests a complex structure capable of facilitating these processes. Splice variant isoforms may exist, potentially altering its structure and function, although specific variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
RNF5 (ring finger protein 5) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in protein quality control within healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This pathway is responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of misfolded proteins, helping to maintain protein homeostasis. RNF5, also known as RMA1, works in conjunction with other proteins such as the E2 enzyme Ubc6 and Derlin-1 to target proteins like the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) for degradation (Nakamura2011The; Li2019Gut).

In addition to its role in ERAD, RNF5 regulates the stability of various proteins, including phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), through ubiquitination. This regulation is crucial for controlling cell growth and metabolic processes, as RNF5-mediated degradation of PHGDH can mitigate its oncogenic effects (Wang2020Acetylation). RNF5 is also involved in immune signaling, influencing the composition of gut microbiota and modulating immune responses, which can impact tumor growth and response to therapies (Li2019Gut).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RNF5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In muscle disorders, particularly sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), RNF5 is overexpressed and mislocalized, contributing to muscle degeneration and the formation of vacuoles with inclusions. This overexpression is associated with increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, suggesting a role in ER stress-associated muscular disorders (Delaunay2008The).

In the context of cardiac health, RNF5 expression is downregulated in acute myocardial infarction (MI), and its deficiency exacerbates heart dysfunction and injury. RNF5 knockout mice show increased inflammatory response and apoptosis post-MI, indicating that RNF5 plays a protective role against heart injury and inflammation (Wan2024RING).

RNF5 is also involved in cancer, with its expression levels affecting tumor progression and response to treatment. In neuroblastoma and melanoma, high RNF5 expression correlates with better clinical outcomes, while in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RNF5 influences cell growth and sensitivity to histone deacetylase inhibitors. High RNF5 expression in AML is associated with poor prognosis, and its inhibition sensitizes cells to treatment (Khateb2021The; Principi2022Targeting).

## Interactions
RNF5, a ring finger protein, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the SREBP chaperone SCAP on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, facilitating the polyubiquitination of SCAP, which is crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis (Kuan2020Ring). RNF5 also interacts with the histone-binding protein RBBP4, an epigenetic regulator involved in chromatin assembly and remodeling. This interaction is significant in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where RNF5 positively regulates RBBP4's transcriptional function (Khateb2021The).

In the context of viral infections, RNF5 interacts with Ephrin receptors A3 (EphA3) and A4 (EphA4), inducing their ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial in suppressing Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) tumor growth (Li2023Suppression). RNF5 also plays a role in the degradation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) by interacting with the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) V protein, which is essential for inhibiting the host's type I interferon production (Sun2019Newcastle). These interactions highlight RNF5's involvement in regulating cellular stress responses, immune regulation, and tumor progression.
