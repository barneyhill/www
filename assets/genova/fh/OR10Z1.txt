# OR10Z1

## Overview
OR10Z1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily Z member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a critical role in the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Wang2021Targeted). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10Z1 is expressed in various tissues, suggesting potential involvement in non-olfactory physiological processes, although these roles are not yet fully understood (Fessahaye2021Breast). The gene has also been implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and certain diseases, such as breast cancer, where it is associated with epigenetic modifications that may influence disease progression (Wang2021Targeted; Fessahaye2021Breast).

## Function
OR10Z1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory transduction, the process by which odorant signals are converted into neuronal responses. OR10Z1 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Wang2021Targeted).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10Z1 has been implicated in other biological processes. Studies have suggested that olfactory receptors, including OR10Z1, may be involved in synapse organization and function, which are critical for proper nervous system development and function (Wang2021Targeted). The gene has also been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating its potential involvement in broader neurological processes (Wang2021Targeted).

OR10Z1, like other olfactory receptors, is expressed in various tissues beyond the olfactory system, suggesting potential roles in non-olfactory physiological processes. However, the specific functions of OR10Z1 in healthy human cells outside the olfactory system remain to be fully elucidated (Fessahaye2021Breast).

## Clinical Significance
The OR10Z1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and epigenetic modifications. In breast cancer, OR10Z1 is one of the olfactory receptor genes found to be completely hypomethylated at the promoter site, which is associated with transcriptional activation and may contribute to carcinogenesis. This hypomethylation is particularly noted in breast cancer samples, suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis (Fessahaye2021Breast).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, OR10Z1 has been identified as a novel candidate gene with potential involvement in neurodevelopmental processes. It shows significant co-expression and interaction with known neurodevelopmental disorder candidate genes, indicating its possible role in broader neurodevelopmental networks (Wang2021Targeted).

Although OR10Z1 is mentioned in studies related to schizophrenia, its specific variants are described as having uncertain significance regarding their effect on protein function. The gene is noted for its rare variants, but no direct association with schizophrenia or specific conditions related to OR10Z1 mutations is established (Saeed2023Smell). Overall, while OR10Z1 is linked to several conditions, its precise clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
