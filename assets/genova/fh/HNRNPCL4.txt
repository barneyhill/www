# HNRNPCL4

## Overview
HNRNPCL4 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C like 4, which is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing and regulation of pre-mRNA within the nucleus, playing essential roles in RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, transport, and translation regulation. HNRNPCL4, through its RNA-binding capabilities, contributes to the modulation of gene expression and cellular responses, thereby influencing RNA processing and function. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organismal development. Additionally, HNRNPCL4 is implicated in various cellular interactions and has been associated with several medical conditions, highlighting its potential clinical relevance (Singhto2024Extracellular; Jiang2023Functional; Ogami2018RNA).

## Structure


## Function
HNRNPCL4 is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) family, which are RNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles in the processing of pre-mRNA within the nucleus. These proteins are integral to various aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing, stability, transport, and translation regulation. HNRNPCL4, like other hnRNPs, is involved in modulating gene expression and cellular responses by influencing RNA processing and function. Through its interaction with RNA, HNRNPCL4 contributes to the regulation of mRNA splicing, a critical step in the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA, which is essential for proper gene expression. The protein's activity in the nucleus underscores its importance in maintaining the fidelity of RNA processing, thereby ensuring accurate gene expression and cellular function. By participating in these molecular processes, HNRNPCL4 plays a role in the broader context of cellular homeostasis and organismal development, impacting how cells respond to various physiological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
HNRNPCL4 has been implicated in several medical conditions due to its role in RNA processing and regulation. In the context of childhood cancers, particularly aggressive forms of medulloblastoma, HNRNPCL4 has been identified as a potential biomarker. It is involved in oncogenic signaling pathways such as ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and EGF/EFGR, which are altered in aggressive medulloblastoma, suggesting its role in the pathology of this disease (Singhto2024Extracellular).

In genetic studies, HNRNPCL4 has been associated with archaic introgression in East Asian populations. A study identified a large putative introgression region on chromosome 1, which includes HNRNPCL4, suggesting that this gene may have been influenced by ancient hominin genomes, potentially affecting its expression or function in modern humans (Yang2023The).

Additionally, HNRNPCL4 is mentioned in the context of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). It is part of a heterozygous deletion in the 1p36.22-p36.21 chromosome region, although the specific clinical significance of HNRNPCL4 in RPL is not detailed (YILDIZ2022Copy). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its potential clinical significance, although further research is needed to fully understand its role.

## Interactions
HNRNPCL4 is involved in various interactions that suggest its role in RNA metabolism and regulation. In humans, it is part of nuclear exosome-adaptor complexes, which are crucial for RNA degradation. These complexes include proteins such as SKIV2L2/MTREX, ZCCHC7, PAPD5, PAPD7, SCAF4, SCAF8, RALY, RALYL, and hnRNPC, indicating that HNRNPCL4 may interact with these proteins as part of its function in RNA processing (Ogami2018RNA).

HNRNPCL4 is also enriched in processing bodies (P-bodies) in various cell types, including 293T cells and human embryonic stem cells. This enrichment suggests its involvement in RNA binding and regulation within these structures, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in P-bodies are not detailed (Jiang2023Functional).

Additionally, HNRNPCL4 is mentioned in the context of Human Herpesvirus 8 ORF57 protein interactions, indicating a potential interaction under stress conditions. However, specific details about its interactions with ORF57 or other proteins in this context are not provided (Webber2023Human). Overall, while HNRNPCL4 is implicated in several protein complexes and cellular structures, detailed interaction partners remain to be fully elucidated.
