# AGPAT2

## Overview
AGPAT2, or 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2, is a gene that encodes an enzyme crucial for lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) by catalyzing the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to form phosphatidic acid (PA) (Mak2021AGPAT2; Gale2006A). AGPAT2 is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in lipid droplet formation and adipocyte differentiation (Mak2021AGPAT2). Mutations in the AGPAT2 gene are linked to congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 (CGL1), a disorder characterized by a severe loss of adipose tissue and associated metabolic complications (Haghighi2012Identification; Broekema2018A).

## Function
AGPAT2 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (TAGs). It catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to form phosphatidic acid (PA), a key intermediate in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway (Mak2021AGPAT2; Gale2006A). This enzyme is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly expressed in adipose tissue, liver, and pancreas (Mak2021AGPAT2).

AGPAT2 is involved in the formation and regulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in cells, influencing their size and formation by controlling PA levels. In healthy cells, AGPAT2 helps maintain normal LD morphology, which is essential for lipid storage and energy homeostasis (Mak2021AGPAT2). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the synthesis of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), a precursor for various phospholipids, by interacting with CDP-diacylglycerol synthases (CDS1 and CDS2) (Mak2021AGPAT2).

AGPAT2 also plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation, as its expression is induced during this process. It is essential for the accumulation of TAG in mature adipocytes and the regulation of key transcriptional activators of the adipogenic program (Gale2006A). Deficiencies in AGPAT2 can lead to metabolic disorders such as congenital generalized lipodystrophy, characterized by a severe loss of adipose tissue and associated metabolic complications (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry; Mak2021AGPAT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGPAT2 gene are primarily associated with congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 (CGL1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a near-total loss of adipose tissue from birth. This condition leads to a muscular appearance, severe insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and other metabolic complications such as hepatic steatosis and pancreatitis (Haghighi2012Identification; Broekema2018A). Patients with CGL1 often exhibit symptoms like muscular hypertrophy, acanthosis nigricans, hyperandrogenism, and hepatosplenomegaly (Haghighi2012Identification). 

AGPAT2 mutations can include nonsense, missense, splice site, frameshift, and small deletions, all of which impair the enzymatic activity of the AGPAT2 protein, disrupting triglyceride and phospholipid biosynthesis (Broekema2018A). These mutations lead to the depletion of triglycerides in adipocytes, causing lipodystrophy (Magré2003Prevalence). 

In addition to CGL1, AGPAT2 mutations have been implicated in Brunzell syndrome, which involves congenital generalized lipodystrophy and cystic angiomatosis of the long bones (Fu2004Mutations). The clinical presentation of AGPAT2-related disorders can vary, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental factors (Fu2004Mutations).

## Interactions
AGPAT2 interacts with CDP-diacylglycerol synthases, specifically CDS1 and CDS2, forming stable complexes that enhance the stability and activity of these proteins. This interaction is crucial for the metabolic flux of phosphatidic acid (PA) through the CDP-DAG pathway, which is important for lipid metabolism and adipogenesis (Mak2021AGPAT2). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that AGPAT2 is the major isoform that co-precipitates with CDS1 and CDS2, indicating a specific functional link. The interaction between AGPAT2 and CDS2 is stronger with the longer isoform of AGPAT2, and enhanced colocalization is observed under low glucose conditions (Mak2021AGPAT2).

AGPAT2 also interacts with seipin, a protein that acts as a scaffold to coordinate the association of AGPAT2 with GPAT3, another enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. This interaction is important for adipocyte differentiation, as seipin facilitates the formation of a multi-protein complex with AGPAT2 and GPAT3, promoting adipogenesis (Sim2020Oligomers). The interaction between seipin and AGPAT2 does not require an intact second transmembrane domain of seipin, indicating independent interactions with GPAT3 and AGPAT2 (Sim2020Oligomers).
