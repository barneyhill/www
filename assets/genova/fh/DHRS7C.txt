# DHRS7C

## Overview
The DHRS7C gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 7C, also known as SRP-35, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein plays a crucial role in the metabolism of retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde, a precursor to all-trans retinoic acid, which is vital for regulating gene expression related to tissue development and cell differentiation. In addition to its metabolic functions, SRP-35 is significant in skeletal muscle, where it enhances muscle performance and glucose metabolism through the activation of key signaling pathways, including PI3K and mTORC2. The protein's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Ruiz2018Overexpression).

## Function
The DHRS7C gene encodes a protein known as SRP-35, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This protein is involved in the metabolism of retinol (Vitamin A) to all-trans-retinaldehyde, which is subsequently converted to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA). atRA serves as a ligand for nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR), which regulate gene expression involved in tissue development and cell differentiation (Ruiz2018Overexpression). In skeletal muscle, SRP-35 enhances muscle performance and glucose metabolism by increasing the phosphorylation of Akt S473, promoting GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, and facilitating glucose uptake. This process involves signaling pathways such as PI3K and mTORC2 (Ruiz2018Overexpression).

The overexpression of SRP-35 in skeletal muscle leads to increased glucose uptake and glycogen storage, enhancing muscle performance. This is achieved through the up-regulation of the Akt signaling pathway, specifically Akt S473 phosphorylation, via the activation of mTORC2 (Ruiz2018Overexpression). The protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Ruiz2018Overexpression).
