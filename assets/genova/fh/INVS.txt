# INVS

## Overview
The INVS gene encodes the protein inversin, a multifunctional protein primarily involved in ciliary function and cell cycle regulation. Inversin is characterized by its complex structure, which includes ankyrin repeats, IQ domains, and nuclear localization sequences, facilitating its diverse roles in cellular processes (Ward2004Analysis; Shiba2009Localization). As a key player in the Wnt signaling pathway, inversin acts as a molecular switch between canonical and noncanonical pathways, crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cystogenesis in renal tubular cells (Solic2021Expression; Badano2006The). Mutations in the INVS gene are linked to nephronophthisis type 2, a severe kidney disorder, underscoring the gene's significance in renal and extra-renal development (Srivastava2018Many; Gupta2021Nephronophthisis-Pathobiology).

## Structure
The INVS gene encodes the protein inversin, which is characterized by a complex molecular structure. Inversin consists of 1062 amino acids in mice and 1065 in humans, and includes several conserved domains and motifs. These include 16 tandem ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, two IQ domains that interact with calmodulin, two destruction-box (D-box) domains, and two bipartite nuclear localization sequences (NLS) (Ward2004Analysis). The protein also contains a ninein homologous region in its C-terminal, crucial for its localization to the ciliary compartment (Shiba2009Localization).

Alternative splicing of the INVS transcript results in various isoforms, which can lead to the loss or addition of functional motifs, affecting protein interactions and subcellular localization. For instance, some splice variants result in proteins with only ankyrin repeats, predicted to localize to the cytoplasm (Ward2004Analysis). Inversin is also subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and type O-glycosylation, which contribute to its functional diversity (Nürnberger2004The). These structural features and modifications allow inversin to participate in diverse cellular processes, including cell signaling and ciliary function.

## Function
The INVS gene encodes the protein inversin, which plays a critical role in the regulation of primary cilia and the cell cycle. Inversin is dynamically expressed throughout the cell cycle, localizing to centrosomes during early prophase, spindle poles during metaphase and anaphase, and the midbody during cytokinesis. This dynamic expression pattern suggests a potential interaction with the anaphase-promoting complex protein Apc2, indicating a role in cell cycle regulation (Morgan2002Expression).

Inversin is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, acting as a molecular switch between the canonical and noncanonical pathways. It targets dishevelled-1 (DVL-1) for degradation, thereby inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway and promoting the planar cell polarity pathway. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal tubular elongation and preventing abnormal proliferation in renal tubular cells, which can lead to cystogenesis (Solic2021Expression; Badano2006The).

Inversin is predominantly active in the primary cilia of renal epithelial cells, where it forms a complex with tubulin. This localization is significant for its role in sensory functions and in regulating cell proliferation, which are essential for proper kidney development and function (Solic2021Expression; Morgan2002Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INVS gene, which encodes the protein inversin, are associated with nephronophthisis type 2 (NPHP2), a severe form of kidney disease. This condition is characterized by early-onset end-stage renal disease (ESRD), typically occurring before the age of two, and is marked by enlarged kidneys with corticomedullary cysts, resembling autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) (Srivastava2018Many; Gupta2021Nephronophthisis-Pathobiology). The mutations in INVS lead to disruptions in ciliary function, which is crucial for maintaining normal kidney morphology and function (Oud2014Early; Srivastava2018Many).

Patients with INVS mutations often present with extra-renal manifestations, including hepatic fibrosis, situs inversus, and cardiac defects (Tory2009Mutations; Oud2014Early). The protein inversin plays a role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathways, and its dysfunction due to mutations can result in abnormal cell proliferation and cystogenesis, contributing to the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease (Solic2021Expression). The INVS gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its critical role in both renal and extra-renal development, with mutations leading to a spectrum of ciliopathies (Stokman2021Renal).

## Interactions
Inversin, encoded by the INVS gene, participates in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex protein Apc2, a relationship mediated by conserved D-box motifs within inversin. This interaction is essential for the ubiquitination of cell cycle regulators, with the N-terminal D-box being particularly critical for binding (Morgan2002Expression). Inversin also binds to calmodulin, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation studies (Morgan2002Expression).

Inversin forms complexes with catenins and N-cadherin, which are important for cell adhesion and signaling in polarized epithelial cells. It colocalizes with β-catenin at the plasma membrane and partially in the nucleus, while its interaction with N-cadherin is exclusive to the plasma membrane (Nürnberger2002Inversin). Inversin also interacts with proteins involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as Dishevelled, targeting it for degradation and thereby inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling (Lienkamp2012Inversin).

In the context of ciliary function, inversin interacts with B9d2 and Fleer, which are part of the intraflagellar transport system, facilitating its localization to the ciliary compartment (Zhao2011Nephrocystins). These interactions highlight inversin's role in regulating ciliary transport and cell signaling pathways.
