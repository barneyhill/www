# STIM1

## Overview
STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein crucial for calcium signaling in human cells. The STIM1 protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it functions as a sensor for calcium levels. Upon depletion of calcium in the ER, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change and relocates to regions near the plasma membrane to interact with the ORAI1 calcium channel, facilitating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Desvignes2015STIM1; Roos2005STIM1). This process is vital for various cellular functions, including immune cell activation and neuronal growth cone navigation. Mutations in the STIM1 gene can lead to disorders such as tubular aggregate myopathy and Stormorken syndrome, underscoring its importance in muscle and immune system function (Picard2009STIM1Mutation; Morin2019Tubular).

## Structure
The STIM1 protein is a type I transmembrane protein crucial for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in cells. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide, EF-hand motifs, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain. The EF-hand domain consists of a canonical EF-hand paired with a 'hidden' EF-hand, which together mediate hydrophobic interactions with the SAM domain, forming the EF-SAM region essential for calcium sensing and SOCE regulation (Stathopulos2008Structural).

The secondary structure of STIM1 is predominantly alpha-helical, with the EF-SAM domain forming a compact globular fold. The SAM domain is characterized by a 5-helix bundle, and the EF-hand motifs are in an 'open' conformation, with hydrophobic surfaces buried against nonpolar SAM contacts (Stathopulos2008Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the EF-SAM domains fold cooperatively, consistent with a two-state thermodynamic model. The interaction between the EF and SAM domains is mainly hydrophobic, contributing to the stability of the protein structure (Stathopulos2008Structural).

Quaternary structure involves oligomerization upon calcium depletion, which is crucial for the activation of SOCE. The cytosolic region contains coiled-coil domains that facilitate the interaction with Orai1, a subunit of the plasma membrane pore, essential for calcium entry (Ma2015Insideout; Stathopulos2013STIM1Orai1). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation can affect STIM1's function, and splice variants may alter its regulatory roles (Ma2015Insideout).

## Function
STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) is a critical component in calcium signaling within human cells. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it functions as a sensor for calcium levels. When ER calcium levels drop, STIM1 undergoes a conformational change and translocates to areas near the plasma membrane. Here, it interacts with ORAI1, a calcium channel, to facilitate store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), allowing calcium influx from the extracellular space into the cell (Desvignes2015STIM1; Roos2005STIM1).

This calcium influx is essential for various cellular functions, including the activation of transcription factors, gene expression, and cytokine production, particularly in immune cells like T cells. STIM1-mediated calcium signaling is crucial for T cell activation and function, influencing processes such as cytokine release and immune response regulation (Desvignes2015STIM1).

In neurons, STIM1 plays a significant role in axon guidance by regulating calcium transients in growth cones. It interacts with microtubule-associated proteins to facilitate the remodeling of the ER and microtubule cytoskeleton, which is necessary for growth cone navigation and response to guidance cues (Pavez2019STIM1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STIM1 gene are associated with a range of disorders due to its role in calcium signaling. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in STIM1 can lead to conditions such as tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) and Stormorken syndrome. TAM is characterized by muscle weakness, myalgia, and the presence of tubular aggregates in muscle biopsies, while Stormorken syndrome includes symptoms like muscle weakness, thrombocytopenia, miosis, and ichthyosis (Morin2019Tubular; Ticci2021Expanding). The p.R304W mutation is a common GOF mutation associated with these conditions, leading to constitutive activation of calcium channels and elevated calcium levels (Misceo2014A; Lacruz2015Diseases).

Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in STIM1 result in severe immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and muscular hypotonia. These mutations impair the interaction between STIM1 and ORAI1, reducing calcium influx and T cell proliferation (Picard2009STIM1Mutation; BernaErro2023The). Specific LOF mutations, such as those leading to premature termination codons, result in undetectable STIM1 protein expression and defective store-operated calcium entry, crucial for lymphocyte activation (Picard2009STIM1Mutation). These mutations highlight the critical role of STIM1 in maintaining immune function and muscle integrity.

## Interactions
STIM1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). It interacts with the Orai1 channel, facilitating calcium entry into the cytoplasm to replenish ER calcium stores. This interaction is mediated by the cytosolic strand of STIM1 and both the C-terminus and N-terminus of Orai1, with specific residues like L273 and L276 being significant for coupling and dimerization (Frischauf2016The).

STIM1 also interacts with PDIA3, a thiol oxidoreductase in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for regulating STIM1 activity and calcium homeostasis. The absence of PDIA3 leads to increased SOCE and STIM1 activity (Wang2021Proteins). Additionally, STIM1 forms a complex with POST, a 10-transmembrane-spanning protein, which binds to STIM1 and localizes near the cell membrane upon store depletion. This complex is proposed to sustain high cytosolic Ca2+ by activating Orai1 and inhibiting PMCA activity (Krapivinsky2011POST).

Golli proteins, encoded by the myelin basic protein gene, interact with the C-terminus of STIM1, negatively regulating SOCE. This interaction is specific, as evidenced by in vitro binding assays (Walsh2010Evidence). STIM1 also interacts with calmodulin, which mediates calcium-dependent inactivation of SOCE by binding to the polybasic region and SOAR domain of STIM1 (Wang2021Proteins).
