# PGAP1

## Overview
The PGAP1 gene encodes the enzyme post-GPI attachment to proteins inositol deacylase 1, which is integral to the post-translational modification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is categorized as a lipase due to its role in the deacylation of the inositol moiety of GPI-APs, a critical step for their maturation and function (Tanaka2004Inositol; Maeda2011Structural). The PGAP1 protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a 10-transmembrane architecture and a catalytic lipase domain, which facilitates its enzymatic activity (Hong2024Molecular). The proper functioning of PGAP1 is essential for the correct localization and signaling of GPI-APs, impacting various physiological processes such as neural function and fertilization (Hong2024Molecular). Mutations in the PGAP1 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Kettwig2016Compound).

## Structure
The PGAP1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes a 10-transmembrane architecture, a lipase domain, and a jelly-roll domain. The transmembrane domain (TMD) consists of 10 helices, with TMH4 crossing the membrane diagonally, forming a bowl-shaped structure that hosts the lipase domain (Hong2024Molecular). The lipase domain exhibits a typical α/β hydrolase fold, with an eight-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by α-helices, and contains a catalytic triad of Ser327, His443, and Asp407, essential for its enzymatic activity (Hong2024Molecular). The jelly-roll domain, although not directly involved in catalysis, may play a role in substrate interaction and protein-protein interactions (Hong2024Molecular).

PGAP1's structure includes a guitar-shaped cavity crucial for substrate and product binding, with specific amino acids lining the cavity to constrain the phospholipid moiety and accommodate the diacyl chains (Hong2024Molecular). The protein's structure allows it to process various substrates by recognizing a flexible ω-minus region and GPI anchor, rather than the main body of GPI-APs (Hong2024Molecular). The human PGAP1 gene may produce multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the human homologue sharing 90% identity with the rat PGAP1 in the first 591 amino acids (Tanaka2004Inositol).

## Function
The PGAP1 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in eukaryotic cells. PGAP1 is involved in the deacylation of the inositol moiety of GPI-APs, a process essential for their proper maturation, trafficking, and function (Tanaka2004Inositol; Maeda2011Structural). This deacylation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is necessary for the efficient transport of GPI-APs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Fujita2008Lipid). 

In healthy human cells, PGAP1 ensures the correct localization and signaling of GPI-APs, which are crucial for various physiological processes, including neural function and fertilization (Hong2024Molecular). The enzyme's activity is vital for the quality control of GPI-AP biogenesis, preventing the accumulation of immature GPI-APs in the ER and facilitating their export (Hong2024Molecular). PGAP1's function is also linked to the modification and expression of Wnt proteins and their interaction with glypicans, which are involved in morphogenic signaling pathways (Maeda2011Structural). Deficiencies in PGAP1 can lead to developmental defects and neurological disorders due to impaired GPI-AP maturation (Hong2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PGAP1 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily due to impaired glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. These mutations can lead to intellectual disabilities, encephalopathy, and other congenital malformations affecting the central nervous system. Clinical manifestations include severe psychomotor retardation, brain atrophy, recurrent apneas, and delayed myelination (Kettwig2016Compound). 

Specific mutations, such as the p.Leu197del alteration, result in abnormal GPI-anchor structures, which are resistant to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, contributing to intellectual disability and encephalopathy (Murakami2014Null). Other identified variants, like p.Lys111Glu, are expected to destabilize the protein, further impacting neurological development (Murakami2014Null).

PGAP1 mutations have also been linked to developmental delays, muscular hypotonia, and retinal dystrophy (Kettwig2016Compound). In addition, downregulation of PGAP1 is associated with conditions such as schizophrenia and Extramammary Paget disease, highlighting its broader clinical significance (Hong2024Molecular). The prevalence of diseases caused by PGAP1 mutations is estimated to be between 7 to 13 per million inhabitants (Murakami2014Null).

## Interactions
PGAP1 is involved in the quality control and biogenesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) through its enzymatic activity, which is crucial for the proper sorting and secretion of these proteins. PGAP1 interacts with the glycan quality control system via calnexin, which binds to N-glycans of GPI-APs, thereby increasing their retention time in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for efficient deacylation (Hong2024Molecular). This interaction is essential for maintaining the fidelity of ER-to-Golgi transport and for the assembly of Sec13-mediated COPII vesicles, which are necessary for GPI-AP transport (Hong2024Molecular).

PGAP1 also plays a role in the degradation of misfolded GPI-APs through ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and lysosomal pathways (Hong2024Molecular). In the context of osteoarthritis, PGAP1 is regulated by the long noncoding RNA NEAT1, which interacts with the miR-374b-5p/PGAP1 axis. NEAT1 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-374b-5p, thereby regulating PGAP1 expression. This interaction affects chondrocyte apoptosis and inflammation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis (Huang2023Downregulation).
