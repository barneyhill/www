# XRCC2

## Overview
XRCC2 is a gene that encodes the X-ray repair cross complementing 2 protein, a crucial component of the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway responsible for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. The XRCC2 protein is a member of the RecA/Rad51 family, characterized by its involvement in DNA repair processes. It forms complexes with other proteins, such as Rad51D and RAD51L3, to facilitate high-fidelity DNA repair by promoting strand exchange between homologous DNA segments (Tambini2010The; Braybrooke2000The). Located on chromosome 7q36.1, the XRCC2 gene is divided into three exons and is suggested to function as a housekeeping gene due to the presence of a CpG island near its 5' end (Cartwright1998The). The protein's activity is primarily nuclear, playing a significant role during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, contributing to genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which are linked to cancer development (Liu2005Differential; Griffin2000Mammalian).

## Structure
The XRCC2 protein is a member of the RecA/Rad51 family, which is involved in DNA repair through homologous recombination. The primary structure of XRCC2 includes characteristic nucleotide binding domains typical of the RecA/Rad51 family, such as a conserved GxxxxGKT motif in the first domain and a hydrophobic β-sheet in the second domain (Cartwright1998The). Despite these similarities, XRCC2 is structurally distinct from other family members like RAD51 and DMC1, being smaller in size (Cartwright1998The).

In terms of quaternary structure, XRCC2 forms complexes with other proteins, such as Rad51D, to facilitate DNA repair. The XRCC2·Rad51D complex can form multimeric ring structures in the absence of DNA and filamentous structures in the presence of single-stranded DNA, which are typical of homologous pairing proteins (Kurumizaka2002Homologous). XRCC2 also interacts with RAD51L3, forming a complex that may play a role in homologous recombination (Braybrooke2000The).

The XRCC2 gene is located on chromosome 7q36.1 in humans and is divided into three exons (Cartwright1998The). The presence of a CpG island near the 5' end suggests it may function as a housekeeping gene (Cartwright1998The).

## Function
The XRCC2 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. XRCC2 is part of the RAD51 family and interacts with RAD51 and other RAD51-like proteins to facilitate high-fidelity DNA repair by promoting strand exchange between homologous DNA segments (Tambini2010The; Thacker2003The). This interaction is vital for the efficient formation of RAD51 foci at DNA damage sites, enhancing the HR response to DNA damage (Tambini2010The).

XRCC2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a role during or after DNA replication, particularly in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Liu2005Differential). It is involved in stabilizing single-stranded DNA and facilitating homologous pairing during HR, contributing to genomic stability (Rajesh2009The). XRCC2 also plays a role in chromosome segregation during cell division, preventing chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, which are linked to cancer development (Griffin2000Mammalian). The absence of XRCC2 leads to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and chromosomal instability, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Johnson1999Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XRCC2 gene are associated with various cancers due to its role in DNA repair. In head and neck cancer (HNC), specific polymorphisms in XRCC2, such as rs3218373, have been linked to an increased risk. The heterozygous mutant (TG) and homozygous mutant (GG) genotypes of this SNP are more frequent in HNC patients, suggesting a significant association with cancer susceptibility (Saeed2017Haplotype). In breast cancer, rare mutations in XRCC2, including protein-truncating and missense variants, have been identified as risk factors. These mutations contribute to genetic instability, a hallmark of cancer development (Park2012Rare).

XRCC2 expression levels also play a role in cancer prognosis. In glioma, overexpression of XRCC2 is associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumor characteristics. This overexpression is linked to various signaling pathways involved in cell cycle and DNA repair, indicating its role in promoting cancer progression (Liu2021Overexpressed). Additionally, XRCC2 polymorphisms have been associated with colorectal cancer, where the rs3218499 C risk allele increases the risk, particularly for rectal cancer (Curtin2009Genetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of XRCC2 in cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
The XRCC2 protein is involved in several critical interactions that facilitate DNA repair through homologous recombination. XRCC2 forms a heterodimer with RAD51L3, a RAD51-like protein with significant DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. This interaction is similar to the Rad55p/Rad57p heterodimer in yeast, which aids in loading RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA, crucial for DNA repair processes (O’Regan2001XRCC2; Braybrooke2000The).

XRCC2 also interacts with RAD51D, forming a complex that catalyzes homologous pairing between single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. This interaction is ATP-independent and is essential for homologous recombination repair (Kurumizaka2002Homologous). The XRCC2·Rad51D complex is involved in forming multimeric ring structures without DNA and filamentous structures with single-stranded DNA, similar to other homologous pairing proteins (Kurumizaka2002Homologous).

Additionally, XRCC2 is part of the BCDX2 complex, which includes RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D. This complex is crucial for protein-protein interactions necessary for homologous recombination. Mutations in RAD51D that impair its interaction with XRCC2 can lead to decreased homologous recombination events, highlighting the importance of these interactions (Baldock2019RAD51D).
