# KLF5

## Overview
KLF5 (Krüppel-like factor 5) is a gene that encodes a zinc finger transcription factor, which is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family. The protein KLF5 plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is characterized by its ability to bind to GC-rich sequences in the promoters of target genes, thereby modulating transcriptional activity. KLF5 is involved in critical physiological processes such as epithelial cell proliferation, adipocyte differentiation, and cardiovascular remodeling. The protein's function is modulated by several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its interaction with other proteins and its activity in different signaling pathways. KLF5's dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cellular context and specific mutations (Lee2023Krüppellike; Dong2009Essential; Guo2009Acetylation).

## Structure
KLF5 (KLF transcription factor 5) is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family, characterized by a DNA-binding domain (DBD) with three C2H2-type zinc finger motifs located at the carboxyl terminus. These zinc fingers facilitate binding to GC-rich sequences, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Miyamoto2003Positive). The protein also contains a proline-rich region within the activation domain spanning amino acids 239 to 372, which is important for its transcriptional activation function (Zhang2003Phosphorylation).

KLF5 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation. Phosphorylation at the N-terminal region enhances its interaction with the coactivator CBP, thereby increasing its transactivation function (Zhang2003Phosphorylation). Acetylation by p300 occurs at the zinc finger domain, specifically at lysine 369, which is essential for its transcriptional activity (Miyamoto2003Positive).

KLF5 can form homodimers and potentially heterodimers with other Kruppel family members, influencing its regulatory functions (Zhang2003Phosphorylation). The protein's interaction with other factors, such as SET and Smad proteins, further modulates its activity and function in various cellular contexts (Miyamoto2003Positive; Guo2009Acetylation).

## Function
KLF5 (KLF transcription factor 5) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to GC-rich sequences in gene promoters to modulate transcription (Dong2009Essential). KLF5 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle, survival, migration, and stemness. It promotes cell proliferation by accelerating the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle transitions and upregulating cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and Cdc2, while inhibiting p27 and p15 (Dong2009Essential).

KLF5 is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes. It is highly expressed in proliferating epithelial cells and is necessary for maintaining epithelial homeostasis and development (Dong2009Essential). In adipocytes, KLF5 acts as a key regulator of differentiation, working in concert with other transcription factors to activate the PPARγ2 promoter, which is crucial for adipogenesis (Oishi2005Krüppellike).

KLF5's expression and activity are regulated by several signaling pathways, including Ras/MAPK, PKC, and TGFb, and it undergoes posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its function (Dong2009Essential). These regulatory mechanisms enable KLF5 to participate in physiological processes like cardiovascular remodeling and inflammation (Dong2009Essential).

## Clinical Significance
KLF5 (Kruppel-like factor 5) is implicated in various cancers due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), KLF5 is involved in tumorigenesis through its regulation by the MAPK-ERK-RAS pathway and its interaction with the HIPPO and WNT signaling pathways. Mutations such as pP301S and pS303P in KLF5 increase its stability and oncogenic potential by preventing degradation, which is significant in CRC progression (Lee2023Krüppellike; Zhang2018Somatic). 

KLF5 is also associated with chemotherapy resistance in CRC, particularly through the prion-FOXO3a-KLF5 axis, and influences the response to radiation therapy (Lee2023Krüppellike). In prostate cancer, the acetylation status of KLF5 affects its role as a tumor suppressor or promoter. A mutation at K369R prevents acetylation, converting KLF5 from a tumor suppressor to a promoter, leading to increased tumor growth (Li2014Interruption).

In breast cancer, KLF5 overexpression is linked to worse survival outcomes, and its expression is influenced by hormonal signaling, contributing to drug resistance (Luo2021The; Zhang2018Somatic). These findings highlight KLF5's clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
KLF5 (Kruppel-like factor 5) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple signaling pathways. It interacts with Smad proteins, including Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, forming complexes that are crucial for TGFβ-mediated transcriptional regulation. The interaction with Smad4 is independent of TGFβ signaling, suggesting that KLF5 may form complexes with Smads before binding to promoter DNA (Guo2009Acetylation). KLF5 also interacts with Miz-1 regardless of TGFβ presence and with Myc only in the presence of TGFβ (Guo2009Acetylation).

In colon cancer cells, KLF5 is essential for the interaction between β-catenin and TCF4, particularly in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of TCF4, and KLF5 is a crucial component of the β-catenin/TCF transcription complex (Guo2015Krüppellike).

KLF5 also interacts with p53 in regulating survivin expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This interaction modulates the repression of survivin promoter activity by p53, highlighting a regulatory role in survivin expression (Zhu2006KLF5). Additionally, KLF5 interacts with CINP (Cdk2-interacting protein) in bladder cancer cells, promoting cell proliferation and survival (Wu2018CINP).
