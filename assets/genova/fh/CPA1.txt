# CPA1

## Overview
The CPA1 gene encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase A1, a zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidase primarily involved in the digestive process. This enzyme is synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cells and plays a critical role in protein digestion by cleaving amino acids from the carboxyl end of protein chains. Carboxypeptidase A1 is secreted as an inactive zymogen and activated in the intestinal lumen, facilitating nutrient absorption. Structurally, it features a conserved catalytic domain and an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, with a catalytic zinc ion essential for its enzymatic function. CPA1's activity is regulated through interactions with inhibitors and other proteins, and its expression is a marker for acinar cell differentiation. Clinically, mutations in the CPA1 gene are associated with early-onset chronic pancreatitis and may increase susceptibility to pancreatic cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Fernández2007Structural; Witt2013Variants; Said2020Carboxypeptidase; Lyons2010Substrate).

## Structure
Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) is a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme with a well-characterized structure. The primary structure of CPA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which includes a conserved catalytic domain typical of the carboxypeptidase family (Lyons2010Substrate). The secondary structure of CPA1 features an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, which is common among metallocarboxypeptidases, and is essential for its enzymatic function (Fernández2007Structural).

The tertiary structure of CPA1 is a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bonds, which helps maintain its structural integrity. This structure includes a catalytic zinc ion located in a cavity, coordinated by key residues such as His69, Glu72, and His196, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Fernández2007Structural). The enzyme's active site is designed to accommodate a broad range of substrates, with specific residues influencing substrate specificity (Lyons2010Substrate).

CPA1 may form a quaternary structure as a homodimer, although specific details on this aspect are not extensively covered in the available literature. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Lyons2010Substrate).

## Function
Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) is an enzyme primarily synthesized in the pancreatic acinar cells, where it is one of the most abundant proteins produced by the pancreas (Said2020Carboxypeptidase). In healthy human cells, CPA1 plays a crucial role in the digestion process. It is secreted as an inactive zymogen and activated by trypsin in the intestinal lumen to form the active enzyme CPA1. Once activated, CPA1 functions by cleaving amino acids from the carboxyl end of protein chains, facilitating the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, which are essential for nutrient absorption (Said2020Carboxypeptidase).

CPA1 is stored in zymogen granules within the pancreatic acinar cells and is not expressed in pancreatic duct cells (Tamura2018Mutations). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining efficient protein digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine. The presence of CPA1 is also a marker for acinar cell differentiation, and its expression is used to identify acinar cell carcinoma, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Said2020Carboxypeptidase). CPA1's role in healthy cells underscores its significance in digestive processes and its potential implications in pancreatic health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CPA1 gene are significantly associated with early-onset chronic pancreatitis, particularly in non-alcoholic cases. These mutations often lead to protein misfolding, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and reduced secretion of the CPA1 enzyme, which contributes to pancreatic inflammation and injury (Sándor2022Novel; Witt2013Variants). The p.G250A and p.N256K mutations, among others, are known to cause severe secretion defects and ER stress, correlating with the pathogenicity of these variants in chronic pancreatitis (Sándor2022Novel).

The CPA1 gene variants are also implicated in pancreatic cancer susceptibility. ER stress-inducing CPA1 variants are more prevalent in pancreatic cancer patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential link between these variants and cancer risk. This association is thought to arise from chronic low-grade inflammation due to acinar cell injury, which may predispose individuals to cancer (Tamura2018Mutations; Kawamoto2021Endoplasmic). Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, the presence of these variants in pancreatic cancer cases without a history of pancreatitis suggests a distinct pathogenic pathway (Tamura2018Mutations).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its activity. CPA1 can form a complex with latexin, a known inhibitor, which has been studied using chemical cross-linking and molecular docking techniques. This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic contacts and minimal structural changes upon complex formation, indicating a stable interaction (Mouradov2005Modelling).

In the context of human digestive proteases, CPA1 interacts with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), a mucoadhesive polymer. This interaction occurs at the active site of CPA1 and is significant as it represents the first example of a complex between a mucoadhesive polymer and a digestive protease in the human gastrointestinal tract. The binding of PAA to CPA1 can inhibit its activity, which may enhance the bioavailability of therapeutic peptides and proteins by prolonging their contact time with body tissues (Pallarès2008Direct).

CPA1 is also part of a larger proteolytic cascade in the digestive system, where it is synthesized as an inactive precursor and activated through specific proteolytic processes. This activation involves interactions with other proproteinases, forming non-covalent binary or ternary complexes that regulate the enzyme's activity (Vendrell2000Metallocarboxypeptidases).
