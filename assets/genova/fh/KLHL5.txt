# KLHL5

## Overview
KLHL5 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 5, which is part of the Kelch-like (KLHL) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of kelch motifs and a BTB domain, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and its function as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes are crucial for targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the cell cycle (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*; Wu2020KLHL5). KLHL5 is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, adrenal gland, and thyroid, and has been implicated in the regulation of protein degradation and cell cycle progression (Schleifer2018KLHL5). The gene has two identified splicing variants, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*). KLHL5's involvement in cancer, particularly its role in ubiquitination processes and potential as a therapeutic target, underscores its clinical significance (Wu2020KLHL5; Xiang2021Targeting).

## Structure
KLHL5 is a member of the kelch-like family of proteins, characterized by the presence of kelch motifs and a BTB domain. The kelch motifs, approximately 50 amino acids in length, form a four-stranded β-sheet that assembles into a β-propeller structure, facilitating multiple protein-protein interactions, including actin-binding activity (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*). The BTB domain, located at the amino terminus, is a protein-protein interaction motif that can form homodimers or heterodimers, contributing to the quaternary structure of the protein (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*). KLHL5 also interacts with Cullin3 to form a Cullin-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, acting as an adapter to recruit substrates for ubiquitination through its kelch motifs (Peng2023Genomic).

The KLHL5 gene has two identified splicing variants, KLHL5a and KLHL5b, which were discovered through sequencing analysis of a human fetal brain cDNA library (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*). These variants may lead to different isoforms with potentially distinct functions, although specific structural differences between these isoforms are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
KLHL5 is a member of the Kelch-like (KLHL) family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes through their role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The KLHL5 protein contains BTB domains and Kelch motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for its function as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes are responsible for targeting specific proteins for degradation, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating the cell cycle (Wu2020KLHL5).

In healthy human cells, KLHL5 is involved in the regulation of protein degradation by recruiting substrates to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, acting as a bridge between the target recognition protein and the scaffold protein Cullin-3 (CUL3) (Wu2020KLHL5). This activity is important for the degradation of cell cycle regulators, such as Aurora Kinase and PLK1, which are critical for cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Schleifer2018KLHL5).

KLHL5 is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, adrenal gland, and thyroid, and has a splicing variant in human fetal brain tissue (Schleifer2018KLHL5). Despite its known roles in protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, the complete function of KLHL5 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Wu2020KLHL5).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL5 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in various cancers, with its expression levels influencing patient outcomes. In gastric cancer, KLHL5 overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival, particularly in node-positive patients with stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). This overexpression is linked to worse prognosis across different subgroups, including variations in gender, stage, and tumor size, and may influence prognosis by affecting lymph node metastases (Wu2020KLHL5). KLHL5 is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in gastric cancer, showing associations with CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, suggesting its involvement in tumor immunity and potential contribution to tumor metastasis and immune escape (Wu2020KLHL5).

In lung and breast cancers, higher KLHL5 expression correlates with better prognoses, indicating its role may vary across cancer types (Wu2020KLHL5). Additionally, KLHL5 is highly expressed in certain cancer cell lines, and its knockdown has been shown to inhibit proliferation, suggesting a cancer-promoting role in colon cancer (Xiang2021Targeting). These findings highlight KLHL5's potential as a target for cancer therapy due to its regulated expression and impact on clinical outcomes (Xiang2021Targeting).

## Interactions
KLHL5 is a member of the Kelch-like family of proteins, which are known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through their role as substrate adaptors in the Cullin3-RING ligase (CRL3) complex. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a critical process for maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell (Dhanoa2013Update; Xiang2021Targeting).

KLHL5 interacts with Cullin-3 (CUL3) to facilitate the ubiquitination of specific substrates, marking them for degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating processes such as protein degradation, actin dynamics, and cell-cycle regulation (Schleifer2018KLHL5). The BTB domain of KLHL5 is a conserved protein-protein interaction motif that can form homodimers or heterodimers, potentially modulating its function and interactions with other proteins (Xu2003CharacterizationofanovelsplicingvariantofKLHL5*).

In the context of cancer, KLHL5 has been implicated in the ubiquitination of Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a molecule involved in cell death, suggesting a role in modulating cell survival pathways (Wu2020KLHL5). These interactions highlight the potential of KLHL5 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
