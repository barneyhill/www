# ZC3H14

## Overview
ZC3H14 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 14 protein, a member of the zinc finger polyadenosine RNA-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by its five CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its binding to polyadenosine RNA, playing a critical role in post-transcriptional mRNA processing (Kelly2007Recognition; Leung2009Splice). ZC3H14 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with pre-mRNAs to ensure their proper maturation and export, which is essential for maintaining cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial function (Wigington2016The). The protein's function is particularly significant in neurons, where it influences RNA metabolism and local translation, contributing to cognitive function (Kelly2014A). Mutations in ZC3H14 have been linked to intellectual disabilities, highlighting its importance in brain function (Rha2017The). Additionally, alterations in ZC3H14 expression have been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor (Zhang2018Downregulation).

## Structure
The human ZC3H14 gene encodes a protein that is part of a family of zinc finger polyadenosine RNA binding proteins. The primary structure of ZC3H14 includes five CCCH-type zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its RNA binding capability (Kelly2007Recognition; Leung2009Splice). These zinc fingers are arranged in a manner that facilitates high-affinity binding to polyadenosine RNA, similar to its yeast orthologue Nab2 (Kelly2007Recognition; Fasken2019Structure–function).

The secondary structure of ZC3H14 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The N-terminal domain of ZC3H14 can be modeled into a PWI-like fold, forming a five α-helical bundle, which is similar to the structure found in Nab2 (Leung2009Splice).

ZC3H14 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functional roles. Isoforms 1, 2, and 3 contain classical nuclear localization signals and are localized to the nucleus, while isoform 4 lacks these signals and is found in the cytoplasm (Leung2009Splice). These isoforms suggest potential tissue-specific expression and functional diversity (Leung2009Splice).

## Function
The ZC3H14 gene encodes a zinc finger polyadenosine RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional processing of mRNA in human cells. This protein is involved in regulating the pre-mRNA processing of specific mRNA transcripts, such as ATP5G1, a key ATP synthase subunit mRNA. ZC3H14 ensures proper mRNA processing by binding to polyadenosine RNA, which is essential for maintaining steady-state levels of ATP5G1 mRNA and preventing its premature degradation (Wigington2016The).

ZC3H14 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with pre-mRNAs to ensure their proper maturation and export. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial function, as evidenced by the mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased ATP levels observed upon ZC3H14 knockdown (Wigington2016The). The protein's role in regulating poly(A) tail length and mRNA stability is particularly important in neurons, where it influences RNA metabolism and local translation, contributing to cognitive function (Kelly2014A). Mutations in ZC3H14 have been linked to intellectual disabilities, underscoring its importance in brain function (Rha2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZC3H14 gene are associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID). These mutations lead to the loss of certain protein isoforms that are crucial for cognitive function, particularly in the brain, while other isoforms remain unaffected (Pak2011Mutation; Kelly2014A). The absence of these isoforms disrupts the regulation of poly(A) tail length in neuronal RNA, which is essential for mRNA stability and translation, potentially leading to impaired synaptic development and plasticity (Rha2017The; Kelly2014A).

In addition to intellectual disability, alterations in ZC3H14 expression have been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene is frequently deleted in a significant fraction of HCC patients, and its downregulation is associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting its role as a potential tumor suppressor (Zhang2018Downregulation).

The clinical significance of ZC3H14 mutations is further underscored by studies in model organisms, where the loss of its orthologs leads to defects in brain morphology and function, highlighting its conserved role in neuronal health (Bienkowski2017The; Morris2018The).

## Interactions
ZC3H14, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily in the context of RNA processing. It interacts with the THO complex, a multiprotein assembly essential for RNA processing activities such as transcription elongation, mRNA splicing, and nuclear export. ZC3H14 associates with all core members of the THO complex, including THOC1, THOC2, THOC3, THOC5, THOC6, and THOC7, as well as THO-associated proteins ALYREF and CHTOP. The interaction with THOC1 is stable even in the presence of RNase, indicating an RNA-independent association, while the interaction with THOC2 is partially RNA-dependent, and the interaction with ALYREF is entirely RNA-dependent (Morris2018The).

ZC3H14 also binds with high affinity to polyadenosine RNA, playing a role in controlling poly(A) tail length, nuclear export, and mRNA splicing. It is involved in the processing of specific neuronal transcripts, such as Atp5g1 and Psd95, and is linked to the exon junction complex (EJC), which is important for mRNA export (Morris2018The; Wigington2016The). Additionally, ZC3H14 interacts with the PI3K signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuroprotective activities (Alqawlaq2021An).
