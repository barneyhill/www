# MAT1A

## Overview
Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is a gene that encodes the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, a critical component in methionine metabolism. This enzyme is primarily responsible for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a universal methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions essential for cellular metabolism and gene regulation. MAT1A is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a vital role in maintaining high levels of SAMe, supporting normal liver function, and regulating gene expression through DNA and histone methylation. The enzyme's structure, characterized by a Rossmann fold and a quaternary homotetrameric formation, facilitates its catalytic activity and interaction with other proteins. Mutations in the MAT1A gene can lead to methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency, resulting in hypermethioninemia and associated neurological symptoms. Additionally, alterations in MAT1A expression have been linked to various liver-related conditions and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Portillo2020Proteinprotein; Ramani2017Methionine; Hübner2022Methionine).

## Structure
The MAT1A gene encodes the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, which is responsible for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) from methionine and ATP. The protein typically forms a homotetramer, indicating a quaternary structure, with each dimer containing two active sites at the subunit interface (Shafqat2013Insight). The enzyme's structure includes a Rossmann fold, a common motif for nucleotide binding, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Markham2008Structurefunction).

The MAT1A protein is composed of three domains, formed by βαββαβ repeats, which facilitate the formation of dimers and tetramers. The active sites are located in deep cavities between subunits, and a disordered loop is proposed to control access to these sites (Markham2008Structurefunction). The protein's C-terminal domain plays a significant role in its nucleocytoplasmic distribution, with specific residues influencing nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (Reytor2009Conformational).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the activity and stability of MAT1A, although the in vivo relevance of these modifications remains to be fully explored (Markham2008Structurefunction). The enzyme's structure and function are critical for maintaining proper cellular methylation processes.

## Function
Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), a key methyl donor involved in numerous methylation reactions essential for cellular metabolism and gene regulation. In healthy human cells, MAT1A is primarily active in the liver, where it maintains high levels of SAMe, which is vital for inhibiting the mitogenic effects of growth factors and supporting normal liver function (Ramani2017Methionine; Schröder2012Proteomic).

MAT1A is involved in the methylation of DNA and histones, processes that are critical for regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. In the nucleus, MAT1A is associated with histone H3K27 trimethylation, an epigenetic modification linked to gene repression (Ramani2017Methionine; Reytor2009Conformational). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the synthesis of metabolites such as polyamines and biotin, and it plays a role in the biosynthesis of cysteine and glutathione, which are important for detoxification processes in the liver (Schröder2012Proteomic).

MAT1A's function extends to influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis, with its deficiency leading to increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to liver pathologies (Ramani2017Methionine). The enzyme's subcellular localization includes both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it forms oligomers necessary for its function (Reytor2009Conformational).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAT1A gene, which encodes methionine adenosyltransferase 1A, are associated with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency, a condition that leads to hypermethioninemia. This metabolic disorder is characterized by elevated levels of methionine in the blood and can result in severe neurological symptoms, including developmental delay and dystonia, particularly in individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (Hübner2022Methionine; Chien2015Mudd’s). The deficiency is the most common cause of hypermethioninemia detected in newborn screening and is linked to brain demyelination in some cases (Chamberlin1996Demyelination).

MAT1A mutations can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, leading to more severe clinical manifestations, or in an autosomal dominant manner, which is generally considered benign (Kim2016Determination). The autosomal recessive form is associated with higher plasma methionine and homocysteine levels, contributing to developmental and intellectual disabilities (Kim2016Determination).

Alterations in MAT1A expression have also been implicated in liver-related conditions. Downregulation of MAT1A is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, as it may lead to enhanced ribosomal translation and cancer progression (Chen2022Downregulation). Elevated MAT1A levels have been linked to drug resistance in bladder cancer, suggesting its role in altering chemosensitivity (Martin2019Methionine).

## Interactions
Methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in methionine metabolism. MAT1A interacts with amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), indicating its role in broader metabolic pathways (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). It also interacts with cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) in the mitochondrial matrix and endoplasmic reticulum, which is important for the methylation and degradation of CYP2E1 (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The transport of MAT1A to mitochondria may involve heat shock proteins HSP70A8 and HSP90b (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

MAT1A forms complexes with PDRG1, a protein involved in macromolecular complexes such as the spliceosome. This interaction occurs in nuclear fractions and may influence the availability of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), affecting DNA methylation (Portillo2020Proteinprotein). The interaction between MAT1A and PDRG1 is supported by evidence of nuclear localization and expression patterns in liver diseases (Portillo2020Proteinprotein).

In hepatoma cells, MAT1A expression leads to increased SAM levels, affecting various cellular pathways, including the down-regulation of the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival (Schröder2012Proteomic). These interactions highlight MAT1A's role in regulating cellular methylation processes and its potential impact on liver function and disease.
