# SH3PXD2B

## Overview
The SH3PXD2B gene encodes the SH3 and PX domains 2B protein, commonly referred to as TKS4, which is a pivotal adaptor protein involved in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. This protein is characterized by its Phox homology (PX) domain and multiple Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate its role in protein docking to membranes and protein-protein interactions (Mao2024Genetic). TKS4 is integral to the formation of podosomes and invadopodia, actin-rich structures that contribute to cell-ECM adhesion and degradation (Massadeh2022The). Mutations in the SH3PXD2B gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Frank-Ter Haar syndrome and ocular abnormalities, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (de2020The; Mao2011Anterior).

## Structure
The SH3PXD2B protein, also known as TKS4, is a 911-amino-acid protein characterized by a conserved Phox homology (PX) domain at the amino-terminal, which is linked to four conserved Src homology 3 (SH3) domains through linker regions (Wilson2013Mutations). The PX domain is crucial for the protein's function, as it facilitates the appropriate cellular localization of TKS4 by binding to specific membrane lipids (Massadeh2022The). This domain is essential for the formation of podosomes and invadopodia, which are actin-rich membrane projections involved in cell adhesion and migration (Massadeh2022The).

Mutations in SH3PXD2B, such as splice donor mutations and deletions, result in truncated proteins that lack functional SH3PXD2B, as confirmed by the absence of the expected 120 kDa protein in patient-derived fibroblast cells (Wilson2013Mutations). These mutations can disrupt the protein's ability to form complexes necessary for downstream signaling pathways, such as the TKS4-TGFR complex involved in the tyrosine-phosphorylation cascade (Massadeh2022The). The SH3 domains within SH3PXD2B are involved in protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal organization (Mehrabipour2023A).

## Function
The SH3PXD2B gene encodes a protein known as SH3 and PX domains 2B, or TKS4, which plays a crucial role in the formation and function of podosomes. Podosomes are dynamic, actin-rich structures involved in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (Wilson2013Mutations). In healthy human cells, SH3PXD2B facilitates ECM remodeling by recruiting matrix metalloproteases and members of the ADAM metalloprotease family, which are essential for the degradation and remodeling of the ECM (Wilson2013Mutations).

The protein contains a Phox homolog (PX) domain and multiple Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, which facilitate protein docking to membranes and protein-protein interactions, respectively (Mao2024Genetic). SH3PXD2B is considered a key podosomal adaptor protein, essential for the formation of podosomes and invadosomes, which are involved in cell-ECM adhesions with ECM degradation activity (Mao2024Genetic). The protein's interaction with phosphoinositides and other proteins through its PX and SH3 domains is crucial for its function in organizing invadosomes, linking tyrosine kinase signaling, actin assembly machinery, and reactive oxygen species to promote cell migration, ECM degradation, and invasion (Mao2024Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SH3PXD2B gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS) is a rare skeletal dysplasia caused by mutations in SH3PXD2B, leading to craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal malformations, and reduced bone mineral density. The gene's product, TKS4, is crucial for extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and its dysfunction results in defective collagen remodeling, central to the pathogenesis of FTHS and related syndromes (de2020The).

In ocular health, SH3PXD2B mutations are linked to anterior segment dysgenesis and early-onset glaucoma. These mutations can cause optic nerve degeneration and a reduction in myelinated axons, contributing to glaucomatous damage. The gene is involved in the development of the iridocorneal angle and may influence metalloproteinase regulation, affecting ocular tissue development (Mao2011Anterior).

SH3PXD2B is also implicated in craniofacial dysmorphology and otitis media (OM) in mice, with mutations leading to craniofacial defects and eustachian tube dysfunction, increasing the risk of OM (Yang2011Sh3pxd2b). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SH3PXD2B expression is up-regulated, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting cell invasion and metastasis (Kui2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
The SH3PXD2B protein, also known as TKS4, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, particularly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. It forms complexes with cortactin and Src, both of which are crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Src phosphorylates SH3PXD2B, cortactin, and paxillin, facilitating their roles in cellular processes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have shown that SH3PXD2B can form a complex with Src, indicating a direct interaction (Lányi2011The). SH3PXD2B also interacts with cortactin independently of Src, with the interaction localized to the C-terminal region of cortactin, which includes the SH3 domain. This interaction is crucial for the formation of actin-based structures like lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (Lányi2011The).

The PX domain of SH3PXD2B binds to specific phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol lipids, which is important for its cellular localization, although protein interactions are more critical for its targeting (Lányi2011The). SH3PXD2B also interacts with ADAM15 through its fourth SH3 domain, suggesting a role in the regulation of ADAM family proteins (Mao2024Genetic). These interactions highlight SH3PXD2B's role as a scaffold protein in cellular attachment and migration.
