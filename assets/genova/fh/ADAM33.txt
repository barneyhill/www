# ADAM33

## Overview
ADAM33 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 33 protein, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteases. These proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell-to-cell interactions and the shedding of pro-protein ectodomains (Garlisi2003Human; Powell2004The). The ADAM33 protein is characterized by a multi-domain structure, including a metalloprotease domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Yoshinaka2002Identification). It is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal cells and the central nervous system, playing significant roles in development and cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Powell2004The). Clinically, the ADAM33 gene is associated with respiratory diseases, particularly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where its polymorphisms have been linked to disease susceptibility and progression (Howard2003Association; Vijaya2016Association).

## Structure
The ADAM33 protein is a member of the ADAM family, characterized by a multi-domain structure. It includes a signal sequence, pro-domain, metalloprotease domain with a zinc-binding motif, disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich domain with an EGF-like motif, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Yoshinaka2002Identification). The human ADAM33 protein consists of 813 amino acids, while the mouse version has 797 amino acids, with a 70% homology between them (Yoshinaka2002Identification). The metalloprotease domain contains a zinc-binding consensus sequence (HEXGHXXGXXHD), essential for enzymatic activity (Zou2005ADAM33; Yoshinaka2002Identification).

ADAM33 has potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a consensus furin cleavage site at the boundary between the pro-domain and metalloprotease domain (Yoshinaka2002Identification). A spliced isoform, termed the b isoform, lacks 26 amino acids at the boundary between the cysteine-rich domain and the EGF-like domain, due to alternative splicing involving exon 17. The longer isoform is referred to as the a isoform (Yoshinaka2002Identification). The protein lacks SH3 binding sites in its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a different activation mechanism compared to other ADAM family members like xADAM13 (Yoshinaka2002Identification).

## Function
ADAM33 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteases involved in various cellular activities, including cell-to-cell interactions and the shedding of pro-protein ectodomains (Garlisi2003Human; Powell2004The). The protein is synthesized as an inactive pro-protein that requires processing to become mature and active, a process often facilitated by furin or furin-like proteases (Garlisi2003Human). The mature ADAM33 protein is translocated to extracellular and/or intracellular membrane surfaces, where it is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and embryogenesis (Powell2004The).

ADAM33 is expressed predominantly in mesenchymal cells and the central nervous system, playing roles in development during embryogenesis (Powell2004The). It is implicated in processes such as ecto-domain shedding of growth factors, ligands, and receptors, as well as membrane fusion and cell adhesion (Powell2004The). The protein is expressed ubiquitously at the mRNA level, with the highest expression in the brain, heart, kidney, lung, and testes (Garlisi2003Human). Although specific enzymatic activities in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, the presence of a metalloprotease domain suggests a role in proteolytic processing of proteins, important for cell signaling, adhesion, and migration (Yoshinaka2002Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The ADAM33 gene is clinically significant due to its association with respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Polymorphisms in ADAM33 have been linked to asthma susceptibility and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), with variations in the gene contributing to airway remodeling and inflammation (Howard2003Association; Powell2004The). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAM33, such as S1 and S2, have been associated with accelerated decline in lung function, particularly in smokers, and are implicated in tissue remodeling and airway obstruction (Jongepier2004Polymorphisms; Vijaya2016Association).

The gene's expression in lung fibroblasts and bronchial smooth muscle cells suggests its role in airway remodeling, a key feature of asthma pathogenesis (Kedda2006ADAM33). Studies have shown that ADAM33 polymorphisms can affect the decline of forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, indicating its impact on lung function (Vijaya2016Association). Additionally, certain haplotypes of ADAM33 have been associated with asthma severity, highlighting the gene's influence on disease progression and phenotype (Kedda2006ADAM33; Shen2017ADAM33). These findings underscore the importance of ADAM33 in the clinical landscape of respiratory diseases.
