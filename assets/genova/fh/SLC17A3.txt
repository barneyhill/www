# SLC17A3

## Overview
SLC17A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 17 member 3, which is a member of the solute carrier family of transporters. This protein functions primarily as a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter and is involved in the transmembrane transport of organic anions. It is predominantly expressed in the kidney, particularly in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules, where it plays a significant role in the renal excretion of organic anions such as urate and paraaminohippurate (Reimer2013SLC17:; Li2024SLC17A13). The transport activity of SLC17A3 is electrogenic and voltage-dependent, facilitating the movement of these anions across cell membranes (Reimer2013SLC17:). Variations in the SLC17A3 gene have been linked to clinical conditions related to urate metabolism and Type 1 Diabetes, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Takada2024Regulation; Hebbar2023Linkage).

## Function
The SLC17A3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family 17, which functions primarily as a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter involved in the transmembrane transport of organic anions. In healthy human cells, SLC17A3 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, specifically in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules, where it plays a crucial role in the renal excretion of organic anions such as urate and paraaminohippurate (Reimer2013SLC17:; Li2024SLC17A13). The transport activity of SLC17A3 is electrogenic and voltage-dependent, facilitating the movement of these anions across cell membranes (Reimer2013SLC17:).

SLC17A3 is also involved in the renal excretion of N-lactoyl-phenylalanine (Lac-Phe), a lactate-derived metabolite. Studies in mice have shown that the absence of SLC17A3 leads to a significant reduction in urine Lac-Phe levels, indicating its role in regulating this metabolite's excretion (Li2024SLC17A13). Despite its role in urine regulation, SLC17A3 does not significantly affect plasma levels of Lac-Phe, suggesting its function is more critical for urine regulation (Li2024SLC17A13). The protein's activity is inhibited by loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide, highlighting its involvement in drug metabolism and secretion (Reimer2013SLC17:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the SLC17A3 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly related to urate metabolism and Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The SLC17A3 gene, along with SLC17A1, is involved in urate transport, and polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to elevated blood urate levels and gout (Reimer2013SLC17:). The lead variant rs942379 in SLC17A3 shows significant associations with T1D, HbA1C, serum urate, and uric acid levels, suggesting its role in these conditions (Hebbar2023Linkage). The rs56027330 variant, in particular, is noted for its association with T1D and glycemic traits, and its prevalence is higher in the T1D cohort compared to the general population (Hebbar2023Linkage).

SLC17A3 variants also influence kidney function, as evidenced by their role as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in kidney tissues, potentially impacting nephropathy-related traits (Hebbar2023Linkage). The gene's involvement in urate transport suggests a potential link to renal disorders, including hyperuricemia and gout, due to its role in urate homeostasis (Takada2024Regulation). These genetic variations may have implications for kidney function and disease, particularly in the context of T1D (Hebbar2023Linkage).
