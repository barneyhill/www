# PHACTR1

## Overview
PHACTR1, or phosphatase and actin regulator 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphatase activity. The protein, also named PHACTR1, is a member of the phosphatase and actin regulatory protein family and is characterized by its RPEL domain, which facilitates binding to G-actin. This interaction is crucial for the protein's role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular processes such as angiogenesis and neuronal development (Fedoryshchak2020Molecular; Jarray2011Depletion). PHACTR1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), modulating actomyosin assembly and stress fiber formation, which are essential for cell motility and invasiveness (Wiezlak2012Gactin). Clinically, variations in the PHACTR1 gene have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, as well as non-cardiovascular conditions like West syndrome (Beaudoin2015Myocardial; Hamada2018De).

## Structure
The PHACTR1 protein is characterized by its RPEL domain, which contains multiple RPEL motifs that are crucial for binding G-actin. The C-terminal region of PHACTR1 includes a triple RPEL repeat, forming a trivalent complex with G-actin, where each RPEL motif engages with a G-actin molecule. This interaction is mediated by conserved residues, such as arginines and hydrophobic side chains, which interact with specific actin subdomains (Mouilleron2012Structures). The RPEL domain's structure is compact and elongated, with three G-actin molecules organized around a helical axis, forming a closed helical assembly (Mouilleron2012Structures).

The protein also contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) near the N-terminal RPEL motif and within the C-terminal RPEL domain, which are involved in its nuclear import. G-actin competes with importin α-β for binding to these NLS elements, influencing PHACTR1's subcellular localization (Wiezlak2012Gactin). PHACTR1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) through a conserved C-terminal region, and this interaction is modulated by G-actin levels (Wiezlak2012Gactin). The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, affecting its activity and interactions (Allen2004Phactrs).

## Function
PHACTR1 (phosphatase and actin regulator 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and phosphatase activity in human cells. It is part of the phosphatase and actin regulatory protein family and interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and actin through its C-terminal RPEL domain (Jarray2011Depletion). PHACTR1 is involved in endothelial cell functions, particularly in angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. It is a VEGF-dependent gene expressed in human endothelial cells, and its depletion leads to increased cell death and reduced tube formation, indicating its role in cell survival and angiogenesis (Jarray2011Depletion).

In the cytoplasm, PHACTR1 regulates actin dynamics and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. It contains RPEL motifs that bind G-actin, which regulates its subcellular localization. Upon serum stimulation, Rho-actin signaling promotes PHACTR1's nuclear accumulation, where it can induce actomyosin structures in a PP1-dependent manner (Wiezlak2012Gactin). In the nucleus, PHACTR1 interacts with PP1 to promote actomyosin assembly, essential for cell motility and invasiveness (Wiezlak2012Gactin). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular contractility, impacting processes like angiogenesis and neuronal development (Fedoryshchak2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PHACTR1 gene are associated with several cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions. In the cardiovascular context, PHACTR1 is linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 6p24 locus, particularly within the third intron of PHACTR1, are associated with MI and CAD, independent of traditional risk factors like hypertension or dyslipidemia (Beaudoin2015Myocardial). The rs9349379 SNP is specifically associated with reduced PHACTR1 expression in macrophages, contributing to impaired efferocytosis and promoting atherosclerotic plaque necrosis (Kasikara2021Deficiency).

PHACTR1 expression is also implicated in endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, critical factors in atherosclerosis development. Its upregulation by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and inflammatory cytokines leads to increased expression of adhesion molecules, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration (Ma2022PHACTR1). Down-expression of PHACTR1 in endothelial cells induces pro-atherogenic factors and alters pathways such as AMPK/CREB/eNOS, contributing to atherosclerosis (Jarray2015Disruption).

In non-cardiovascular contexts, PHACTR1 mutations have been identified in West syndrome, a form of infantile epilepsy, where they disrupt corticogenesis and synaptic function (Hamada2018De). These findings highlight the gene's broad clinical significance across various diseases.

## Interactions
PHACTR1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and actin, playing a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein contains RPEL motifs that bind G-actin, which is crucial for its cytoplasmic localization in resting cells. Upon serum stimulation, Rho-actin signaling promotes the nuclear accumulation of PHACTR1, where it interacts with importin α-β. G-actin competes with importin α-β for binding to nuclear import signals associated with the RPEL motifs, influencing PHACTR1's subcellular localization (Wiezlak2012Gactin).

PHACTR1 also forms complexes with PP1, and this interaction is essential for its regulatory functions. The binding of PP1 and G-actin to PHACTR1 is competitive, particularly at the C-terminal region, which affects actomyosin assembly and stress fiber formation in cells (Wiezlak2012Gactin). Structural studies have shown that the RPEL domain of PHACTR1 forms a trivalent complex with G-actin, which is critical for actin binding cooperativity and the formation of higher-order actin structures (Mouilleron2012Structures).

In addition to its interactions with PP1 and actin, PHACTR1 is involved in the regulation of Slack (KCNT1) channels. It recruits PP1 to dephosphorylate the Slack channel, modulating its activity and influencing channel currents (Ali2019Phactr1).
