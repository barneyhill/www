# PSORS1C2

## Overview
The PSORS1C2 gene encodes a proline-rich protein known as psoriasis susceptibility 1 candidate 2, which is primarily involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cells in the epidermis. This protein is characterized by a high content of proline residues and is expressed mainly in the epidermis and, to a lesser extent, in the thymus. It plays a crucial role in skin barrier formation and maintenance, particularly in the granular layer of the epidermis and in cornifying epithelial cells of Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). The PSORS1C2 gene is part of a group of genes that share similar exon-intron organization and sequence similarities, underscoring its evolutionary significance in skin function (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). While variations in PSORS1C2 have been linked to an increased risk of psoriasis and other skin-related conditions, its precise role in these diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).

## Structure
The PSORS1C2 gene encodes a proline-rich protein, which is characterized by a high content of proline residues, particularly in exon 2. This proline-rich domain is similar to small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs), although PSORS1C2 is distinct from other SPRRs encoded by genes within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21.3 (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). The amino acid sequence of PSORS1C2 is highly conserved among various species, indicating its potential importance in biological functions (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).

The structural implications and biochemical functions of PSORS1C2 remain to be fully determined, and specific details about its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature. The protein is expressed primarily in the epidermis, particularly in the granular layer, and in cornifying epithelial cells of Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). While the protein has been referred to as small proline-rich protein 1 (SPR1), it is distinct from other SPR proteins, suggesting unique structural or functional properties (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete structural characteristics and post-translational modifications of PSORS1C2.

## Function
The PSORS1C2 gene encodes a proline-rich protein primarily involved in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. This gene is expressed mainly in the epidermis and to a lesser extent in the thymus. During the terminal differentiation of human keratinocytes, PSORS1C2 mRNA is significantly upregulated, indicating its crucial role in this process (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). Immunohistochemistry studies have shown that PSORS1C2 is exclusively expressed in the granular layer of the epidermis and in cornifying epithelial cells of Hassall's corpuscles in the thymus, suggesting its involvement in skin barrier formation and maintenance (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).

The gene is part of a group that includes CDSN and C6ORF15, which share similar exon-intron organization and sequence similarities, highlighting its evolutionary importance in skin function (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). The conservation of PSORS1C2 in land mammals and its loss in cetaceans suggest that its role in maintaining the skin barrier is particularly important in terrestrial environments, where it contributes to skin barrier function in dry conditions (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). Variations in PSORS1C2 have been linked to multiple myeloma risk and psoriasis, although its mutations are unlikely to predispose to psoriasis (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PSORS1C2 gene have been associated with several skin-related conditions and diseases. Variations in PSORS1C2 are linked to an increased risk of developing psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by rapid skin cell proliferation and immune system dysregulation (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). Although some studies suggest that mutations in PSORS1C2 may not directly predispose individuals to psoriasis, the gene's location within the psoriasis susceptibility locus 1 (PSORS1) on chromosome 6p21.33 indicates its potential involvement in the disease (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).

In humans, deletions of PSORS1C2, along with other genes, have been associated with generalized peeling skin disease. However, the specific role of PSORS1C2 in this condition is not entirely clear due to the overshadowing effects of the deletion of the CDSN gene, which is also located in the same region (Abbas2017Phylogenetic). The gene's expression in terminally differentiated keratinocytes and its potential link to T cell differentiation in the thymus suggest that it may play a role in skin and immune system homeostasis, although this requires further investigation (Abbas2017Phylogenetic).
