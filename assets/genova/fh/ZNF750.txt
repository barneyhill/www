# ZNF750

## Overview
ZNF750 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 750, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation. The protein is characterized by a unique zinc finger domain, known as the Z* domain, which adopts a CCHC motif and is crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities. ZNF750 plays a pivotal role in promoting terminal differentiation of the epidermis by regulating the expression of key differentiation genes, such as KLF4. It is a target of the transcription factor p63, linking it to the broader network of epidermal differentiation. The protein's interactions with chromatin regulators and other transcription factors underscore its importance in maintaining skin homeostasis. Clinically, mutations and altered expression of ZNF750 are associated with skin disorders and various cancers, where it functions as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation is linked to poor prognosis in malignancies such as breast cancer and melanoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Du2020ZNF750; Cassandri2020ZNF750; Sen2012ZNF750).

## Structure
ZNF750 is a transcription factor characterized by a unique zinc finger domain, referred to as the Z* domain. This domain deviates from the classical CCHH zinc finger motif, instead adopting a CCHC motif where the final histidine is replaced by a cysteine. Despite this deviation, the Z* domain forms a stable antiparallel beta-beta-alpha (bba) tertiary structure, which is typical of zinc finger domains. This structure is highly stable, with a melting point above 80°C, and exhibits a strong affinity for zinc ions, with a binding affinity (Kd) of 4 x 10^-12 M (Rua2023NMR).

The Z* domain's structure is similar to classical zinc finger proteins, featuring a hydrophobic core and specific DNA-binding residues, including E36, H39, and N42. The domain is involved in DNA binding, although it may also participate in protein-protein interactions (Rua2023NMR). The ZNF750 protein contains a C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS), crucial for its nuclear localization, and lacks nuclear export signals, indicating its primary localization within the nucleus (Cohen2012ZNF750). The protein's role in epidermal differentiation and its involvement in various cancers highlight its functional significance (Cohen2012ZNF750; Cassandri2020ZNF750).

## Function
ZNF750 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in promoting terminal epidermal differentiation in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the regulation of late differentiation genes, essential for the proper development and function of the skin barrier. ZNF750 functions by inducing the expression of KLF4, another transcription factor crucial for late epidermal differentiation. It binds to multiple sites flanking the KLF4 transcription start site, facilitating the activation of KLF4 during the differentiation process (Sen2012ZNF750).

ZNF750 is a target gene of the transcription factor p63, which is necessary for its induction during epidermal differentiation. The DNp63 isoform binds to the ZNF750 promoter, activating its expression and linking p63 to the terminal differentiation program through KLF4 (Sen2012ZNF750). ZNF750 is expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, with its expression peaking in the granular layer, where it regulates genes involved in skin barrier formation, such as FLG, LOR, and DSG1 (Cohen2012ZNF750).

In the nucleus, ZNF750 influences chromatin remodeling and gene expression, contributing to skin homeostasis. Mutations in ZNF750 can lead to skin disorders characterized by abnormal differentiation, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy skin (Cohen2012ZNF750; Sen2012ZNF750).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZNF750 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of skin disorders, mutations in ZNF750 are linked to abnormal terminal epidermal differentiation and cutaneous inflammation. Specific mutations, such as a frameshift mutation, have been associated with seborrheic dermatitis-like and psoriasiform conditions, as well as a dominant generalized skin disease due to haploinsufficiency (Yang2008A; Sen2012ZNF750). Another mutation, c.À625A4C, in the promoter region of ZNF750, has been linked to familial psoriasis, resulting in decreased promoter activity and reduced gene expression (Yang2008A).

In cancer, ZNF750 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with various malignancies. In breast cancer, low ZNF750 expression correlates with shorter relapse-free survival and increased cell migration and invasion, suggesting its role in metastasis suppression (Butera2020The; Cassandri2020ZNF750). In melanoma, decreased ZNF750 expression is linked to larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Du2020ZNF750). ZNF750's role in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis has also been observed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Bi2020Decreased).

## Interactions
ZNF750 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in epidermal differentiation through its interactions with various proteins and DNA. It binds to a specific DNA motif, 5'-CCNNAGGC-3', and interacts with several chromatin regulators and transcription factors, including KLF4, RCOR1, KDM1A, and CTBP1/2 (Boxer2014ZNF750; Rua2023NMR). These interactions are crucial for ZNF750's function in repressing progenitor genes and activating differentiation genes. 

ZNF750 forms complexes with KLF4 to activate differentiation genes, while its interaction with KDM1A is essential for repressing progenitor genes (Boxer2014ZNF750). The protein also recruits RCOR1 and CTBP1/2 to genomic sites, facilitating both activation and repression of target genes (Boxer2014ZNF750). The interactions with these proteins are mediated by conserved PLNLS motifs in ZNF750, which are critical for its protein-protein interactions and DNA binding (Boxer2014ZNF750).

Mutations in ZNF750, particularly in the C2H2 and PLNLS motifs, disrupt its ability to bind to interacting proteins and target genes, impairing its regulatory functions (Boxer2014ZNF750). These interactions highlight ZNF750's role in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases like psoriasis and certain cancers (Boxer2014ZNF750).
