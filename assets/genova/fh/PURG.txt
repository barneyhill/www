# PURG

## Overview
The PURG gene encodes the purine-rich element binding protein G, which is a member of the purine-rich element binding protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of DNA replication and transcription, playing a crucial role in cellular processes by binding to purine-rich sequences in DNA. The PURG protein is categorized as a DNA-binding protein, and its function is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression. Although the specific mechanisms of PURG are not fully understood, it is believed to interact with other proteins and participate in various signaling pathways, potentially influencing cellular responses to environmental stimuli (Qiu2020aarFDC).
