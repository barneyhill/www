# MT1HL1

## Overview
MT1HL1 is a gene that encodes the protein metallothionein 1H like 1, which is part of the metallothionein family known for their role in metal ion binding and detoxification. Metallothioneins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that play a crucial role in metal homeostasis and protection against metal toxicity and oxidative stress. The MT1HL1 gene is of particular interest due to its involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its potential response to environmental stimuli such as heavy metals. While the specific functions of the MT1HL1-encoded protein in various biological processes are not fully elucidated, its expression patterns suggest a significant role in cellular responses to metal exposure and oxidative stress (Zhang2021Integrative; Haynes2020Integrated).

## Clinical Significance
MT1HL1 has been identified as part of an underappreciated SLE MetaSignature in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This MetaSignature includes genes that are not significantly differentially expressed in response to interferon stimulation or in neutrophils, unlike most SLE MetaSignature genes. The expression of MT1HL1 is significantly elevated in human cell lines exposed to heavy metals such as cadmium and zinc, suggesting a potential link between SLE and exposure to heavy metals or other environmental stimuli that induce oxidative stress. The underappreciated SLE MetaScore, which includes MT1HL1, shows a stronger correlation with disease activity measurements than the interferon SLE MetaScore in blood-derived datasets, indicating its potential clinical significance in understanding SLE mechanisms (Haynes2020Integrated).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MT1HL1 is mentioned in gene-gene interaction networks with other metallothionein family members. However, the specific clinical significance of MT1HL1 in HCC is not detailed, as the focus is primarily on MT1H and its interactions within the metallothionein family (Zhang2021Integrative). The role of MT1HL1 in other diseases or conditions remains less explored in the available literature.
