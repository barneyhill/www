# TMEM117

## Overview
TMEM117 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 117, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving mitochondrial function and gene regulation. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM117 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, influencing mitochondrial biogenesis, and regulating oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and function (Yang2023Transmembrane; Maruyama2023Effects). Additionally, TMEM117 interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), affecting histone modification and gene expression, thereby playing a role in epigenetic regulation (Liao2021A). The gene's involvement in these pathways has implications for various health conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and susceptibility to infectious diseases (Liu2022The; Lai2022Identification; Yang2023Transmembrane).

## Function
TMEM117 is a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in maintaining mitochondrial function and regulating gene expression. In healthy human cells, TMEM117 plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), which is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. It influences the expression of genes such as SIRT1, NRF1, TFAM, UCP2, MFN2, and Sig1R, which are associated with mitochondrial function and biogenesis (Maruyama2023Effects).

TMEM117 is also involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). It binds to components of PRC2, such as EZH2 and SUZ12, and influences histone modification, specifically H3K27me3. This interaction affects the expression of downstream genes like TSLP, indicating a role in epigenetic regulation (Liao2021A).

In the context of cardiac function, TMEM117 is implicated in modulating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its activity affects mitochondrial integrity and function, suggesting a protective role against stress-induced cellular damage (Yang2023Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM117 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In the context of cardiac health, TMEM117 is significantly upregulated in angiotensin-II (Ang-II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Its overexpression exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy, while its deficiency provides protective effects against hypertrophic stimuli, suggesting that TMEM117 plays a critical role in modulating cardiac hypertrophy (Yang2023Transmembrane).

In cancer, TMEM117 interacts with the EZH2 protein, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), affecting histone methylation and gene expression. This interaction is associated with the prognosis of cervical cancer, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Liao2021A). TMEM117 is also identified as a key gene in melanoma prognosis, where it is associated with immune cell infiltration and survival outcomes (Liu2022The).

Additionally, TMEM117 has been linked to Alzheimer's disease through its involvement in endoplasmic reticulum stress-related pathways, which are crucial in the disease's progression (Lai2022Identification). It is also associated with susceptibility to rubella, as alterations in its expression may influence disease susceptibility (Zhu2023Using).

## Interactions
TMEM117, a protein-coding gene, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the EZH2 protein, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This interaction is facilitated by a specific RNA recognition motif, YCAGCYTCC, which is crucial for the binding of TMEM117 RNA to EZH2. Mutation of this motif significantly decreases the interaction, highlighting its importance (Liao2021A). TMEM117 is also involved in regulating the expression of the TSLP gene through EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 modification. Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells showed that silencing TMEM117 led to increased TSLP expression, dependent on the presence of EZH2 (Liao2021A).

In the context of cancer, TMEM117 is associated with the ER stress-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug, reduces TMEM117 expression, leading to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and affecting mitochondrial function. This reduction in TMEM117 expression is linked to decreased expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), both involved in mitochondrial function and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Maruyama2023Effects).
