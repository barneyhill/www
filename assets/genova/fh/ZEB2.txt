# ZEB2

## Overview
ZEB2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and neural development. The ZEB2 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding, and several other domains that enable protein-protein interactions and transcriptional repression. It plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in processes such as gastrulation and neural crest migration, by regulating gene expression through interactions with corepressors and chromatin-modifying complexes. Mutations in the ZEB2 gene are associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a genetic disorder with multiple congenital anomalies, while dysregulation of ZEB2 expression is implicated in cancer progression due to its role in promoting EMT and metastasis (Fardi2019The; Garavelli2009Mowat–Wilson; Ghoumid2013ZEB2).

## Structure
The ZEB2 protein, encoded by the ZEB2 gene, is a transcription factor characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in gene regulation. The protein contains two zinc finger clusters located at the N-terminus (N-ZF) and C-terminus (C-ZF), which are crucial for DNA binding through CACCT(G) sequences. Each zinc finger cluster comprises three domains with a C2H2 motif, essential for specific DNA interaction (Ghoumid2013ZEB2). The C2H2 motif consists of two cysteine and two histidine residues arranged around a zinc ion, forming a tetrahedral structure (Ghoumid2013ZEB2).

ZEB2 also includes a SMAD-binding domain (SBD), a homeodomain (HD), and a CtBP-interacting domain (CID), which are involved in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional repression (St.2024Mowat–Wilson; Ghoumid2013ZEB2). The protein's structure is predicted to have flexible regions with well-structured zinc finger domains, as shown by AlphaFold2 predictions (St.2024Mowat–Wilson).

Mutations in the zinc finger domains, such as p.His1045Arg, p.Tyr1055Cys, and p.Ser1071Pro, can disrupt the protein's ability to bind DNA and affect its transcriptional activity (Ghoumid2013ZEB2). These mutations lead to structural changes that impact the protein's stability and function (Ghoumid2013ZEB2). The ZEB2 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Ghoumid2013ZEB2).

## Function
ZEB2, also known as zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process where epithelial cells transform into mesenchymal cells, gaining mobility and invasive capabilities. This transition is crucial for embryonic development, including processes like gastrulation and neural crest migration (Gheldof2012Evolutionary; Katoh2009Integrative).

ZEB2 functions as a transcriptional repressor by binding to E-box sequences in DNA, influencing the expression of genes such as E-cadherin, which is essential for maintaining epithelial cell integrity. This repression is mediated through interactions with corepressors like CtBP and the NuRD complex, which recruit histone-modifying enzymes to alter chromatin structure (Fardi2019The; Gheldof2012Evolutionary).

In the context of neural development, ZEB2 is expressed in the neuroepithelium and is crucial for neural tube closure and the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells. It also plays a role in the development of the central nervous system, including myelinogenesis and gliogenesis (Gheldof2012Evolutionary; Fardi2019The). ZEB2's activity is regulated by various signaling pathways, including TGFβ/BMP, which modulate its expression and function in different tissues (Fardi2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZEB2 gene are primarily associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder. MWS is characterized by moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, epilepsy, Hirschsprung disease, and various congenital anomalies, including heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and urogenital anomalies (Saunders2009Comprehensive; Garavelli2009Mowat–Wilson; St.2024Mowat–Wilson). The mutations leading to MWS are typically nonsense or frameshift mutations, with a significant number occurring in exon 8 of the ZEB2 gene (Saunders2009Comprehensive; St.2024Mowat–Wilson).

Alterations in ZEB2 expression are also implicated in cancer progression. ZEB2 is involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis and invasion. Overexpression of ZEB2 is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including gastric cancer and melanoma, due to its role in promoting EMT and metastasis (Fardi2019The; Birkhoff2021ZEB2). ZEB2 expression is regulated by several signaling pathways and transcription factors, and its dysregulation can lead to increased malignancy and poor clinical outcomes (Fardi2019The; Xie2022Significance). Additionally, ZEB2's interaction with miRNAs, particularly the miR-200 family, plays a role in modulating its expression and impacting cancer severity (Fardi2019The).

## Interactions
ZEB2, a transcription factor, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and development. It interacts with SMAD proteins, particularly SMAD1 and SMAD3, within the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway, acting as a critical regulator of gene expression during embryogenesis and organogenesis (Fardi2019The; St.2024Mowat–Wilson). ZEB2 also interacts with the transcription factor Sp1 to regulate the expression of integrin α5 and cadherin-11, which are crucial for EMT and cancer cell invasion (Nam2013ZEB2–Sp1; Nam2012ZEB2).

ZEB2 forms complexes with corepressors such as CtBPs, recruiting them to active transcription sites and leading to transcriptional repression through histone-modifying enzymes (Fardi2019The). It also interacts with the NuRD remodeling and deacetylase repressor complex, influencing Schwann cell differentiation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes (Fardi2019The). Additionally, ZEB2 binds to E-box sequences on the ETS1 promoter, regulating ETS1 expression and maintaining ZEB2-induced EMT, which is crucial for cancer progression (Yalim‐Camci2019ETS1). These interactions highlight ZEB2's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in complex cellular pathways.
