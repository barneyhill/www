# SCRN3

## Overview
Secernin 3 (SCRN3) is a gene that encodes the protein secernin-3, which is implicated in various biological processes, particularly within the nervous system. Secernin-3 is categorized as a hydrazine-sensitive protein and is involved in the regulation of inflammatory and nociceptive pathways. It has been identified as a non-monoamine oxidase (MAO) target of phenelzine, a compound used in the study of protein interactions, suggesting its potential role in the therapeutic effects of phenelzine beyond MAO inhibition (Bustin2023Phenelzinebased). The protein is also associated with thermal nociception and is regulated by transcription factors like RUNX1, which are responsive to inflammatory stimuli (Bustin2023Phenelzinebased). These characteristics highlight SCRN3's involvement in pain perception and its potential significance in neurological and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
Secernin-3 (SCRN3) is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the context of neurological functions and pain perception. The protein has been identified as a target of phenelzine-based probes, which are used to study protein interactions in vivo. These probes have revealed that SCRN3 is a non-monoamine oxidase (MAO) target of phenelzine, reacting covalently via its conserved cysteine-derived N-terminal Glox group. This interaction suggests that SCRN3 may play a role in the therapeutic effects of phenelzine, independent of MAO inhibition (Bustin2023Phenelzinebased).

SCRN3 has been shown to be involved in thermal nociception, a process related to the perception of temperature-induced pain. The protein's expression is regulated by transcription factors responsive to inflammatory stimuli, such as RUNX1, which is associated with thermal and neuropathic pain. This indicates that SCRN3 may participate in inflammatory pain pathways and nociceptive processing (Bustin2023Phenelzinebased).

Additionally, SCRN3 has been identified as a hydrazine-sensitive protein in the brain, regulated by pro-inflammatory response pathways. This suggests potential interactions with other proteins involved in these pathways, although specific protein partners have not been detailed (Bustin2023Phenelzinebased).
