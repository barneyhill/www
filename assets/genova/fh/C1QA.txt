# C1QA

## Overview
The C1QA gene encodes the A chain of the complement component C1q, a key protein in the classical complement pathway of the immune system. The C1q protein is a complex glycoprotein that forms a hexameric structure, consisting of 18 polypeptide chains, including six A chains, which are crucial for its function. The C1q A chain is characterized by a collagen-like region and a globular domain, known as the gC1q module, which is involved in recognizing and binding to various ligands, including antibodies and pathogen surfaces. This binding initiates a cascade of immune responses, such as opsonization, inflammation, and cell lysis, thereby playing a vital role in host defense mechanisms (Reid2018Complement; Ghebrehiwet2018Is). Additionally, C1q is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and synaptic pruning in the central nervous system, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and neural plasticity (Kouser2015Emerging).

## Structure
The C1QA gene encodes the A chain of the complement component C1q, which is part of the classical complement pathway. The C1q protein is a hexameric structure composed of 18 polypeptide chains, including six A, six B, and six C chains, forming a bouquet-like shape (Reid2018Complement; Ghebrehiwet2018Is). Each chain consists of an N-terminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal globular domain known as the gC1q module (Ghai2007C1q; Bally2013Expression).

The primary structure of the C1q A chain includes a collagen-like sequence, which is crucial for its interaction with the C1r2-C1s2 complex. This interaction is facilitated by a conserved amino acid sequence, with lysine residues playing a critical role (Reid2018Complement). The secondary structure involves disulfide bonds linking the chains, forming a heterotrimeric collagen-like triple helix (Bally2013Expression).

The tertiary structure of C1q is characterized by the association of six trimers, resulting in a protein with a bouquet-like shape. The globular heads mediate ligand recognition, while the collagen-like regions interact with the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer (Bally2013Expression). The gC1q domain exhibits a jelly-roll topology, consisting of a 10-stranded beta-sandwich fold, which is highly conserved and similar to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Ghai2007C1q).

Post-translational modifications of the C1q A chain include hydroxylation and glycosylation, which are essential for its structural integrity and function (Bally2013Expression).

## Function
The C1QA gene encodes the A-chain of the complement component C1q, a crucial part of the classical complement pathway. C1q is a complex glycoprotein composed of 18 polypeptide chains, forming a hexameric structure with six globular heads and collagen-like stalks. It plays a significant role in the immune system by binding to antibodies and pathogen surfaces, initiating a cascade that leads to opsonization, inflammation, and cell lysis (Ghebrehiwet2012The; Sellar1991Characterization).

C1q is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, which is essential for preventing autoimmunity. It recognizes early apoptotic molecules like phosphatidylserine and facilitates their rapid phagocytosis, maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Kouser2015Emerging). The globular head region of C1q, known as the gC1q domain, is crucial for recognizing a wide range of molecular patterns, including both self and non-self antigens, and is structurally similar to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (Ghebrehiwet2018Is; Kishore2004C1q).

C1q also plays a role in synaptic pruning in the central nervous system, tagging synapses for removal by microglia, which is vital for maintaining neural plasticity and proper CNS function (Kouser2015Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C1QA gene, which encodes a component of the complement system, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus-like diseases. C1q deficiency, resulting from mutations in C1QA, is strongly linked to a high risk of developing SLE, with approximately 90% of individuals with this deficiency experiencing SLE or SLE-like symptoms (Demirkaya2020New; Batu2018Monogenic). Clinical manifestations in C1q-deficient patients often include cutaneous disorders, renal involvement, and neurological symptoms, with a notable absence of anti-dsDNA antibodies and normal levels of C3 and C4 (Batu2018Whole).

C1QA mutations can also lead to recurrent bacterial infections due to impaired immune function (Lintner2016Early). The deficiency in C1q affects the clearance of apoptotic cells and immune complexes, contributing to the development of autoimmunity (Demirkaya2020New). Additionally, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in C1QA have been linked to lupus nephritis, a severe kidney inflammation associated with SLE (Song2020An). These genetic alterations highlight the critical role of C1QA in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
The C1QA gene encodes the A chain of the C1q protein, which is a crucial component of the classical complement pathway. C1q interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in immune functions. C1qA, a subcomponent of C1q, binds to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) through its collagen-like region, specifically within residues 14-26, which contain an arginine-rich motif. This interaction is primarily driven by electrostatic forces (Chikazawa2016Identification).

C1q also interacts with β-amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease, apoptotic cells, and viral proteins such as the gp41 peptide of HIV-1 and the gp21 peptide of HTLV-I. These interactions occur through the globular head regions of C1q, particularly the gC1q domain, which is involved in binding to apoptotic cells and viral peptides (Kishore2003Modular).

The matrix protein (M1) of the influenza A virus interacts with the globular region of C1qA, blocking the classical complement pathway and inhibiting hemolysis. This interaction helps the virus evade the host's immune system (Zhang2009Influenza). C1q also binds to C-reactive protein (CRP) and IgG1, with interactions involving specific residues and structural complementarity (Gaboriaud2003The).
