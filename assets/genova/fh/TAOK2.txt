# TAOK2

## Overview
TAOK2 (TAO kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, neuronal development, and immune responses. The protein product, TAO kinase 2, exists in two isoforms, TAOK2α and TAOK2β, each with distinct structural and functional characteristics. TAOK2α is primarily associated with microtubule dynamics, playing a crucial role in neuronal migration and cortical development, while TAOK2β is involved in regulating protein synthesis by interacting with the translational machinery (Richter2018Altered; Scharrenberg2022TAOK2). The TAOK2 gene is located in the 16p11.2 genomic region, a locus linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Henis2022Direct; Scharrenberg2022TAOK2). Additionally, TAOK2 is implicated in antiviral immunity, interacting with double-stranded RNA and modulating immune responses (Pennemann2021Crossspecies).

## Structure
TAOK2 (TAO kinase 2) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with two isoforms, TAOK2α and TAOK2β, each characterized by distinct structural features and phosphorylation sites. TAOK2α contains two phosphorylation sites at serine 181 and threonine 475, along with a caspase-9 cleavage site. In contrast, TAOK2β has three phosphorylation sites (Richter2018Altered). The protein's domains include a red-colored kinase domain, a black MEK binding domain, and regulatory domains that are blue for TAOK2α and light blue for TAOK2β (Richter2018Altered).

TAOK2α is associated with microtubules and plays a significant role in tethering them to the endoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for microtubule dynamics and stability during neuronal migration (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2). This isoform colocalizes with acetylated tubulin, a marker of stable microtubules, while TAOK2β is found adjacent to microtubules and present in dendritic filopodia (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are critical for TAOK2's function, affecting its kinase activity and cellular localization. Mutations in TAOK2 can lead to altered phosphorylation and kinase activity, impacting neurodevelopmental processes and synaptic connectivity (Richter2018Altered).

## Function
TAOK2 (TAO kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating protein synthesis, particularly during the translation elongation phase. In healthy human cells, TAOK2β interacts with the translational machinery and phosphorylates the elongation factor eEF2 at the Thr56 residue. This phosphorylation event inhibits eEF2 activity, leading to decreased protein synthesis by reducing the rate of translational elongation (Henis2022Direct). TAOK2 is located in the 16p11.2 genomic region, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Henis2022Direct).

TAOK2 is also involved in the regulation of synapse formation and neuronal morphology. It plays a crucial role in dendrite and synaptic development, affecting dendritic complexity and spine formation, which are essential for proper neuronal connectivity and function (Richter2018Altered). In the context of neurodevelopment, TAOK2 is important for maintaining normal brain morphology and function, influencing processes such as neuronal migration and cortical development (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2).

In addition to its role in protein synthesis and neuronal development, TAOK2 is involved in antiviral immunity. It interacts with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, enhancing its kinase activity and playing a role in modulating immune responses (Pennemann2021Crossspecies).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAOK2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. The TAOK2 gene is located within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, a hotspot for recurrent microdeletions and microduplications linked to these conditions (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2). Mutations in TAOK2, especially those affecting the TAOK2α isoform, disrupt neuronal migration by altering microtubule dynamics and JNK1 phosphorylation, leading to cortical development abnormalities such as reduced cortex thickness and improper cortical layering (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2).

TAOK2 mutations can lead to changes in brain morphology, including increased brain volume and altered brain regions, which are associated with ASD (Richter2018Altered). Specific mutations, such as the A135P and P1022* mutations, affect dendritic spine distribution and morphology, contributing to cognitive and social interaction deficits observed in ASD (Richter2018Altered). These mutations also impact the RhoA signaling pathway, which is crucial for spine function and neuronal connectivity (Richter2018Altered).

The TAOK2 gene's role in neurodevelopmental disorders underscores its significance as a potential therapeutic target, with research indicating that restoring normal TAOK2 function can ameliorate some of the associated developmental deficits (Scharrenberg2022TAOK2).

## Interactions
TAOK2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in antiviral immunity and cellular processes. It directly binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), particularly poly(I:C), which enhances its kinase activity and suggests a role in antiviral responses (Pennemann2021Crossspecies). TAOK2 also interacts with TRIM4, a ubiquitin ligase that enhances RIG-I-dependent innate immune responses, indicating its involvement in the regulation of innate immunity (Pennemann2021Crossspecies). This interaction is more stable under poly(I:C) stimulation, highlighting its role in type-I interferon induction (Pennemann2021Crossspecies).

TAOK2 is involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as MKK3 to activate p38 MAPK, linking environmental stimuli to cellular stress responses (Fang2020The). It also interacts with cytoskeletal components, binding directly to microtubules and stabilizing them, which is crucial for spindle positioning and mitotic processes (Fang2020The). In neurons, TAOK2 modulates synapse development and neurodevelopmental processes through interactions with proteins like Septin7 and PSD95, and it regulates the RhoA signaling pathway (Richter2018Altered; Fang2020The).
