# IGLL1

## Overview
The IGLL1 gene encodes the immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 1, a critical component of the immune system involved in early B-cell development. This protein is a part of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, which is essential for the maturation and differentiation of B cells. The pre-BCR complex, including IGLL1, plays a pivotal role in signaling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of pre-B cells, facilitating the transition from pro-B cells to pre-B cells (Conley2000Defects; Della2021Molecular). IGLL1 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it aids in the proper folding and assembly of the pre-BCR complex before it is transported to the cell surface (BURROWS2004The). Mutations in IGLL1 can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, such as agammaglobulinemia, due to impaired B-cell development and a lack of functional antibodies (Naiboğlu2024Single). Additionally, IGLL1 has been implicated in pediatric cancers, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where its expression levels may serve as a biomarker for prognosis (Standing2022Identification).

## Function
The IGLL1 gene encodes the immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 1, which is a crucial component of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex. This protein is involved in the early stages of B-cell development, particularly in the transition from pro-B cells to pre-B cells. The pre-BCR complex, which includes the surrogate light chain composed of IGLL1 (λ5) and VpreB, is essential for signaling processes that promote B-cell maturation and differentiation (Conley2000Defects; Della2021Molecular).

IGLL1 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in the proper folding and assembly of the pre-BCR complex. This complex is then transported to the cell surface, where it plays a critical role in signaling pathways that drive the proliferation and survival of pre-B cells (BURROWS2004The). The presence of the pre-BCR on the cell surface is necessary for the clonal expansion of B cells and the downregulation of recombination-activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2, which are involved in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (BURROWS2004The).

Mutations in IGLL1 can lead to severe immunodeficiencies, such as agammaglobulinemia, due to impaired B-cell development and a lack of functional antibodies (Naiboğlu2024Single).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IGLL1 gene are associated with primary immunodeficiency diseases, particularly affecting B-lymphocyte development. Homozygous mutations in IGLL1 can lead to immunodeficiency, as demonstrated in a study where two sisters with such mutations exhibited issues in B-cell development, while their heterozygous parents were healthy carriers (Moens2014Diagnostics). This gene is crucial for the formation of the pre-B-cell receptor, and its dysfunction can result in conditions like agammaglobulinemia, characterized by absent peripheral B cells and low immunoglobulin levels, leading to recurrent infections (BenAli2019Genetic; Della2021Molecular).

In pediatric cancers, IGLL1 has been identified as differentially expressed, particularly in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where it is upregulated. This upregulation is linked to decreased survival rates in pediatric cancer patients, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Standing2022Identification). The gene's involvement in B-cell receptor regulation and signaling pathways indicates its significance in both immunodeficiency and cancer contexts, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications (Standing2022Identification).

## Interactions
IGLL1, also known as immunoglobulin lambda-like polypeptide 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the immune system. In the context of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) caused by P. lutzii, IGLL1 has been identified as part of a strong interaction network with other immunoglobulin components, such as the Ig gamma-2-chain C region (IGLL5) and the Ig heavy-chain VIII TIL. These interactions suggest a role in the immune response against infections (Sylvestre2018Serological).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, IGLL1 is a target of the transcription factor Ikaros, which binds to its promoter region. Ikaros recruits the NuRD-associated chromatin remodeler CHD4 to the Igll1 promoter, facilitating nucleosome invasion and RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) eviction, which are essential for transcriptional repression. This interaction is part of a complex regulatory mechanism involving other factors such as EBF1 and BRG1, which compete or cooperate with Ikaros to modulate IGLL1 expression (Liang2017A). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of IGLL1 in both immune function and gene regulation.
