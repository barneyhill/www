# PRAMEF27

## Overview
PRAMEF27 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 27, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) family. This family of proteins is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and immune response modulation. PRAME family member 27 is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which is typically expressed in a restricted manner in normal tissues but is upregulated in certain cancers. The expression pattern of PRAMEF27 suggests its potential involvement in oncogenic processes, making it a subject of interest in cancer research and a potential target for immunotherapy (Qiu2020aarFDC).
