# MRPS35

## Overview
The MRPS35 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S35, which is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins necessary for cellular energy production and metabolism (Cheong2020Expression). Unlike other ribosomal proteins, MRPS35 is characterized by its unique structural features, including the presence of a bRF-PH domain and distinctive helical domains, which suggest an evolutionary adaptation for a structural role within the mitochondrial ribosome (Burroughs2019The). Although enzymatically inactive, MRPS35 is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the mitoribosome complex, ensuring efficient mitochondrial translation (Baggio2021A). The protein's involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and its potential role in cancer-related processes highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Oviya2021Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The MRPS35 protein is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. It is characterized by the presence of a bRF-PH domain, which is a version found in eukaryotes, specifically within mitochondrial ribosomes. This domain lacks the GTPase-interacting and codon-recognition domains, similar to ICT1 and C12orf65 versions. However, MRPS35 has acquired two distinctive helical domains flanking the core bRF-PH domain (Burroughs2019The).

MRPS35 is enzymatically inactive due to the absence of the conserved glutamine in the catalytic loop, which is typically necessary for catalytic activity. Despite significant sequence divergence from other characterized bRF-PHs, the presence of the αi helical segment suggests that MRPS35 originated via duplication of ICT1, followed by the loss of the catalytic glutamine residue. This adaptation may have led to its recruitment for a structural role in the mitochondrial ribosome (Burroughs2019The).

In terms of quaternary structure, MRPS35 is part of the ribosomal protein complex, which is less accessible to degradation, potentially due to its association with RNA components that provide further protection from proteolysis (Baggio2021A). The protein's localization on the surface of the mitochondrial matrix in humans suggests its involvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Baggio2021A).

## Function
MRPS35 encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein that is part of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in cells (Cheong2020Expression). The mitochondrial ribosome, where MRPS35 is active, is specialized for translating hydrophobic and integral membrane proteins, distinct from bacterial and yeast ribosomes due to its high protein content and structural adaptations (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

MRPS35 is involved in the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, which are vital for cellular energy production and overall cellular metabolism. The protein's activity is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the mitoribosome complex, ensuring efficient mitochondrial translation and energy homeostasis (Cheong2020Expression). The lack of functional redundancy among mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, including MRPS35, suggests that each has a unique and essential role in mitochondrial translation, impacting cellular viability and energy production (Cheong2020Expression). Mutations or alterations in MRPS genes can lead to mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, highlighting their importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS35 has been implicated in various cancers, with altered expression levels observed in different types. It is specifically noted in the context of testicular germ cell tumors, where its expression may serve as a prognostic marker (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The gene's expression changes are part of a broader pattern of mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (MRPS) genes showing aberrant expression in cancers, which can correlate with clinicopathological features such as subtype, stage, grade, invasion, and metastasis (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). 

MRPS35 is also involved in cellular responses to cytotoxic drugs, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer treatment outcomes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). While specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from MRPS35 mutations are not detailed, its role in mitochondrial function implies that alterations could contribute to mitochondrial disorders. The gene's involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis and translation is noted, with upregulation observed in breast cancer cells, indicating a possible role in tumorigenic processes (Oviya2021Mitochondrial). Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of MRPS35 alterations in human diseases.

## Interactions
MRPS35 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit and plays a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins to form the ribosomal complex. Specifically, MRPS35 is involved in interactions with proteins such as MRPS29, which is crucial for forming mitochondria-specific bridges between the small and large ribosomal subunits (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). 

Additionally, MRPS35 has been identified as one of the ribosomal proteins interacting with C4orf14, a protein involved in the biogenesis of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit. This interaction suggests a role for MRPS35 in mitochondrial protein synthesis and mtRNA metabolism (He2012Human). 

While the specific physical interactions of MRPS35 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in the mitochondrial ribosomal complex and interaction with C4orf14 indicates its participation in essential mitochondrial functions. The potential extraribosomal functions of MRPS35, such as its involvement in cellular responses to cytotoxic drugs and cancer-related processes, are also suggested, although specific interaction partners in these contexts are not detailed (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).
