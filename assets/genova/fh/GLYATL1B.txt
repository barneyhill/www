# GLYATL1B

## Overview
GLYATL1B is a gene that encodes the protein glycine-N-acyltransferase like 1B, which is involved in the metabolic process of conjugating acyl groups to glycine. This protein is categorized as an enzyme and is primarily active within the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in detoxification and energy metabolism. By facilitating the conversion of acyl-CoA to acyl-glycine, glycine-N-acyltransferase like 1B helps in the excretion of excess acyl groups, thus preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic substances and maintaining metabolic balance (Qiu2020aarFDC). The gene's function is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the regulation of metabolic pathways, underscoring its importance in maintaining overall cellular health.

## Function
GLYATL1B encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the conjugation of acyl groups to glycine, a process essential for detoxification and metabolism in human cells. This protein is active within the mitochondria, where it facilitates the conversion of acyl-CoA to acyl-glycine. This conversion is vital for the excretion of excess acyl groups, thereby maintaining metabolic balance and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic substances. By aiding in the excretion of these acyl groups, GLYATL1B contributes to the regulation of metabolic pathways and supports cellular homeostasis. The activity of GLYATL1B in the mitochondria underscores its importance in energy metabolism and detoxification processes, highlighting its role in maintaining the overall health and function of cells. The efficient functioning of this protein is critical for the organismal outcomes related to metabolic health, as it ensures the proper management of acyl groups, which are byproducts of various metabolic reactions.
