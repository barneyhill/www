# USP17L29

## Overview
USP17L29 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 29, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L29 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases due to its regulatory functions in protein turnover and signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
