# ABCA10

## Overview
ABCA10 is a gene that encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 10 (ABCA10) protein, which is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This family of proteins is involved in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, with ABCA10 specifically implicated in lipid transport and homeostasis. The ABCA10 protein is characterized by its two nucleotide-binding folds and two transmembrane domains, classifying it as a full-size ABC transporter. It is predominantly expressed in the heart, brain, and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting a role in cholesterol metabolism and related physiological processes. The expression of ABCA10 is regulated by cholesterol levels, indicating its involvement in macrophage lipid homeostasis. Despite its structural and functional similarities to other ABC transporters, the precise physiological role of ABCA10 in human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

## Structure
The ABCA10 gene encodes a 1543-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 176 kDa, classifying it as a full-size ABC transporter. The protein structure includes two nucleotide binding folds (NBFs) with conserved Walker A and B motifs. A signature sequence is present in the N-terminal NBF, but not in the C-terminal NBF (Wenzel2003ABCA10). ABCA10 is predicted to have two transmembrane domains, each consisting of six membrane-spanning segments (Wenzel2003ABCA10). The protein contains a PEST sequence downstream of the N-terminal transmembrane domain, which may be involved in its turnover rate through proteasomal degradation (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

Several splice variants of ABCA10 mRNA have been identified, resulting in different polypeptide structures. These include variants such as ABCA10D+82, which lacks 23 N-terminal amino acids, and ABCA10D)176, truncated at the N-terminal nucleotide binding fold due to exon 14 skipping (Wenzel2003ABCA10). The expression of ABCA10 is regulated by cholesterol levels, suggesting a role in macrophage lipid homeostasis (Wenzel2003ABCA10). The ABCA10 protein shows high homology with other ABCA6-like transporters, indicating it belongs to a distinct subclass within the ABC A-subfamily (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

## Function
The ABCA10 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically within the A subclass. These transporters are involved in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, including lipids. ABCA10 is a full-size ABC transporter characterized by two nucleotide-binding folds and two transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in lipid transport and homeostasis in macrophages (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

ABCA10 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in the heart, brain, and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting its involvement in cholesterol metabolism and related physiological processes (Wenzel2003ABCA10). The expression of ABCA10 is regulated by cholesterol levels, being suppressed when cholesterol is imported into macrophages and upregulated by cholesterol export. This indicates a role in macrophage lipid homeostasis, similar to other ABC A subclass transporters like ABCA1, which is known to facilitate phospholipid and cholesterol export (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

The presence of a PEST sequence in ABCA10 suggests a role in protein turnover via proteasomal degradation, potentially regulating the protein's activity and availability at the plasma membrane (Wenzel2003ABCA10). However, the specific function of ABCA10 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Wenzel2003ABCA10).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCA10 gene, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, has been implicated in breast cancer. Research indicates that ABCA10 expression is significantly downregulated in various subtypes of breast cancer, including luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, and HER2 subtypes, compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer prognosis and shorter overall survival in breast cancer patients (Chu2022Downregulation). The study by Chu et al. suggests that ABCA10 expression may be influenced by factors such as promoter methylation, copy number variation, and kinase activity, which are linked to immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Chu2022Downregulation).

Mutations in ABCA10 are positively associated with immune cell infiltration, including CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, across multiple immune databases, highlighting its role in modulating the immune microenvironment in breast cancer (Chu2022Downregulation). Genetic alterations in ABCA10, particularly copy number amplifications, are prevalent in breast cancer and are correlated with poor clinical outcomes (Chu2022Downregulation). These findings suggest that ABCA10 could serve as a potential target for precision treatment and as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis (Chu2022Downregulation).
