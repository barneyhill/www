# KBTBD13

## Overview
KBTBD13 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch repeat and BTB domain containing 13, which is a member of the BTB/Kelch protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain, both of which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The BTB domain facilitates the formation of a functional ubiquitin ligase complex by interacting with Cullin 3 (Cul3), playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation within cells (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins; Sambuughin2012KBTBD13). KBTBD13 is predominantly expressed in striated muscles, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it is involved in maintaining muscle structure and function. Mutations in KBTBD13 are associated with nemaline myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies, underscoring the gene's critical role in muscle health (Bouman2020CONGENITAL; Sambuughin2012KBTBD13).

## Structure
The KBTBD13 protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal BTB/POZ domain and a C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain. The BTB domain is a conserved protein-protein interaction motif that facilitates the formation of dimers and is crucial for the protein's interaction with Cullin 3 (Cul3) to form a functional ubiquitin ligase complex (Stogios2005SequenceandstructuralanalysisofBTBdomainproteins; Sambuughin2012KBTBD13). The Kelch domain consists of five Kelch repeats, which are involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and are implicated in various biological processes, including cytoskeleton modulation and myofibril assembly (Sambuughin2012KBTBD13).

The BTB domain of KBTBD13 is structurally similar to the Cul1 binding domain of Skp1, allowing it to act as a substrate adaptor for Cul3-RL, implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of KBTBD13-associated nemaline myopathy (Sambuughin2012KBTBD13). The protein's structure has not been experimentally determined, but homology modeling has been used to predict the structure of the BTB domain, revealing its role in dimerization and interaction with Cul3 (Garibaldi2018Corerod). The protein is highly conserved across vertebrates, indicating its evolutionary importance (Sambuughin2010Dominant).

## Function
The KBTBD13 gene encodes a muscle-specific protein that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system responsible for protein degradation and regulation within cells. This protein contains an N-terminal BTB domain and a C-terminal Kelch-repeat domain, both of which are involved in protein-protein interactions. The BTB domain functions as a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin 3 (Cul3) based RING ubiquitin ligases (Cul3-RLs), facilitating the targeting of specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (Sambuughin2012KBTBD13).

KBTBD13 is highly expressed in striated muscles, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, where it is involved in maintaining muscle structure and function. It interacts with Cul3 to form a functional ubiquitin ligase complex, which is essential for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Kang2019A; Sambuughin2012KBTBD13). This interaction is particularly important in muscle cells, where it may regulate the levels of specific proteins, preventing their accumulation and ensuring proper muscle function (Blondelle2020The).

Mutations in KBTBD13 are associated with nemaline myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies, highlighting the gene's critical role in muscle health (Sambuughin2012KBTBD13).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KBTBD13 gene are associated with nemaline myopathy type 6 (NEM6), a rare congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, and muscle slowness. This condition is linked to autosomal dominant mutations in KBTBD13, which result in improper interaction with thin filaments/actin, leading to impaired muscle relaxation kinetics (Bouman2020CONGENITAL). Specific missense mutations, such as c.742C>A (p.Arg248Ser), c.1170G>C (p.Lys390Asn), and c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Cys), have been identified in the KBTBD13 gene and are associated with nemaline myopathy with cores (Sambuughin2010Dominant). These mutations are located in conserved domains of Kelch repeats and are predicted to disrupt the molecule's beta-propeller blades (Sambuughin2010Dominant).

NEM6 is characterized by the presence of nemaline rods and core lesions in skeletal myofibers, with histopathologic markers such as ring-rods fibers, nuclear clumps, and protein aggregates (Bouman2020CONGENITAL). The KBTBD13 gene is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and some patients with the KBTBD13 R408C mutation have exhibited cardiac issues, including left ventricular dysfunction and rhythm disorders (Vissing2019O.14B3GNT4). Additionally, a novel homozygous change (p.Ala55Gly) in KBTBD13 has been reported in two siblings with motor neuropathy, indicating a potential role in hereditary motor neuropathies (Previtali2019Expanding).

## Interactions
KBTBD13 is known to interact with Cullin 3 (Cul3) to form a functional ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is mediated by the BTB domain of KBTBD13, which binds to the Cullin domain of Cul3. The complex also includes Rbx1, and together they promote substrate ubiquitination, a crucial process for protein degradation and regulation within the cell (Sambuughin2012KBTBD13).

KBTBD13 is part of the BTB/Kelch protein family, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions. These interactions are significant in muscle function and have been linked to the pathogenesis of nemaline myopathy, a muscle disorder. Mutations in KBTBD13 can lead to the accumulation of non-muscle α-actinins, such as ACTN1 and ACTN4, in muscle tissues, which is associated with muscle weakness and the formation of nemaline bodies (Blondelle2019Cullin3–dependent).

KBTBD13 may also interact with other cullin proteins, such as CUL1, CUL2, and CUL5, suggesting a broader role in intracellular signaling pathways, although specific details of these interactions are not fully elucidated (Lin2021Identification).
