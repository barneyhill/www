# ZNF69

## Overview
ZNF69 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 69, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. Zinc finger protein 69 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA binding and transcriptional regulation, due to its ability to interact with specific DNA sequences. The protein plays a role in modulating gene expression, which can impact numerous biological pathways and processes. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 69 is implicated in the regulation of genes that are crucial for cellular differentiation and development.
