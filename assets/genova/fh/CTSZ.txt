# CTSZ

## Overview
The CTSZ gene encodes cathepsin Z, a cysteine protease that is part of the papain-like protease family. This enzyme is characterized by its unique structural features, including a signal peptide, propeptide, and a mature enzyme with a papain-like fold, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Bonthron2000Characterization). Cathepsin Z functions primarily as an exopeptidase and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and cargo transport within the cell (Bonthron2000Characterization). It is widely expressed across different tissues and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it interacts with integrins to influence cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Akkari2014Distinct). The gene's expression and regulation are of significant interest due to its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2011Overexpression).

## Structure
Cathepsin Z (CTSZ) is a cysteine protease with unique structural features compared to other cathepsins. The primary structure of CTSZ includes a signal peptide and a propeptide, followed by the mature enzyme. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of CTSZ forms a typical papain-like fold, a common feature among proteases in this family, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bonthron2000Characterization).

CTSZ is known to be a widely expressed exopeptidase, and its biological function includes acting as a ligand for the ERGIC-53 lectin, which is involved in cargo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (Bonthron2000Characterization). Post-translational modifications of CTSZ may include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and activity. The genomic structure of CTSZ consists of six exons spanning 12 kb, and it is transcribed in a tail-to-tail orientation with the TH1 gene, with only 70 base pairs separating their polyadenylation sites (Bonthron2000Characterization). The allelic origin of CTSZ transcripts has been analyzed, demonstrating biallelic expression in all tissues examined (Bonthron2000Characterization).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CTSZ gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CTSZ is frequently upregulated, correlating with increased cell motility and poor prognosis. This upregulation is associated with the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis, and is linked to the degradation of extracellular matrix components, facilitating tumor cell migration (Wang2011Overexpression).

In pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), CTSZ expression is observed in both cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contributing to tumor invasion and growth. The RGD motif in CTSZ plays a significant role in these processes by engaging integrins and activating the FAK-Src signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and invasion (Akkari2014Distinct).

In breast cancer, CTSZ is associated with hypomethylation at specific CpG sites, which correlates with increased cancer risk and higher tumor stages. This hypomethylation is particularly significant in early-stage breast cancer and in patients with negative estrogen receptor status (Li2023The). These findings suggest that CTSZ plays a multifaceted role in cancer progression through both its expression levels and interactions with cellular pathways.

## Interactions
Cathepsin Z (CTSZ) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer progression. CTSZ interacts with integrins, specifically integrin β1 and β3, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling pathways such as the FAK-Src pathway. This interaction is significant for cancer cell invasion and proliferation, as CTSZ modulates these pathways through its RGD motif, a critical regulator of its proinvasive functions (Akkari2014Distinct).

CTSZ is secreted by cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages, and its presence on the cancer cell surface is enhanced by macrophage-derived CTSZ. This interaction with integrins on the cell surface supports cancer cell invasion by enhancing integrin-dependent invasion (Akkari2014Distinct). The RGD motif in CTSZ is essential for its binding to integrins, influencing the FAK-Src signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and invasion (Akkari2014Distinct).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CTSZ overexpression is associated with the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves interactions with extracellular matrix components and the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) like MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9, further facilitating tumor cell migration and invasion (Wang2011Overexpression).
