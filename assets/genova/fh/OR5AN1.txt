# OR5AN1

## Overview
The OR5AN1 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 5 subfamily AN member 1, a protein that belongs to the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for their role in signal transduction. OR5AN1 is specifically involved in the detection of musk odors, functioning as a chemosensory receptor in the olfactory epithelium. The protein's ability to bind a diverse range of musk-smelling compounds, such as macrocyclic ketones and nitromusks, underscores its significance in olfactory perception. The receptor's activity is mediated by specific amino acid residues that facilitate ligand binding and activation, contributing to the complex process of odor detection and neuronal signaling (Ahmed2018Molecular; Glezer2019Olfactory).

## Structure
The OR5AN1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. The primary structure of OR5AN1 consists of amino acid sequences that form the protein, with specific residues playing crucial roles in ligand binding. Key residues involved in the binding pocket include Tyr260, Phe105, Phe194, and Phe207, which participate in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with musk compounds (Ahmed2018Molecular).

The secondary structure of OR5AN1 includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, typical of GPCRs. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a functional receptor, with a binding site near the extracellular loop (ECL2) (Ahmed2018Molecular). The receptor's binding site is characterized by a combination of aromatic, polar, and nonpolar residues, contributing to its ability to stabilize odorants through specific interactions (Ahmed2018Molecular).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, affecting receptor function and localization, although specific modifications for OR5AN1 are not detailed in the provided context. The receptor functions as a monomer, as quaternary structure is generally not applicable to olfactory receptors (Ahmed2018Molecular).

## Function
The human gene OR5AN1 encodes an olfactory receptor that plays a crucial role in the perception of musk odors. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell (Ahmed2018Molecular). OR5AN1 is specifically responsive to a variety of musk-smelling compounds, including macrocyclic ketones, nitromusks, and some polycyclic musks. It is capable of binding to compounds such as C15 and C16 macrocyclic carbonyl compounds, racemic muscone, and civetone, highlighting its broad ligand tuning compared to other musk receptors like OR1A1 (Ahmed2018Molecular).

The receptor's function is mediated by specific amino acid residues that facilitate binding and activation. For instance, Tyr260 and Tyr279 are critical for the receptor's response to musks, with hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions playing key roles in ligand binding (Ahmed2018Molecular). OR5AN1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Glezer2019Olfactory). This receptor's activity is essential for the perception of musk odors, and its genetic variability can lead to differences in odorant perception among individuals (Glezer2019Olfactory).
