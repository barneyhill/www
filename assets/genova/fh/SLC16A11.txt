# SLC16A11

## Overview
SLC16A11 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 16 member 11 (MCT11), which is part of the monocarboxylate transporter family. These transporters are integral membrane proteins characterized by twelve transmembrane-spanning domains, facilitating the transport of monocarboxylates such as pyruvate and lactate across cell membranes (Halestrap2004The; Meredith2008The). MCT11 is predominantly expressed in the liver, particularly in the pericentral region, where it plays a vital role in maintaining energy homeostasis and regulating glucose and lipid metabolism (Ainbinder2021Mct11). Variants of the SLC16A11 gene have been implicated in increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, especially in populations with Native American ancestry, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders (Unknownauthors2013Sequence; Kimura2021The).

## Structure
The SLC16A11 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 16, which encodes monocarboxylate transporters. These transporters are characterized by a common structural feature of twelve transmembrane-spanning domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly (Halestrap2004The; Meredith2008The). This topology is typical among the SLC16 family members and is crucial for their function in transporting monocarboxylates across cell membranes (Halestrap2013The).

The primary structure of SLC16A11 consists of 471 amino acids, as predicted by computational models (Unknownauthors2013Sequence). While specific details about the secondary and tertiary structures of SLC16A11 are not provided, the general structure of the SLC16 family suggests a significant role for transmembrane domains in forming the transport channel (Halestrap2004The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the activity of these transporters, although specific modifications for SLC16A11 are not detailed in the available literature (Halestrap2013The). The protein's expression and subcellular localization have been studied using immunocytochemistry, indicating its presence in various human tissues (Unknownauthors2013Sequence).

## Function
The SLC16A11 gene encodes the monocarboxylate transporter MCT11, which plays a crucial role in hepatic glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. In healthy human cells, particularly in the liver, SLC16A11 is primarily expressed in the low oxygen pericentral region. MCT11 is involved in the transport of simple monocarboxylates, such as pyruvate and lactate, which are central to energy metabolism (Ainbinder2021Mct11). This transporter is essential for regulating lactate levels in hepatocytes, especially under pericentral oxygen tension, and helps maintain a balance in glucose and lipid metabolism, preventing the accumulation of intracellular lactate and triacylglycerols (TAGs) (Ainbinder2021Mct11).

SLC16A11's function is particularly significant under low oxygen conditions typical of the pericentral zone of the liver, where it facilitates the export of lactate and possibly other monocarboxylates, thus maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic function in hepatocytes (Ainbinder2021Mct11). Disruption of SLC16A11 expression, as seen in type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk variants, leads to altered glucose metabolism, increased intracellular lactate, and a shift towards TAG accumulation, which are associated with insulin resistance and T2D (Ainbinder2021Mct11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC16A11 gene have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly in populations with Native American ancestry. Variants in this gene are common risk factors for T2D in Mexican and Japanese populations, as evidenced by several studies. In Mexican populations, SLC16A11 variants have been linked to a higher prevalence of T2D, with significant differences observed between Mexican Americans and European Americans (Unknownauthors2013Sequence). In Japanese patients, a specific haplotype known as the 5SNP haplotype in the SLC16A11 gene is associated with altered lipid metabolism and increased T2D risk, affecting fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (Kimura2021The).

In Chilean populations, the rs75493593 polymorphism of SLC16A11 is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and insulin levels, suggesting a link to early metabolic alterations that could lead to T2D (Mardones2021Genetic). The gene's variants are also linked to increased insulin levels, although this association is not significant when adjusted for BMI, indicating a potential connection to nutritional state rather than direct insulin resistance (Mardones2021Genetic).

## Interactions
SLC16A11, a member of the solute carrier family 16, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are significant for its function in metabolic processes. One notable interaction is with Basigin (BSG), a protein that is dysregulated in Type 2 diabetes variants. This interaction was identified in a study that used AlphaFold-Multimer for structural prediction, focusing on heterodimeric complexes within the SLC16A family. The study highlighted that BSG was detected in a significant portion of samples and scored interactions with several SLC16A-family members, including SLC16A11 (Frommelt2024The).

The interaction between SLC16A11 and BSG is particularly relevant in the context of Type 2 diabetes, as BSG's dysregulation is associated with this condition. The study also modeled the structure of SLC-chaperone interactions, retrieving high-confidence structures for several heterodimers, including the SLC16A11-BSG complex. This interaction suggests a role for SLC16A11 in the regulation of metabolic pathways that are disrupted in diabetes (Frommelt2024The).

While the specific mechanisms of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated, the association with BSG indicates a potential pathway through which SLC16A11 may influence metabolic processes and disease states.
