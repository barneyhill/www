# SET

## Overview
The SET gene encodes the SET nuclear proto-oncogene protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, and cell cycle control. As a member of the nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family, the SET protein is characterized by its NAP domain and is involved in inhibiting Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key tumor suppressor, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and cellular signaling pathways (Daniel2011Analysis; Antonyan2022Putative). The protein's dynamic localization between the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitated by interactions with proteins such as Rac1, underscores its involvement in cell migration and genomic stability (Daniel2011Analysis). Clinically, the SET gene is significant due to its association with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where its upregulation is linked to poor prognosis and early recurrence (Nguyen2021Upregulation). The SET protein's role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, particularly through its interaction with the INHAT complex, further highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Switzer2011Targeting).

## Structure
The SET nuclear proto-oncogene encodes a protein that is part of the nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family, featuring a NAP domain flanked by an N-terminal region with regulatory phosphorylation sites and a C-terminal acidic region (Daniel2011Analysis). The primary structure of SET is rich in acidic residues, which is characteristic of its role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influences its function and localization. Specifically, phosphorylation at Serine 9 has been studied in relation to its interaction with the small GTPase Rac1, although this modification does not affect binding to Rac1's C-terminus (Daniel2011Analysis).

SET exists in two isoforms, SET A and SET B, which may have distinct functional roles (Daniel2011Analysis). The protein's interaction with other cellular components, such as Rac1, is crucial for its function in processes like cell migration and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (Daniel2011Analysis). The SET protein is also involved in inhibiting Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a tumor suppressor, through its interaction with other proteins like ANP32A (Antonyan2022Putative). These interactions highlight the importance of SET in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function
The SET nuclear proto-oncogene encodes a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SET functions primarily as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a key regulator of various cellular activities. This inhibition plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G2/M transition, by modulating cyclin B-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity (Switzer2011Targeting). SET is also involved in transcriptional activation, influencing the expression of genes such as P450c17, and plays a role in the initiation of neurosteroidogenesis (Switzer2011Targeting).

SET interacts with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which further regulates cyclin B-cdk1 activity, highlighting its involvement in cell cycle control (Switzer2011Targeting). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation through its association with the INHAT complex, affecting histone acetylation (Switzer2011Targeting). SET also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process influenced by its interaction with the small GTPase Rac1, which is crucial for cell migration and division (Daniel2011Analysis). This dynamic localization suggests SET's involvement in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cellular responses to environmental cues.

## Clinical Significance
The SET nuclear proto-oncogene is clinically significant due to its role in various diseases, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that upregulation of SET is associated with early recurrence and poorer prognosis in HCC patients. High SET expression correlates with shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival, making it a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of HCC (Nguyen2021Upregulation). The research indicates that SET expression is higher in HCC tissues compared to non-cancerous liver tissues, and its expression is significantly correlated with various immune cells, including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (Nguyen2021Upregulation).

SET's involvement in cancer is not limited to HCC. Alterations in SET expression or mutations can contribute to the development of other cancers by disrupting normal cell growth and apoptosis. The gene's role in chromatin remodeling and cell cycle regulation is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to oncogenesis. SET is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's due to its role in tau protein regulation, although this aspect is not covered in the provided context. Overall, SET's clinical significance is underscored by its potential as a multifunctional oncoprotein involved in various cellular processes (Nguyen2021Upregulation).

## Interactions
The SET nuclear proto-oncogene protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. SET interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, acting as a transcriptional corepressor. This interaction is regulated by the acetylation status of p53's C-terminal domain (CTD). In unstressed cells, SET binds to the unacetylated CTD of p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity. However, stress-induced acetylation of the CTD disrupts this interaction, allowing p53 to activate its target genes (Wang2016Acetylationregulated).

SET is also part of the INHAT complex, which inhibits histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity by binding to core histones and double-stranded DNA, thereby blocking histone acetylation. This interaction is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Antonyan2022Putative).

Additionally, SET interacts with Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), inhibiting its activity. This interaction is facilitated by SET's role as I2PP2A, and it can form a complex with ANP32A to further inhibit PP2A (Antonyan2022Putative). These interactions highlight SET's involvement in transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle control.
