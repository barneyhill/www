# SULT1C3

## Overview
SULT1C3 is a gene that encodes the protein sulfotransferase family 1C member 3, a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family. This family of enzymes is primarily involved in the sulfation of a wide range of substrates, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotic compounds, which is essential for their solubility and excretion (Dubaisi2019Developmental). The SULT1C3 protein is characterized by a Rossmann fold, a structural motif common to this enzyme family, and is known to form dimers through a specific dimer interface (Weitzner2009An; AllaliHassani2007Structural). SULT1C3 is predominantly expressed in the human intestine, where it plays a role in the metabolism of phenolic compounds, although its precise physiological function remains to be fully understood (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may influence its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression).

## Structure
The SULT1C3 protein is a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family, characterized by a common structural fold that includes a central four-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and loops (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The tertiary structure of SULT1C3, like other sulfotransferases, forms a Rossmann fold, which is typical for this enzyme family (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The binding site for the cofactor PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate) is highly conserved, with specific residues contributing to the binding pocket, and the binding of PAPS primes certain loops for substrate binding (AllaliHassani2007Structural).

SULT1C3 exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with notable variants being SULT1C3a and SULT1C3d. These isoforms differ in their exon composition, specifically exons 7 and 8, which are crucial for the PAPS binding domain and the substrate-binding pocket (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression). The structural differences between these isoforms affect the shape and charge distribution of the substrate-binding pocket, potentially altering enzymatic activity (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression). The SULT1C3 protein is known to form dimers, a common feature among cytosolic sulfotransferases, facilitated by a small dimer interface known as the KTVE motif (Weitzner2009An).

## Function
SULT1C3 is a member of the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family, which is involved in the sulfation of various substrates, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and xenobiotic compounds. This enzymatic process enhances the solubility and excretion of these compounds, playing a crucial role in detoxification and metabolism within human cells (Dubaisi2019Developmental). SULT1C3 is primarily expressed in the human intestine, specifically in the small and large intestines, and in LS180 human colorectal cells (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression). 

The enzyme is known to bind catecholamines and phenolic compounds, although only phenolic compounds serve as substrates, indicating a specific role in metabolizing these compounds in human cells (AllaliHassani2007Structural). The expression of SULT1C3 is regulated by nuclear signaling pathways, with certain transcription factor activators like ciprofibrate and rosiglitazone selectively increasing its mRNA levels in LS180 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Rondini2013Regulation). 

Despite its presence in the intestine, the specific function of SULT1C3 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated. However, its structural differences in the substrate-binding pocket suggest potential functional implications, particularly in the sulfation processes within the intestinal environment (DuniecDmuchowski2013Expression).
