# SLC26A9

## Overview
SLC26A9 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 9, which functions as a transmembrane anion transporter. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of chloride and bicarbonate ions across epithelial cell membranes, playing a critical role in maintaining ion balance and pH regulation in tissues such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Liu2018Physiological). Structurally, the SLC26A9 protein is characterized by a homodimeric organization with distinct transmembrane and cytosolic STAS domains, facilitating its function as an electrogenic chloride channel and Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (Chi2020Structural; Walter2019CryoEM). The protein's activity is modulated through interactions with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and is influenced by factors such as cell polarity and intracellular calcium levels (Chi2020Structural; Ousingsawat2012Differential). Variants in the SLC26A9 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including cystic fibrosis and related comorbidities, as well as other respiratory diseases, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Miller2015Variants; Gong2021Genetic).

## Structure
The SLC26A9 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 26 and functions as an anion transporter. Its molecular structure has been elucidated using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a homodimeric organization. Each protomer consists of a transmembrane (TM) domain and a cytosolic STAS domain. The TM domain adopts a '7 + 7' fold, similar to the UraA transporter, with segments TM1-TM7 and TM8-TM14 related by a pseudo-C2 symmetry axis. The core domain is formed by TM1-4 and TM8-11, while the gate domain is formed by TM5-7 and TM12-14 (Chi2020Structural; Walter2019CryoEM).

The STAS domain is crucial for dimerization and interacts with the transmembrane domain of the opposing subunit, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure. The N-terminal sequence forms antiparallel β-strand sheets, aiding in dimerization, while the C-terminal sequence acts as a gating modulator by inhibiting ion conduction (Chi2020Structural; Walter2019CryoEM).

Ion-binding sites within the structure include coordination sites for chloride and sodium ions, with specific residues involved in their stabilization. The protein's structure supports an alternate-access mechanism for ion transport, characterized by conformational changes that facilitate ion passage (Chi2020Structural; Walter2019CryoEM).

## Function
The SLC26A9 gene encodes a protein that functions as an anion transporter, primarily involved in chloride and bicarbonate ion transport across cell membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining ion balance and pH regulation in epithelial tissues, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (Liu2018Physiological). SLC26A9 is expressed abundantly in the lung and stomach epithelia, where it contributes to airway surface hydration and gastric acid production by mediating luminal electrogenic chloride transport (Walter2019CryoEM).

In healthy human cells, SLC26A9 acts as a chloride channel and a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger, facilitating chloride secretion and bicarbonate transport. This activity is essential for processes such as gastric lumen pH regulation and mucociliary clearance in the airways (Chi2020Structural; Liu2018Physiological). The protein's function is modulated by its interaction with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which can enhance or inhibit its activity depending on the cellular context (Liu2018Physiological; Ousingsawat2012Differential).

SLC26A9 is also involved in maintaining airway surface liquid homeostasis, which is crucial for mucus clearance, especially under pathophysiological conditions like allergic airway inflammation (Liu2018Physiological). Its role in chloride and bicarbonate transport is vital for maintaining acid-base homeostasis and fluid secretion in epithelial cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC26A9 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly those related to cystic fibrosis (CF). Variants in SLC26A9, such as rs7512462, have been associated with the severity of pancreatic disease in CF patients, influencing prenatal exocrine pancreatic damage and newborn screening immunoreactive trypsinogen levels (Miller2015Variants). This SNP is also linked to lung function in CF patients, especially in response to CFTR modulators like ivacaftor, suggesting its role in modulating disease severity and treatment response (Corvol2018SLC26A9; Gong2021Genetic).

SLC26A9 is also associated with other CF-related conditions, such as meconium ileus and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD), indicating its broader impact on CF comorbidities (Liu2018Physiological; Pereira2017Association). Beyond CF, SLC26A9 polymorphisms have been linked to increased risks of childhood asthma and diffuse idiopathic bronchiectasis, highlighting its role in respiratory diseases (Liu2018Physiological). The gene's involvement in chloride and bicarbonate transport suggests it may serve as a therapeutic target for CF and other obstructive lung diseases (Gong2021Genetic).

## Interactions
The SLC26A9 protein interacts with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), forming a complex that can modulate anion transport. This interaction is context-dependent, with SLC26A9 promoting chloride secretion in polarized cells, while CFTR activation inhibits chloride conductance in nonpolarized cells (Chi2020Structural; Liu2018Physiological). The regulatory effects of SLC26A9 on CFTR are influenced by cell polarity and background, highlighting the complexity of their interaction (Chi2020Structural).

SLC26A9 is also regulated by calmodulin, which binds to its intrinsically disordered regions, and intracellular calcium levels can inhibit SLC26A9-associated currents (Chi2020Structural). Posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation by with-no-lysine (WNK) kinases, can decrease SLC26A9's plasma membrane localization and channel activity (Chi2020Structural).

In the kidney, SLC26A9 is expressed in the medullary collecting duct cells, where it functions as a chloride channel, impacting renal salt excretion and blood pressure. Its interaction with CFTR in this context is significant, as it can enhance or inhibit CFTR-mediated anion secretion (Liu2018Physiological). These interactions suggest that SLC26A9 plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for related diseases.
