# SMARCA5

## Overview
SMARCA5 is a gene that encodes the protein SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5, commonly referred to as SNF2H. This protein is a member of the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers, which are crucial for the regulation of chromatin structure and function. SNF2H is characterized by its ATPase activity, which facilitates nucleosome sliding and chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing DNA replication, gene expression, and DNA damage response (Turkova2024Differential; Andrikopoulos2024The). The protein plays a significant role in hematopoiesis and interacts with various partners to regulate gene expression and maintain genomic stability (Dluhosova2014Epigenetic; Turkova2024Differential). Alterations in SMARCA5 expression are associated with several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in oncogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target (Thakur2022Chromatin; Shibayama2020Aberrant).

## Structure
The SMARCA5 protein is a member of the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers and is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains an ATP-binding pocket that coordinates a catalytic Mg2+ ion, essential for ATP hydrolysis, which is a critical aspect of its chromatin remodeling activity (Andrikopoulos2024The). The protein also includes a double-histidine (dHis) motif, which is involved in binding divalent metals such as Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ni2+ (Andrikopoulos2024The). This motif is formed by histidines at positions 656 and 660, separated by three amino acids, and is thought to create a potential chelating site for metal ions (Andrikopoulos2024The).

The secondary structure of SMARCA5 is predicted to be predominantly α-helical, as indicated by structural predictions from Phyre 2 and AlphaFold, which are considered analogous (Andrikopoulos2024The). The protein's tertiary structure includes a potential metal-binding site distinct from the Mg2+ coordination site, suggesting a complex topology that accommodates multiple functional interactions (Andrikopoulos2024The). The SMARCA5 protein is also involved in forming part of the nucleosome remodeling factor complex (NURF), indicating its role in higher-order chromatin structure (Jevtic2022SMARCA5).

## Function
The SMARCA5 gene encodes the SMARCA5/SNF2H ATPase, a critical component of ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes are essential for regulating DNA replication, gene expression, and DNA damage response. SMARCA5 is involved in nucleosome sliding, which affects chromatin accessibility and gene expression, playing a significant role in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (Turkova2024Differential). 

In hematopoiesis, SMARCA5 is crucial for the development of various blood cell lineages, including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis. It is particularly important during the transition stages of thymocyte and B cell development (Turkova2024Differential). SMARCA5 interacts with partners such as the BAZ family and Pole3, which are part of the CHRAC ISWI complex, essential for lymphoid differentiation (Turkova2024Differential).

SMARCA5 also plays a role in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with CTCF, an important epigenetic factor. It is required for CTCF's enhancer-blocking activity and is involved in the regulation of genes like Igf2 and H19, indicating its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling (Dluhosova2014Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMARCA5 gene are implicated in various cancers, including leukemia, breast, lung, and gastric cancers. Overexpression of SMARCA5 is common in these cancers and is associated with aberrant chromatin remodeling, impacting cancer development and progression (Thakur2022Chromatin). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), SMARCA5 is upregulated due to the overexpression of the (pro)renin receptor, contributing to genomic instability and tumor formation (Shibayama2020Aberrant).

The loss of SMARCA5 function can lead to significant cellular consequences, such as impaired DNA damage repair, genomic instability, and altered cell cycle regulation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, SMARCA5 knockout results in accelerated growth arrest and a senescent-like phenotype, indicating its crucial role in maintaining cellular fitness and preventing premature senescence (Thakur2022Chromatin). SMARCA5's involvement in DNA repair pathways is further highlighted by its impact on sensitivity to genotoxic insults, where its loss increases susceptibility to DNA damage (Thakur2022Chromatin).

CircSMARCA5, a circular RNA derived from the SMARCA5 gene, also plays a role in cancer. It acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, but promotes tumor growth in others, such as osteosarcoma and prostate cancer (Xue2022The).

## Interactions
SMARCA5, also known as SNF2H, is a chromatin remodeling ATPase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for DNA damage response and transcription regulation. It interacts with RNF168 in a poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARP)-dependent manner, which is essential for the recruitment of repair factors like BRCA1 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). This interaction is crucial for the RNF168-dependent ubiquitin signaling cascade, facilitating histone ubiquitylation and BRCA1 assembly at DSBs (Smeenk2012Poly(ADPribosyl)ation page 4 of 8; Smeenk2012Poly(ADPribosyl)ation page 5 of 8).

SMARCA5 also interacts with the NUP98-NSD1 oncofusion protein, a fusion associated with acute myeloid leukemia. This interaction is part of a co-dependent functional unit involving other proteins like BPTF and NUP188, which are implicated in cancer cell transcriptional regulation. SMARCA5 is a key component of nuclear condensates formed by NUP98-NSD1, and its functional activity is essential for maintaining the transformed phenotype in leukemia (Jevtic2022SMARCA5).

Additionally, SMARCA5 interacts with CTCF, a transcriptional repressor, to regulate gene expression. SMARCA5 is necessary for the recruitment of CTCF to DNA binding sites, and this interaction plays a role in transcriptional repression and epigenetic regulation (Dluhosova2014Epigenetic).
