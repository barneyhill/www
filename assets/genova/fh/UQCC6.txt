# UQCC6

## Overview
UQCC6 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 6, commonly referred to as BRAWNIN. This protein is categorized as a mitochondrial microprotein and is integral to the assembly of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which are vital for efficient mitochondrial respiration and energy production. BRAWNIN's role extends to the regulation of mitochondrial functions, particularly in neuronal development, where it is influenced by the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1. The gene's expression and the protein's function are crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and supporting neuronal structural integrity, highlighting its significance in both mitochondrial and neuronal health (Lanfranchi2024The).

## Function
UQCC6, also known as BRAWNIN, is a mitochondrial microprotein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of mitochondrial supercomplexes, which are essential for efficient mitochondrial respiration and energy production in healthy human cells (Lanfranchi2024The). This protein is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions, particularly in the context of neuronal development. It is regulated by the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1, which influences its expression levels. In conditions where NUAK1 is knocked out, BRAWNIN expression is significantly reduced, indicating its dependency on NUAK1 activity (Lanfranchi2024The).

BRAWNIN is also implicated in the process of axon branching in neurons. Functional experiments have shown that reducing BRAWNIN levels in mouse cortical neurons leads to a decrease in axon branching, particularly on the contralateral side, suggesting its role in conveying some of the axonal functions of NUAK1 (Lanfranchi2024The). This highlights the importance of UQCC6 in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on neuronal development processes. The protein's activity in the mitochondria underscores its significance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and supporting the structural and functional integrity of neurons.
