# PBOV1

## Overview
PBOV1, or Prostate and Breast Cancer Overexpressed 1, is a gene that encodes a human-specific protein implicated in various cancer-related processes. The PBOV1 protein, which emerged de novo during primate evolution, is characterized by its unique structure, consisting of 135 amino acids encoded by a single exon on chromosome 6. Despite its lack of significant homology to other proteins, PBOV1 is involved in critical cellular pathways, particularly in cancer progression. It interacts with key signaling molecules such as β-catenin, influencing pathways like Wnt/β-catenin, which are crucial for tumor development and metastasis. The protein's expression is notably regulated by the Hedgehog signaling pathway, and it is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation. PBOV1's expression patterns and interactions suggest it plays a dual role in cancer biology, acting as both a potential tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the cancer type, thereby serving as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Samusik2013PBOV1; Guo2018Nanomedicines).

## Structure
The PBOV1 protein is a human-specific protein encoded by a gene that originated de novo in primate evolution. It consists of 135 amino acids and is encoded by a single exon on chromosome 6 (Samusik2013PBOV1). The primary structure of PBOV1 is not highly conserved across mammals, with significant sequence alignment only in higher primates (Samusik2013PBOV1). 

In terms of secondary structure, PBOV1 is predicted to contain four short alpha-helices, which cover approximately 35% of the sequence, while the remainder of the protein is disordered (Samusik2013PBOV1). No significant structural domain motifs have been identified, and the protein lacks recognizable protein domains, suggesting it may not have a well-defined molecular structure (Samusik2013PBOV1). 

The protein is predicted to have potential phosphorylation sites on specific serines and tyrosines, and a disulfide bond may be present, indicating possible post-translational modifications (Samusik2013PBOV1). There is no information available on the tertiary or quaternary structure of PBOV1, nor on any splice variant isoforms. The protein's lack of significant homology to other proteins and its neutral evolution suggest a unique role in human biology (Samusik2013PBOV1).

## Clinical Significance
PBOV1 is a gene with significant clinical implications in various cancers due to its tumor-specific expression. In breast cancer, higher PBOV1 expression is associated with improved relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with lymph node metastases and grade 2 tumors. It also correlates with progression-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients undergoing tamoxifen therapy (Samusik2013PBOV1). In glioma, elevated PBOV1 levels are linked to longer survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Samusik2013PBOV1).

Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PBOV1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. It correlates with larger tumor size, metastasis, and advanced tumor stage, serving as an independent predictor of poor outcomes (Xue2018Association). PBOV1 promotes HCC progression by interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and metastatic potential (Guo2018Nanomedicines).

The gene's expression is regulated by the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which may influence its activation in tumors (Samusik2013PBOV1). These findings highlight PBOV1's dual role as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
PBOV1 interacts with β-catenin, a key player in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor progression. PBOV1 forms a complex with β-catenin, enhancing its activity by reducing its phosphorylation by GSK-3β, thereby preventing its degradation. This interaction results in increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and activation of downstream genes, promoting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression (Guo2018Nanomedicines).

In the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), PBOV1 is regulated by the long noncoding RNA FBXL19-AS1, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA to sponge miR-431. This interaction reduces the availability of miR-431 to target PBOV1, leading to its upregulation. The FBXL19-AS1/miR-431/PBOV1 axis plays a significant role in NPC progression by promoting cancer cell viability, migration, and invasion (Dong2021FBXL19‑AS1).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), PBOV1 expression is influenced by the long noncoding RNA NTT, which is regulated by the transcription factor C/EBPβ. NTT acts in cis on nearby genes, including PBOV1, and its overexpression in monocytes leads to increased expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine CXCL10, contributing to RA pathogenesis (Yang2018lncRNA).
