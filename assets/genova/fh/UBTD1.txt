# UBTD1

## Overview
UBTD1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The protein is characterized by its ubiquitin-like domain, which facilitates interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, playing a critical role in protein ubiquitylation and degradation pathways (Uhler2014The). UBTD1 is implicated in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and the stabilization of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby influencing cellular senescence and proliferation (Torrino2020UBTD1; Zhang2015UBTD1). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context, thus highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2015UBTD1; Zhao2024UBTD1).

## Structure
The UBTD1 protein is a ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain-containing protein, characterized by its structural homology to the mitochondrial Dc-UbP/UBTD2 protein. It consists of 227 amino acids, with a UbL domain located at the carboxy-terminus. This domain is 58% identical and 79% similar to UBTD2, and 34% identical and 55% similar to ubiquitin, indicating a significant degree of evolutionary conservation (Uhler2014The).

The amino-terminus of UBTD1, spanning amino acids 14 to 141, shows 83% identity with UBTD2, suggesting a conserved structural motif within this region. UBTD1 and UBTD2 are part of a protein family conserved across metazoa, fungi, and plants. In metazoa, these proteins contain an integrated ubiquitin domain, although they are not conjugated to other proteins (Uhler2014The).

UBTD1 forms a stable, stoichiometric complex with the UBE2D family of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which are integral to the ubiquitylation pathway. This interaction was confirmed through yeast-2-hybrid screening and biochemical characterization, highlighting the protein's role in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (Uhler2014The). The structural details of UBTD1, including potential post-translational modifications or splice variants, are not specified in the provided context.

## Function
UBTD1 (ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1) plays a crucial role in regulating cellular processes through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It modulates the balance of ceramides and the positioning of endolysosomes, which are essential for coordinating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. UBTD1 influences EGFR self-phosphorylation and lysosomal degradation by modulating ceramide levels through the ubiquitination of ASAH1 and participating in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR via the ubiquitination of SQSTM1/p62 (Torrino2020UBTD1).

UBTD1 also interacts with E2 and E3 enzymes, stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53 by modulating the degradation of MDM2, a negative regulator of p53. This interaction enhances p53 stability, promoting cellular senescence and inhibiting proliferation (Zhang2015UBTD1). UBTD1's role in cellular senescence is further supported by its ability to induce senescence through the p53-p21 CIP1 pathway, acting as a barrier to tumorigenesis (Zhang2015UBTD1).

In addition to its role in EGFR signaling and p53 regulation, UBTD1 is involved in the mechanical properties of cells, influencing cell adhesion and traction forces, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer aggressiveness (Torrino2019UBTD1).

## Clinical Significance
UBTD1 has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In CRC, UBTD1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and decreased survival rates. It acts as an oncogene by modulating tumorigenesis pathways and is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Jin2023Ubiquitinationrelated; Zhao2024UBTD1). High UBTD1 expression in CRC is also associated with immune escape mechanisms and poor response to immunotherapy (Jin2023Ubiquitinationrelated).

In gastric cancer, UBTD1 is downregulated, correlating with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poorer prognosis. It induces cellular senescence through the p53-p21 CIP1 pathway, suggesting a tumor-suppressor role (Zhang2015UBTD1). Similarly, in HCC, UBTD1 is downregulated in response to increased matrix stiffness, affecting YAP signaling and promoting cancer progression. Overexpression of UBTD1 in HCC inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2020CXCR4).

Overall, alterations in UBTD1 expression and its interactions with key signaling pathways play significant roles in cancer progression and patient prognosis, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
UBTD1 is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It forms a stable complex with the UBE2D family of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which are involved in the ubiquitylation pathway crucial for cellular processes like gene expression and protein sorting (Uhler2014The). UBTD1 also interacts with p53, enhancing its stability and promoting a positive feedback loop that regulates cellular senescence and proliferation. This interaction involves the degradation of Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, thereby increasing p53 levels (Zhang2015UBTD1).

In the context of EGFR signaling, UBTD1 interacts with p62/SQSTM1, influencing its ubiquitination and affecting the spatial positioning of endolysosomal vesicles. This interaction is crucial for the proper degradation of EGFR, as UBTD1 depletion disrupts the positioning of EGFR-positive vesicles, leading to increased EGFR signaling (Torrino2020UBTD1). UBTD1 is also involved in the ubiquitination of ASAH1, a lysosomal ceramidase, which plays a role in modulating ceramide levels and membrane lipid composition, further impacting EGFR signaling (Torrino2020UBTD1). These interactions highlight UBTD1's role as a scaffolding protein in E2/E3 complexes, influencing cellular signaling and receptor trafficking.
