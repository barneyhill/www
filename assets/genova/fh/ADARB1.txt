# ADARB1

## Overview
ADARB1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific B1, commonly referred to as ADAR2. This enzyme is a member of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family and plays a critical role in the post-transcriptional modification process known as RNA editing. Specifically, ADAR2 catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA, a modification that can influence RNA stability, splicing, and translation, thereby affecting gene expression and protein diversity (Tan2020Bi-allelic; Ashley2024ADAR). The protein is characterized by its double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic deaminase domain (CDD), which are essential for its function in RNA editing (Ashley2024ADAR). ADAR2 is particularly active in the nervous system, where it modulates the properties of neuronal proteins by editing transcripts encoding subunits of neuroreceptors and ion channels, playing a crucial role in neural development and function (Wang2020Role).

## Structure
The ADARB1 gene encodes the enzyme ADAR2, which is involved in RNA editing by converting adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. The protein structure includes several double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic deaminase domain (CDD), which are essential for its function (Tan2020Bi-allelic; Ashley2024ADAR). ADAR2 has two major isoforms, ADAR2S and ADAR2L, which differ by the inclusion of an alternatively spliced exon 5a, adding a flexible RNA-binding loop to the deaminase domain of ADAR2L (Tan2020Bi-allelic). 

The dsRBDs are approximately 65 amino acids long and have a conserved αβββα topology, crucial for binding duplex RNA in a shape-dependent manner (Ashley2024ADAR). These domains interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA and sometimes with the minor groove in a sequence-specific manner, enhancing the protein's affinity for dsRNA and its editing activity (Ashley2024ADAR). 

The deaminase domain contains the enzymatic active site, which is critical for RNA substrate specificity and preference (Ashley2024ADAR). The ADAR2 protein can form both heterodimers and homodimers, which are important for its editing activity (Tan2020Bi-allelic). The protein's structure and function are influenced by the presence of specific variants, which can affect RNA-binding and editing efficiency (Tan2020Bi-allelic).

## Function
The ADARB1 gene encodes the enzyme ADAR2, which is involved in the RNA editing process, specifically the conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This editing is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system, as it affects RNA stability, splicing, and translation, thereby influencing gene expression and protein diversity (Wang2020Role; Tan2020Bi-allelic). ADAR2 is particularly active in the brain, where it modulates the properties of neuronal proteins by editing transcripts encoding subunits of neuroreceptors and ion channels. One of the most well-studied substrates of ADAR2 is the Gria2 transcript, which encodes a subunit of the AMPA receptor. Editing at the Q/R site of Gria2 results in a change from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R), making AMPA receptors impermeable to calcium and affecting their trafficking. This editing is critical for maintaining proper neuronal function and preventing conditions such as epilepsy (Tan2020Bi-allelic). ADAR2 is expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, playing a crucial role in neural development and function (Wang2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADARB1 gene, which encodes the enzyme ADAR2, are associated with several neurological and psychiatric conditions. Biallelic variants in ADARB1 have been linked to a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), characterized by profound developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, spastic tetraplegia, and intractable epilepsy. Specific variants, such as p.(Arg630Gln) and c.1245_1247+1 del, lead to a loss of function, affecting RNA editing and contributing to the DEE phenotype (Maroofian2020Biallelic).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a dysfunctional form of ADARB1 is significantly increased, suggesting a role in the condition. This dysfunctional isoform, lacking two RNA binding domains, is up-regulated in the cerebella of ASD patients, potentially contributing to the disorder's pathophysiology (Zamil2020Evaluation).

ADARB1 is also implicated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), where it is downregulated, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. Its expression is negatively correlated with EGFR expression, and higher methylation levels of ADARB1 are linked to poorer survival outcomes in LUSC patients (Wang2020Role).

## Interactions
ADARB1, also known as ADAR2, is involved in RNA editing by converting adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. This enzyme plays a significant role in RNA processing and stability, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. ADAR2 is known to participate in dimerization, which is crucial for its RNA editing activity. The dimerization involves the catalytic deaminase domain (CDD) and the second double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD), with specific residues such as T501, W502, D503, G504, G508, and L509 being essential for this interaction (Ashley2024ADAR).

ADAR2's interactions are not limited to dimerization. It also engages in RNA binding through its dsRBDs, which are critical for recognizing and binding to RNA substrates. These domains contribute to the enzyme's substrate specificity and editing efficiency (Ashley2024ADAR). The structural features of ADAR2, including its dsRBDs and CDD, facilitate its role in RNA editing and its interactions with other RNA molecules (Ashley2024ADAR).

While specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, ADAR2's structural components suggest its involvement in complex RNA processing pathways, potentially interacting with other RNA-binding proteins to regulate gene expression and neural function.
