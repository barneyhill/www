# CA1

## Overview
Carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 1, a zinc metalloenzyme primarily involved in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. This enzyme plays a critical role in maintaining acid-base balance and facilitating gas exchange, particularly in red blood cells, where it is predominantly expressed (Tashian1989The). The CA1 gene is located on chromosome 8q22 in humans and is part of a larger family of carbonic anhydrases that share similar functions but differ in tissue distribution and catalytic activity (Tashian1989The). While CA1 has lower catalytic efficiency compared to other isozymes, it is involved in essential physiological processes such as ion transport and pH regulation across various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and vascular endothelium (Khalifah1991Carbonic). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a compact, globular form with a zinc ion coordinated in its active site, crucial for its enzymatic activity (KANNAN1984Structure). Despite its widespread presence, alterations in CA1 expression or mutations have not been directly linked to specific clinical disorders, although it has been identified as a potential biomarker in several diseases, including cancer and sepsis (Zamanova2019Carbonic).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) is a zinc metalloenzyme primarily found in red blood cells. The primary structure of CA1 consists of a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes both alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a twisted beta-pleated sheet architecture (KANNAN1984Structure). The tertiary structure of CA1 is compact and globular, with a zinc ion coordinated in the active site. This zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues: His-94, His-96, and His-119, along with a solvent molecule, forming a near tetrahedral arrangement (KANNAN1984Structure). 

The protein functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are common in CA1. The refined structure of CA1 also highlights the role of solvent molecules, which can disrupt secondary structures by forming bridges between carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen (KANNAN1984Structure). 

In the CA I Michigan 1 variant, a single point mutation replaces His67 with Arg67, leading to the formation of a second zinc binding site involving arginine coordination, which is not present in the native enzyme (Ferraroni2002Crystal). This mutation results in structural changes that enhance esterase activity in the presence of zinc ions (Ferraroni2002Crystal).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) is a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a crucial role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a process essential for maintaining acid-base balance in tissues. This enzyme is predominantly found in red blood cells, gastrointestinal epithelia, and vascular endothelium, where it facilitates gas exchange, fluid and ion transport, and pH regulation (Tashian1989The). In red blood cells, CA1 contributes to the rapid conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate, which is then transported in the blood to the lungs for exhalation, thus playing a vital role in respiration (Khalifah1991Carbonic).

CA1 is also present in various tissues, including the eye, sweat glands, salivary glands, and adipose cells, where it may have specialized functions such as promoting ion transfer and maintaining local pH homeostasis (Tashian1989The). Although CA1 has lower catalytic activity compared to other isozymes like CA II, it is involved in similar physiological processes, including the regulation of acid-base balance and ion transport across cell membranes (Khalifah1991Carbonic). The gene for CA1 is located on chromosome 8q22 in humans (Tashian1989The).

## Clinical Significance
Carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression levels and potential mutations. Although CA1 is abundant in red blood cells, its absence does not lead to hematologic abnormalities (Zamanova2019Carbonic). However, CA1 has been identified as a biomarker for several cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer, where its levels are elevated in patients, suggesting its role in early detection and diagnosis (Zamanova2019Carbonic). In prostate cancer, CA1 may improve diagnostic accuracy when combined with prostate-specific antigen measurements, particularly in cases with ambiguous PSA levels (Zamanova2019Carbonic).

CA1 is also associated with sepsis, where elevated levels in blood samples can indicate the presence of the condition (Zamanova2019Carbonic). In the context of schistosomiasis, CA1 levels decrease over the course of infection, suggesting its potential as a negative biomarker (Zamanova2019Carbonic). Furthermore, CA1 is part of a biomarker set proposed for detecting an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients (Zamanova2019Carbonic). Despite these associations, no specific clinical disorders have been directly linked to CA1 variants, even in the homozygous state (Tashian1980Inherited).
