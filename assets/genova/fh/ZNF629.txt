# ZNF629

## Overview
ZNF629 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 629, which is part of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which facilitate binding to DNA and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 629 is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and possibly chromatin remodeling. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several pathological conditions, such as umbilical hernia in pigs and lung squamous cell carcinoma in humans, indicating its potential significance in developmental and oncogenic pathways (Li2022Integrative; Savoldi2021A). Additionally, ZNF629's evolutionary conservation and intolerance to genetic variations suggest its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Liu2024Analysis). The gene's differential methylation patterns have also been associated with cancer risk, underscoring its potential role in disease susceptibility and progression (Cugliari2021New).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF629 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression or mutations. In pigs, ZNF629 has been associated with the development of umbilical hernia, a condition characterized by the protrusion of abdominal contents through the umbilical ring. This association was identified through a study that combined exome and transcriptome data, highlighting ZNF629 as a candidate gene potentially involved in the onset of this condition (Savoldi2021A).

In humans, ZNF629 has been identified as a core gene in the co-expression analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients. This suggests a potential role in cancer development, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Li2022Integrative).

ZNF629 has also been identified as a candidate gene in cases of spontaneous abortion, based on its evolutionary conservation and intolerance to genetic variations. This suggests a possible pathogenic role, although the clinical significance in this context is not yet fully understood (Liu2024Analysis).

Additionally, differential methylation of ZNF629 has been observed in malignant pleural mesothelioma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer risk assessment (Cugliari2021New). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of ZNF629 in these and other conditions.
