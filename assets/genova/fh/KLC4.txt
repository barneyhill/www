# KLC4

## Overview
KLC4 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin light chain 4, a critical component of the kinesin motor protein complex involved in intracellular transport. This protein is categorized as a kinesin light chain and plays a pivotal role in the anterograde transport of vesicles along microtubules, which is essential for neuronal development and function. Kinesin light chain 4 is characterized by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and cargo binding, and a heptad repeat region that interacts with kinesin heavy chains (Haynes2021KLC4; Bayrakli2015Hereditary). The gene's expression and function are crucial for processes such as axon branching, microtubule dynamics, and cellular organization. Alterations in KLC4 expression or mutations can lead to various pathological conditions, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and chemoresistance in cancer, underscoring its significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Haynes2021KLC4; Baek2020Kinesin).

## Structure
The KLC4 protein is a kinesin light chain subunit involved in intracellular transport and neuronal development. It contains several conserved functional domains, including six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are crucial for cargo binding and protein-protein interactions (Haynes2021KLC4; Bayrakli2015Hereditary). The TPR domains are characterized by a helix-turn-helix structure, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Zhu2012Crystal).

KLC4 also features a heptad repeat region that mediates binding to kinesin heavy chains (KHC), a C-terminal lipid-binding amphipathic helix, and an LFP motif that mediates KLC auto-inhibition (Haynes2021KLC4). The primary structure of KLC4 includes low complexity regions (LCR) and TPR domains, which are essential for its function (Bayrakli2015Hereditary).

In zebrafish, KLC4 has two alternative splice isoforms: a long isoform encoding a full-length protein of 620 amino acids and a short isoform predicted to encode a 185 amino acid protein, ending just before the LFP motif (Haynes2021KLC4). These isoforms suggest that KLC4 may have diverse roles in cellular processes depending on the isoform expressed. The protein's structure and function are further regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its interaction with cargo and other proteins (Zhu2012Crystal).

## Function
KLC4 (kinesin light chain 4) is a component of the kinesin motor protein complex, which is essential for intracellular transport along microtubules. In healthy human cells, KLC4 is involved in the anterograde transport of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles, a process crucial for proper neurite outgrowth and arborization. This transport is facilitated by the CLN6-CRMP2-KLC4 complex, which regulates the movement of these vesicles to the distal ends of axons, supporting neuronal development and function (Koh2021A).

KLC4 also plays a role in linking various cargoes to kinesin motors, which are vital for axonal transport. This function is critical for maintaining cellular organization and ensuring the proper delivery of organelles and proteins within neurons (Koh2021A). In the absence of CLN6, a component of the complex, there is a reduction in vesicular transport, leading to stunted neurite outgrowth, highlighting the importance of KLC4 in this process (Koh2021A).

In addition to its role in vesicle transport, KLC4 is implicated in the stabilization of nascent axon branches and the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are essential for axon branching and neuronal morphology (Haynes2021KLC4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KLC4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), KLC4 is associated with chemoresistance. High levels of KLC4 expression correlate with resistance to DNA-damaging anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and etoposide. Silencing KLC4 enhances the cytotoxic effects of these drugs, suggesting that KLC4 plays a role in DNA repair mechanisms and chemoresistance (Baek2020Kinesin). KLC4's interaction with checkpoint kinase CHK2 is crucial for maintaining G2/M arrest and apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, and targeting the KLC4-CHK2 axis could be a strategy for developing new anticancer therapies (Baek2020Kinesin).

In neurological contexts, mutations in KLC4 have been linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia, a condition characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the legs. KLC4 is crucial for axon branching and proper neuronal development, and mutations can lead to defects in vision, hearing, movement, and cognition (Haynes2021KLC4). In zebrafish models, KLC4 mutations result in behavioral defects such as increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired feeding ability, highlighting its role in neural circuit function (Haynes2021KLC4).

## Interactions
KLC4 (kinesin light chain 4) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular transport and cellular processes. KLC4 interacts with checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), playing a significant role in the DNA damage response and chemoresistance in lung cancer cells. The interaction between KLC4 and CHK2 is critical for regulating apoptosis and maintaining cell cycle checkpoints, particularly in response to DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin (Baek2020Kinesin).

In neuronal development, KLC4 interacts with CRMP2, a protein that influences microtubule dynamics. This interaction is essential for axon branching and stabilization, as KLC4 affects microtubule polymerization and stabilization, which are necessary for proper neuronal morphology and function (Haynes2021KLC4).

KLC4 also binds to the kinesin heavy chain (KHC) as part of the kinesin motor protein complex. This interaction is mediated by a specific binding site on the KHC, which is crucial for the transport of various cellular cargos along microtubules. The binding site for KLC4 on the KHC is located within the region 771-876, which forms an R-helical coiled-coil structure (Diefenbach1998The).
