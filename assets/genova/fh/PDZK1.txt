# PDZK1

## Overview
PDZK1 is a gene that encodes the PDZ domain-containing 1 protein, a scaffolding protein characterized by its four PDZ domains. These domains facilitate the organization and stabilization of protein complexes at the cell membrane, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including ion transport, cholesterol metabolism, and signal transduction. The PDZ domain-containing 1 protein is particularly significant in epithelial cells, where it influences the localization and function of membrane proteins such as ion channels and transporters. It is also involved in the regulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptors, impacting cholesterol homeostasis. Alterations in PDZK1 expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (Yesilaltay2009Loss; Ferreira2018PDZ; Kocher2011Identification).

## Structure
PDZK1 is a scaffolding protein composed of four PDZ domains, each capable of independently binding to the PDZ binding motifs of various membrane proteins, facilitating the organization of macromolecular complexes (Hajizadeh2018Probing). The protein is 519 residues long and features a carboxyl-terminal tail ending with the sequence DTEM, which is a potential ligand for PDZ domains (LaLonde2009The). The PDZ domains are connected by three linkers, which contribute to the protein's conformation and stability, contrary to the previously assumed flexible 'beads-on-a-string' model (Hajizadeh2018Probing).

The tertiary structure of PDZK1 is characterized by an extended, L-shaped conformation with moderate flexibility, as revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies (Hajizadeh2018Probing). The protein can undergo intramolecular interactions, particularly between its first PDZ domain and the carboxyl-terminal tail, leading to a more compact conformation (LaLonde2009The). PDZK1 also has the ability to dimerize, primarily through interactions involving the third PDZ domain, although this dimerization does not involve the DTEM sequence (LaLonde2009The).

The protein's structure is further influenced by its linker regions, which are not merely disordered spacers but play active roles in maintaining the protein's defined conformation and supporting its structural integrity (Hajizadeh2018Probing).

## Function
PDZK1 is a scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in organizing and stabilizing protein complexes at the cell membrane. It contains four PDZ domains, which facilitate interactions with various membrane proteins, contributing to the organization of specialized membrane domains (Ferreira2018PDZ). PDZK1 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, influencing their expression and localization, particularly in epithelial cells (Kocher2003Targeted).

In the kidney, PDZK1 stabilizes the 'urate transportosome,' a complex involved in renal urate handling, by interacting with solute carriers such as SLC22A12 (URAT1) and SLC22A11 (OAT4), enhancing their membrane localization and transport capacity (Ferreira2018PDZ). It also interacts with efflux transporters like ABCC4 (MRP4) and ABCC2 (MRP2), which are involved in drug metabolism (Ferreira2018PDZ).

PDZK1 plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism by regulating the expression and localization of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) in hepatocytes. This interaction is essential for normal lipoprotein metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis, as evidenced by increased plasma cholesterol levels in PDZK1 knockout mice (Nakamura2005Regulation; Kocher2011Identification). PDZK1 is also involved in epithelial fluid transport and neurotransmitter signaling, interacting with proteins like ABCC7 (CFTR) and the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) (Ferreira2018PDZ).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDZK1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and cardiovascular conditions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PDZK1 is significantly downregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. It acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration, primarily through the suppression of SHP-1 phosphorylation, which affects downstream signaling pathways such as Akt and STAT5 (Tao2017PDZK1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDZK1 expression is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, and its expression is regulated by miR-101-3p, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Gao2024miR1013pmediated).

PDZK1 also plays a role in cardiovascular diseases. Its deficiency in apolipoprotein E (apoE) knockout mice leads to increased atherosclerosis and coronary artery occlusions, indicating its atheroprotective role. PDZK1 regulates the expression of the HDL receptor SR-BI, crucial for cholesterol metabolism (Yesilaltay2009Loss).

In osteoarthritis, PDZK1 is involved in maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Its deletion accelerates chondrocyte senescence and cartilage damage, while its overexpression mitigates these effects, highlighting its protective role against osteoarthritis progression (Shao2024PDZK1).

## Interactions
PDZK1 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with various proteins through its multiple PDZ domains. It forms a regulated ternary complex with EBP50 and ezrin, which is crucial for microvillar organization in polarized epithelial cells. This complex is cooperative, with ezrin enhancing the interaction between PDZK1 and EBP50, and is regulated by the cellular location of PDZK1 (LaLonde2010A).

PDZK1 also interacts with the prostacyclin receptor (IP) through its PDZ1 domain. This interaction is essential for prostacyclin's role in reendothelialization and angiogenesis. The non-isoprenylated form of IP's carboxy-terminus binds to PDZ1, while the isoprenylated form likely anchors IP in the plasma membrane (Birrane2013Molecular).

In the context of ion transport, PDZK1 regulates membrane ion transporters such as the NHE3 ion exchanger and the peptide transporter PEPT2. The fourth PDZ domain of PDZK1 binds to the C terminus of PEPT2, and the first domain is sufficient for NHE3 binding (Hajizadeh2018Probing).

PDZK1 is also involved in the regulation of the hepatic high-density lipoprotein receptor SR-BI. The PDZ1 domain specifically binds to the C terminus of SR-BI, which is crucial for its regulation (Fenske2008Overexpression).
