# ADAM2

## Overview
ADAM2 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 2 protein, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and signaling. The ADAM2 protein is characterized by its complex domain structure, including a disintegrin domain and a metalloprotease domain, although the latter is predicted to be proteolytically inactive due to an altered consensus motif (Stone1999Structure–Function). Primarily expressed in the testis, ADAM2 plays a crucial role in reproductive biology, particularly in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization, where it forms a heterodimer with ADAM1 on the sperm surface to facilitate binding and fusion with the egg membrane (Stone1999Structure–Function; Wolfsberg1995ADAM). Beyond its reproductive functions, ADAM2 has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer, where it acts as a cancer-testis antigen in lung adenocarcinoma, influencing immune responses and tumor progression (Dervovic2023In).

## Structure
ADAM2, also known as fertilin-β, is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, characterized by a complex domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, a metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Cho2012Testicular; Brocker2009Evolutionary). 

The metalloprotease domain of ADAM2 is predicted to be proteolytically inactive due to an altered consensus motif that cannot coordinate zinc, which is essential for catalytic activity (Stone1999Structure–Function). The disintegrin domain of ADAM2 is involved in cell adhesion, utilizing non-RGD sequences to interact with integrin receptors, with an ECD sequence acting as an adhesion-mediating motif (Cho2012Testicular). 

ADAM2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing during sperm maturation, which removes the prodomain and metalloprotease domain, leaving the disintegrin domain on the processed form (Cho2012Testicular). The protein forms complexes with other ADAM proteins, such as ADAM1 and ADAM3, which are crucial for its function in sperm-egg fusion (Stone1999Structure–Function; Choi2016Characterization).

## Function
ADAM2, also known as fertilin β, is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, which are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In humans, ADAM2 is primarily expressed in the testis and plays a significant role in reproductive processes, particularly in sperm-egg interactions during fertilization. It forms a heterodimer with ADAM1 on the sperm surface, which is crucial for sperm binding and fusion with the egg membrane (Stone1999Structure–Function; Wolfsberg1995ADAM).

ADAM2 is characterized by a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain, although it is predicted to be proteolytically inactive due to an altered metalloprotease consensus motif that cannot coordinate zinc. This suggests that ADAM2 functions primarily in adhesion, cell fusion, and intracellular signaling rather than proteolysis (Stone1999Structure–Function). The protein is involved in binding to the egg plasma membrane, facilitating sperm-egg membrane adhesion and fusion, which are essential for successful fertilization (Stone1999Structure–Function).

In humans, ADAM2 is detected in the testis but not in sperm, indicating a potential difference in its role or necessity in human reproduction compared to other mammals (Choi2016Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
ADAM2 is implicated in various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it acts as a cancer-testis antigen. Its expression is associated with reduced responses to inflammatory cytokines such as IFNα, IFNγ, and TNFα, which are crucial for immune responses in lung cancer (Dervovic2023In). In LUAD, ADAM2 expression is more prevalent in KRAS-mutant tumors compared to BRAF-mutant ones, suggesting a specific oncogenic pathway involvement (Dervovic2023In). The gene's expression is linked to the downregulation of immune response genes and the upregulation of genes that promote cancer progression, indicating its role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and potentially affecting immunotherapy outcomes (Dervovic2023In).

In mouse models, ADAM2 overexpression leads to faster tumor growth and reduced survival, highlighting its role in suppressing immune responses (Dervovic2023In). It also affects the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which may enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic T-cells in tumors overexpressing ADAM2 (Dervovic2023In). These findings suggest that ADAM2 could be a target for enhancing immune therapy responses in lung cancer (Dervovic2023In).

## Interactions
ADAM2, also known as fertilin-b, is involved in several key interactions crucial for its role in sperm-egg fusion. It forms a heterodimer with ADAM1 (fertilin-a) on the sperm surface, which is essential for sperm-egg binding and fusion. This interaction is evidenced by the inhibition of these processes when antibodies against ADAM2 are applied (EDWARDS2008The; Wolfsberg1995ADAM). ADAM2 also interacts with the a6b1 integrin on the egg surface, facilitating sperm-egg binding. A peptide based on the disintegrin domain of ADAM2 can block this binding, highlighting the importance of this interaction (EDWARDS2008The).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, ADAM2 is found in increased levels in hippocampal neurons, where it may interact with integrins, affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This interaction is suggested to play a role in the disease's clinical manifestations, potentially impacting memory through integrin-mediated pathways (Gerst2000Altered).

The proteolytic processing of ADAM2 during sperm maturation is another aspect of its interaction profile, as it undergoes cleavage that may influence its binding capabilities and interactions with other proteins (Marcello2010Multivariate; EDWARDS2008The).
