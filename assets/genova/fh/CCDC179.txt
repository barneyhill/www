# CCDC179

## Overview
CCDC179 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 179, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural elements that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the CCDC179 protein may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the precise biological functions of CCDC179 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in brain development and potential association with immune-related pathways have been suggested by genetic studies. The gene has been implicated in brain malformations, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum and polymicrogyria, through chromosomal duplications that include CCDC179 (Krutzke2015Array‐based). Additionally, CCDC179 is located within a genomic region associated with the age of onset of type 1 diabetes, indicating a possible role in immune system regulation (Cardinale2023Genomewide). Further research is necessary to define the specific functions and clinical significance of the CCDC179 protein.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CCDC179 gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in certain conditions related to brain malformations. In a study involving array-based molecular karyotyping, a duplication of the chromosomal region 11p14.3, which includes CCDC179, was identified in a fetus with brain malformations. This duplication overlaps with a region found in another patient who exhibited agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and polymicrogyria, suggesting a potential link between CCDC179 and these brain malformations (Krutzke2015Array‐based). However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or alterations in CCDC179 are not detailed in the available literature.

In another study, CCDC179 was mentioned as one of the genes located within a 3-Mb window centered on a haplotype associated with the age of onset of type 1 diabetes. Although the study focused on other genes, such as HTATIP2, as potential regulators in immune cells, CCDC179 was included in the region of interest, indicating its potential involvement in immune-related pathways (Cardinale2023Genomewide). Despite these findings, further research is needed to clarify the specific clinical implications of CCDC179 mutations or expression alterations.
