# TROAP

## Overview
TROAP, or trophinin associated protein, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to cell adhesion and microtubule dynamics. The protein encoded by TROAP is essential for early embryonic development and plays a pivotal role in cell division and stability by interacting with microtubules. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. TROAP's regulatory functions in cell proliferation and migration are vital for normal tissue development and homeostasis. Dysregulation of TROAP activity has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it influences key signaling pathways and protein interactions that promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Li2021TROAP; Wang2023TROAP).

## Structure


## Function
TROAP, or trophinin associated protein, plays a significant role in cell adhesion and is crucial for early embryonic development. It is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with microtubule dynamics, contributing to cell division and stability. TROAP's function is essential for proper cell cycle progression and maintaining cellular structure. In healthy human cells, TROAP is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, particularly through its interaction with microtubules, which are critical for maintaining cell shape and facilitating intracellular transport. This protein's activity is vital for ensuring accurate cell division, as it helps stabilize the microtubule network during mitosis, thereby supporting the proper segregation of chromosomes. The stability and dynamics of microtubules are crucial for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell signaling, and the maintenance of cell polarity. By contributing to these processes, TROAP ensures the structural integrity and functional efficiency of cells, which is essential for normal tissue development and homeostasis. The precise regulation of TROAP activity is necessary to prevent aberrant cell proliferation, which can lead to pathological conditions such as cancer.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TROAP, or trophinin-associated protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cancer progression. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), TROAP interacts with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). TROAP directly binds to the activated form of STAT3, known as p-STAT3, enhancing its levels and nuclear enrichment. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by potentially affecting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway (Wang2023TROAP).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TROAP interacts with the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases DYRK1A and DYRK1B. TROAP binds to these kinases, leading to their cytoplasmic retention and activation of the Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway. This interaction contributes to cell cycle progression and cancer cell proliferation (Li2021TROAP).

TROAP is also implicated in prostate cancer, where it influences the TWIST/c-Myc pathway. TROAP knockdown reduces the expression of TWIST and c-Myc, indicating that TROAP may regulate c-Myc via TWIST, affecting cell proliferation and invasion (Jin2021EZH2TROAP). These interactions highlight TROAP's role in various cancer types through its involvement in key signaling pathways.
