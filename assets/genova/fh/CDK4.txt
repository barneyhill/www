# CDK4

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 4, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation. The CDK4 protein is primarily involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle, functioning through its interaction with D-type cyclins to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), thereby facilitating cell cycle progression (Parry1999Cyclin; Fassl2022CDK4). This kinase is also implicated in the regulation of cell growth by modulating the mTORC1 pathway, linking cell cycle control with cellular growth mechanisms (RomeroPozuelo2020Cdk4). CDK4's activity is tightly regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which modulate its interaction with cyclins and other regulatory proteins (Fassl2022CDK4). Dysregulation of CDK4, through mutations or overexpression, is associated with various cancers, including melanoma and mantle cell lymphoma, highlighting its significance as a potential target for cancer therapy (Puntervoll2013Melanoma; Hernández2005CDK4).

## Structure
CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) is a serine/threonine kinase with a typical bilobal structure common to kinases. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids forming a 5-stranded β-sheet N-terminal domain (residues 1-96) and a predominantly helical C-terminal domain (residues 97-303) (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal). The N-terminal domain contains the helix-αC with the sequence PISTVRE, which is packed against the β-sheet (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal). 

The tertiary structure of CDK4 is characterized by a cleft between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which houses the ATP binding site (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal). The T-loop, particularly around Thr-172, is crucial for its activity and can adopt a 'loop in' conformation, characteristic of an inactive CDK, even when phosphorylated (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal).

In its quaternary structure, CDK4 forms a complex with D-type cyclins, such as cyclin D1, which primarily contacts the N-lobe and αC-helix of CDK4 (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal). The CDK4/cyclin D1 complex has a buried surface area of 2,334 Å², indicating a unique conformation compared to other CDK/cyclin complexes (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal). 

Phosphorylation of the T-loop is a critical post-translational modification required for enzymatic activity, although it does not alone trigger the conformational change typically associated with full activation (Takaki2009The; Day2009Crystal).

## Function
CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) is a crucial component of the cell cycle machinery in healthy human cells. It forms a complex with D-type cyclins, which are regulated by extracellular signals, to facilitate the progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein (RB1), leading to the release of E2F transcription factors and the upregulation of E2F-transcriptional targets, including cyclin E, which is essential for the transition into the S-phase (Fassl2022CDK4).

CDK4 also plays a role in regulating cell growth by activating mTORC1, a key pathway for cell growth and protein synthesis. It phosphorylates and inhibits TSC2, an upstream inhibitor of mTORC1, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity. This coupling of cell growth to the cell-cycle machinery suggests that CDK4 has a dual role in cell proliferation: directly through phosphorylation of RB and indirectly by activating mTORC1 (RomeroPozuelo2020Cdk4).

The activity of CDK4 is tightly regulated by cell-cycle inhibitors, such as the INK and KIP/CIP families, which can prevent the formation of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes or modulate their activity (Fassl2022CDK4). CDK4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it is essential for normal cell proliferation and growth (RomeroPozuelo2020Cdk4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CDK4 gene are associated with several cancers, most notably melanoma. Germline mutations in CDK4, such as R24H and R24C, are linked to an increased risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, particularly in familial cases. These mutations affect the p16 INK4A binding domain, leading to reduced inhibition of CDK4 kinase activity and promoting cell cycle progression (Puntervoll2013Melanoma; Sheppard2013The). CDK4 mutations are phenotypically similar to CDKN2A mutations, characterized by early onset of melanoma and increased occurrence of multiple primary melanomas (Puntervoll2013Melanoma).

In mantle cell lymphomas (MCL), CDK4 gene alterations, including increased gene copy number and overexpression, are associated with highly proliferative and aggressive variants. These alterations often occur alongside p53 gene inactivation, contributing to the pathogenesis of MCL by affecting cell cycle regulation pathways (Hernández2005CDK4).

The CDK4 pathway is a critical oncogenic pathway in melanoma, with dysregulation observed in over 90% of cases. This pathway's activation is often due to genomic alterations, such as the deletion of the tumor suppressor CDKN2A, which increases CDK4 activity (Sheppard2013The). CDK4 inhibitors are being developed as potential therapeutic agents, showing promise in clinical trials for their ability to inhibit cell proliferation (Sheppard2013The).

## Interactions
CDK4 interacts with various proteins, primarily forming complexes with D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) to regulate cell cycle progression. These cyclin D-CDK4 complexes phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), facilitating the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle (Parry1999Cyclin). CDK4 activity is modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) from the INK4 family, including p16 INK4a, which forms stable complexes with CDK4, inhibiting its activity (Baker2012CDK4:; Parry1999Cyclin).

CDK4 also forms multimeric complexes with chaperone proteins such as HSP90 and CDC37, which stabilize CDK4 and facilitate its interaction with cyclin D (Stepanova1996Mammalian; Jirawatnotai2014The). The interaction with CDC37 is specific to CDK4 and does not occur with other cyclin-dependent kinases (Stepanova1996Mammalian).

In addition to these interactions, CDK4 is involved in complexes with p21 CIP1 and p27 KIP1, which stabilize cyclin D-CDK4 complexes and counteract the inhibitory effects of INK4 proteins (Parry1999Cyclin). The presence of p21 CIP1 can reconstitute cyclin D-CDK4-p21 CIP1 complexes even in the presence of excess p16 INK4a, highlighting the dynamic equilibrium between INK4-bound and p21-bound states (Parry1999Cyclin).
