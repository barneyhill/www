# GNG2

## Overview
GNG2 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 2, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. The GNG2 protein is characterized by its role in forming a stable dimer with beta subunits, which is essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways. As a part of the G protein complex, GNG2 interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate various physiological responses, including growth, differentiation, and movement. The protein is notably involved in the regulation of brain structure and function, particularly in regions associated with cognitive control and emotional regulation, such as the medial frontal cortex (ChavarríaSiles2012Genes). Additionally, GNG2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including Down syndrome, mesio temporal lobe epilepsy, and vasovagal syncope, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Sriroopreddy2019Differentially; Xu2020Identification; Huang2014Alteration).

## Structure
The GNG2 gene encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are involved in signal transduction. In its Gβ-bound form, the Gγ subunit, including GNG2, exhibits a highly extended α-helical structure that participates in coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit. This structure is stabilized by specific interactions with the Gβ subunit, indicating that the extended α-helical structure cannot exist in the unbound form (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The GNG2 protein is characterized by a significant level of intrinsic disorder, with a percentage of disordered residues (PDR) of 38.3%, which correlates with its ability to form coiled-coils (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

The GNG2 protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, which aids in membrane attachment. However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as specific domains, prominent folds, and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

## Function
GNG2 encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which are crucial for signal transduction in healthy human cells. These proteins are involved in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors, playing a significant role in various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and movement. GNG2 is active in the cell membrane, where it helps regulate physiological responses by interacting with other G-protein subunits to form a functional heterotrimeric complex (ChavarríaSiles2012Genes).

In the human brain, GNG2 has been associated with variations in gray matter volume, particularly in the medial frontal cortex. This region is involved in cognitive control and emotional regulation, suggesting that GNG2 may influence brain structure and function through its role in G-protein signaling pathways (ChavarríaSiles2012Genes). The presence of GNG2 in the claustrum and insular cortex, as observed through immunohistochemistry, indicates its involvement in the integration of multisensory information, although its precise function in these areas remains unclear (Pirone2012Topography). The gene's expression in astrocytes within the claustrum and insular cortex further suggests a role in supporting neural activity and maintaining the extracellular environment (Pirone2012Topography).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GNG2 gene have been associated with several diseases. In mesio temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), GNG2 is identified as a hub gene with high connectivity in the protein-protein interaction network, suggesting its potential importance in the condition's molecular mechanisms (Xu2020Identification). In brain low-grade gliomas (LGG), GNG2 expression levels are linked to poor overall survival, although no significant expression differences were observed between LGG-Grade 2 and LGG-Grade 3 (Xu2020Identification).

In vasovagal syncope (VVS), GNG2 is one of the genes with elevated mRNA levels in patients, indicating its involvement in G-protein-coupled signaling, which plays a significant role in cardiovascular reflexes (Huang2014Alteration). The study suggests that changes in G-protein expression, including GNG2, may contribute to VVS (Huang2014Alteration).

In the context of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), GNG2 is identified as a downregulated gene in perituberal tissue, which may play a role in epileptogenesis, although the clinical significance of GNG2 mutations specifically is not directly addressed (Li2020The). These findings highlight the potential of GNG2 as a biomarker and its involvement in various pathophysiological processes.

## Interactions
GNG2 (G protein subunit gamma 2) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It is a component of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, which interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate signal transduction. GNG2 forms a stable dimer with beta subunits, which is crucial for its function in signaling pathways (Gan2019miR30aGNG2).

In the context of Down syndrome, GNG2 has been identified as a hub gene in protein-protein interaction networks, interacting with other proteins involved in neural development and function (Sriroopreddy2019Differentially). The study highlights its interaction with WASP, a gene with a strong network topology score, indicating significant interactions within the network (Sriroopreddy2019Differentially).

In abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development, GNG2 interacts with chemokines such as CXCL1 and CCR7, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory processes (Gan2019miR30aGNG2). These interactions are part of the NF-kB-CCR7/CXCL1-VEGF pathway, which is implicated in inflammation and cancer progression (Gan2019miR30aGNG2).

In melanoma cells, GNG2 modulates signaling pathways involving c-SRC and AKT, influencing cell proliferation. Overexpression of GNG2 in melanoma cells leads to reduced proliferation rates, associated with decreased phosphorylation of c-SRC and AKT, and increased levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 Cip1/WAF1 (Yajima2012Functional).
