# DCDC2

## Overview
DCDC2 is a gene that encodes the protein doublecortin domain containing 2, which is a member of the doublecortin domain (DC) superfamily. This protein is characterized by its two doublecortin domains, which are essential for its role in microtubule binding and stabilization, contributing to neuronal migration and differentiation (Lata2023In; Reiner2006The). DCDC2 is involved in critical cellular processes, including the regulation of ciliary length and signaling pathways such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt, which are vital for neuronal development (Massinen2011Increased). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as Kif3a and DYX1C1, underscore its importance in ciliary function and neuronal migration (Massinen2011Increased; Bieder2023Genetic). Clinically, mutations in the DCDC2 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including dyslexia and recessive deafness, highlighting its significance in sensory and cognitive functions (Grati2015A; Meng2005DCDC2).

## Structure
The DCDC2 protein is part of the doublecortin domain (DC) superfamily and contains two distinct doublecortin domains, which are crucial for its function in microtubule binding and stabilization. The N-terminal domain spans amino acids 17-100, while the C-terminal domain covers amino acids 139-222 (Lata2023In). These domains are involved in binding to microtubules at the groove between protofilaments, contributing to the protein's role in neural development (Lata2023In). The DCX domains adopt a ubiquitin-like fold, which is distinct from classical microtubule-associated proteins (Dijkmans2010The).

The protein's interaction with microtubules is essential for neuronal migration and differentiation, and it is known to stabilize microtubules by binding at a novel site between protofilaments (Reiner2006The). The DCDC2 protein also exhibits nuclear and nucleolar localization, suggesting additional functions beyond microtubule interaction (Coquelle2006The). Missense SNPs within the DC domains have been associated with disorders such as dyslexia, affecting the protein's stability and interaction with microtubules (Lata2023In). The predicted tertiary structure of DCDC2 is available in the AlphaFold database (ID: AF-Q9UHG0-F1) (Lata2023In).

## Function
The DCDC2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the doublecortin domain-containing superfamily, which plays a significant role in microtubule stabilization and ciliary function in healthy human cells. DCDC2 is involved in the regulation of ciliary length and signaling, particularly in neurons, where it localizes to the primary cilium. This organelle is crucial for various signaling pathways, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt, which are essential for neuronal development and function (Massinen2011Increased).

DCDC2 interacts with Kif3a, a component of the kinesin-2 motor protein complex, suggesting a role in intraflagellar transport, a critical process for ciliary maintenance and signaling (Massinen2011Increased). The protein's function in microtubule dynamics is further supported by its involvement in the regulation of kinocilia axoneme length and stability in sensory hair cells, where it is distributed along the kinocilium with a higher concentration towards the tip (Grati2015A).

In the context of neuronal migration, DCDC2 modulates this process in the developing neocortex, with dysregulation linked to reading disabilities such as dyslexia (Meng2005DCDC2). The protein's role in microtubule-based transport and signal transduction is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCDC2 gene have been linked to several neurodevelopmental and sensory disorders. DCDC2 is notably associated with reading disabilities, particularly dyslexia. Variants in this gene can affect neuronal migration, a critical process in brain development, which may contribute to the manifestation of dyslexia (Scerri2011DCDC2; Meng2005DCDC2). The gene's involvement in neuronal migration is supported by studies showing that its disruption can impair this process, potentially leading to reading difficulties (Meng2005DCDC2).

In addition to its role in reading disabilities, a specific missense mutation in DCDC2, identified as p.Gln424Pro, has been associated with human recessive deafness, DFNB66. This mutation affects the regulation of cilia length in sensory hair cells, leading to structural defects that impair hearing (Grati2015A). The mutation disrupts the intracellular microtubule network, causing elongation of cilia, which is crucial for proper auditory function (Grati2015A).

DCDC2 has also been implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with studies suggesting a genetic linkage between ADHD symptoms and specific markers near the DCDC2 gene (Riva2014The). The gene's interaction with socioeconomic factors may further influence attention problems, highlighting its potential role in behavioral disorders (Riva2014The).

## Interactions
DCDC2 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal migration and ciliary function. It interacts with Kif3a, a subunit of the kinesin-2 complex, at the primary cilium. This interaction is significant for ciliary length regulation and microtubule stabilization, as demonstrated by in situ proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in rat hippocampal neurons (Massinen2011Increased). DCDC2 also interacts with DYX1C1, another dyslexia candidate gene, and both proteins are involved in neuronal migration and ciliary processes. Their interaction is mediated through the centrosomal protein CPAP (CENPJ), which is essential for cilia formation and neuronal migration (Bieder2023Genetica; Bieder2023Genetic).

DCDC2's interaction with CPAP has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, and it co-occurs with CPAP at the centrosomes during metaphase (Bieder2023Genetica; Bieder2023Genetic). DCDC2 also binds to tubulin, enhancing microtubule polymerization, and interacts with dishevelled 3, a key regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby modulating ciliary signaling (Wei2023Neonatal). These interactions highlight DCDC2's role in microtubule dynamics and ciliary signaling pathways.
