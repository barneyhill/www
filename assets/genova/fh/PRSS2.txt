# PRSS2

## Overview
The PRSS2 gene encodes the enzyme serine protease 2, also known as human anionic trypsinogen, which is a precursor to the digestive enzyme trypsin. This gene is located on chromosome 7 and is primarily expressed in the pancreas, where it plays a critical role in the digestive process by facilitating the breakdown of dietary proteins. Upon activation, trypsinogen is converted into trypsin, which then activates other digestive enzymes, thus playing a pivotal role in protein digestion (Rónai2009A). The regulation of PRSS2 is crucial, as premature activation can lead to pancreatic disorders such as pancreatitis. The enzyme is categorized as a serine protease due to its mechanism of action, which involves a serine residue in its active site. PRSS2 is distinct from its counterpart, PRSS1, which encodes cationic trypsinogen, and together they constitute the majority of trypsinogen in pancreatic juice (Rónai2009A). Genetic variations in PRSS2 have been associated with both protective and risk factors for pancreatic diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Kume2008A; Geisz2024Six).

## Function
The PRSS2 gene encodes human anionic trypsinogen, a precursor to the enzyme trypsin, which plays a crucial role in digestive physiology. Trypsinogen is produced by the pancreas and, upon activation to trypsin, facilitates the digestion of dietary proteins by activating other digestive proenzymes (Rónai2009A). The PRSS2 gene is located on chromosome 7 and is responsible for encoding the anionic form of trypsinogen, which, along with cationic trypsinogen encoded by PRSS1, constitutes the majority of trypsinogen in pancreatic juice (Rónai2009A).

In healthy human cells, the primary function of PRSS2 is related to its role in digestion. The activation of trypsinogen involves the proteolytic cleavage of the Lys23-Ile24 peptide bond, which is essential for the conversion of trypsinogen to active trypsin (Nemoda2005ACTIVATION). This process is tightly regulated to prevent premature activation, which could lead to conditions such as pancreatitis (Nemoda2005ACTIVATION). Despite the presence of a common polymorphism, p.D153H, which abolishes tyrosine sulfation of anionic trypsinogen, this modification does not significantly affect the activation or function of PRSS2 in normal digestive physiology (Rónai2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PRSS2 gene have been implicated in various pancreatic disorders, particularly chronic pancreatitis. The p.G191R variant in PRSS2 is a loss-of-function mutation associated with a protective effect against chronic pancreatitis, especially in alcoholic and idiopathic cases. This variant is less frequent in patients with chronic pancreatitis compared to healthy controls, suggesting a protective role (Kume2008A). The PRSS2 gene's increased sensitivity to chymotrypsin C-mediated degradation is thought to prevent mutations from increasing its stability enough to cause intra-pancreatic activation, which is a risk factor for pancreatitis (Geisz2024Six).

The PRSS1-PRSS2 haplotype has been linked to both alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. A risk haplotype involving PRSS1-PRSS2-TRB is associated with increased PRSS2 expression, potentially accelerating the transition from recurrent acute pancreatitis to chronic pancreatitis, particularly with alcohol abuse (Herzig2020Role; Geisz2024Six). Conversely, a protective haplotype marked by a large deletion reduces PRSS2 expression and is associated with a decreased risk of chronic pancreatitis (Geisz2024Six). These genetic variations highlight the complex role of PRSS2 in pancreatic disease susceptibility and resistance.

## Interactions
PRSS2, or human anionic trypsinogen, is primarily regulated by chymotrypsin C (CTRC), which plays a crucial role in its degradation and suppression of autoactivation. This regulation is more effective for PRSS2 than for cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) due to additional cleavage sites and the absence of a disulfide bond in PRSS2, which increases its susceptibility to CTRC-mediated degradation (Jancsó2016Tighter).

The interaction between PRSS2 and PRSS1 is significant in the context of pancreatitis. The E79K mutation in PRSS1 enhances the transactivation of PRSS2, suggesting that PRSS1 mutations can increase PRSS2 activity, potentially contributing to the disease (Teich2004Interaction). This interaction highlights a novel mechanism where PRSS1 mutations influence PRSS2 activity, despite PRSS2 mutations not being directly associated with hereditary pancreatitis.

PRSS2 also interacts with activation peptides, which play a role in its autoactivation control. The presence of specific aspartate residues in the activation peptide influences the autoactivation process, although these interactions are less significant in PRSS2 compared to PRSS1 due to structural differences (Nemoda2005ACTIVATION).
