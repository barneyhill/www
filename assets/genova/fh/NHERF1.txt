# NHERF1

## Overview
NHERF1, or Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1, is a gene that encodes the NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 1, a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its two PDZ domains and a C-terminal ezrin-binding domain (EBD), which facilitate interactions with a wide range of cellular partners, including membrane proteins and cytoskeletal elements (Mamonova2012Structural). As a scaffold protein, NHERF1 plays a pivotal role in organizing signaling complexes and modulating cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to ion transport and receptor localization (Voltz2007Phosphorylation). The protein's dynamic structure, influenced by flexible linker regions and post-translational modifications, allows it to adapt to various cellular contexts, thereby regulating processes such as sodium-hydrogen exchange and phosphate reabsorption (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic). NHERF1's interactions and functions are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and renal disorders (Bellizzi2010NHERF1EBP50; Karim2008NHERF1Mutations).

## Structure
NHERF1, also known as Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1, is a cytoplasmic scaffolding protein characterized by its modular structure, which includes two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) and a C-terminal ezrin-binding domain (EBD) (Mamonova2012Structural). The PDZ domains are globular structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions by binding to short carboxy-terminal motifs of target proteins (Mamonova2012Structural). The PDZ1 domain is structurally similar to other PDZ domains, consisting of six beta strands and two alpha helices, and it forms a hydrophobic pocket for ligand binding (Jiang2014Crystallographic). The PDZ2 domain also exhibits a canonical PDZ domain structure with a 6-stranded β-barrel and two α-helices, and it includes additional structural features such as an α-helix (α3) and a 310 helix (α4) that enhance binding affinity (Martin2020In).

NHERF1 is highly dynamic, existing as a continuum of structures due to its flexible linker regions, which connect the PDZ domains and the EBD (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic). This flexibility allows NHERF1 to coordinate the spatial and temporal location of its domains, crucial for its scaffolding function (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, modulate NHERF1's cellular activity and interactions (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic).

## Function
NHERF1 (Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1) is a critical phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the cAMP-mediated inhibition of the renal Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) by forming a complex with the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin/merlin) family of actin-binding proteins, linking NHE3 to the actin cytoskeleton. This complex recruits protein kinase A (PKA) to promote NHE3 phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting sodium-hydrogen exchange (Voltz2007Phosphorylation).

NHERF1 is also essential for the proper trafficking and localization of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter Npt2a to the apical membrane, which is crucial for phosphate reabsorption in the kidney. In NHERF1-deficient cells, Npt2a is mislocalized to the cytosol, indicating NHERF1's role in ensuring its presence in the apical membrane for effective phosphate transport (Khundmiri2008Novel; Shenolikar2002Targeted).

Additionally, NHERF1 interacts with various receptors, such as the β2-adrenergic receptor and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), influencing their function and localization. The phosphorylation of NHERF1 modulates its binding to these targets, affecting the assembly and function of cellular complexes (Voltz2007Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
NHERF1 (NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 1) plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Altered expression of NHERF1 is linked to aggressive clinical behavior, poor prognosis, and increased tumor hypoxia in breast cancer. It is predominantly cytoplasmic in tumor cells, contrasting with its membranous localization in normal cells, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Bellizzi2010NHERF1EBP50). NHERF1 interacts with the oncogenic receptor HER2/neu, stabilizing it and promoting downstream signaling, which may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis (Bellizzi2010NHERF1EBP50).

NHERF1 also functions as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing β-catenin at the plasma membrane, crucial for maintaining cell-cell junctions. Its deficiency leads to impaired β-catenin localization, reduced E-cadherin levels, and increased N-cadherin levels, promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition and increased cell motility (Kreimann2007Cortical). In breast cancer, loss of NHERF1 expression is associated with enhanced Wnt-induced β-catenin activation and increased cell proliferation (Wheeler2010Direct).

In renal conditions, NHERF1 mutations are linked to impaired phosphate transport, leading to conditions like hypophosphatemia. These mutations disrupt interactions with NPT2A, affecting phosphate homeostasis (Mamonova2021Noncanonical). NHERF1 mutations also result in increased cAMP generation by parathyroid hormone, altering renal phosphate handling (Karim2008NHERF1Mutations).

## Interactions
NHERF1 (NHERF family PDZ scaffold protein 1) is a scaffold protein that interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling. It contains two PDZ domains and a C-terminal ezrin-binding domain (EBD), which facilitate its interactions with multiple partners. NHERF1 interacts with the membrane-cytoskeleton adapter protein ezrin, which binds to the C-terminal EBD of NHERF1. This interaction disrupts the autoinhibition between the PDZ2 domain and the C-terminal tail, enhancing the PDZ domain's affinity for ligands (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic; Li2009Ezrin).

NHERF1 also interacts with G protein-coupled receptor kinase A (GRK6A), with phosphorylation at Ser-290 by GRK6A being critical for NHERF1's cellular activity (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic). The protein binds to the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1, specifically at a site encompassing the GYGF loop, which is crucial for the interaction (Liedtke2004Role).

Mutations in NHERF1, such as L110V, R153Q, and E225K, affect its binding affinity and kinetics with ezrin and other partners, impacting its function and leading to conditions like nephrolithiasis and bone demineralization (Bhattacharya2019Dynamic).
