# ARHGAP28

## Overview
ARHGAP28 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 28, which is a member of the RhoGAP family. This protein functions as a regulatory molecule that inactivates RhoA, a small GTPase, by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby converting it from an active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state. This inactivation is crucial for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and tension (Yeung2014Arhgap28; KASUYA2016RhoA). Rho GTPase activating protein 28 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it modulates signaling pathways that are essential for maintaining cellular dynamics and tissue development (Yeung2014Arhgap28). Despite its critical role in cellular function, studies have shown that ARHGAP28-null mice are viable, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms by other RhoGAPs (Yeung2014Arhgap28).

## Function
ARHGAP28 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by inactivating RhoA, a small GTPase involved in actin filament organization. This inactivation leads to the downregulation of stress fibers, which are structures composed of actin filaments that contribute to cellular tension and mechanical stiffness of tissues (Yeung2014Arhgap28). ARHGAP28 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates signaling pathways that affect cell shape and motility (Yeung2014Arhgap28).

In healthy human cells, ARHGAP28 functions to convert activated RhoA, which is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), into its inactive form bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). This conversion is crucial for maintaining the balance of RhoA activity, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell cycle progression (KASUYA2016RhoA). The regulation of RhoA by ARHGAP28 is important for maintaining balanced signaling pathways that influence cell fate and tissue development (Yeung2014Arhgap28).

Despite its significant role in actin reorganization, ARHGAP28-null mice are viable and appear normal, suggesting possible compensation by other RhoGAPs, such as ARHGAP6 (Yeung2014Arhgap28).
