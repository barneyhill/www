# KRTAP9-4

## Overview
KRTAP9-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 9-4, a member of the KAP9 family, which is characterized by its ultrahigh sulfur content. This protein is primarily involved in the structural integrity and mechanical strength of hair fibers, functioning by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. The protein is notable for its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the stability and resilience of hair. KRTAP9-4 is predominantly expressed in the hair cortex, playing a critical role in the later stages of hair keratinization, where it aids in the development of a hard and compact hair fiber (Rogers2006Human).

## Structure
The KRTAP9-4 gene encodes a keratin-associated protein that is part of the KAP9 family, known for its ultrahigh sulfur content. These proteins are characterized by a high cysteine content, ranging from 31.3% to 32.7% mol, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds crucial for the protein's structural stability (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP9-4 includes a variety of pentameric monocysteine and dicysteine-containing repeat structures. These repeats contribute to the protein's heterogeneity in size and are rich in proline, serine, and glycine, with serine being particularly abundant (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP9-4 proteins contain two domains with family-specific amino acid sequence motifs, distinguishing them from other KAP families like KAP4 (Rogers2006Human). The secondary structure likely involves alpha-helices, typical of keratin-associated proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, a common feature in proteins with high cysteine content. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with keratin intermediate filaments, although specific interactions for KRTAP9-4 are not detailed in the available sources. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are possible, but specific modifications for KRTAP9-4 are not mentioned in the context.

## Function
KRTAP9-4 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically within the KAP9 family, which is characterized by ultrahigh sulfur content. These proteins are integral to the structure and function of hair, interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to provide mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). KRTAP9-4 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the formation and integrity of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

The KAP9 proteins, including KRTAP9-4, are known for their heterogeneous size and the presence of pentameric monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing repeat structures. These structures are rich in cysteine, proline, serine, and glycine, with serine being particularly abundant. This composition allows KRTAP9-4 to form strong disulfide bonds with keratin, enhancing the durability and elasticity of hair (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP9-4 expression is associated with the differentiated portion of the hair cortex, indicating its role in the later stages of hair keratinization. This expression pattern is crucial for the development of a hard and compact hair fiber, as KRTAP9-4 and other KAPs cross-link with keratin intermediate filaments to reinforce the hair structure (Rogers2006Human).
