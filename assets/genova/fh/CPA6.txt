# CPA6

## Overview
The CPA6 gene encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase A6, a member of the M14 metallocarboxypeptidase family, which is primarily involved in the extracellular processing of peptide hormones and neuropeptides. This enzyme is secreted into the extracellular matrix, where it functions by cleaving C-terminal amino acids from its substrates, thereby modulating their activity. Carboxypeptidase A6 exhibits a preference for large hydrophobic amino acids, influencing various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and blood pressure regulation. The gene is notably expressed in the olfactory bulb and embryonic brain, implicating its role in neurodevelopment. Mutations in CPA6 have been associated with several clinical conditions, including Duane syndrome and epilepsy, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Salzmann2011Carboxypeptidase; Lyons2008Characterization; Lyons2010Substrate).

## Structure


## Function
Carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) is an extracellular matrix-bound enzyme that plays a significant role in processing peptide hormones and neuropeptides by cleaving C-terminal amino acids. It is part of the M14 metallocarboxypeptidase family and is secreted through the constitutive secretory pathway, indicating its activity outside the cell rather than intracellularly (Lyons2008Characterization). CPA6 is highly expressed in the adult mouse olfactory bulb and broadly in the embryonic brain, suggesting its involvement in neurodevelopmental processes (Lyons2008Characterization).

CPA6 exhibits a preference for cleaving large hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids such as phenylalanine, leucine, tyrosine, methionine, and tryptophan, while showing lower activity towards smaller amino acids (Lyons2010Substrate). This specificity allows CPA6 to process neuropeptides like Met- and Leu-enkephalin, angiotensin I, and neurotensin, converting them into inactive forms or, in the case of angiotensin I, into the active angiotensin II, thus influencing neurotransmission and blood pressure regulation (Lyons2008Characterization).

The enzyme's activity in the extracellular matrix at a neutral pH suggests its role in modulating signaling pathways and contributing to the regulation of neuropeptides in the brain's extracellular environment (Lyons2008Characterization). CPA6's function in healthy human cells is linked to its ability to process biologically relevant peptides, impacting processes like morphogenesis and neurodevelopment (Lyons2010Substrate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CPA6 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. One significant association is with Duane syndrome, a congenital eye movement disorder. Disruptions in the CPA6 gene, such as mutations or chromosomal translocations, have been identified in patients with Duane syndrome, suggesting a role for CPA6 in the proper development of cranial nerve connections (Lyons2008Characterization).

CPA6 mutations are also implicated in epilepsy, including temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and febrile seizures (FS). Specific mutations, such as p.Ala270Val and p.Gly267Arg, have been identified in patients with these conditions. These mutations can affect CPA6 secretion and activity, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of epilepsy (Salzmann2011Carboxypeptidase; Sapio2012Naturally).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CPA6 is significantly upregulated, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This suggests CPA6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC (Huang2019Carboxypeptidase).

CPA6 expression is also altered in ulcerative colitis (UC), where it is down-regulated in active disease states. This down-regulation may serve as a biomarker for active UC, indicating its involvement in inflammatory processes (Wang2020Carboxypeptidase).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase A6 (CPA6) is known to interact with various components in the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is secreted into the ECM and its activity is influenced by interactions with negatively charged glycoproteins, which may help maintain its active site accessible for substrate processing (Lyons2008Characterization). CPA6's attachment to the ECM can be blocked by heparin, a negatively charged glycoprotein, suggesting that CPA6's basic residues interact with the acidic components of the ECM (Lyons2008Characterization).

CPA6 is processed into its active form by furin or related proprotein convertases, indicating a transient interaction with these enzymes during its maturation process (Lyons2008Characterization). The enzyme is also inhibited by specific inhibitors such as benzylsuccinic acid and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, with IC50 values of 7 µM and 50 nM, respectively, highlighting its potential interactions with inhibitory molecules (Lyons2008Characterization).

CPA6 does not co-localize with carboxypeptidase E (CPE), indicating that it follows a different secretory pathway, specifically the constitutive secretory pathway, rather than the regulated pathway (Lyons2008Characterization). These interactions and processing pathways suggest CPA6's role in the extracellular processing of neuropeptides and other substrates.
