# BIN2

## Overview
BIN2, or Bridging Integrator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within hematopoietic cells. The BIN2 protein is categorized as a membrane-sculpting N-BAR domain protein, which plays a crucial role in membrane binding and remodeling. It is predominantly expressed in white blood cells, such as mast cells, B cells, and macrophages, where it influences cell motility, adhesion, and phagocytosis. The protein's structure includes an N-terminal N-BAR domain that facilitates membrane curvature and interaction, and a C-terminal region that interacts with SH3 domain-containing proteins. BIN2 is also involved in calcium signaling in platelets, interacting with proteins critical for calcium store release and store-operated calcium entry, thus playing a significant role in thrombosis and thrombo-inflammatory responses (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2; Volz2020BIN2).

## Structure
The BIN2 protein is characterized by its N-terminal N-BAR domain, which is crucial for its role in membrane binding and remodeling. This domain forms a dimeric structure with an elongated, banana-shaped conformation typical of BAR modules, facilitating membrane curvature and interaction (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2). The N-BAR domain includes an amphipathic helix (H0) that is essential for membrane binding, with specific hydrophobic residues such as F13 and F21 playing a significant role in this interaction (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2).

The C-terminal region of BIN2 is rich in glutamates, serines, and prolines, and is heavily phosphorylated. This region lacks strong homology to other proteins and is most divergent across species. It facilitates interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins like Endophilin A2 and a-PIX (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2). BIN2 does not possess a C-terminal SH3 domain, which is a common feature in other BAR family proteins (Ge2000Bin2).

The protein is predominantly alpha-helical, as revealed by structural analysis, and its molecular mass is approximately 25,996 Da for a monomer (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2). BIN2 is expressed in various leucocytic cell lines and tissues, with its expression pattern suggesting possible alternate splicing (Ge2000Bin2).

## Function
BIN2, also known as Bridging Integrator 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in hematopoietic cells. It is predominantly expressed in white blood cells, including mast cells, B cells, and macrophages, where it influences cell motility, adhesion, and phagocytosis (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2). BIN2 contains an N-BAR domain, which is crucial for its membrane-sculpting activities, allowing it to associate with actin-rich structures on the plasma membrane and influence the formation of podosomes, which are essential for leukocyte chemotactic migration (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2).

In platelets, BIN2 is involved in calcium signaling, interacting with proteins such as STIM1 and IP3R, which are critical for calcium store release and store-operated calcium entry (Volz2020BIN2). This interaction is vital for platelet activation and function in thrombosis and thrombo-inflammatory responses (Volz2020BIN2). BIN2's role in these processes highlights its importance in regulating cellular dynamics and immune responses, particularly in the context of blood cell function and migration (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2; Volz2020BIN2).

## Interactions
The human gene BIN2 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes by interacting with various proteins, particularly in the context of podosomes in leukocytes. BIN2 is a membrane-sculpting N-BAR protein that localizes to podosomes, which are actin-rich structures involved in cell motility and phagocytosis. It interacts with proteins containing SH3 domains, such as a-PIX, b-PIX, and Git2, which are part of a complex located at podosomal ring-like structures. The C-terminus of BIN2 contains polyproline regions that mediate these interactions. In vitro pull-down experiments have demonstrated that the SH3 domain of a-PIX directly binds to the C-terminus of BIN2 (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2).

BIN2 also interacts with Endophilin A2, a protein located at podosome-like adhesions. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminus of BIN2, as no association was observed through N-BAR heterodimerization (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2). These interactions suggest that BIN2 functions as an adaptor for SH3-domain-containing proteins at podosomes, influencing podosome function and dynamics. BIN2's role in leukocytes includes influencing podosome formation, motility, and phagocytosis, with its knockdown resulting in decreased cell migration and increased phagocytosis (SánchezBarrena2012Bin2).
