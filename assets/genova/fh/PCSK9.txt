# PCSK9

## Overview
PCSK9, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, is a gene located on chromosome 1p32.3 that encodes a serine protease involved in cholesterol metabolism. The protein product of PCSK9 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of liver cells, influencing cholesterol levels in the bloodstream. PCSK9 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to become active, facilitating the degradation of LDLR by binding to its epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain. This interaction leads to the transport of LDLR to lysosomes for degradation, thereby reducing the number of receptors available for cholesterol uptake. The activity of PCSK9 is modulated by various factors, including sterol-response element binding proteins and statins, and is primarily active in the liver, with expression also noted in the intestine and pancreas. Mutations in the PCSK9 gene can lead to significant clinical outcomes, such as hypercholesterolemia or hypocholesterolemia, depending on whether they are gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, respectively (Guo2020PCSK9; Seidah2021The).

## Structure
The PCSK9 protein is a 692-amino-acid glycoprotein encoded by the PCSK9 gene, located on chromosome 1p32.3. It is synthesized as a 75 kDa soluble zymogen, which undergoes autocatalytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum to release a 14 kDa propeptide, resulting in a mature enzyme of approximately 60 kDa (Tibolla2011Proprotein; Awan2020Structural). The protein structure includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-30), a prodomain (amino acids 31-152), a catalytic domain (amino acids 153-404), and a cysteine-histidine-rich hinge region (amino acids 405-454) (Awan2020Structural).

The prodomain acts as a chaperone and inhibitor, remaining bound to the catalytic site even after autocatalysis (Kwon2008Molecular). The catalytic domain contains the proteolytic active site essential for autocatalytic cleavage (Awan2020Structural). PCSK9's structure has been modeled using the I-TASSER webserver, and its crystal structure is available in the protein data bank under the identifier 2P4E (Awan2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications of PCSK9 include N-linked glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, although their physiological significance remains unclear (Tibolla2011Proprotein). PCSK9 can also form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (Awan2020Structural).

## Function
PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a crucial regulator of cholesterol metabolism in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by modulating the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on the surface of liver cells. PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to become active. The active form of PCSK9 binds to the EGF-A domain of LDLR, facilitating its transport to lysosomes where it is degraded, thus reducing the number of LDL receptors available for cholesterol uptake (Wiciński2017PCSK9; Seidah2021The).

This process is essential for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, as it influences the levels of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. PCSK9's activity is regulated by various factors, including sterol-response element binding proteins (SREBP) and statins, which can upregulate its expression (Schulz2015Molecular; Seidah2021The). The protein is primarily active in the liver but is also expressed in other tissues such as the intestine and pancreas (Schulz2015Molecular; Seidah2021The). By controlling LDLR degradation, PCSK9 plays a significant role in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCSK9 gene are clinically significant due to their impact on cholesterol metabolism, leading to various cholesterol-related conditions. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9, such as p.S127R, p.F216L, p.D374Y, p.R218S, and p.R357H, are associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). These mutations result in increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), contributing to conditions like coronary heart disease (CHD), premature myocardial infarction, and stroke (Guo2020PCSK9; Abifadel2009Mutations). The p.D374Y variant, in particular, enhances PCSK9's affinity for LDL receptors, preventing their recycling and leading to their degradation (Guo2020PCSK9).

Conversely, loss-of-function mutations, such as p.C679X, p.Y142X, and p.R46L, are linked to hypocholesterolemia, characterized by low plasma LDL-C levels and a reduced risk of CHD (Abifadel2009Mutations). These mutations provide protection against coronary artery disease by increasing LDL-C clearance (Guo2020PCSK9).

PCSK9 mutations can also interact with LDLR mutations, leading to a severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype similar to homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (Abifadel2009Mutations). The gene's expression in various tissues suggests potential associations with other diseases, although these remain to be fully explored (Abifadel2009Mutations).

## Interactions
PCSK9 interacts primarily with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), binding specifically to its epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGF-A) domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of LDLR degradation, which affects cholesterol metabolism. The binding of PCSK9 to LDLR is calcium-dependent and involves specific residues such as Arg-194 and Phe-379, which form critical interactions with the EGF-A domain (Kwon2008Molecular; Zhang2007Binding). The interaction is also pH-dependent, with stronger binding observed at acidic pH levels, which may influence LDLR recycling and degradation (Zhang2007Binding).

PCSK9 also interacts with other receptors, including ApoER2 and mouse VLDLR, although with lower affinity compared to LDLR. The EGF-A domain is essential for these interactions as well, and synthetic EGF-A peptides can inhibit PCSK9 binding to these receptors (Shan2008PCSK9). The LDL receptor-associated protein (RAP) can inhibit PCSK9 binding to these receptors, suggesting involvement of additional receptor domains (Shan2008PCSK9).

Peptides derived from lupin protein have been shown to inhibit the PCSK9-LDLR interaction, offering potential therapeutic strategies for managing cholesterol levels (Lammi2016Lupin). These interactions highlight the role of PCSK9 in cholesterol homeostasis and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.
