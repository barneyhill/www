# MRTO4

## Overview
The MRTO4 gene encodes the MRT4 homolog, a ribosome maturation factor that plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of ribosomes, specifically in the maturation of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit. This protein is categorized as a ribosomal assembly factor and is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport and assembly of ribosomal components. MRT4 initially binds to pre-60S subunits in the nucleolus and is later replaced by the ribosomal protein uL10 in the cytoplasm, a process essential for the formation of the ribosomal stalk structure (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular; Lo2009Ribosome). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its distribution and interaction with ribosomal components, particularly under stress conditions (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). MRTO4 has also been implicated in various clinical contexts, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient prognosis (Zheng2023Unveiling).

## Structure
The MRTO4 protein, also known as the MRT4 homolog, ribosome maturation factor, is involved in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the maturation of pre-60S ribosomal subunits. The human version of MRTO4 contains a C-terminal extension with acidic amino acids and serine residues, which is similar to the C-terminal part of the ribosomal P protein uL10 (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). This C-terminal region undergoes phosphorylation by CK2 kinase at serines S229, S233, and S235, which plays a role in the protein's function during stress conditions (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). The phosphorylation status of MRTO4 affects its nucleocytoplasmic distribution, particularly under stress, suggesting a regulatory role in ribosome biogenesis (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular).

The MRTO4 protein shares structural similarities with the ribosomal P0 protein, and both proteins bind to the same site on the 25S rRNA in yeast, indicating a functional relationship during ribosome assembly (RodríguezMateos2009The). The protein's interaction with ribosomal components is crucial for its role in ribosome maturation, and its C-terminal region is unique to higher eukaryotes, suggesting a divergence in function compared to yeast (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular).

## Function
The MRTO4 gene encodes the human Mrt4 protein, which plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, specifically in the maturation of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit. Mrt4 is a trans-acting factor that initially binds to pre-60S subunits in the nucleolus and is later replaced by the uL10 protein in the cytoplasm, a process facilitated by the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP12 (human orthologue of yeast Yvh1) (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular; Lo2009Ribosome). This exchange is essential for the formation of the ribosomal stalk structure, which is necessary for the recruitment and activation of translation GTPases, ensuring the functional maturation of 60S subunits (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular).

The C-terminal region of Mrt4 contains serine residues that are phosphorylated by CK2 kinase, a modification that may regulate ribosomal biogenesis during cellular stress (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). Phosphorylation affects the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Mrt4, particularly during nucleolar stress, suggesting a regulatory role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular stress response pathways (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). Mrt4's proper localization and release from ribosomal subunits are crucial for its function, with DUSP12 being necessary for this process (Lo2009Ribosome).

## Clinical Significance
MRTO4 (MRT4 homolog, ribosome maturation factor) has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to its altered expression levels. Studies have shown that MRTO4 is predominantly overexpressed in HCC, which is associated with poorer overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in patients (Zheng2023Unveiling). High MRTO4 expression correlates with various adverse clinical features, including advanced pathologic T stage, higher histologic grade, vascular invasion, and elevated AFP levels, indicating its role as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients (Zheng2023Unveiling).

MRTO4's overexpression is linked to immune system interactions, showing a positive correlation with Th2 cells and NK CD56+ cells, and a negative correlation with Th17 cells, NK cells, neutrophils, DC cells, CD8 T cells, and cytotoxic cells. This suggests that MRTO4 may influence tumor immunity by altering the expression of specific chemokines and immune molecules (Zheng2023Unveiling). Functional enrichment analyses have identified pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway and RNA splicing as enriched among MRTO4-related genes, highlighting potential genetic biomarkers for HCC (Zheng2023Unveiling). These findings suggest that MRTO4 could serve as a biomarker for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

## Interactions
The MRTO4 protein, also known as human Mrt4, is involved in ribosome biogenesis and interacts with pre-60S ribosomal subunits. It shares significant sequence homology with the ribosomal protein P0 and binds to the same site in the 25S rRNA, specifically the GTPase Associated Region (GAR) (RodríguezMateos2009The). MRTO4 initially binds to pre-60S subunits in place of P0 and is later exchanged for P0 with the assistance of the dual-specificity phosphatase Yvh1 (human DUSP12) (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular; Lo2009Ribosome). This exchange is crucial for the maturation of the ribosomal stalk and the recruitment of translation factors (Lo2009Ribosome).

MRTO4 interacts with the ribosomal protein L12, forming a unique ionic contact that induces a conformational change in L12, which is stronger than the interaction between P0 and L12 (RodríguezMateos2009The). The C-terminal region of MRTO4 is phosphorylated by CK2 kinase, which may regulate its interactions during cellular stress conditions (MichalecWawiorka2015Molecular). These interactions highlight MRTO4's role as a ribosomal assembly factor, facilitating the transition of pre-ribosomal particles from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm and ensuring proper ribosome assembly and function.
