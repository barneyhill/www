# CIP2A

## Overview
CIP2A, or cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, is a gene that encodes the oncoprotein cellular inhibitor of PP2A. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation by modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical tumor suppressor. CIP2A is characterized as an inhibitor protein that interacts with PP2A to prevent the dephosphorylation of key signaling molecules, thereby maintaining their phosphorylated state and promoting oncogenic signaling pathways (Junttila2007CIP2A; Kauko2020Phosphoproteome). The protein's structure includes an Armadillo repeat domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as MYC, stabilizing them and enhancing their oncogenic potential (De2014Oncogenic; Dahlström20153D). CIP2A's overexpression is associated with various cancers, where it serves as a potential biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and a target for therapeutic intervention (Yu2013Clinical; Vaarala2010CIP2A).

## Structure
The human CIP2A protein is composed of 905 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 102 kDa (Dahlström20153D). Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains crucial for its function. The secondary structure of CIP2A is predominantly α-helical, with the Armadillo repeat (ArmRP) domain forming a right-handed superhelix composed of 18 helices and six ArmRP motifs (Dahlström20153D). This domain spans amino acids 47-308 and is characterized by motifs of 42 amino acids each, forming three α-helices (Dahlström20153D).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a superhelix, creating a concave central groove that is positively charged and crucial for protein-protein interactions (Dahlström20153D). This groove is involved in binding negatively charged amino acids in interaction partners, such as MYC and PP2A (Dahlström20153D).

CIP2A may form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although this is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. The protein's interaction with PP2A-B56α involves the N-terminal head domain, which stabilizes the interaction and is essential for CIP2A's oncogenic activity (Pavic2023Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination at lysine 647, play a role in regulating CIP2A stability (Pavic2023Structural).

## Function
CIP2A (cellular inhibitor of PP2A) is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and proliferation by modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a critical tumor suppressor. In healthy human cells, CIP2A primarily functions in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences key signaling pathways, including MYC signaling (Junttila2007CIP2A). CIP2A inhibits PP2A activity, which is involved in dephosphorylating signaling molecules, thereby maintaining phosphorylation balance within the cell (Kauko2020Phosphoproteome).

CIP2A's interaction with PP2A is crucial for stabilizing the c-Myc protein by preventing its proteolytic degradation. This stabilization supports c-Myc-mediated gene expression and cell proliferation, which are essential processes in both normal and malignant cells (Junttila2007CIP2A). CIP2A achieves this by inhibiting PP2A activity toward serine 62 on c-Myc, a modification necessary for c-Myc stability (Junttila2007CIP2A).

The protein's interaction with the PP2A-B56α complex is mediated by its N-terminal head domain, which is essential for its function and stability in cancer cells (Pavic2023Structural). This interaction prevents the PP2A-B56α complex from recognizing and dephosphorylating its substrates, thereby influencing various cellular processes (Pavic2023Structural).

## Clinical Significance
CIP2A, encoded by the KIAA1524 gene, is an oncoprotein that plays a significant role in various cancers by inhibiting the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Overexpression of CIP2A is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and poor prognosis in several malignancies. In breast cancer, CIP2A expression is associated with high histological grade, lymph node metastasis, and triple-negative breast cancer, serving as a potential biomarker for chemotherapeutic sensitivity and prognosis (Yu2013Clinical). In prostate cancer, CIP2A is overexpressed and correlates with high Gleason scores and high-risk tumors, indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness (Guo2015CIP2A; Vaarala2010CIP2A).

CIP2A is also implicated in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma, where its expression correlates with tumor stage and lymph node status, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Xue2012CIP2A). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high CIP2A mRNA levels are linked to poor tumor differentiation and intrahepatic metastasis, indicating a role in tumor progression (Huang2012Expression). Additionally, CIP2A overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in solid tumors, including lung and colorectal cancers (Tang2018Prognostic).

## Interactions
CIP2A (cellular inhibitor of PP2A) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a significant role in oncogenic processes. It interacts with the PP2A-B56α complex, inhibiting its tumor suppressor activity through a mechanism described as 'hijack and mute'. This involves displacing the A-subunit from the PP2A-B56α trimer and inhibiting B56α's binding to LxxIxE motif substrates, forming a CIP2A-B56α-PP2Ac pseudotrimer (Pavic2023Structural). CIP2A also interacts with MYC, stabilizing it and preventing its degradation, which enhances MYC's oncogenic transcriptional activity (De2014Oncogenic).

In Th17 cells, CIP2A interacts with proteins such as DOCK8, Lyn, and STAT3, which are involved in T cell signaling pathways. It also associates with proteins related to viral response and interferon signaling, including IFI16, IRF4, and STAT1 (Khan2019Protein). CIP2A's interaction with PP2A is crucial for its function, as it supports the activity of oncoproteins like Akt, MYC, and E2F1, promoting malignancy through PP2A inhibition (Khan2019Protein). These interactions highlight CIP2A's role in regulating oncogenic pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
