# PPHLN1

## Overview
The PPHLN1 gene encodes the protein periphilin 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including epigenetic regulation and epithelial differentiation. Periphilin 1 is characterized by its structural features, such as a hydrophilic N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain with heptad repeats, which facilitate dimerization and interaction with other proteins (Larsen2017Splice; Kazerounian2003Characterization). Functionally, periphilin 1 is a component of the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, playing a crucial role in gene silencing through the deposition of the H3K9me3 mark (Prigozhin2020Periphilin). Additionally, it contributes to the formation of the cornified cell envelope in keratinocytes, indicating its importance in maintaining epidermal integrity (Kazerounian2003Characterization). Periphilin 1's involvement in protein interactions and its role in cancer-related genetic fusions, such as the FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, underscore its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Sia2015Massive).

## Structure
The PPHLN1 gene encodes the periphilin-1 protein, which is characterized by a hydrophilic flexible N-terminal half and a C-terminal half composed of heptad repeats that potentially form four α-helices (Larsen2017Splice; Kazerounian2003Characterization). The C-terminal region is structurally homologous to the homodimerization domain of vitellogenin proteins, which are involved in lipid transport and storage, and is sufficient for dimerization (Kazerounian2003Characterization). The protein also contains a putative nuclear localization signal (aa 110-116) and a potential nuclear export signal (aa 320-327) (Kazerounian2003Characterization).

Periphilin-1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. For instance, the PPHLN1Sp1 variant lacks a 57 bp region in exon 7, leading to a protein with 354 amino acids, while the PPHLN1Sp2 variant lacks exons 4 and 7, affecting both the N-terminal and middle regions of the protein (Larsen2017Splice). The protein's C-terminal domain can be cross-linked by tissue-type transglutaminase, indicating its potential involvement in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (Kazerounian2003Characterization). The protein is also a substrate for transglutaminase 2, which cross-links periphilin, forming aggregates (Kazerounian2003Characterization).

## Function
The PPHLN1 gene encodes the protein periphilin, which plays a significant role in epigenetic silencing through its involvement in the HUSH (Human Silencing Hub) complex. Periphilin's N-terminal domain (NTD) is crucial for HUSH-dependent silencing, contributing to the deposition of the H3K9me3 epigenetic mark by SETDB1 at HUSH-regulated loci. This process is essential for maintaining gene silencing in human cells (Prigozhin2020Periphilin). The NTD of periphilin is intrinsically disordered and contains clusters of alternating charges, which are important for its function in the HUSH complex (Prigozhin2020Periphilin).

Periphilin is also involved in the structure of the keratinocyte cornified envelope, suggesting a role in epithelial differentiation and the maintenance of epidermal integrity (Kazerounian2003Characterization). The protein is highly insoluble and localizes to the nucleus and cell periphery, indicating its involvement in nuclear functions and regulatory interactions between the cell periphery and the nucleus (Kazerounian2003Characterization). Additionally, periphilin interacts with periplakin, a component of the cornified cell envelope, further supporting its role in epithelial cell biology (Kazerounian2003Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
The PPHLN1 gene has been implicated in various cancers through its involvement in genetic fusions and alternative splicing events. In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a significant finding is the FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion, which occurs in approximately 16% of cases. This fusion results from a chromosomal translocation and leads to constitutive activation of FGFR2, promoting oncogenic signaling pathways. The FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion is considered a targetable alteration, with potential therapeutic interventions using FGFR2 inhibitors showing promise in preclinical studies (Li2020Functions; Sia2015Massive).

In group 3 medulloblastoma, PPHLN1 is involved in OTX2-mediated alternative splicing, which affects stem cell properties and tumor growth. Alterations in PPHLN1 splicing, induced by splice-blocking morpholinos, lead to changes in cell viability and tumoursphere characteristics, suggesting its role in maintaining the stem cell state and viability of these cancer cells. Targeting PPHLN1 splicing has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for this type of medulloblastoma (Saulnier2024A).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPHLN1 in cancer, particularly through its involvement in genetic fusions and splicing alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
Periphilin 1 (PPHLN1) is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes. PPHLN1 shares structural similarities with the BFARv3 isoform, which interacts with proteins involved in RNA processing and splicing, such as SFPQ and NONO, members of the DBHS family of RNA-binding proteins. These interactions imply that PPHLN1 may also engage with similar proteins or nucleic acids, particularly in the context of RNA metabolism and stress response (Mrowiec2021The).

In the context of cancer, PPHLN1 is part of a fusion protein with FGFR2, identified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). The FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion protein is constitutively active, leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of downstream MAP kinase ERK1/2. This fusion protein has been shown to enhance cell viability, clonogenic, and migratory capacities, and its effects can be suppressed by FGFR2 inhibitors (Sia2015Massive). The FGFR2-PPHLN1 fusion is prevalent in iCCA, with significant implications for the disease's pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targeting (Sia2015Massive).
