# NAA15

## Overview
NAA15 is a gene that encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 15, NatA auxiliary subunit, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the NatA complex, which is involved in the co-translational N-terminal acetylation of proteins. This protein is categorized as an auxiliary subunit, essential for anchoring the NatA complex to the ribosome, thereby facilitating the acetylation of a significant portion of the human proteome (Arnesen2009A; Van2021Charting). The NAA15 protein is characterized by its structural features, including tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs and a metazoan-specific Sel1-like repeat region, which are crucial for its interaction with the catalytic subunit NAA10 and the ribosome (Deng2021Protein; grunwald2020structural). Mutations in the NAA15 gene have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders and congenital anomalies, underscoring its clinical significance (Ritter2020Variants; Tian2022Possible).

## Structure
The NAA15 protein is an auxiliary subunit of the NatA complex, which plays a crucial role in N-terminal acetylation. Structurally, NAA15 is characterized by a series of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that form a ring-like structure. This configuration encircles the catalytic NAA10 subunit, facilitating extensive hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions between the two proteins (Deng2021Protein). The TPR motifs are essential for the tertiary structure of NAA15, contributing to its ability to induce conformational changes in NAA10, which are necessary for substrate-specific recognition and catalysis (Deng2021Protein).

In terms of quaternary structure, NAA15 anchors the NatA complex to the ribosome, which is vital for its function in co-translational N-terminal acetylation. This anchoring is mediated by interactions with ribosomal RNA expansion segments and the nascent polypeptide chain (grunwald2020structural). The human NAA15 protein also contains a metazoan-specific Sel1-like repeat region at its C-terminal end, which enhances the stability of the human NatA complex (Deng2021Protein).

Mutations in NAA15, such as p.Lys450Glu, can disrupt interactions within the complex, affecting its stability and activity (Lyon2023Expanding). These structural features underscore the importance of NAA15 in maintaining the functional integrity of the NatA complex.

## Function
NAA15 is a crucial component of the NatA complex, which is involved in the co-translational N-terminal acetylation of proteins, a modification that affects protein stability, folding, localization, and complex formation (Arnesen2009A; Van2021Charting). NAA15 acts as an auxiliary subunit, anchoring the NatA complex to the ribosome, which is essential for its function in acetylating up to 50% of mammalian proteins (Van2021Charting). This acetylation process is vital for the modification of a significant portion of the human proteome, affecting 80% of cytosolic proteins (Lyon2023Expanding).

In healthy human cells, NAA15 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Knockdown of NAA15 leads to decreased levels of NAA10 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, highlighting its importance in maintaining cell viability (Arnesen2009A). NAA15 is also expressed in most adult human tissues, with higher expression in highly proliferative tissues, indicating its role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Starheim2009Composition). Its interaction with other proteins, such as HYPK, suggests regulatory roles beyond its enzymatic activity, potentially influencing protein aggregation and stability (Starheim2012Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAA15 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and other conditions. NAA15-related neurodevelopmental syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, and motor impairments. These disorders often present with overlapping features such as dysmorphic facial features and congenital anomalies (Ritter2020Variants; Tian2022Possible). Pathogenic variants in NAA15 have been linked to motor disorders, including dystonia and adult-onset parkinsonism (Makwana2024A). 

NAA15 mutations are also implicated in congenital heart defects, such as pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and atrial septal defects (Pesz2018Phenotypic; Ritter2020Variants). The gene's role in neuronal proliferation and migration is critical, and its disruption can lead to conditions like epilepsy and ADHD (Pesz2018Phenotypic; Tian2022Possible). 

Studies have shown that NAA15 variants can cause mild to moderate developmental delays, with some patients experiencing catch-up growth in certain developmental domains (Tian2022Possible). The clinical spectrum of NAA15-related disorders is broad, with significant phenotypic overlap with NAA10-related syndromes, though typically presenting milder phenotypes (Makwana2024A).

## Interactions
NAA15, a component of the NatA complex, plays a crucial role in N-terminal acetylation by interacting with several proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with NAA10, the catalytic subunit, and this interaction is essential for the acetylation of up to 50% of mammalian proteins. NAA15 acts as a ribosomal anchor, binding to ribosomal RNA expansion segments, which positions the NatA complex beneath the polypeptide exit tunnel, facilitating co-translational acetylation (Aksnes2019Cotranslational; Van2021Charting).

NAA15 also interacts with the chaperone-like protein HYPK, forming a stable heterotrimeric complex. HYPK binds to the C-terminus of NAA15 and acts as a negative regulator of NatA's acetylation activity by blocking the NAA10 active site (Weyer2017Structural). This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, indicating a high-affinity binding (Weyer2017Structural).

Variants in the NAA15 gene can affect its interactions, such as the p.Lys450Glu mutant, which disrupts the NAA10-IP6 interaction, destabilizing the NAA10/NAA15 complex. Other variants, like p.Arg27Gly and p.Ala585Thr, are located in regions implicated in ribosome-binding, potentially altering NatA cotranslational activity (Lyon2023Expanding).
