# MATCAP1

## Overview
MATCAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase 1, which is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein functions as a carboxypeptidase, specifically removing tyrosine residues from tubulin, a process that is crucial for the stability and function of microtubules. These structural components are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, intracellular transport, and signaling pathways. The activity of MATCAP1 is particularly significant in the context of heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where it has been associated with the regulation of detyrosinated tubulin levels. This suggests a potential compensatory role in tubulin tyrosination, although its precise functions in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated (Pietsch2023Chronic).

## Function
MATCAP1, or microtubule associated tyrosine carboxypeptidase 1, plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics by removing tyrosine residues from tubulin. This post-translational modification is significant for microtubule stability and function, impacting various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and signaling pathways. The activity of MATCAP1 is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function in healthy human cells (Pietsch2023Chronic).

In the context of heart disease, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), MATCAP1 has been implicated in maintaining elevated levels of detyrosinated tubulin, which is not fully normalized by tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) therapy. This suggests that MATCAP1 may play a compensatory role in the process of tubulin tyrosination, although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed in the available studies (Pietsch2023Chronic). The regulation of tubulin isoforms and associated proteins by MATCAP1 highlights its importance in the complex molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction and potentially other cellular processes (Pietsch2023Chronic).
