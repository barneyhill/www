# KRTAP21-3

## Overview
KRTAP21-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 21-3, which is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral components of the hair and nail structure, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the keratin matrix. The KAP family is known for its involvement in the cross-linking of keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair and nails. The keratin-associated protein 21-3 is characterized by its high cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, essential for the structural integrity of keratinized tissues. Variations in the KRTAP21-3 gene have been studied for their potential impact on hair texture and other phenotypic traits (Qiu2020aarFDC).
