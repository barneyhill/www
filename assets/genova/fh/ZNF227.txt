# ZNF227

## Overview
ZNF227 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 227, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind DNA through zinc finger motifs. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF227 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, and is predominantly active in the nucleus where it modulates the transcriptional landscape of the cell. The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to physiological responses, such as blood pressure regulation, and it has been implicated in clinical conditions, including cancer and behavioral traits (Shannon2003Differential; Xu2020Environmental; Lim2017Modulation).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF227, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable them to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. ZNF227 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the transcription of target genes (Shannon2003Differential). 

The protein is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell. This nuclear activity is crucial for its role in controlling the expression of genes that are important for maintaining normal cellular functions and responses to environmental changes (Shannon2003Differential). 

Research has shown that DNA methylation changes in ZNF227 can be associated with physiological responses, such as blood pressure regulation in response to environmental stressors like low ambient temperatures. Specifically, methylation at certain CpG sites within the ZNF227 gene has been linked to changes in diastolic blood pressure, suggesting a role in cardiovascular health (Lim2017Modulation). However, the direct function of ZNF227 in healthy human cells beyond these regulatory roles is not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF227, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in gene expression regulation. High expression of ZNF227 is associated with an aggression phenotype, suggesting its involvement in behavioral traits (Xu2020Environmental). Additionally, the methylation status of ZNF227 is influenced by short-term ambient temperature changes, which may have implications for cardiovascular health, as DNA methylation on related genes can mediate the effects of cold temperatures on blood pressure and cardiovascular events (Xu2020Environmental).

In the context of cancer, ZNF227 has been studied in relation to Wilms tumor (WT), a pediatric kidney cancer. A study identified a loss of the chromosomal region 19q13.31, which includes ZNF227, in a patient with WT. Although this loss has not been previously associated with WT, it suggests that ZNF227 may play a role in tumor development, warranting further functional studies (Cabral2015Array).

Furthermore, an eQTL association analysis found that insertions on chromosome 19 can decrease the expression of ZNF227, indicating that genetic variations can impact its expression levels and potentially contribute to disease phenotypes (Ashouri2021Characterization).
