# LARP7

## Overview
LARP7 is a gene that encodes the La ribonucleoprotein 7, a transcriptional regulator protein that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism and transcription regulation. The LARP7 protein is a member of the La-related protein family and is characterized by its La module and extended RNA recognition motif (xRRM), which are essential for its function in binding and stabilizing 7SK RNA. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II, as LARP7 sequesters the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in an inactive state, thereby maintaining transcriptional homeostasis (Markert2008The; Krueger2008LARP7). Additionally, LARP7 is involved in RNA modification processes, such as the 2'-O-methylation of U6 small nuclear RNA, and has been implicated in telomerase function and mRNA stability (Hasler2020The; Hasler2020Stabilize). Mutations in the LARP7 gene are linked to Alazami syndrome, a disorder characterized by intellectual disability and growth retardation, highlighting its significance in human development and disease (Wojcik2019Updating; Alazami2012Loss).

## Structure
The LARP7 protein is characterized by its La module, which includes a La-motif (LAM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM1). The La-motif is located at the N-terminus and features a specific secondary structure: α1-β1-α2-α3-β2-β3. This motif is crucial for RNA binding and is conserved across species, showing structural similarity to human hLARP7 and the telomerase-binding protein p65 in ciliates (Collopy2018LARP7). The RRM1 domain in LARP7 is smaller than typical RRMs, with a three-stranded β-sheet, and lacks a C-terminal helix, which increases accessibility to RNA-binding residues (Uchikawa2015Structural).

LARP7 also contains a C-terminal extended RNA recognition motif (xRRM), which is essential for specific binding to the 7SK RNA and the assembly of the 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex. The xRRM is characterized by an additional helix α3, which plays a crucial role in RNA binding (Basu2020Structure; Eichhorn2018Structural). The xRRM domain interacts with the SL4 stem of the RNA, contributing to the unique recognition of 7SK RNA by LARP7 (Eichhorn2018Structural).

The structural configuration of LARP7, including its La module and xRRM, is vital for its function in stabilizing the 7SK RNA and regulating transcription elongation (Uchikawa2015Structural).

## Function
LARP7 is a crucial component of the 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which regulates transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. It binds to the 7SK RNA, stabilizing the complex and sequestering the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in an inactive state. This regulation is essential for maintaining transcriptional homeostasis and proper gene expression in human cells (Markert2008The; Krueger2008LARP7).

LARP7 also plays a significant role in RNA modification, particularly in the 2'-O-methylation of U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). This modification is guided by C/D box small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and is crucial for splicing robustness, especially under stress conditions. LARP7 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the interaction between U6 snRNA and snoRNAs, which is vital for maintaining splicing fidelity and proper RNA processing (Hasler2020The).

In addition to its role in RNA modification, LARP7 is involved in the regulation of telomerase function, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Its activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to the stability and function of various RNA-protein complexes, ensuring normal cellular functions and preventing developmental disorders (Hasler2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LARP7 gene are associated with Alazami syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, and distinct facial dysmorphic features such as deep-set eyes and malar hypoplasia (Dateki2018Novel; Wojcik2019Updating). The syndrome was first identified in a consanguineous Saudi Arabian family, where a homozygous frameshift mutation in the LARP7 gene was discovered (Alazami2012Loss). These mutations often result in a loss of function, leading to a null phenotype due to the absence of LARP7 protein expression (Hollink2015Broadening; Alazami2012Loss).

LARP7 mutations can also affect telomere maintenance, as seen in Alazami syndrome patients who exhibit significantly shorter telomeres. This suggests a role for LARP7 in telomerase activity and telomere length regulation, with potential implications for telomeropathies (Holohan2016Impaired). Additionally, LARP7 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation has been linked to various cancers, including cervical and breast cancer metastasis (Eichhorn2018Structural). The gene's deficiency may also influence embryonic stem cell growth and differentiation, contributing to the etiology of primordial dwarfism observed in Alazami syndrome (Hosseini2019A).

## Interactions
LARP7 is a crucial component of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, where it interacts with 7SK RNA to regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II. LARP7 binds specifically to the 3'-terminal U-rich stretch of 7SK RNA, stabilizing the RNA and maintaining the integrity of the 7SK snRNP complex (Uchikawa2015Structural; Markert2008The). This interaction is essential for the sequestration of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which includes cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T1/2, in an inactive state (Markert2008The; Eichhorn2018Structural).

LARP7 also interacts with other proteins within the 7SK snRNP complex, such as HEXIM1 and MEPCE, contributing to the regulation of P-TEFb activity (Krueger2008LARP7). The protein's interaction with 7SK RNA is mediated through its La module and RNA recognition motifs, which are crucial for specific binding and stabilization of the RNA (Uchikawa2015Structural; Eichhorn2018Structural).

In addition to its role in transcription regulation, LARP7 has been implicated in other biological processes, such as telomerase assembly in ciliates and mRNA stability in mouse embryonic stem cells, indicating its broader functional significance (Hasler2020Stabilize).
