# TMEM207

## Overview
TMEM207 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 207, a member of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and early endosomes, where it plays a crucial role in the quality control and secretion of intelectin-1, a protein involved in innate immunity and metabolic processes (Saigo2018Cancerous; Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM207 is implicated in various cellular functions, including cell junction assembly and the regulation of the adaptive immune response, and is expressed in tissues such as the kidney (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein's interaction with the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is significant in cancer biology, as it can inhibit WWOX's tumor suppressor function, thereby influencing cancer progression (Saigo2018Cancerous; Chang2019Editorial:). TMEM207's expression and function are of clinical interest, particularly in the context of cancers such as oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer, where it may play a role in tumor progression and metastasis (Saigo2018Cancerous; Maeda2016Expression).

## Function
TMEM207 is a transmembrane protein localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and early endosomes. It plays a role in the quality and quantity control of intelectin-1, a protein involved in intestinal pathogen-host interactions and innate immunity. TMEM207 assists in the proper secretion of intelectin-1, suggesting its involvement in intestinal innate immunity and potentially in metabolic processes through the processing of intelectin-1, also known as omentin, an adipokine with insulin-sensitizing properties (Saigo2018Cancerous).

In terms of cellular localization, TMEM207 is directed to the ER by a signal peptide, but additional factors guide it to early endosomes. The protein has a cytoplasmic C-terminus and an N-terminus directed towards the lumen of the early endosome, indicating its role in cellular transport and signaling (Wesoly2024Structural).

TMEM207 is also involved in cell junction assembly and the regulation of the adaptive immune response, as well as the cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process. Its expression is noted in the kidney and is down-regulated in certain cancers, suggesting a role in maintaining normal cellular functions related to cell junctions and immune response (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM207 has been implicated in various cancers, including gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and colorectal cancer. In OSCC, TMEM207 is overexpressed and promotes aerobic glycolysis by inhibiting the tumor suppressor function of WWOX, a protein that regulates HIF1α, thereby contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Saigo2018Cancerous; Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM207's interaction with WWOX is significant, as it competes with oncogenic molecules for binding to WWOX, inhibiting its tumor suppressor function (Saigo2018Cancerous).

In colorectal cancer, TMEM207 expression is inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis and is associated with the mucinous phenotype of the carcinoma. It interacts with intelectin-1, a tumor suppressor, and is involved in its processing, suggesting that TMEM207 may play a protective role against metastasis (Maeda2016Expression). The loss of TMEM207 expression can lead to increased degradation of intelectin-1, potentially promoting carcinogenesis (Maeda2016Expression).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TMEM207 is downregulated, and its expression is linked to cell junction assembly and immune response regulation, although its exact role in ccRCC remains to be fully elucidated (Wesoly2024Structural).

## Interactions
TMEM207 is known to interact with the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) protein. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal PPxY motif of TMEM207, which binds to the WW domain of WWOX. This binding is significant as it inhibits the tumor suppressor function of WWOX, a crucial factor in cancer biology (Saigo2018Cancerous; Chang2019Editorial:). In oral squamous cell carcinoma, TMEM207 co-localizes and binds to WWOX, promoting aerobic glycolysis by disrupting WWOX's regulation of the HIF1α protein (Saigo2018Cancerous). TMEM207's interaction with WWOX is also implicated in gastric and colonic carcinogenesis, where it promotes invasion by impairing WWOX's tumor suppressor function (Saigo2018Cancerous).

TMEM207 is also involved in the quality control of intelectin-1 (ITLN1) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays a role in intestinal innate immunity. The ITLN1/TMEM207 axis may influence carcinogenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer, where low levels of TMEM207 can lead to decreased ITLN1 concentrations, promoting cancer progression (Paval2022The). These interactions suggest that TMEM207 may form part of a novel family of transmembrane proteins that hinder WWOX's tumor suppressor function (Saigo2018Cancerous).
