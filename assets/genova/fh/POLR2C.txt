# POLR2C

## Overview
POLR2C is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit C, a critical component of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for the transcription of DNA into RNA in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of a larger assembly of 12 subunits that work together to facilitate the transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Muste2023Deregulations). As a structural subunit, POLR2C contributes to the stability and assembly of the RNA polymerase II complex, playing a vital role in gene expression and cellular function. The regulation of POLR2C is crucial for maintaining transcriptional homeostasis, and its interactions with other proteins, such as those involved in the ARMC5-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, underscore its importance in cellular processes and protein stability (Luo2024ARMC5). Alterations in POLR2C expression have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including primary ovarian insufficiency and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Moriwaki2017POLR2C; Muste2023Deregulations).

## Function
POLR2C encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. This subunit is part of a complex composed of 12 subunits, each encoded by different genes, including POLR2A-K (Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2C contributes to the assembly and stability of the RNA polymerase II complex, which is essential for the transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Muste2023Deregulations). 

In healthy human cells, POLR2C is involved in maintaining the proper function of the transcription machinery, ensuring accurate and efficient gene expression. The RNA polymerase II complex, including POLR2C, operates within the cell nucleus, where it plays a critical role in gene expression, impacting various cellular functions and organismal development. The regulation of POLR2C and other subunits is vital for maintaining a balanced pool of RNA polymerase II, which is necessary for proper transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis (Luo2024ARMC5). The degradation of POLR2C, along with other subunits, is mediated by the ARMC5-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, highlighting its role in cellular processes and transcriptional regulation (Luo2024ARMC5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the POLR2C gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. One significant condition linked to POLR2C mutations is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in women. A heterozygous nonsense mutation in POLR2C, specifically c.454A>T, results in a premature stop codon (p.Lys152Ter), which has been identified in families with a dominant inheritance pattern of POI. This mutation leads to decreased POLR2C mRNA expression, affecting germ cell proliferation and resulting in a reduced oocyte complement, contributing to POI (Moriwaki2017POLR2C; França2019Genetics).

In cancer, POLR2C expression is often altered. Increased expression of POLR2C has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it correlates with poorer survival outcomes. Overexpression in HCC cell lines enhances proliferation, migration, and tumor growth, and is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of E-cadherin expression. POLR2C also regulates VOPP1 expression, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Alterations in POLR2C expression have also been noted in osteosarcoma and gastric cancer, with upregulation linked to cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer (Muste2023Deregulations). These findings suggest that POLR2C plays a role in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
POLR2C, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in transcription. It interacts with Snail, a key regulator of E-cadherin transcription, through its N-terminal domain, influencing E-cadherin expression and promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Muste2023Deregulations). POLR2C is also part of the RNA polymerase II complex, which consists of 12 subunits, and is essential for mRNA transcription (Moriwaki2017POLR2C).

In the context of protein degradation, POLR2C is associated with ARMC5, a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex targets RNA polymerase II subunits, including POLR2C, for degradation. Although the accumulation of POLR2C did not reach statistical significance after ARMC5 deletion, there was a consistent trend of increase, suggesting ARMC5's role in POLR2C degradation (Luo2024ARMC5). ARMC5 interacts with other Pol II subunits, such as POLR2A, POLR2B, and POLR2H, indicating a broader role in regulating the stability of the RNA polymerase II complex (Luo2024ARMC5). These interactions highlight POLR2C's involvement in both transcriptional regulation and protein stability within the cell.
