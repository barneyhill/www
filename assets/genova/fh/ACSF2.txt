# ACSF2

## Overview
ACSF2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2, which is categorized as a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. This enzyme is integral to fatty acid metabolism, facilitating the conversion of medium-chain fatty acids into their CoA derivatives, a critical step for various cellular functions such as energy storage, membrane synthesis, and protein modification (Maiguel2022ACSF2:). The protein is expressed in a wide range of tissues and exhibits diverse subcellular localizations, including the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, depending on the cell type (Maiguel2022ACSF2:). ACSF2 is also involved in neuronal differentiation and has been linked to several diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and progression (Song2022Construction; Zhao2022Identification). Additionally, ACSF2 plays a role in ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, and is associated with cancer suppression in certain contexts (Gong2024FerroptosisRelated).

## Function
The ACSF2 gene encodes a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by activating medium-chain fatty acids to their CoA derivatives. This activation is essential for various cellular processes, including the formation of membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, energy storage and metabolism, neurometabolism, and protein covalent modification (Maiguel2022ACSF2:). ACSF2 is expressed in most tissues, with its protein localization varying between cell types. In Neuro2a and P19 cells, ACSF2 is found in the Golgi region, while in MA-10, HepG2, and skin fibroblasts, it localizes to the mitochondria (Maiguel2022ACSF2:). In the liver, ACSF2 is located in mitochondria, where it may participate in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids for beta-oxidation (Maiguel2022ACSF2:).

ACSF2 is also implicated in neuronal differentiation, as its presence is required for neurite outgrowth in Neuro2a cells in response to retinoic acid, suggesting a significant role in neuronal development and synapse formation (Maiguel2022ACSF2:). The enzyme's activity may be regulated by acetylation/deacetylation of a conserved lysine residue, similar to other acyl-CoA synthetases (Maiguel2022ACSF2:).

## Clinical Significance
ACSF2 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACSF2 is significantly upregulated, and its elevated transcriptional levels are associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Zhao2022Identification). The gene is also linked to immune cell infiltration in HCC, which may impact clinical outcomes (Zhao2022Identification).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ACSF2 is part of a prognostic model based on ferroptosis-related genes. It is identified as a high-risk gene with a negative association with patient survival, indicating its potential role in AML prognosis (Song2022Construction). ACSF2 is also noted as a sensitive marker for recurrent deep vein thrombosis, suggesting its significance in selecting patients for extended anticoagulant therapy (Song2022Construction).

In kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), ACSF2 is downregulated and hypothesized to act as a cancer suppressor. It is involved in ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, and is correlated with the lncRNA LINC01020, indicating a potential regulatory role in cancer progression (Gong2024FerroptosisRelated).
