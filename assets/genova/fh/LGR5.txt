# LGR5

## Overview
LGR5, or leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure and a large extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats, which are essential for its interaction with ligands such as R-spondins. LGR5 plays a pivotal role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. The protein is notably expressed in adult stem cells across various tissues, including the intestine, stomach, and hair follicles, where it contributes to tissue regeneration and maintenance. In addition to its physiological roles, LGR5 is implicated in several cancers, where its expression can influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis (Morgan2018Targeting; Xu2019Lgr5).

## Structure
LGR5 is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven transmembrane (7-TM) domain structure typical of GPCRs (Snyder2013The). The protein features a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) containing 17 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which form a solenoid structure with a slight right-handed twist (Chen2013The; Wang2013Structural). This solenoid structure encircles its ligands, forming an arch that is crucial for its interaction with R-spondin (RSPO) and RNF43 (Chen2013The).

The LGR5 ECD shares structural similarities with glycoprotein hormone receptors but lacks a critical sulfur-modified tyrosine, affecting its interaction with RNF43 and RSPO1 (Chen2013The). The LRR modules in LGR5 include noncanonical features, such as the replacement of the 'N' position in the 'LxxLxLxxNxL' motif, which disrupts the asparagine ladder and results in two separate smooth beta sheets (Wang2013Structural).

LGR5 also contains canonical GPCR motifs, including the 'DRY' and 'NPXXY' motifs, which are important for G protein coupling and β-arrestin-2 recruitment (Snyder2013The). A serine cluster ('SSS' at amino acids 873-875) in the C-terminal tail is crucial for β-arrestin-2 recruitment, indicating its capacity for classical GPCR behavior (Snyder2013The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which influence its function and stability (Novellasdemunt2019NEDD4).

## Function
LGR5, also known as leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5, is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, LGR5 functions as a marker for adult stem cells in various tissues, including the intestine, stomach, and hair follicles. It is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with R-spondins to enhance Wnt signaling, thereby promoting stem cell maintenance and tissue regeneration (Xu2019Lgr5).

In the intestinal epithelium, LGR5 is expressed at the base of crypts in the colon and small intestine, marking a subpopulation of multipotent stem cells responsible for the continuous renewal of the intestinal lining. These cells are characterized by their prolonged self-renewal capabilities and are crucial for maintaining the balance of proliferation and differentiation within the stem cell niche (Baker2015Characterization; Becker2008Immunostaining).

In the stomach, LGR5 is expressed at the base of pyloric glands, where it marks active, multipotent stem cells that contribute to the self-renewal and maintenance of the gastric epithelium. These cells are capable of generating various epithelial cell lineages, supporting the long-term renewal of gastric tissues (Barker2010Lgr5+ve).

## Clinical Significance
LGR5, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In colorectal cancer (CRC), LGR5 is overexpressed, particularly at the invasive front of tumors and in distant metastases, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (Morgan2018Targeting). Its expression is linked to increased proliferation, chemoresistance, and poor response to 5FU-based therapies (Morgan2018Targeting). However, LGR5 also exhibits tumor suppressor functions, as its loss is observed during CRC progression, and high expression of Wnt target genes, including LGR5, is associated with a good prognosis (Morgan2018Targeting).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LGR5 overexpression is associated with a less aggressive, more differentiated tumor phenotype, affecting tumor morphology and metastatic properties (Effendi2014Overexpression). In glioblastoma, LGR5 promotes tumorigenicity and invasion of glioblastoma stem-like cells, making it a potential therapeutic target (Xie2019LGR5).

LGR5's role in cancer is complex and context-dependent, with its expression and function influenced by various factors, including dietary components and gut microbiota, which could offer alternative therapeutic strategies (Morgan2018Targeting).

## Interactions
LGR5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in Wnt signaling pathways. It functions as a receptor for R-spondins, which are secreted proteins that enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This interaction is crucial for maintaining stem cell characteristics and promoting cell proliferation in various tissues, including cancer cells (Ruffner2012RSpondin; Akbari2021LGR5RSpo1Wnt3a).

LGR5 forms a complex with RSPO1 and RNF43, where RSPO1 acts as a bridge between LGR5 and RNF43. Although LGR5 does not directly interact with RNF43, it stabilizes the RSPO1-RNF43 complex, facilitating more favorable binding and enhancing Wnt signaling (Chen2013The). This interaction is important for the assembly of the signaling complex, which is vital for both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways.

The LGR5 receptor also interacts with β-arrestin-2 (βarr2) in a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling context. Specific serine residues in LGR5 are crucial for βarr2 recruitment, and this interaction is mediated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), particularly GRK6, which promotes βarr2 translocation to intracellular vesicles (Snyder2013The). These interactions highlight LGR5's role in modulating GPCR processes and its potential involvement in various signaling pathways.
