# ZFP91

## Overview
ZFP91 is a gene that encodes the ZFP91 zinc finger protein, an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its function in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, where it activates NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) through Lys63-linked ubiquitination. This activation plays a significant role in immune response regulation and inflammation. ZFP91 is expressed in multiple human tissues, with notable expression in the testis, lymph nodes, and thyroid gland, indicating its broad functional significance across different organ systems. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) and the CRL4 CRBN ubiquitin ligase, underscore its involvement in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Tang2019The; Paschke2019ZFP91; Mi2018Zinc).

## Structure
ZFP91 is a zinc finger protein characterized by its molecular mass of 63.4 kDa and composed of 570 amino acid residues (Paschke2019ZFP91). The protein structure includes five zinc-finger motifs, a leucine zipper, a coiled-coil structure, and nuclear localization sequences, suggesting its localization in the nucleus and function as a transcription factor (Paschke2019ZFP91). The zinc-finger motifs are crucial for its role as an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the stabilization and activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) through Lys63-linked ubiquitination (Jin2010An). 

ZFP91's zinc finger domains, particularly the second zinc finger (ZnF2), are essential for its interaction with NIK, as mutations in conserved cysteines within ZnF2 significantly reduce NIK ubiquitination (Jin2010An). The protein also contains a leucine zipper and a coiled-coil structure, which may contribute to its dimerization or interaction with other proteins (Paschke2019ZFP91). ZFP91 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which can influence its activity and stability (An2017pSILAC). The presence of splice variant isoforms may lead to functional diversity, although specific isoforms are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
ZFP91 is a zinc finger protein that functions as an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation. This activity is essential for regulating protein levels and activity within cells. ZFP91 is involved in the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, where it activates NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) via Lys63-linked ubiquitination. This activation is significant for the regulation of immune responses and inflammation (Paschke2013ZFP91—A; Mi2018Zinc).

In macrophages, ZFP91 positively regulates the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as ERK, p38, and JNK. This activation leads to the synthesis of pro-IL-1β, highlighting ZFP91's role in promoting inflammation (Mi2018Zinc). ZFP91 also enhances the activation of the non-canonical caspase-8 inflammasome, which is crucial for IL-1β production (Mi2018Zinc).

ZFP91 is expressed in various normal human tissues, with particularly high expression in the testis. It is also present in the lymph node, endometrium, thyroid gland, and other tissues, suggesting a broad role in cellular processes across different organ systems (Paschke2019ZFP91).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFP91 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), ZFP91 is upregulated, correlating with higher histological grades and poorer therapeutic outcomes. This upregulation is associated with resistance to gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug. Ginsenoside Rg3 has been shown to reduce ZFP91 expression, thereby increasing gemcitabine sensitivity and improving patient prognosis (Pan2022Ginsenoside).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZFP91 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cancer metabolism reprogramming. It achieves this by promoting the degradation of hnRNP A1, which regulates PKM splicing. Downregulation of ZFP91 in HCC is linked to advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2020E3).

ZFP91 also plays a role in the metabolic fitness and antitumor activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells in colorectal cancer. It negatively regulates T cell activation and proliferation, and its deletion enhances antitumor immune responses. This suggests that targeting ZFP91 could improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes (Wang2021ZFP91).

In breast cancer, ZFP91 is targeted by miR-188-5p, which inhibits cancer progression by decreasing ZFP91 levels, highlighting its role in oncogenesis (Yang2020MicroRNA‑188‑5p).

## Interactions
ZFP91 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting the forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) protein for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial in gastric cancer, where ZFP91-mediated degradation of FOXA1 promotes tumor cell survival and chemoresistance (Tang2019The). ZFP91 also interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway, where FOXA1 is required for ZFP91-dependent activation, contributing to tumor growth (Tang2019The).

ZFP91 is identified as a substrate of the CRL4 CRBN ubiquitin ligase, with its degradation being facilitated by lenalidomide, thalidomide, and pomalidomide. This interaction is mediated through a common sequence motif in the ZnF domains of ZFP91, which allows high-affinity binding to the CRL4 CRBN-IMiD complex (An2017pSILAC).

In the context of inflammation, ZFP91 interacts with components of the non-canonical caspase-8 inflammasome, promoting the production of IL-1β in macrophages. It enhances the expression and assembly of inflammasome components such as NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-8, which are crucial for IL-1β production (Mi2018Zinc).
