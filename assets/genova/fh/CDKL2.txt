# CDKL2

## Overview
CDKL2, or cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The protein product of CDKL2 is part of the CDKL family, which shares structural similarities with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Chen2022Decreased). Characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal extension known as the αJ helix, CDKL2 is critical for its kinase activity (Canning2018CDKL). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is expressed in the nervous system, where it is implicated in cognitive functions and neurological processes (Chen2022Decreased). CDKL2 has been associated with the progression of breast cancer, particularly through its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), making it a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target in invasive breast cancers (Li2014CDKL2).

## Structure
CDKL2 is a member of the CDKL family kinases, characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and variable C-terminal regions. The kinase domain of CDKL2 adopts a classic bilobal architecture, with a notable divergence at the two MAPK family docking sites. The C-terminal lobe includes an unusual αJ helix that occupies a site equivalent to the MAPK common docking groove, occluding part of the recruitment site for MAPK substrates. This αJ helix is distinct from the C-terminal extensions of other kinases and is critical for the kinase activity of CDKL2, as its deletion reduces activity (Canning2018CDKL).

CDKL2 has been crystallized in an inactive conformation, with the structure stabilized by a collapsed P loop conformation. The ATP-binding pocket is sterically occluded by the P loop and activation segment, forcing the αC helix to swing outward and break the salt bridge between the catalytic lysine and glutamate (Canning2018CDKL). The protein does not have an equivalent structural element to the αC PSTAIRE motif of CDK2, which precludes binding to cyclins (Canning2018CDKL). CDKL2 may require phosphorylation at one or both residues in the activation segment for full activation, although the activating kinase is unknown (Endicott2013Structural).

## Function
CDKL2 (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. It is part of the CDKL family, which shares structural similarities with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (Chen2022Decreased). CDKL2 is characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal extension known as the aJ helix, which is critical for its kinase activity (Canning2018CDKL). This protein can exist in both active and inactive conformations, with its activity regulated by structural changes, such as the position of the aC helix and the formation of a salt bridge necessary for activation (Canning2018CDKL).

CDKL2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with lower levels in the nucleus, and is expressed in the nervous system, where it is implicated in cognitive functions and neurological processes (Chen2022Decreased). Although the specific regulatory and substrate partners of CDKL2 in healthy human cells remain to be fully identified, its structural features suggest a role in protein interactions and possibly in cilium length regulation (Canning2018CDKL).

## Clinical Significance
CDKL2 is implicated in the progression of breast cancer through its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression of CDKL2 in breast cancer cells is associated with increased tumor incidence and metastasis, as well as a shift towards mesenchymal characteristics, such as the loss of E-cadherin and increased vimentin expression. This expression pattern is linked to a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients, as those with CDKL2 amplification or elevated expression have significantly shorter survival times (Li2014CDKL2).

Mechanistically, CDKL2 activates a positive feedback loop involving ZEB1, E-cadherin, and β-catenin, which is crucial for EMT. This loop enhances the stem cell-like properties of cancer cells, contributing to their aggressiveness and resistance to therapy (Li2014CDKL2). CDKL2 also promotes the transition of CD24 high epithelial cells into CD44 high mesenchymal cells, further facilitating EMT and cancer progression (Li2014CDKL2).

These findings suggest that CDKL2 plays a significant role in breast cancer progression and may serve as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target in invasive breast cancers (Li2014CDKL2).
