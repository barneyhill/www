# SKIC3

## Overview
The SKIC3 gene encodes the SKI3 subunit, a critical component of the superkiller (SKI) complex, which is involved in RNA surveillance and degradation processes in human cells. The SKI3 protein functions as a cofactor within the SKI complex, facilitating the exosome-mediated 3'-to-5' mRNA decay pathway, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. This pathway plays a vital role in eliminating defective or excess mRNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful RNA species. The SKIC3 gene is particularly significant in the context of human health, as its mutations are associated with tricho-hepatoenteric syndrome type 1 (THES1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Additionally, SKIC3 has been implicated in cancer progression through its interactions with kindlin proteins, highlighting its broader significance in cellular defense and disease (Moreno2022Loss; Alrammal2024Trichohepatoenteric; Chowdhury2024Pancancer).

## Function
The SKIC3 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the superkiller (SKI) complex, which plays a significant role in RNA surveillance and degradation processes in human cells. The SKI complex, including SKIC3, is involved in the exosome-mediated 3'-to-5' mRNA decay pathway, ensuring proper mRNA turnover and quality control. This pathway is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression (Moreno2022Loss).

SKIC3, also known as TTC37, acts as a cofactor in the SKI complex, which associates with the cytoplasmic exosome to degrade RNA molecules. This degradation process is crucial for eliminating defective or excess mRNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful RNA species within the cell (Moreno2022Loss). The SKI complex, including SKIC3, was initially discovered as a host-directed antiviral mechanism targeting double-stranded viral RNA for degradation, highlighting its role in cellular defense (Moreno2022Loss).

In healthy human cells, SKIC3 is essential for maintaining RNA surveillance and degradation processes, contributing to cellular homeostasis. Its deficiency is linked to tricho-hepatoenteric syndromes (THES), indicating its importance in normal physiological functions (Moreno2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SKIC3 gene, also known as the SKI3 subunit of the superkiller complex, are associated with Trichohepatoenteric syndrome type 1 (THES1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by early-onset intractable diarrhea, failure to thrive, mental retardation, woolly hair abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, liver disease, immune dysfunction, congenital heart disease, and skin abnormalities. The syndrome is caused by mutations that lead to a frameshift and premature stop codon, resulting in mRNA degradation or protein truncation (Alrammal2024Trichohepatoenteric).

In the Fujian region of China, SKIC3 mutations have been identified with a higher allele frequency compared to other regions, suggesting a unique carrier spectrum for neurological diseases in this population (Guo2024Comprehensive). The SKIC3 gene is also implicated in cancer, where its interactions with kindlin proteins are altered, potentially affecting cancer progression through changes in mechanochemical properties (Chowdhury2024Pancancer).

The SKIC3 gene's role in the SKI mRNA surveillance pathway is crucial for maintaining liver homeostasis. Deficiencies in this pathway, due to mutations in SKIC3, can lead to liver-related diseases, including liver cirrhosis, as seen in conditions with overlapping symptoms to those caused by FOCAD deficiency (Moreno2022Loss).

## Interactions
SKIC3, also known as SKI3, is a component of the SKI complex, which plays a crucial role in RNA surveillance and degradation. It interacts with other proteins such as SKIC2 and SKIC8 to form the SKI complex, which associates with the exosome complex to facilitate mRNA decay (Moreno2022Loss). The stability of SKIC3 is dependent on its interaction with FOCAD, a protein that is essential for maintaining the proteostatic levels of SKIC2 and SKIC3. The absence of FOCAD results in reduced levels of these proteins, indicating that FOCAD is crucial for the stability of the SKI complex (Moreno2022Loss).

In the context of cancer, SKIC3 has been identified as part of the interaction network involving kindlins, specifically FERMT1. In samples with FERMT1 alterations, SKIC3 exhibited greater co-alterations, suggesting its involvement in the interaction network of FERMT1 and potential synergistic effects in cancer progression (Chowdhury2024Pancancer). Despite these interactions, studies have not found direct interaction between SKIC3 and ZCCHC3, a zinc knuckle protein associated with the RNA exosome, indicating that SKIC3's interactions are specific to certain protein complexes (Goodier2023ZCCHC3).
