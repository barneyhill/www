# MTAP

## Overview
The MTAP gene encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, a critical component of the methionine salvage pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a phosphorylase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) into adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, thereby playing a vital role in polyamine metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Tang2015Expression; Holdt2011Expression). MTAP is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, functioning as a housekeeping gene essential for maintaining cellular functions (Schmid2000A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for recycling methionine, an essential amino acid, and regulating cellular proliferation processes. MTAP's interactions with other cellular proteins, such as PRMT5 and RIOK1, further underscore its importance in cellular metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in MTAP-deficient cancers (Hu2021MTAP; Mavrakis2016Disordered).

## Structure
The human 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) protein is a trimeric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of a single α/β domain. This domain is characterized by a central eight-stranded mixed β sheet, flanked by six α helices, forming a unique α/β fold (Appleby1999The). The active sites of MTAP are located near the interface between two monomers, with each trimer forming three active sites. These sites are divided into purine-, methylthioribose-, and phosphate-binding regions (Appleby1999The; Guan2011EntropyDriven).

The purine binding site is situated between the backbone of β-5 and β-9 and involves several side chains, including Phe177 and Met196 (Guan2011EntropyDriven). The methylthioribose binding site is primarily hydrophobic, involving residues like Met196, Val233, and Leu279 (Appleby1999The). The phosphate binding involves interactions with residues such as Thr18 and Arg60 (Guan2011EntropyDriven).

MTAP's quaternary structure is a homotrimer, with extensive subunit contacts primarily involving specific β strands and helices, contributing to its stability and function (Appleby1999The). The enzyme's structure shows significant homology with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), despite differences in substrate specificity (Appleby1999The).

## Function
The MTAP gene encodes the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, which plays a crucial role in the methionine salvage pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a byproduct of polyamine synthesis, into adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, thereby contributing to the regulation of polyamine levels within cells (Tang2015Expression; Holdt2011Expression). MTAP is widely expressed in healthy human cells and is considered a housekeeping gene, essential for maintaining basic cellular functions (Schmid2000A).

In healthy cells, MTAP is involved in polyamine metabolism, which is vital for cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis (Holdt2011Expression). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the recycling of methionine, an essential amino acid, and for the regulation of cellular proliferation processes. MTAP's function supports normal cellular activities and may influence epigenetic control through its substrate, MTA (Tang2015Expression).

MTAP is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper balance of polyamines, which are important for various cellular functions, including DNA stabilization, gene expression, and cell growth (Holdt2011Expression).

## Clinical Significance
MTAP (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase) gene alterations have significant clinical implications in various cancers. MTAP deficiency, often due to chromosomal deletions at 9p21, is associated with increased sensitivity to antifolate therapies such as pemetrexed and methotrexate. This sensitivity is particularly noted in cancers like urothelial carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where MTAP loss can serve as a predictive biomarker for antifolate therapy response (Alhalabi2022MTAP). In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), homozygous deletion of the MTAP gene correlates with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, and higher mitotic rates, making it an independent adverse prognosticator for disease-free survival (Huang2009Homozygous).

In pancreatic cancer, MTAP deficiency leads to metabolic reprogramming, enhancing glycolysis and creating vulnerabilities to treatments targeting de novo purine synthesis and glycolysis. This metabolic shift is linked to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with deep MTAP deletions (Hu2021MTAP). In renal cell carcinoma, MTAP mutations are associated with sarcomatoid differentiation and poor prognosis, suggesting potential benefits from immunotherapy due to higher PD-L1 expression (Xu2022Genomic). These findings underscore the potential of MTAP as a target for therapeutic strategies and a marker for prognosis in various cancers.

## Interactions
MTAP (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase) is involved in several critical interactions within the cell, particularly affecting cancer cell metabolism and proliferation. One of its key interactions is with the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). In MTAP-deficient cells, the accumulation of methylthioadenosine (MTA) inhibits PRMT5 activity, as MTA competes with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) for binding to PRMT5. This inhibition is significant because PRMT5 is essential for cell proliferation, and its inhibition can lead to anti-proliferative effects in cancer cells (Mavrakis2016Disordered; Kryukov2016MTAP).

MTAP also interacts with RIOK1, a kinase that influences the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), a factor involved in glucose metabolism. MTAP regulates the phosphorylation of HIF1a through RIOK1, affecting HIF1a levels and stability. In MTAP wild-type cells, silencing MTAP increases HIF1a stability, while silencing RIOK1 can mitigate this effect (Hu2021MTAP).

These interactions highlight MTAP's role in regulating metabolic pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in MTAP-deficient cancers, where its loss creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited by targeting associated pathways (Mavrakis2016Disordered; Marjon2016MTAP).
