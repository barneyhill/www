# CETN3

## Overview
CETN3 is a gene that encodes the protein centrin 3, a member of the EF-hand superfamily known for its calcium-binding capabilities. The protein is characterized by its four EF-hand domains, with the fourth domain being functionally active, which is crucial for its role in calcium-mediated cellular processes (Middendorp1997Identification). Centrin 3 is involved in centrosome function and microtubule organization, playing a significant role in cell division and structural integrity. It is ubiquitously expressed and is part of the CDC31 subfamily, indicating its evolutionary conservation and importance across species (Dantas2012Such). The protein's interactions with other centrins and proteins like SFI1 are essential for centrosome duplication and spindle pole body integrity (Dantas2012Such). Additionally, CETN3 has been implicated in clinical conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea and retinal degeneration, highlighting its potential significance in human health (Ying2019Deletion; Gong2024Identification).

## Structure
CETN3, also known as centrin 3, is a protein that belongs to the EF-hand superfamily, characterized by its helix-loop-helix motifs that coordinate calcium ions. The protein structure includes four EF-hand domains, which are crucial for its calcium-binding capabilities (Dantas2012Such). Among these, the fourth EF-hand domain in CETN3 is predicted to be the only functional one, similar to its yeast orthologue, ScCDC31 (Middendorp1997Identification). This suggests a specialized role in calcium-mediated processes.

CETN3 is an acidic, slow-migrating isoform with a calculated molecular weight of 19.5 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.6 (Middendorp1997Identification). The protein is ubiquitously expressed and is part of the CDC31 subfamily, indicating its evolutionary conservation and functional significance across species (Dantas2012Such).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating centrin activity, potentially affecting its interaction with other proteins and its function in centrosome duplication and microtubule organization (Dantas2012Such). The COOH terminus of CETN3 is short and lacks the typical LY motif found in classical centrin sequences, suggesting functional divergence within the centrin family (Middendorp1997Identification).

## Function
CETN3 (centrin 3) is a protein involved in centrosome function and microtubule organization, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and division integrity. Centrins, including CETN3, are calcium-binding proteins that contribute to centrosome duplication, spindle assembly, and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, CETN3 is active in the centrosome, where it helps stabilize ciliary structures and is involved in the modular assembly of centrioles, potentially stabilizing distal centriole modules (Fisk2019Breaking).

CETN3 has been identified to have nuclear localization signals, suggesting potential roles in nuclear processes beyond its known functions in cilia (McClureBegley2017Nuclear). Although specific functions of CETN3 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, studies in other organisms imply that CETN3, along with other centrins, may be involved in stabilizing ciliary structures and maintaining the structural integrity of photoreceptor components (Ying2019Deletion). The cooperative role of CETN3 with other centrins, such as CETN2, is crucial for maintaining the stability of ciliary structures, which may be relevant to its function in human cells (Ying2019Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
The CETN3 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in CETN3 expression have been associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A study using Mendelian randomization analysis identified a statistically significant causal effect of CETN3 on OSA, suggesting that changes in CETN3 expression or function could contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition (Gong2024Identification).

In the context of retinal health, CETN3, in conjunction with CETN2, plays a critical role in maintaining the structural stability of the connecting cilium in photoreceptors. While the deletion of CETN3 alone does not affect photoreceptor function, the simultaneous deletion of CETN2 and CETN3 leads to significant retinal degeneration. This degeneration is characterized by structural changes in the photoreceptor connecting cilium and axonemes, resulting in progressive retinal degeneration and ciliopathy-related symptoms (Ying2019Deletion). These findings suggest that mutations or alterations in CETN3, particularly when combined with CETN2 deficiencies, could potentially lead to retinal degeneration and associated visual impairments, although direct links to specific human diseases have not been established (Ying2019Deletion).

## Interactions
CETN3 (centrin 3) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in centrosome duplication and microtubule organization. It interacts with SFI1, a protein essential for centrosome duplication, forming filaments that maintain spindle pole body integrity (Dantas2012Such). CETN3 also interacts with other centrins, such as CETN2, and calmodulin-like proteins, playing roles in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair processes (Dantas2012Such).

In the context of photoreceptor cells, CETN3, along with CETN2, stabilizes the distal connecting cilium (CC) and proximal outer segment (OS) axoneme by interacting with a protein complex that includes SPATA7. The absence of CETN3 and CETN2 leads to molecular and structural changes, such as reduced RP1 decoration and SPATA7 depletion, which are crucial for photoreceptor survival and function (Ying2019Deletion).

CETN3 is also noted for its significant presence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting potential interactions with nuclear proteins, although specific nuclear interactions are not detailed (McClureBegley2017Nuclear). These interactions highlight CETN3's multifaceted role in cellular processes, particularly in maintaining structural integrity and function in specialized cells.
