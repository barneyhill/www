# SRXN1

## Overview
The SRXN1 gene encodes the enzyme sulfiredoxin 1, which plays a pivotal role in cellular redox homeostasis by repairing hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prxs), a class of antioxidant enzymes. Sulfiredoxin 1 is categorized as a reductase enzyme and is essential for maintaining the balance between the peroxidase and chaperone functions of Prxs, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress-related damage. The enzyme operates through an ATP-dependent mechanism, reducing cysteine sulfinic acid in hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prxs to restore their peroxidase activity (Jakubek2023Beyond; Lowther2011Reduction). Sulfiredoxin 1 is primarily localized in the cytosol but can translocate to mitochondria under stress conditions to repair mitochondrial PrxIII (Lowther2011Reduction). The SRXN1 gene is upregulated in response to oxidative stress and is implicated in various physiological processes, including immune response and cardiac function, as well as in pathological conditions such as cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Wang2023Antioxidative; Lv2020SRXN1).

## Function
The SRXN1 gene encodes sulfiredoxin-1, an enzyme crucial for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis by repairing hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prxs) in human cells. These Prxs are antioxidant enzymes that detoxify hydrogen peroxide and other peroxides, playing a significant role in cellular defense against oxidative stress (Jakubek2023Beyond; Lowther2011Reduction). Sulfiredoxin-1 specifically reduces the cysteine sulfinic acid in hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prxs, restoring their peroxidase activity. This process is ATP-dependent and involves a conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic center of sulfiredoxin-1 (Jakubek2023Beyond; Lowther2011Reduction).

In healthy human cells, sulfiredoxin-1 is predominantly localized in the cytosol and can also be imported into mitochondria under stress conditions to repair mitochondrial PrxIII (Lowther2011Reduction). The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing oxidative stress-related damage and maintaining the balance between the peroxidase and chaperone functions of Prxs (Lowther2011Reduction). The SRXN1 gene is upregulated in response to oxidative stress and is involved in various physiological processes, including immune response and cardiac function, highlighting its role in cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative damage (Lowther2011Reduction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRXN1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SRXN1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its upregulation promotes tumor growth and metastasis by modulating the ROS/p65/BTG2 signaling pathway, which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis (Lv2020SRXN1; Rao2020Sulfiredoxin‐1). In prostate cancer, SRXN1 expression influences the response to radiotherapy. High SRXN1 levels are linked to radiotherapy resistance, as they reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibiting cancer cell apoptosis. This makes SRXN1 a potential prognostic marker for predicting radiotherapy outcomes (Wang2023Antioxidative).

In breast cancer, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SRXN1 are associated with survival outcomes, particularly in patients undergoing radiotherapy. Certain SRXN1 genotypes correlate with better or poorer prognoses, affecting the cancer cells' tolerance to oxidative damage and response to treatment (Hartikainen2012Genetic). In cervical cancer, elevated SRXN1 expression is linked to cancer progression and metastasis, potentially through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting its role as an oncoprotein (Lan2017Sulfiredoxin). These findings highlight SRXN1's clinical significance as a potential target for cancer treatment and prognosis.

## Interactions
SRXN1 (sulfiredoxin 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SRXN1 interacts with the B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) through the ROS/p65/BTG2 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer metastasis (Lv2020SRXN1).

In the context of lung cancer, SRXN1, also known as Srx, interacts preferentially with peroxiredoxin IV (Prx IV). This interaction is characterized by a strong binding affinity, which is essential for the modulation of specific phosphokinase signaling pathways involved in cancer progression. The Srx-Prx IV axis is critical for maintaining the tumor cell phenotype and promoting metastasis (Wei2011Sulfiredoxin–Peroxiredoxin).

SRXN1 also interacts with S100A4, a protein involved in cancer cell motility. The interaction is influenced by S-glutathionylation and calcium ions, which enhance the binding affinity between SRXN1 and S100A4, affecting cancer cell motility (Bowers2012Sulfiredoxin). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SRXN1 in cancer biology.
