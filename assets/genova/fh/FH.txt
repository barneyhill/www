# FH

## Overview
The FH gene encodes the enzyme fumarate hydratase, a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is essential for cellular energy production and metabolic regulation. Fumarate hydratase is a lyase enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to L-malate, playing a pivotal role in mitochondrial function and cellular respiration. The enzyme is a homotetramer, with each subunit contributing to the formation of active sites necessary for its catalytic activity. Beyond its metabolic functions, fumarate hydratase is involved in DNA damage repair and the regulation of epigenetic modifications, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis. Mutations in the FH gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and fumarate hydratase deficiency, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Lehtonen2011Hereditary; Zyla2021Gene).

## Structure
Fumarate hydratase (FH) is a homotetrameric enzyme, meaning it is composed of four identical subunits. Each subunit is structured into three domains: Domain 1 (D1) spans residues 49-188, Domain 2 (D2) covers residues 189-439, and Domain 3 (D3) includes residues 440-510 (Shorthouse2019The; Shorthouse2021Computational). The enzyme's quaternary structure is crucial for its function, forming four identical binding pockets through interactions between three subunits (Shorthouse2021Computational).

The primary structure of FH consists of a sequence of 510 amino acids, which includes specific residues critical for its catalytic activity, such as HIS176, ASN182, SER186, SER187, ASN188, THR234, HIS235, LYS371, VAL372, ASN373, and GLU378. These residues form the active site, known as Site A (Shorthouse2019The; Shorthouse2021Computational). The secondary structure involves the folding of these domains into alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context.

FH is expressed in both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms, with its localization determined by the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal in one of the alternative transcription products (Zyla2021Gene). The enzyme's structure is evolutionarily conserved, with significant sequence identity across species (Picaud2011Structural).

## Function
The FH gene encodes the enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), which is crucial in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a key metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. In healthy human cells, FH catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to L-malate within the mitochondria, facilitating ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Zyla2021Gene). This process is essential for cellular respiration and energy production, contributing to the maintenance of cellular redox balance and the regulation of metabolic pathways.

FH also plays a role in DNA damage repair. It can translocate to the nucleus, where it catalyzes fumarate production, inhibiting the histone demethylase KDM2B, and promoting the repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining (Zyla2021Gene). The enzyme is a homotetramer, localized in both the mitochondria and cytosol, and is encoded by nuclear DNA. Its structure includes a N-terminal lyase 1 domain, a C-terminal fumarase C domain, and a central domain for interaction with other FH monomers (Zyla2021Gene).

In addition to its metabolic functions, FH is involved in the urea cycle, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disruptions, such as the accumulation of argininosuccinate and dependency on exogenous arginine (Zyla2021Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FH gene are associated with several significant clinical conditions. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is an autosomal dominant syndrome linked to heterozygous germline mutations in FH. This condition is characterized by the development of cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and an increased risk of aggressive renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (Lehtonen2011Hereditary; Zyla2021Gene). The risk of RCC is particularly high in certain populations, such as Finnish and North American families (Lehtonen2011Hereditary). FH mutations lead to the activation of the hypoxia pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis through mechanisms like pseudohypoxia and impaired DNA damage repair (Zyla2021Gene).

Biallelic germline mutations in FH cause fumarate hydratase deficiency (FHD), a rare metabolic disorder characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including psychomotor retardation and muscular hypotonia, often resulting in early childhood mortality (Lehtonen2011Hereditary; Zyla2021Gene).

FH mutations also predispose individuals to malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, although this is a rare occurrence (Castro-Vega2013Germline). These mutations result in specific epigenetic changes and the accumulation of oncometabolites like fumarate, which contribute to tumorigenesis (Castro-Vega2013Germline; Bardella2011Aberrant).

## Interactions
Fumarate hydratase (FH) is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its activity is influenced by its interactions with other proteins and small molecules. FH functions as a homotetramer, with each active site formed by residues at the interface of three of the four subunits, indicating that its enzymatic activity depends on the precise assembly of its subunits and potentially on interactions with other proteins to maintain its functional conformation (Zhu2020Identification).

Mutations in the FH gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to compromised enzymatic activity and the accumulation of fumarate, which acts as an oncometabolite by inhibiting α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzymes and modifying proteins through succination (Zhu2020Identification). This suggests that FH may interact with these enzymes and proteins, either directly or indirectly, to regulate their activity.

In FH-deficient cells, there is a notable shift towards glycolysis and an upregulation of stress response pathways, including the Nrf2-related antioxidant pathway. This shift is associated with increased expression of Nrf2-regulated genes, such as HMOX1, indicating a potential interaction between FH deficiency and the upregulation of these pathways (Podkalicka2020Synthetically). The synthetic lethality observed between FH and HMOX1 suggests a critical interaction that could be targeted for therapeutic purposes in FH-deficient cancers (Podkalicka2020Synthetically).
