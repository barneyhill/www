# CWC25

## Overview
CWC25 is a gene that encodes the CWC25 spliceosome-associated protein homolog, a critical component in the pre-mRNA splicing process. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and plays a pivotal role in the catalytic phase of spliceosome dynamics. It is essential for the transition between the first and second catalytic steps of splicing, primarily by stabilizing the spliceosome's conformation after the first catalytic reaction. The CWC25 protein binds tightly to the spliceosome, preventing reverse reactions and facilitating the splicing pathway's progression. Its interaction with various spliceosomal components, such as U6 snRNA and the branch site sequence, underscores its importance in maintaining splicing efficiency. The protein's removal, mediated by Prp16-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, is necessary for the spliceosome to advance to the second catalytic step, highlighting its dual regulatory role in splicing (Chiu2009Cwc25; Tseng2017A).

## Structure


## Function
CWC25 is a protein that plays a critical role in the dynamics of the spliceosome during the catalytic phase of pre-mRNA splicing. It is essential for the transition from the first to the second catalytic step in splicing by stabilizing the first-step conformation of the spliceosome. This stabilization promotes the first catalytic reaction by lowering the free energy and creating a more rigid structure that inhibits conformational changes, ensuring efficient splicing (Tseng2017A). CWC25 binds tightly to the spliceosome after the first reaction, preventing reverse reactions and facilitating the progression of the splicing pathway (Tseng2017A).

The protein is recruited to the spliceosome after Prp2-mediated remodeling, which may create a high-affinity binding site for CWC25. Its binding increases the proximity of the 5' splice site and branchpoint, facilitating the chemical reaction (Tseng2017A). However, CWC25 also inhibits the second catalytic reaction and requires Prp16-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis for its removal, allowing the spliceosome to progress to the second step (Tseng2017A). The presence of CWC25 is crucial for efficient first-step splicing, but its removal is necessary for the second step, highlighting its dual role in splicing regulation (Tseng2017A).

## Interactions
CWC25 is a splicing factor that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the spliceosome during the catalytic phase of pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several components of the spliceosome, including U6 snRNA and the branch site sequence, where its N-terminal residue G2 forms hydrogen bonds, and the side chain of K10 contributes to its interaction with RNA (Tseng2017A). CWC25 is recruited to the spliceosome after Prp2-mediated destabilization of SF3a/b and becomes stably associated after the first catalytic reaction (Tseng2017A). Its association with the spliceosome is transient and requires the presence of Yju2, which is necessary for its stable binding (Chiu2009Cwc25).

CWC25 interacts with the Prp19-associated complex (NTC), although it is not tightly associated with it. It shows weak interaction with Ntc77, a component of the NTC (Chiu2009Cwc25). The removal of Ntc30, another NTC component, destabilizes CWC25's association with the spliceosome, affecting splicing efficiency (Tseng2017A). CWC25's interactions are crucial for the transition between the first and second steps of splicing, with its removal facilitating the binding of Slu7/Prp18 to promote the second reaction (Tseng2017A).
