# ZSCAN5B

## Overview
ZSCAN5B is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5B protein, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can bind to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, and are often involved in transcriptional regulation. The SCAN domain is a leucine-rich region that facilitates protein-protein interactions, suggesting that ZSCAN5B may play a role in the regulation of gene expression through complex formation with other proteins. While the specific functions of ZSCAN5B remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply a potential role in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways. Further research is needed to clarify its interactions and clinical significance.
