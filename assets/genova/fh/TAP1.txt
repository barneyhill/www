# TAP1

## Overview
The TAP1 gene encodes the transporter 1, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member, which is a critical component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex. This protein is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and functions as a transmembrane transporter. TAP1, in conjunction with TAP2, forms a heterodimer that facilitates the ATP-dependent translocation of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process is essential for the loading of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are subsequently presented on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells, playing a vital role in immune surveillance and response (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; LankatButtgereit2002The). The proper functioning of TAP1 is crucial for the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate infected or cancerous cells, and its dysfunction is associated with various clinical conditions, including Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome Type I and certain cancers (Furukawa1999Splice; Cromme1994Loss).

## Structure
The TAP1 protein is a component of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and forms a heterodimer with TAP2. Each subunit of TAP1 consists of a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (Koch2004Functional; Abele2004The). The TMD is responsible for peptide binding and translocation, while the NBD is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, which powers the transport process (Abele2004The; Padariya2021Structural). TAP1 has 10 transmembrane helices, with the last six showing homology to other ABC transporters (Abele2004The).

The N-terminal domains of TAP1 are crucial for recruiting tapasin, a component of the peptide-loading complex, which includes MHC class I molecules and other auxiliary factors (Koch2004Functional; Abele2004The). These domains are essential for the formation of MHC class I peptide loading complexes, as they facilitate interaction with tapasin (procko2005identification).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation influence the function and stability of TAP1, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Abele2004The). The structural dynamics of TAP1 are also affected by interactions with viral proteins and cancer-associated mutations, which can alter its function and stability (Padariya2021Structural).

## Function
The TAP1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex, which plays a vital role in the immune response by facilitating the transport of antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; LankatButtgereit2002The). This process is essential for the loading of peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are then presented on the cell surface to cytotoxic T cells (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; LankatButtgereit2002The). 

TAP1, along with TAP2, forms a heterodimer that functions as an ATP-dependent peptide transporter, displaying selectivity toward peptides with specific characteristics, such as a hydrophobic C-terminal amino acid (Wright1995Coordinate). The TAP complex is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family and is located in the ER membrane, where it is involved in the stabilization and export of MHC class I molecules to the cell surface (Beismann‐Driemeyer2004Function; LankatButtgereit2002The). 

In healthy human cells, TAP1 is critical for immune surveillance, enabling the immune system to recognize and eliminate infected or cancerous cells (Kelly1992Assembly; LankatButtgereit2002The). The proper functioning of TAP1 is essential for the development of cytotoxic T cells and the overall integrity of the immune response (Wright1995Coordinate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAP1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant condition linked to TAP1 mutations is Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS) Type I, characterized by a deficiency in MHC class I molecules. This deficiency results from mutations that disrupt the normal function of TAP1, leading to impaired antigen processing and presentation. Patients with BLS Type I often experience recurrent bacterial infections and chronic inflammation due to the lack of MHC class I expression (Furukawa1999Splice; LankatButtgereit2002The).

In cancer, alterations in TAP1 expression can influence tumor progression and immune evasion. Low TAP1 expression is associated with tumor development and the evasion of cytotoxic T-cell killing, as seen in various cancers, including cervical, colon, and lung cancers (Tabassum2021Transporter; Cromme1994Loss). Specific mutations, such as TAP1 R372Q, have been identified in cancers like cervical squamous cell carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, affecting peptide transport and MHC-I cell surface expression (Padariya2021Structural).

TAP1 expression levels also have prognostic implications. For instance, lower TAP1 expression correlates with higher relapse-free survival in breast and lung cancer patients, while higher expression is linked to better survival in ovarian cancer (Tabassum2021Transporter).

## Interactions
TAP1, a component of the transporter associated with antigen processing, interacts with several proteins crucial for its function in the immune response. TAP1 forms a heterodimer with TAP2, which is essential for the translocation of peptide antigens into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (LevesonGower2004Detection). This interaction is confirmed by the dihydrofolate reductase protein-fragment complementation assay, which shows that TAP1 and TAP2 do not form homodimers but exclusively heterodimerize (LevesonGower2004Detection).

TAP1 also interacts with tapasin, a chaperone that stabilizes the TAP complex and facilitates the loading of peptides onto MHC class I molecules. Tapasin binds to TAP1 at three sites: two in the N-terminal domains of TAP1 and TAP2, and one in the core transmembrane domain (coreTMD) of unassembled TAP1. This interaction is crucial for TAP stability and efficient heterodimerization with TAP2 (Leonhardt2014Three). Specific amino acids in the transmembrane segment TM9 of TAP1, such as Asn-411, Thr-415, Gly-419, and Lys-423, are critical for tapasin binding (Leonhardt2014Three). These interactions ensure the proper assembly and function of the peptide-loading complex within the ER.
