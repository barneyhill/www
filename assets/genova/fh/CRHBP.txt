# CRHBP

## Overview
The CRHBP gene encodes the corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by modulating the activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This protein functions as a binding protein, interacting with CRH to regulate its availability and prevent excessive activation of CRH receptors, thereby influencing stress responses and maintaining physiological balance (Seasholtz2002Corticotropinreleasing; Ketchesin2017Corticotropinreleasing). CRHBP is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pituitary, liver, and placenta, and is involved in critical processes such as stress modulation and pregnancy-related hormonal regulation (Ketchesin2017Corticotropinreleasing; Turnbull1997CorticotropinReleasing). Alterations in CRHBP expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, including certain cancers, where its expression levels may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers (Tezval2013Reduced; Xia2018Decreased).

## Structure
The corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP) is a protein that plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRF). The primary structure of CRHBP consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, which form the basis for its complex structure and function. The secondary structure of CRHBP includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which are stabilized by disulfide bridges. Specifically, the CRHBP structure is organized into two modules: the first module (residues 50-180) contains two short alpha helices and six antiparallel beta-sheets, with disulfide bridges C60-C81 and C104-C141. The second module (residues 180-245) features beta-sheets, an alpha helix, and disulfide bridges C183-C205 and C237-C264 (Slater2018Molecular).

The tertiary structure of CRHBP involves the three-dimensional folding of these secondary elements, contributing to its functional conformation. CRHBP is capable of forming a symmetrical homodimer, which is significant for its interaction with CRF as a dimer (Slater2018Molecular). The protein's electrostatic potential surfaces reveal acidic and basic patches, which are important for its binding interactions (Slater2018Molecular). The study of CRHBP also suggests the presence of specific domains responsible for binding CRF and Urocortin I (UCNI) (Slater2018Molecular).

## Function
The corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein (CRHBP) plays a critical role in modulating the activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in humans. CRHBP is a secreted glycoprotein that binds CRH with high affinity, thereby regulating its availability and activity. This binding action prevents the activation of CRH receptors, particularly in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is crucial for managing stress responses (Seasholtz2002Corticotropinreleasing; Ketchesin2017Corticotropinreleasing).

CRHBP is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pituitary, liver, and placenta. In the brain, it is found in regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, where it modulates CRH activity and influences stress-related processes (Ketchesin2017Corticotropinreleasing). In the pituitary gland, CRHBP inhibits CRH-induced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, supporting its function as an inhibitory molecule that prevents receptor activation (Seasholtz2002Corticotropinreleasing).

CRHBP also plays a role in maintaining normal plasma ACTH levels during pregnancy by binding placental CRH, thus preventing inappropriate stimulation of the stress axis (Turnbull1997CorticotropinReleasing). This protein's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining physiological balance in stress and anxiety responses (Deussing2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CRHBP gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CRHBP expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. This reduced expression is associated with larger tumor size, higher Edmondson Grade, elevated α-fetoprotein levels, and hepatitis B virus infection. Patients with low CRHBP expression in HCC have a poorer prognosis, with reduced 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates (Xia2018Decreased).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CRHBP expression is also significantly reduced, with a 33-fold decrease in mRNA levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduction is linked to more advanced and aggressive disease stages, including metastasis. The loss of CRHBP expression in ccRCC is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a potential prognostic biomarker (Tezval2013Reduced; Yang2019Integrative).

CRHBP expression is also involved in tumor immunity and drug response across various cancers. Its expression levels correlate with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint markers, and drug responses, indicating its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy success and cancer prognosis (Chen2024A).

## Interactions
CRHBP, or corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein, is known for its interactions with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptors. CRHBP binds CRF with high affinity, modulating its availability and activity within the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This binding inhibits CRF-mediated activation of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and CRF receptor 2 (CRFR2), acting as a negative feedback regulator (Wan2022Characterization).

CRHBP also interacts specifically with the CRF type-2α receptor (CRF2αR), facilitating its presence on the cell surface. This interaction is isoform-specific, as CRHBP does not form a complex with the CRF2βR isoform. CRHBP acts as an escort protein, increasing the presence of CRF2αR on the plasma membrane, which is crucial for CRF-dependent neuronal plasticity and stress-induced behaviors (Slater2016CRF).

In the context of alcohol use disorder, CRHBP interacts with CRFR2α, increasing receptor expression on the cell surface and potentiating receptor signaling. This interaction is implicated in the modulation of stress responses and ethanol consumption, highlighting CRHBP's potential role as a pharmacological target for treatment (HaassKoffler2016Defining).
