# SOD1

## Overview
The SOD1 gene encodes the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1, a critical antioxidant defense protein that belongs to the family of metalloenzymes. This enzyme plays a vital role in cellular protection by catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, thereby mitigating oxidative stress within cells (Zelko2002Superoxide). SOD1 is predominantly located in the cytosol but is also present in other cellular compartments such as the nucleus, mitochondrial intermembrane space, and peroxisomes, where it helps regulate superoxide levels (Eleutherio2021SOD1). Beyond its enzymatic function, SOD1 acts as a nuclear transcription factor under oxidative stress conditions, influencing the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance and DNA repair (Tsang2014Superoxide). Mutations in the SOD1 gene are notably linked to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), where they contribute to neurodegenerative processes through mechanisms such as protein aggregation and structural instability (Wright2019The).

## Structure
The SOD1 protein is a metalloenzyme with a molecular weight of 32 kDa, forming a homodimer composed of two 16 kDa subunits. Each monomer consists of 153 amino acids and folds into an eight-stranded Greek-key β-barrel structure, which is a characteristic feature of the immunoglobulin fold family (Trist2020Superoxide; Timucin2021Bridging). The β-barrel is stabilized by two large loops, the electrostatic loop (residues 122-143) and the metal-binding loop (residues 49-84), which are crucial for the protein's function (Trist2020Superoxide; Pereira2021Comprehensive).

The tertiary structure of SOD1 is further stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys57 and Cys146, which is rare in the cytosol and contributes significantly to the protein's stability (Trist2020Superoxide; Eleutherio2021SOD1). The active site of SOD1 involves the coordination of copper and zinc ions, with copper binding to His46, His48, His63, and His120, and zinc binding through His63, His71, His80, and Asp83 (Eleutherio2021SOD1).

In its quaternary structure, SOD1 forms a stable homodimer, with dimerization involving hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions that exclude water, contributing to its high stability even under denaturing conditions (Wright2019The; Eleutherio2021SOD1). The protein's stability is enhanced by metal binding, with zinc providing a significant thermodynamic stabilizing effect (Trist2020Superoxide).

## Function
Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily known for its role in catalyzing the conversion of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, thus protecting cells from oxidative stress (Zelko2002Superoxide). SOD1 is predominantly located in the cytosol, but it is also found in the nucleus, mitochondrial intermembrane space, and peroxisomes, where it regulates superoxide levels (Eleutherio2021SOD1).

Beyond its enzymatic activity, SOD1 functions as a nuclear transcription factor in response to oxidative stress, particularly when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. It translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance and DNA repair, contributing to genomic stability (Tsang2014Superoxide). This nuclear role is mediated by the ATM kinase pathway and involves the regulation of genes such as Tsa2, Prx1, Rnr3, and Rad16 (Tsang2014Superoxide).

SOD1 also plays a role in metabolism regulation, affecting cholesterol metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. It decreases the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and modulates mitochondrial respiration through acetylation (Damiano2020Metabolism). These functions highlight SOD1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against oxidative damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SOD1 gene are significantly associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS), a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor neurons. Approximately 20% of fALS cases are linked to SOD1 mutations, which can lead to a toxic gain of function, resulting in protein aggregation and decreased stability (Wright2019The; Wang2008Protein). These mutations often destabilize the SOD1 protein structure, affecting its β-barrel, dimer interface, and loops, which contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons (Wright2019The).

The most common SOD1 mutation, Ala4Val (A4V), is associated with rapid disease progression and shorter survival times (Juneja1997Prognosis; Cudkowicz1997Epidemiology). Other mutations, such as Asp90Ala, have different impacts on disease onset and progression (Wright2019The). The presence of metal-free, disulfide-reduced SOD1 in aggregates suggests a defective post-translational modification pathway (Wright2019The).

SOD1 mutations can also occur in sporadic ALS cases, though they are more prevalent in familial cases (Andersen2003Sixteen). The clinical characteristics of ALS patients with SOD1 mutations are similar to those without, but the mean age at onset is often earlier in the SOD1 group (Cudkowicz1997Epidemiology).

## Interactions
SOD1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One key interaction is with the copper chaperone for SOD1 (hCCS), which is crucial for SOD1's copper acquisition and disulfide reduction. Mutations in SOD1, such as those associated with ALS, can disrupt this interaction, leading to structural instability and aggregation in motor neurons (Wright2016A). The R163W mutation in hCCS, for example, reduces metalation and prevents the formation of the critical heterodimer with SOD1, reducing SOD1 activity and triggering unfolded protein response markers (Wright2016A).

SOD1 also interacts with stress granule marker G3BP1, particularly in the context of ALS. Mutant SOD1 proteins, unlike the wild-type, interact with G3BP1 in an RNA-independent manner, affecting stress granule dynamics and potentially contributing to ALS pathology (Gal2016ALS). This interaction involves specific residues in both G3BP1 and SOD1, and mutations in these residues impair the interaction (Gal2016ALS).

In addition, SOD1 mutants interact with proteins involved in protein degradation pathways, such as the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome, co-chaperone CHIP, and ubiquitin-binding proteins, indicating competition between chaperone complexes and proteolytic machinery (Huai2019Structural).
