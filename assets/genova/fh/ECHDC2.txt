# ECHDC2

## Overview
ECHDC2 (enoyl-CoA hydratase domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism. The protein, part of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily, plays a critical role in converting fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units, which are essential for ATP production through the citric acid cycle. This function is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation, particularly in energy-demanding tissues such as the liver and brain (Song2013Comparative). ECHDC2's involvement in metabolic processes extends to its interaction with other proteins, influencing pathways related to cancer and cardiovascular health (PinedaCirera2021Exploring; Wang2022Proteomic).

## Structure


## Function
ECHDC2 (enoyl-CoA hydratase domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in fatty acid metabolism, specifically within the beta-oxidation pathway. This pathway is crucial for the degradation of fatty acids, which are broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP. ECHDC2 is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Song2013Comparative).

The protein encoded by ECHDC2 is part of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase superfamily, which is essential for the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. This process involves the conversion of fatty acids into acetyl-CoA units, which can then enter the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Song2013Comparative).

In healthy human cells, ECHDC2 contributes to the regulation of lipid metabolism, ensuring that energy production is balanced with the cell's metabolic needs. This function is vital for the proper functioning of various tissues, including the liver and brain, where energy demands are high (PinedaCirera2021Exploring). The activity of ECHDC2 in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining metabolic health and energy balance within the organism.

## Clinical Significance
The ECHDC2 gene has been implicated in various cancer types and metabolic conditions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers, alterations in ECHDC2 have been observed in over 20% of patients within the HPV+ cohort. These genetic changes are significantly associated with overall survival, suggesting a prognostic role for ECHDC2 in this cancer type (Reddy2019Molecular). In lower-grade glioma, ECHDC2 is one of 18 genes identified as potent predictors of patient survival, highlighting its potential importance in cancer prognosis through its involvement in mitochondrial function and cell death patterns (Qin2023Integrated).

ECHDC2 is also associated with epigenetic changes following myocardial infarction, showing a significant association with mannose and a suggestive association with caparic acid. This indicates a potential role in metabolic processes related to cardiovascular health (WardCaviness2018Analysis). Additionally, ECHDC2 is affected by alternative splicing events in fibroblasts from patients with cblC genetic defects of cobalamin metabolism, which may contribute to the clinical manifestations of these disorders (Rashka2020Analysis). These findings suggest that ECHDC2 may play a role in both cancer progression and metabolic regulation.

## Interactions
ECHDC2 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of the protein MCCC2. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in gastric cancer cells. ECHDC2 promotes the ubiquitination of MCCC2 by binding to NEDD4, which enhances the degradation of MCCC2 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is evidenced by the use of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents the downregulation of MCCC2 protein levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between ECHDC2, MCCC2, and NEDD4, and protein-protein docking models have been used to predict the interaction patterns. Knocking down NEDD4 reverses the ubiquitination of MCCC2 promoted by ECHDC2 overexpression, indicating that ECHDC2's role in this process is dependent on its interaction with NEDD4 (He2024ECHDC2).

In addition to its role in cancer, ECHDC2 is involved in fatty acid metabolism and is part of a network of proteins that regulate metabolic processes related to cardiovascular health. However, specific physical interactions of ECHDC2 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Wang2022Proteomic).
