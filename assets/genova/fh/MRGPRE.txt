# MRGPRE

## Overview
MRGPRE, or MAS related GPR family member E, is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known for its involvement in sensory and autonomic nervous system functions. The protein product of MRGPRE is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a structural feature typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its role in cellular signaling. Predominantly expressed in sensory neurons, including those in the dorsal root ganglia and various central nervous system regions, MRGPRE is implicated in modulating pain perception and inflammatory responses (InclanRico2021Beyond; Solinski2014Pharmacology). Despite its recognized presence in sensory pathways, the specific ligands and comprehensive functions of MRGPRE remain under investigation, with ongoing research aimed at elucidating its role in physiological and pathological conditions (InclanRico2021Beyond).

## Structure
MRGPRE (MAS related GPR family member E) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a primary structure that includes seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs. These helices form the secondary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a specific three-dimensional conformation, which is essential for its function. GPCRs, including MRGPRE, often form dimers or higher-order oligomers, which represent their quaternary structure.

The protein features specific domains such as the extracellular N-terminus and intracellular C-terminus. These domains are crucial for ligand binding and signal transduction, playing a significant role in the receptor's physiological functions. Post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and glycosylation can influence the activity and stability of MRGPRE, affecting its interaction with other molecules and its overall function within the cell. These modifications are common in GPCRs and are important for their regulation and signaling capabilities. The structural characteristics of MRGPRE, including its transmembrane helices and post-translational modifications, are integral to its role in various physiological processes.

## Function
The MRGPRE gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is primarily expressed in sensory neurons, including those in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and various regions of the central nervous system such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, spinal cord, and cerebellum (InclanRico2021Beyond; Solinski2014Pharmacology). MRGPRE is also found in the placenta and enteric neurons, indicating a role in the autonomic nervous system and gastrointestinal functions (Solinski2014Pharmacology).

In terms of molecular function, MRGPRE is involved in cellular signaling processes that influence pain perception and inflammatory responses. It is thought to modulate ion channels and neurotransmitter release, impacting neuronal excitability and communication (Solinski2014Pharmacology). Although the specific ligands and detailed functions of MRGPRE in healthy human cells remain poorly characterized, its expression in sensory neurons suggests a role in sensory perception, particularly in pain signaling (InclanRico2021Beyond).

MRGPRE's expression is affected by inflammatory conditions, which can alter its levels in tissues such as the intestines, indicating its potential involvement in inflammatory responses (InclanRico2021Beyond). However, further research is needed to fully elucidate its functions in healthy human cells.
