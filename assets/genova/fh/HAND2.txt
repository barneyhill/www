# HAND2

## Overview
The HAND2 gene encodes the heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2 protein, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development. This protein is integral to the formation and differentiation of various tissues, particularly in cardiac and vascular systems, where it influences the development of cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. HAND2 is also involved in the development of the enteric nervous system, contributing to neurogenesis and neurotransmitter expression. The protein functions primarily through forming heterodimers with E-proteins, enabling it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. Mutations in the HAND2 gene have been linked to congenital heart defects and endometrial cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Barnes2011Hand2; George2018Hand; Dai2002The; Jones2013Role).

## Structure
The HAND2 protein is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, characterized by a conserved domain that facilitates DNA binding and dimerization. The primary structure of HAND2 includes a polyalanine tract, which is similar to other developmentally regulated genes and is associated with transcription inhibition in certain proteins (Russell1998Molecular). The bHLH domain is crucial for its DNA binding and dimerization capabilities, with the basic domain responsible for DNA binding and the helix-loop-helix domain facilitating dimerization (Dai2002The).

HAND2 predominantly forms heterodimers with E-proteins, such as E12, to bind specific E-box sequences, which are DNA motifs recognized by bHLH transcription factors (Dai2002The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of the protein to allow for specific interactions with DNA and other proteins, while the quaternary structure involves its interaction as a heterodimer with E-proteins (Dai2002The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating HAND2's activity. Phosphorylation at specific residues, such as S114, is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins (Firulli2005Altered). These modifications can influence HAND2's dimerization and transcriptional regulation, which may be context-dependent and influenced by cell type-specific modifications (Dai2002The).

## Function
HAND2 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a critical role in various developmental processes, particularly in cardiac and vascular development. In the heart, HAND2 is essential for the proper formation and expansion of cardiomyocytes, especially in the right ventricle and outflow tract. It regulates the expression of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and interacts with other transcription factors like GATA4 to ensure proper cardiac morphogenesis (George2018Hand; Tsuchihashi2011Hand2). HAND2 is also involved in the development of the epicardium and coronary vessels, influencing extracellular matrix deposition and cell differentiation (Barnes2011Hand2).

In the vascular system, HAND2 is crucial for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into vascular smooth muscle cells and regulates angiogenesis, potentially through the VEGF signaling pathway (Yamagishi2000The). HAND2 also plays a significant role in the enteric nervous system, where it supports neurogenesis and the expression of neurotransmitter-specific genes, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in enteric neurons (Hendershot2006Expression). These functions highlight HAND2's importance in coordinating complex developmental processes across multiple organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAND2 gene are associated with various congenital heart defects (CHDs). A specific mutation, p.S65I, has been linked to familial cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis (PS), and double outlet right ventricle (DORV). This mutation is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner and results in diminished transcriptional activity of HAND2, affecting its interaction with other cardiac transcription factors such as GATA4 and NKX2.5 (Sun2016A). Another mutation, p.L47P, identified in a patient with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), also leads to reduced transcriptional activity and is considered a de novo mutation (LU2015A).

HAND2 is also implicated in endometrial cancer through its epigenetic silencing via hypermethylation. This silencing is a common molecular alteration in endometrial cancer, occurring in over 90% of cases, and is associated with a lack of response to progesterone treatment in hyperplastic endometrium. HAND2 methylation is considered an early event in endometrial carcinogenesis and has potential as a diagnostic tool for early detection of the disease (Jones2013Role).

## Interactions
HAND2 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that participates in various protein interactions. It directly interacts with the Runx2 protein, inhibiting its DNA-binding activity and transcriptional function. This interaction is mediated through the Runt DNA-binding domain of Runx2 and the N-terminal domain of HAND2, which is crucial for the inhibition of Runx2's function (Funato2009Hand2). HAND2's repression of Runx2 is independent of histone deacetylase activity and does not involve interactions with transcriptional co-factors like CBP/p300 or Fhl2 (Funato2009Hand2).

HAND2 also forms heterodimers with E-proteins, such as E12, to function as a transcriptional activator by binding to E-box DNA sequences. This interaction is essential for HAND2's role in transcriptional regulation, as it does not bind DNA effectively as a homodimer (Dai2002The). HAND2's interaction with E12 enhances its transcriptional activity, indicating a preference for heterodimerization in vivo (Dai2002The).

In the context of limb development, HAND2 interacts with Twist1, although this interaction may operate independently of Runx pathways (Firulli2005Altered). These interactions highlight HAND2's versatile role in regulating gene expression through both inhibitory and activating mechanisms.
