# ANKRD26

## Overview
ANKRD26 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat domain containing 26, which is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane organization and signal transduction. The protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a coiled coil region, which facilitate its role as an adaptor protein connecting membrane proteins with intracellular signaling pathways (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26; Bera2008A). ANKRD26 is part of the N-Ank protein superfamily, known for its ability to shape membranes and form membrane-associated arrays (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). Clinically, mutations in the ANKRD26 gene are linked to Thrombocytopenia 2 (THC2), an autosomal-dominant form of inherited thrombocytopenia, and an increased risk of myeloid malignancies (Zidan2020Relation; Pippucci2011Mutations). The gene's regulatory role in hematopoiesis and its interactions with type I cytokine receptors are significant in these pathological conditions (Lovatel2023A).

## Structure
The ANKRD26 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a coiled coil region. The ankyrin repeats are crucial for its function, forming a module known as the N-Ank module, which is essential for membrane binding and curvature sensing (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). This module includes five N-terminal ankyrin repeats between amino acids 46 and 207, and an amphipathic N-terminal structure that facilitates membrane association through hydrophobic interactions (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). The coiled coil domain, spanning amino acids 500 to 1600, is important for the protein's self-association properties (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26).

The ANKRD26 protein lacks the cysteine-rich domain typical of POTEs, which are proteins with limited similarity to ANKRD26 (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). The protein's ability to form nanoclusters at the plasma membrane is significant for its function, particularly in organizing cellular signaling pathways (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs and coiled coil domains are highlighted as significant structural features (Hahn2006Duplication). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The ANKRD26 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in cellular differentiation and various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ANKRD26 is involved in the organization of distal appendages of parent centrioles, which are essential for basal body docking to the plasma membrane and ciliogenesis (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26). The protein is located near the plasma membrane and contains ankyrin repeats and spectrin helices, which suggest its function as an adaptor protein connecting membrane proteins with intracellular signaling pathways (Bera2008A).

ANKRD26 is also implicated in thrombopoiesis, the process of platelet production. In normal megakaryocytes, thrombopoietin promotes thrombopoiesis by activating the MPL downstream signaling pathways. The RUNX1/FLI1 complex negatively regulates ANKRD26 gene expression, and mutations in the 5'UTR of the gene can lead to overexpression, affecting the TPO/MPL signaling pathways and contributing to thrombocytopenia (Balduini2018Clinic).

In terms of cellular signaling, ANKRD26 forms nanoclusters at the plasma membrane, organizing signaling platforms crucial for proper signal transduction. It is part of the N-Ank protein superfamily, characterized by its ability to shape membranes and form larger membrane-associated arrays through self-association (HofbruckerMacKenzie2021Ankrd26).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKRD26 gene are associated with an autosomal-dominant form of inherited thrombocytopenia known as Thrombocytopenia 2 (THC2). This condition is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia, normal mean platelet volume, and a deficiency of platelet α-granules, leading to a bleeding tendency that can range from mild to severe (Kewan2020Inherited; Noris2011Mutations; Pippucci2011Mutations). The mutations are located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the gene, which disrupts normal gene regulation and leads to overexpression of ANKRD26 in megakaryocytes, affecting the thrombopoietin (TPO)/MPL signaling pathway and contributing to defective proplatelet formation (Balduini2018Clinic).

Patients with ANKRD26 mutations also have a predisposition to myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The mutations may lead to deregulation of signaling pathways, promoting leukemic transformation of hematopoietic progenitors (Zidan2020Relation). The incidence of hematologic malignancies is notably higher in individuals with ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia compared to the general population (Noris2011Mutations). The gene's role in regulating myeloid lineages and its interaction with type I cytokine receptors are implicated in these pathological processes (Lovatel2023A).

## Interactions
ANKRD26 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with TRIO, GPS2, DIPA, and HMMR, which are involved in the regulation of adipogenesis. These interactions were identified using yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays, and they occur primarily at the C-terminus of ANKRD26, which contains a coiled-coil domain crucial for these protein-protein interactions (Liu2012ANKRD26). The interaction with TRIO, a protein involved in activating Rho and Rac1, suggests a role in cell migration and growth (Liu2012ANKRD26).

ANKRD26 also interacts with type I cytokine receptors such as MPL, G-CSFR, and EPOR, affecting receptor-mediated signaling by altering receptor internalization. This interaction is significant in hematopoiesis, where ANKRD26 modulates the activity of these receptors, impacting proliferation and differentiation in myeloid lineages (BassoValentina2022ANKRD26).

In the context of cilia gating, ANKRD26 forms a complex with TALPID3 and FBF1, essential for the selective import of cilia cargoes. This interaction is crucial for the proper formation of the ciliary gate, highlighting its role in ciliogenesis (Yan2020TALPID3).
