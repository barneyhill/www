# CCL5

## Overview
CCL5, also known as RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted), is a gene that encodes the C-C motif chemokine ligand 5, a member of the CC chemokine family. This chemokine is primarily involved in immune cell trafficking and plays a pivotal role in the recruitment of T cells, eosinophils, and basophils to sites of inflammation, thereby facilitating an effective immune response (Zeng2022CCL5CCR5). The CCL5 protein interacts with several G-protein-coupled receptors, including CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, with a particular affinity for CCR5, which is crucial for its function in chemotaxis and immune cell recruitment (Marques2013Targeting). Beyond its role in immune responses, CCL5 is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis and cancer progression, where it influences cell proliferation, migration, and survival through multiple signaling pathways (Suffee2011Angiogenic; Zeng2022CCL5CCR5). The clinical significance of CCL5 is underscored by its involvement in several diseases, such as cancer and inflammatory disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2020Functional; Aldinucci2014The).

## Structure
The CCL5 protein, also known as RANTES, is a member of the CC chemokine family characterized by its primary structure, which consists of a polypeptide chain of 91 amino acids. This chain includes a 23-amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved to produce the mature protein, which is approximately 8 kDa in size (Lapteva2010CCL5). The secondary structure of CCL5 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure of CCL5 is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are typical in chemokines and crucial for maintaining its three-dimensional shape. CCL5 can oligomerize, forming a quaternary structure that enhances its chemotactic function. This oligomerization is important for its interaction with glycosaminoglycans and receptors on target cells (Aldinucci2014The).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can occur in CCL5, affecting its activity and stability. These modifications are significant for its role in immune responses and interactions with other molecules in the extracellular matrix (Aldinucci2014The). The protein's ability to bind to G-protein-coupled receptors like CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5 is essential for its function in chemotaxis and immune cell recruitment (Lapteva2010CCL5).

## Function
CCL5, also known as RANTES, is a chemokine involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in immune cell trafficking by attracting T cells, eosinophils, and basophils to sites of inflammation, which is essential for mounting an effective immune response (Zeng2022CCL5CCR5). CCL5 interacts with chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, with the highest affinity for CCR5, facilitating cell signaling and migration (Marques2013Targeting; Zeng2022CCL5CCR5).

The CCL5/CCR5 axis is involved in several downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-kB, and MEK-ERK, which are associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (Zeng2022CCL5CCR5). These pathways contribute to the regulation of cell cycle, mRNA translation, and gene transcription, influencing processes such as homeostasis, angiogenesis, and immune response (Zeng2022CCL5CCR5).

CCL5 also plays a role in angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell branching and capillary sprout formation, which is relevant in both pathological and physiological processes (Suffee2011Angiogenic). In the context of viral infections, CCL5 is essential for preventing apoptosis in virus-infected macrophages, thereby allowing these cells to survive and clear the infection (Tyner2005CCL5CCR5).

## Clinical Significance
The CCL5 gene, also known as RANTES, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in immune response and inflammation. Alterations in CCL5 expression are linked to several cancers, including breast, prostate, gastric, and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, high CCL5 levels are associated with advanced stages and poor response to therapy, contributing to tumor invasion and metastasis (Aldinucci2020The; Aldinucci2014The). In prostate cancer, CCL5 promotes cell proliferation and invasion, with CCR5 antagonists like TAK-779 showing potential in inhibiting these effects (Aldinucci2014The). 

In colorectal cancer, CCL5 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, with CCR5 antagonists like maraviroc showing promise in reducing tumor growth (Aldinucci2020The). CCL5 is also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where elevated levels contribute to inflammation in synovial fluid (Zeng2022CCL5CCR5). In liver diseases, CCL5 is involved in acute liver failure and hepatitis, exacerbating liver injury through macrophage recruitment and activation (Chen2020Functional). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCL5 in disease progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CCL5, also known as RANTES, is a chemokine that interacts with several receptors, including CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5, to mediate various cellular responses. The interaction between CCL5 and CCR5 is particularly significant in the context of cancer and viral infections. In pancreatic cancer, the CCL5/CCR5 axis promotes the migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells by inducing F-actin polymerization and increasing intracellular calcium levels, processes that can be inhibited by the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (Singh2018CCR5CCL5). 

In viral infections, CCL5 interacts with CCR5 to provide antiapoptotic signals crucial for macrophage survival. This interaction activates signaling pathways such as Gαi-PI3K-Akt and MEK-ERK, which prevent virus-induced apoptosis in macrophages (Tyner2005CCL5CCR5). 

CCL5 also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, which influences its receptor-binding affinity and specificity. The presence of basic residues in CCL5, particularly in the 40s loop, forms a GAG-binding motif that contributes to these interactions (Monneau2015The). These interactions are crucial for the formation and maintenance of chemotactic gradients, affecting the secretion and trafficking of CCL5 (Monneau2015The).
