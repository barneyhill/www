# FRMD1

## Overview
FRMD1 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing 1, which is part of the FERM domain family of proteins. These proteins are known for their involvement in linking cytoskeletal structures to the plasma membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular architecture and signal transduction. The FERM domain containing 1 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, thereby influencing tumor suppression (Zarei2021Decoding). The gene's location on chromosome 6q27 has been associated with several clinical conditions, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and psychiatric disorders such as early-onset bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential significance in both oncological and neurological contexts (Ünsel2020The; Priebe2011Genomewide; Lee2012Genome).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
FRMD1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its involvement in key cellular pathways. In the context of HTLV-1 infection, FRMD1 is associated with the progression of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is identified as an activating transcription factor binding protein with significant functions in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor suppression by limiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. This suggests that FRMD1 may influence cancer development and progression through its role in this pathway (Zarei2021Decoding).

In psychiatric disorders, FRMD1 is linked to early-onset bipolar disorder through a microduplication at chromosome 6q27, which is significantly overrepresented in patients compared to controls. However, the study did not find significant differences in the distribution of these CNVs when comparing all bipolar disorder patients to controls, indicating a potential but not definitive role in the disorder (Priebe2011Genomewide; Lee2012Genome).

FRMD1 is also mentioned in the context of autism spectrum disorder, where a CNV at 6q27, including FRMD1, is maternally inherited, though the specific clinical significance of FRMD1 in ASD is not detailed (Ünsel2020The).
