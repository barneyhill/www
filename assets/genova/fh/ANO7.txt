# ANO7

## Overview
ANO7, also known as anoctamin 7, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the anoctamin family, which is characterized by its role as a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase. Unlike other members of the anoctamin family that function as chloride channels, ANO7 is primarily involved in the translocation of phospholipids across the membrane bilayer, influencing cellular signaling and membrane dynamics (Whitlock2017AnoctaminsTMEM16). The protein is predominantly expressed in prostate tissues and has been implicated in prostate cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker for disease progression and prognosis (Guo2021ANO7:). Structurally, ANO7 features eight transmembrane domains and is localized mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a role in intracellular processes such as vesicle formation and trafficking (Duran2012ANOs; Guo2021ANO7:). The gene's expression and interactions with other proteins involved in vesicle trafficking underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Kaikkonen2020The).

## Structure
The ANO7 protein, also known as anoctamin 7, is characterized by a structure that includes eight transmembrane domains (TMDs), with both the NH2 and COOH termini located in the cytoplasm (Hahn2009Anoctamin; Guo2021ANO7:). A reentrant loop is present between TMD5 and TMD7, which is suggested to play a role in ion selectivity and lipid conduction (Pedemonte2014Structure; Guo2021ANO7:). ANO7 contains a scrambling domain (SCRD) essential for phospholipid scrambling and a putative cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (c-NMP) binding domain near the N-terminal, which may mediate ion channel opening and dimerization (Milenkovic2010Evolution; Guo2021ANO7:).

The protein also features two N-glycosylation sites at positions N809 and N824, indicating potential extracellular modifications (Guo2021ANO7:). ANO7 is primarily expressed in prostate tissues and is associated with prostate cancer, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Guo2021ANO7:). The ANO7 gene can be transcribed into two spliced variants, encoding the full-length ANO7 and a smaller protein, ANO7S, which is soluble and lacks some transmembrane domains (Duran2011Physiological).

## Function
ANO7, also known as anoctamin 7, is primarily expressed in prostate tissue and is involved in various cellular processes. It is part of the anoctamin family, which includes proteins that function as calcium-activated phospholipid scramblases rather than chloride channels. This scramblase activity facilitates the movement of phospholipids across the membrane bilayer, influencing membrane properties and cell signaling (Whitlock2017AnoctaminsTMEM16).

In healthy human cells, ANO7 is predominantly localized intracellularly, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), rather than the plasma membrane. This localization suggests a role in intracellular processes rather than ion transport across the plasma membrane (Duran2012ANOs). ANO7 is involved in vesicle formation and trafficking, similar to other members of the anoctamin family. It interacts with proteins involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, such as COPG2 and AP2B1, and is found in extracellular vesicles, indicating a role in vesicle maturation and trafficking (Kaikkonen2020The).

The protein's interactions and localization suggest that ANO7 may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication between cells through vesicle-mediated processes (Kaikkonen2020The).

## Clinical Significance
ANO7 (anoctamin 7) is clinically significant in the context of prostate cancer. Alterations in the expression levels of ANO7 are linked to poor survival rates in prostate cancer patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for aggressive disease outcomes (Kaikkonen2020The). Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANO7 are associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer, suggesting that genetic variations in this gene may influence disease progression (Kaikkonen2020The). 

ANO7 is involved in vesicle formation and trafficking, interacting with proteins such as COPG2, AP2B1, HSPA1A, and SND1. These interactions suggest a role in vesicle maturation and trafficking, which may be crucial during cancer progression (Kaikkonen2020The). Changes in prostasome secretion, where ANO7 peptides are found, could support tumor growth, and mutations in ANO7 might affect exosome maturation, potentially influencing chemotherapy resistance, particularly to docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients (Kaikkonen2020The).

The gene's prostate tissue-specific expression makes it a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating prostate cancer (Kaikkonen2020The).

## Interactions
Anoctamin 7 (ANO7) is known to interact with several proteins, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. Using the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) method, researchers identified 64 potential ANO7-interacting proteins in LNCaP cells, a prostate cancer cell line. Notable interactions include those with heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1A (HSPA1A), staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1 (SND1), adaptor related protein complex 2 subunit beta 1 (AP2B1), coatomer protein complex subunit gamma 2 (COPG2), and XRCC5 (Kaikkonen2020The).

These interactions were visualized using dual immunofluorescence and STED microscopy, revealing that ANO7 localizes to the plasma membrane and partially co-localizes with these proteins. HSPA1A and AP2B1 form bright spots at the plasma membrane, while COPG2 appears as granular structures in the cytosol. SND1 co-localizes with ANO7 at the cell surface (Kaikkonen2020The). ANO7's interactions suggest a role in vesicle formation and trafficking, as it is associated with proteins involved in these processes, such as COPG2 and AP2B1. Additionally, ANO7 peptides have been detected in prostate-specific extracellular vesicles, indicating a potential role in vesicle maturation and trafficking (Kaikkonen2020The).
