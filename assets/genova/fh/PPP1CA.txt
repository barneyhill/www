# PPP1CA

## Overview
The PPP1CA gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit alpha (PP1α), a serine/threonine phosphatase that is integral to numerous cellular processes. As a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), PP1α is involved in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, a critical mechanism for controlling cellular activities such as cell division, glycogen metabolism, and muscle contractility (CEULEMANS2004Functional; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The protein is characterized by a highly conserved catalytic core and a tertiary structure that facilitates substrate and metal ion recognition (Egloff1995Crystal). PP1α interacts with a wide array of regulatory subunits and protein phosphatase interacting proteins (PIPs), which modulate its activity and confer specificity, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular pathways (Esteves2012Protein; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The gene's expression and function are implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a proto-oncogene depending on the cellular context (Felgueiras2020Protein; Castro2007PPP1CA).

## Structure
The PPP1CA gene encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase. The primary structure of PPP1CA includes a highly conserved catalytic core, with variations in the N and C termini that confer specificity among its isoforms (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The secondary structure of PP1 is characterized by a compact elliptical domain composed of ten alpha-helices and three beta-sheets, with a core beta-sandwich formed by two mixed beta-sheets (Egloff1995Crystal). 

The tertiary structure features a catalytic site located at the base of a shallow groove on the molecular surface, crucial for substrate and metal ion recognition. This site includes a dinuclear metal binding center, typically involving Mn2+ and Fe2+, coordinated by residues such as Asp92, Asn124, His173, and His248 (Egloff1995Crystal). The structure also includes a sub-domain that shields one face of the beta-sheets (Egloff1995Crystal).

PP1 can form complexes with various regulatory subunits, influencing its quaternary structure and targeting it to specific intracellular locations (Egloff1995Crystal). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which modulate its activity (Egloff1995Crystal). Splice variants of PPP1CA result in different isoforms, with differences primarily in the C-terminal region (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Function
PPP1CA encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1α), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. PP1α is involved in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, which is essential for many cellular functions, including cell division, glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility, and protein synthesis (CEULEMANS2004Functional; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). In healthy cells, PP1α is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

PP1α is particularly abundant in the brain and heart, where it is involved in memory formation and cell proliferation (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). It interacts with over 200 phosphatase interacting proteins (PIPs), which confer subcellular, substrate, or tissue specificity, allowing PP1α to perform specific functions depending on its interaction with these proteins (Esteves2012Protein; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

In the context of DNA damage response, PP1α negatively regulates the phosphorylation of H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, suggesting its role in DNA repair processes (McMahon2019Identification). It also contributes to the regulation of the p53 pathway, which is crucial for the cellular response to DNA damage and stress (Castro2007PPP1CA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PPP1CA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, have been implicated in various cancers. The gene is frequently altered in cancer, with both amplification and allelic loss observed. Amplification of PPP1CA is common in prostate cancer, where it may function as a pro-metastatic proto-oncogene, and is also associated with increased expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (Felgueiras2020Protein). Conversely, allelic loss of PPP1CA is noted in thyroid, larynx, kidney, and colorectal tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role in these contexts (Felgueiras2020Protein; Castro2007PPP1CA).

In colorectal cancer, PPP1CA is crucial for the oncogenic effects of USP11, which promotes tumor growth and metastasis through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Alterations in PPP1CA expression can influence the development and progression of malignant tumors in this context (Sun2019USP11). In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), PPP1CA is significantly downregulated, and its re-expression can induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a tumor suppressor gene (Vafadar2019The).

The gene's role in cellular senescence and stress responses further underscores its involvement in cancer. Downregulation of PPP1CA can impair p53-induced growth arrest, contributing to tumorigenesis (Castro2007PPP1CA). These findings suggest that PPP1CA plays a complex role in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and a proto-oncogene depending on the context.

## Interactions
Protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP1CA) is involved in numerous interactions with other proteins, which are crucial for its regulatory functions. PPP1CA interacts with various protein phosphatase interacting proteins (PIPs) in the human brain, as identified through Yeast Two-Hybrid screening. This study revealed 66 interacting proteins, with 39 being novel, highlighting the complexity of PPP1CA's role in cellular pathways such as signaling, splicing, and metabolism (Esteves2012Protein).

PPP1CA forms complexes with regulatory subunits, which modulate its activity and specificity. These interactions often involve specific motifs, such as the RVxF motif, which is crucial for binding and influences substrate specificity (Casamayor2020Controlling). The C-terminal region of PPP1CA is important for isoform-specific interactions, as seen with proteins like myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) and neurabins, which interact with different PPP1C isoforms (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

In colorectal cancer, PPP1CA is stabilized by USP11, which prevents its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This stabilization leads to the activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, promoting cancer progression (Sun2019USP11). These interactions underscore PPP1CA's role in diverse cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
