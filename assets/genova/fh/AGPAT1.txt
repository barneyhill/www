# AGPAT1

## Overview
AGPAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1, which is a critical component in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an acyltransferase and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids. It facilitates the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid, a pivotal step in the glycerol phosphate pathway, thereby contributing to the production of triglycerides and phospholipids essential for cell membrane integrity and energy metabolism (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry; Agarwal2017Metabolic). AGPAT1 is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and adipose tissue, where it plays a significant role in energy handling and cellular signaling pathways (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). The gene's function and regulation are crucial for maintaining normal phospholipid levels, and its dysregulation has been associated with several metabolic and neurological disorders (Vial2019Dengue; Karagiota2022Lipid).

## Function
AGPAT1 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids. It catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid (PA) by adding an acyl group to the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone, a key step in the glycerol phosphate pathway (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry; Agarwal2017Metabolic). This process is essential for the production of triglycerides and phospholipids, which are vital components of cell membranes and are involved in energy metabolism (Agarwal2017Metabolic).

AGPAT1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and adipose tissue (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). It is involved in energy handling by promoting oleate uptake and incorporation into phosphatidic acid and triacylglycerol, enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and suppressing free fatty acid release, indicating increased reesterification (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). AGPAT1 also plays a role in cellular signaling pathways, as its overexpression enhances cytokine-stimulated signaling (Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal phospholipid levels, which are essential for cellular functions (Vial2019Dengue).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AGPAT1 gene have been linked to several human diseases. Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AGPAT1 locus associated with diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, SNP rs1061808 is linked to diabetes mellitus, while SNP rs3130283 is associated with Alzheimer's disease (Agarwal2012Lysophospholipid). AGPAT1 is also implicated in neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and dementia, and its increased expression is a negative prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma, associated with a high risk of relapse and shorter survival (Karagiota2022Lipid).

In Agpat1-null mice, the deletion of the gene results in severe metabolic, reproductive, and neurological abnormalities, including hypoglycemia, infertility, and seizures. These mice exhibit reduced body fat and low plasma glucose levels, indicating AGPAT1's role in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism (Agarwal2017Metabolic). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and glucose regulation suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to metabolic disorders (Agarwal2017Metabolic). AGPAT1's expression is also regulated by miR-122, a liver-specific miRNA, indicating its potential involvement in liver-related conditions (Karagiota2022Lipid).
