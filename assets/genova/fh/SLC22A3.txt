# SLC22A3

## Overview
SLC22A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 3, commonly referred to as organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3). This protein is a transmembrane transporter belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by its twelve transmembrane alpha-helical domains (Koepsell2013The; Khanppnavar2022Structural). OCT3 plays a pivotal role in the transport of organic cations, including neurotransmitters and various drugs, across cell membranes. It is expressed in multiple tissues such as the liver, kidney, intestine, heart, and brain, where it contributes to the uptake and excretion of organic cations (Koepsell2013The; Yee2021Emerging). The protein's function is modulated by pathways such as the Ca2+/calmodulin pathway, which influences its activity in neurotransmitter reuptake and drug metabolism (Koepsell2013The). SLC22A3 is also implicated in various clinical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological processes (Paquette2019SLC22A3; MohelnikovaDuchonova2017SLC22A3).

## Structure
The SLC22A3 gene encodes the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), a member of the solute carrier family 22. The primary structure of OCT3 consists of amino acid sequences that form twelve transmembrane alpha-helical domains, characteristic of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters (Koepsell2013The; Khanppnavar2022Structural). These helices create a channel that facilitates the transport of organic cations across the plasma membrane.

The secondary structure of OCT3 is defined by these alpha helices, which span the membrane and contribute to the protein's classical MFS fold (Khanppnavar2022Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into an outward-facing conformation, with a substrate binding site located centrally within the transporter (Khanppnavar2022Structural).

OCT3 features a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane domains, which is glycosylated and may play a role in oligomerization (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). This loop is also noted for its sequence similarity to SCO-spondin, suggesting potential binding sites for glycosaminoglycans and cytokines (Engelhart2020Systems). The quaternary structure details are less defined, but the protein's ability to form homo-oligomers is suggested by the presence of conserved cysteines in the extracellular loop (Volk2013OCTs).

## Function
SLC22A3, also known as organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of organic cations across cell membranes. It is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, intestine, heart, brain, and several other organs (Koepsell2013The). In the intestine, SLC22A3 is localized to the apical membrane, where it contributes to drug absorption, while in the liver and kidney, it is found on the basolateral membrane, co-localizing with OCT1 and OCT2, suggesting a role in the uptake and excretion of organic cations (Yee2021Emerging).

SLC22A3 is involved in the transport of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and histamine, as well as various drugs, including metformin and oxaliplatin (Koepsell2013The). It functions as a facilitated transporter, relying on the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane to move substrates (Yee2021Emerging). In the central nervous system, SLC22A3 regulates the interstitial concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters, potentially affecting neuronal activities and behavior (Koepsell2013The). The protein's activity is modulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin pathway, which posttranscriptionally stimulates cation uptake (Koepsell2013The). SLC22A3's role in neurotransmitter reuptake also helps regulate neurotransmitter concentrations near their receptors, impacting various physiological processes (Yee2021Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC22A3 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients, the rs2048327 SNP in SLC22A3 is associated with increased lipoprotein (a) concentrations and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (Paquette2019SLC22A3). The gene is also implicated in coronary artery disease, with certain variants like rs3088442 linked to susceptibility (Nies2009Expression).

In the context of cancer, SLC22A3 polymorphisms have been associated with pancreatic cancer prognosis, particularly the rs2504938 SNP, which is linked to unfavorable outcomes in stage IV patients (MohelnikovaDuchonova2017SLC22A3). The gene is also connected to prostate and colorectal cancers, suggesting a potential pleiotropic effect (Kölz2021Genetic; MohelnikovaDuchonova2017SLC22A3).

Alterations in SLC22A3 expression can affect drug metabolism, particularly for drugs like metformin, and are influenced by genetic factors and conditions such as cholestasis (Nies2009Expression). The gene's role in neurotransmitter transport also links it to psychiatric disorders, including associations with obsessive-compulsive disorder (Koepsell2013The).

## Interactions
SLC22A3, also known as organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with ACTN4, an actin-binding protein that plays a role in cell motility. The wild-type form of SLC22A3 interacts with ACTN4, inhibiting ACTN4-mediated actin crosslinking, which is crucial for cell motility. This interaction is not observed with the edited form of SLC22A3, suggesting that RNA editing affects the protein's ability to bind ACTN4 (Fu2017RNA). The interaction between SLC22A3 and ACTN4 was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, as well as immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments (Fu2017RNA).

SLC22A3's interaction with ACTN4 is crucial for its role as a metastasis suppressor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The wild-type SLC22A3 inhibits cell migration and invasion by binding to ACTN4, reducing ACTN4-mediated actin crosslinking and filopodia formation. In contrast, the edited or reduced form of SLC22A3 decreases its binding capability to ACTN4, thereby accelerating cell motility and contributing to cancer progression (Fu2017RNA).
