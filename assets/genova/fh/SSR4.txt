# SSR4

## Overview
The SSR4 gene encodes the signal sequence receptor subunit 4, a critical component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is involved in the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is integral to the process of N-linked glycosylation, a vital post-translational modification that influences protein folding and function. As a part of the TRAP complex, SSR4 interacts with other subunits to facilitate protein translocation and glycosylation, ensuring proper protein transport within the ER. The protein's structure is characterized by a unique fold, including an antiparallel β-sheet and α-helices, which distinguishes it from other proteins (Newman2020The). Mutations in the SSR4 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and human health (Wang2022Case; Castiglioni2020Expanding).

## Structure
The SSR4 protein, encoded by the SSR4 gene, is a component of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which plays a crucial role in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The primary structure of SSR4 consists of 173 amino acid residues, with the first 23 amino acids forming a signal peptide sequence. The remaining amino acids, from 23 to 173, constitute the functional domain of the TRAP-δ subunit (Wang2022Case).

The secondary structure of SSR4 includes an antiparallel β-sheet composed of seven strands, with α-helices on one side and random coils on the other. This configuration is unique and not represented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Newman2020The). The N-terminal domain of SSR4 starts with a short helix, followed by another helix, a short beta-strand, and an unstructured coil leading to a long helix (Newman2020The).

The tertiary structure of SSR4 is characterized by its unique fold, which has been compared to other proteins but shows significant differences, indicating a novel structural configuration (Newman2020The). The quaternary structure involves its integration into the TRAP complex, where it functions alongside other subunits to facilitate protein translocation and glycosylation (Huang2021Deficient).

## Function
The SSR4 gene encodes a subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, specifically the delta subunit, which is integral to the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in eukaryotic cells (Wang2022Case). This process is essential for the efficiency of N-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification that affects protein folding and function (Castiglioni2020Expanding; Sun2024A). The TRAP complex, including SSR4, works in conjunction with the SEC61 and OST complexes to facilitate protein translocation, ensuring proper glycosylation and protein transport within the ER (Wang2022Case; Sun2024A).

In healthy human cells, SSR4 is crucial for maintaining the normal operation of the TRAP complex, which supports glycosylation processes and protein transport (Wang2022Case). The TRAP complex also plays a role in regulating N-glycosylation during ER stress, with SSR4 contributing to the quality control of this process (Phoomak2021The). Proper function of SSR4 is vital for various cellular functions, including the biosynthesis of proinsulin and insulin in pancreatic β-cells, where it aids in the translocation of preproinsulin across the ER membrane (Huang2021Deficient). Deficiency in SSR4 can lead to impaired glycosylation and associated disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Sun2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SSR4 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically CDG type Iy, an X-linked recessive disorder. These mutations lead to defects in protein glycosylation, resulting in a range of clinical manifestations. Patients with SSR4-CDG often present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features (Wang2022Case; Castiglioni2020Expanding). Additional symptoms may include feeding difficulties, growth retardation, ocular abnormalities, and, less commonly, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities (Wang2022Case; Sun2024A).

The SSR4 gene encodes a subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is crucial for protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and N-linked glycosylation. Mutations such as the p.Trp90* nonsense variant result in truncated proteins that disrupt the TRAP complex's function, leading to defective glycosylation (Wang2022Case; Castiglioni2020Expanding). The condition is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported since its first description in 2014 (Castiglioni2020Expanding). Genetic testing is essential for accurate diagnosis, as traditional methods may not always detect the disorder (Sun2024A).

## Interactions
The SSR4 gene encodes a subunit of the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex, which is involved in protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. SSR4 interacts with other subunits of the TRAP complex, including SSR1, SSR2, and SSR3, forming a functional unit essential for N-glycosylation and protein transport. The TRAP complex binds to the oligosaccharide transferase complex, directly participating in N-glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process (Wang2022Case).

SSR4, along with SSR3, plays a role in maintaining N-glycosylation under ER stress by preventing the association of SSR1 and SSR2 with BiP, an ER stress effector. This interaction is crucial for preserving the function of the TRAP complex during stress conditions (Phoomak2021The). Although SSR4 does not have enzymatic activity, it contributes to the regulation of N-glycosylation and the stability of the TRAP complex (Phoomak2021The).

Deficiencies in SSR4 can lead to decreased levels of proinsulin and insulin, highlighting its role in the biosynthesis of these proteins in pancreatic β-cells. The re-expression of SSR4 can partially restore these levels, indicating its importance in the stability and function of the TRAP complex (Huang2021Deficient).
