# KANSL1

## Overview
KANSL1 is a gene that encodes the KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 1, a protein integral to the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex, which plays a pivotal role in transcription regulation and chromatin modification. The KANSL1 protein functions primarily as a scaffold within the NSL complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as WDR5 and KANSL2, which are essential for the assembly and chromatin targeting of the complex (Dias2014Structural). This protein is characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature and contains specific domains that interact with other proteins, such as the PEHE domain that binds to the histone acetyltransferase domain of MOF (Dias2014Structural). KANSL1 is crucial for the acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16ac), a modification that promotes transcriptional activation (Awamleh2024A). The gene's proper function is vital for cellular homeostasis, development, and neuronal function, with its deficiency linked to disorders such as Koolen-de Vries Syndrome and potentially Parkinson's disease (Linda2020KANSL1; Awamleh2024A).

## Structure
KANSL1 is a protein primarily characterized by its intrinsically disordered nature, consisting of 1105 amino acid residues (Dias2014Structural). The protein serves as a scaffold within the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as WDR5 and KANSL2, which are crucial for the assembly and chromatin targeting of the complex (Dias2014Structural).

The C-terminal region of KANSL1 contains a PEHE domain that interacts with the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of MOF (Dias2014Structural). A specific region of KANSL1, spanning residues 537-773, has been identified as the WDR5-binding region, featuring conserved residues and a potential Zn-coordinating structure (Dias2014Structural). The interaction with WDR5 involves a motif centered on Arg592, which forms hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions with the WDR5 b-propeller domain (Dias2014Structural).

Mutational analysis has shown that the Arg592 residue is critical for the interaction with WDR5, as the R592A mutation disrupts this interaction (Dias2014Structural). The NSL1-WDR5 interaction is essential for the proper targeting of the NSL complex to gene promoters, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (Dias2014Structural).

## Function
The KANSL1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex, which is involved in transcription regulation and chromatin modification. In healthy human cells, KANSL1 functions as a scaffold protein within the NSL complex, facilitating the assembly and chromatin targeting of the complex by interacting with other subunits such as WDR5 and KANSL2 (Dias2014Structural). This interaction is essential for the acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16ac), a modification that promotes transcriptional activation and is vital for the regulation of a large number of genes, particularly housekeeping genes (Awamleh2024A; Dias2014Structural).

KANSL1 also plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating autophagy pathways. It helps balance ROS-mediated and mTOR-mediated autophagy, which is crucial for proper neuronal function and synaptic integrity (Linda2020KANSL1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, genome stability, and development (Unknownauthors2022MLPAMethoddoesnotAlwaysConfirmtheResultsofaCGH:AStudyofKANSL1GeneDeletionPatients). The proper functioning of KANSL1 is essential for early embryonic development and normal cellular function, as its deficiency is linked to disorders such as Koolen-de Vries Syndrome (KdVS) and potentially Parkinson's disease (Linda2020KANSL1; Awamleh2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KANSL1 gene are primarily associated with Koolen-De Vries syndrome (KdVS), also known as 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome. This condition is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. The syndrome is caused by either microdeletions in the 17q21.31 region, which includes the KANSL1 gene, or by pathogenic variants within the gene itself, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations (MorenoIgoa2015KANSL1; Awamleh2024A).

KANSL1 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause the full clinical phenotype of KdVS, which can also include epilepsy, kidney anomalies, and heart defects (Zollino2017Syndromic). In some cases, craniosynostosis, a condition involving premature fusion of skull bones, has been observed in patients with the 17q21.31 deletion (Zollino2017Syndromic).

In addition to KdVS, alterations in KANSL1 expression have been implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Changes in KANSL1 expression can affect immune response genes and are associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (Fejzo2021Analysis). The gene's role in chromatin modification and transcription regulation is crucial, and its disruption can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations (Awamleh2024A).

## Interactions
KANSL1 is a core component of the non-specific lethal (NSL) complex, where it functions primarily as a scaffolding protein. It interacts with several other proteins within this complex, facilitating its role in transcriptional activation. KANSL1 interacts with MOF (also known as KAT8) via its PEHE domain, which is crucial for the catalytic activity of the NSL complex, particularly in acetylation assays targeting H4K16 and p53-K120 (Sheikh2019The). 

KANSL1 also interacts with WDR5, a component of the NSL complex, through a region spanning residues 537-773, with Arg592 playing a key role in this interaction. This interaction is essential for the proper assembly and chromatin targeting of the NSL complex (Dias2014Structural). Mutations in Arg592 disrupt the KANSL1-WDR5 interaction, highlighting its importance (Dias2014Structural).

In addition to its role in chromatin, KANSL1 relocates to microtubules during mitosis, where it stabilizes microtubules and interacts with the spindle assembly factor TPX2. This interaction is crucial for microtubule assembly and stability, indicating KANSL1's role in mitosis (Meunier2015An; Sheikh2019The).
