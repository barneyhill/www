# ALDH3B1

## Overview
The ALDH3B1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member B1, which is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the detoxification of aldehydes, converting them into less reactive carboxylic acids, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kitamura2013Substrate; Marchitti2010Aldehyde). ALDH3B1 is categorized as a cytosolic and plasma membrane-associated enzyme, with tissue-specific expression notably in the liver, lung, testis, kidney, and brain (Marchitti2010Aldehyde). It is particularly active in metabolizing lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, such as hexanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, which are linked to oxidative stress (Marchitti2010Molecular). The enzyme's activity is modulated by lipid modifications, such as prenylation, which enhance its localization to the plasma membrane (Kitamura2013Substrate). ALDH3B1's function in cellular defense mechanisms underscores its significance in reducing cytotoxicity from aldehydes and oxidants, contributing to cell viability and survival (Marchitti2010Molecular).

## Function
The human gene ALDH3B1 encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family, which plays a crucial role in detoxifying aldehydes by converting them into less reactive carboxylic acids. This detoxification process is essential for protecting cells against oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kitamura2013Substrate; Marchitti2010Aldehyde). ALDH3B1 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with notable expression in the liver, lung, testis, kidney, and brain, where it is primarily localized in the cytosol and plasma membrane (Kitamura2013Substrate; Marchitti2010Aldehyde).

The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes, such as hexanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), which are associated with oxidative stress (Marchitti2010Molecular). ALDH3B1 has a high affinity for medium-chain aldehydes and is active towards hexadecanal, trans-2-hexadecenal, and octanal, with the highest affinity for hexadecenal (Kitamura2013Substrate). The enzyme's activity is enhanced by lipid modifications like prenylation, which aids its localization to the plasma membrane (Kitamura2013Substrate).

In healthy cells, ALDH3B1 contributes to cellular defense mechanisms by reducing cytotoxicity from aldehydes and oxidants, thereby enhancing cell viability and survival (Marchitti2010Molecular). Its role in detoxifying aldehydes is crucial for protecting cells from oxidative damage, which is implicated in various human diseases (Marchitti2010Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
ALDH3B1 has been identified as an independent prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer. High expression levels of ALDH3B1 are associated with poor prognosis, larger tumor size, advanced T stage, and positive lymphatic invasion in lung adenocarcinoma patients. The hazard ratio for high ALDH3B1 expression is significantly higher, indicating a strong correlation with poor outcomes (Sun2020ALDH3B1). 

In addition to lung cancer, ALDH3B1 is upregulated in several other tumor types, including breast, ovarian, and colon cancers. This upregulation may provide a growth advantage to tumor cells or result from increased oxidative stress (Marchitti2010Aldehyde). In breast cancer, ALDH3B1 expression is noted in a variety of tumor types, with a majority being invasive and poorly differentiated (Marchitti2010Aldehyde). 

The gene's role in detoxifying aldehydes and protecting against oxidative stress suggests its involvement in cancer progression and potential drug resistance (Marchitti2010Aldehyde). While specific diseases directly linked to ALDH3B1 mutations are not detailed, its altered expression is implicated in cancer and possibly other conditions related to oxidative stress (Marchitti2010Molecular).
