# NHSL3

## Overview
The NHSL3 gene encodes the NHS-like 3 protein, which is part of the NHS family of proteins. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling. NHS-like 3 is characterized by its role in modulating actin dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape and motility. The protein is implicated in the regulation of cellular pathways that influence cell proliferation and differentiation, making it a significant focus of research in developmental biology and disease pathology. Mutations or dysregulation of NHSL3 have been associated with developmental disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical relevance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
