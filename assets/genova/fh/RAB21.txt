# RAB21

## Overview
RAB21 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. The RAB21 protein plays a critical role in the early endocytic pathway, where it is associated with early endosomes and is essential for the endocytosis and trafficking of integrins, which are vital for cell adhesion and signaling processes (Hutagalung2011Role; Bhuin2014Rab). As a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, RAB21 shares structural features such as a central 6-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, and it interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to regulate its activity (Zhang2006Varp; Park2013Structural). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including endosomal sorting, autophagy, and the modulation of protein interactions, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have implications in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Liu2022Rab21; Del2019RAB21).

## Structure
The RAB21 protein, a member of the RAS oncogene family, shares structural features typical of the Rab family of small GTPases. It has a central 6-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by 5 α-helices, similar to the structure of H-Ras (Park2013Structural). Key conserved sequence motifs involved in nucleotide binding, such as the P-loop, Switch I, and Switch II, are present in Rab proteins. These motifs are crucial for the regulation of Rab activity, with the P-loop located at amino acids 20-27, Switch I at 38-49, and Switch II at 69-81 in Rab6A, which is structurally similar to RAB21 (Park2013Structural).

RAB21 interacts with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) like Varp, which contains a VPS9 domain crucial for binding and nucleotide exchange, indicating the importance of this domain in RAB21's function (Zhang2006Varp). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as prenylation, aiding in membrane attachment, although specific modifications for RAB21 are not detailed in the provided context. The context does not provide specific information on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of RAB21.

## Function
RAB21 is a small GTPase protein that plays a significant role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the early endocytic pathway. It is primarily associated with early endosomes and is involved in the endocytosis and trafficking of integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling processes (Hutagalung2011Role; Bhuin2014Rab). RAB21 also participates in the endosomal sorting of specific clathrin-independent cargo and autophagy, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Liu2022Rab21; Del2019RAB21).

In healthy human cells, RAB21 is involved in the internalization and trafficking of molecules such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transferrin, playing a role in endosome fusion and dynamics (Simpson2004A). It interacts with proteins like TMED10, modulating their localization and abundance, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and may have implications for neurodegenerative disorders (Del2019RAB21).

RAB21 is also implicated in the regulation of endosome morphology and function, and its activity is crucial for maintaining the integrity and dynamics of cellular compartments and transport routes (Liu2022Rab21; Bhuin2014Rab).

## Clinical Significance
RAB21, a member of the RAS oncogene family, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and interactions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RAB21 is significantly upregulated compared to normal pancreatic tissue, and its high expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Anand2020Comprehensive). The gene's expression is notably higher in PDAC patients who are occasional drinkers compared to those who drink daily or weekly (Anand2020Comprehensive).

In glioma, RAB21 functions as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Knockdown of RAB21 in glioma cell lines results in reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Ge2017Knockdown).

In prostate cancer, RAB21 is involved in the miR-320a/GAS5 axis, where it is regulated by the long non-coding RNA GAS5. This interaction affects cell viability, migration, and radiosensitivity, highlighting RAB21's role in cancer progression and treatment response (p&gt; Long; Ma2020&lt).

RAB21 also influences multidrug resistance in cancer cells by modulating the surface expression of ABCG2, a protein involved in drug efflux, thereby impacting the effectiveness of chemotherapy (Yousaf2020Modulation).

## Interactions
RAB21, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking. RAB21 interacts with TMED10, a member of the p24 family of proteins, which is essential for cargo transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. This interaction is GTP-favored and has been validated through GFP co-immunoprecipitation assays, although it is suggested to be indirect (Del2019RAB21). RAB21 also modulates the localization and abundance of TMED10, affecting its presence at the Golgi and influencing TMED10 and TMED2 protein expression (Del2019RAB21).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, RAB21 interacts with the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, PS1, regulating its activity by transferring it from early to late endosomes/lysosomes. This interaction is significant for the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as it influences the production of beta-amyloid (Aβ) (Liu2022Rab21).

RAB21 is also associated with the early endocytic pathway, showing colocalization with other Rab proteins such as Rab5a, Rab4a, Rab17, and Rab22a, which are involved in early endosomal processes (Simpson2004A).
