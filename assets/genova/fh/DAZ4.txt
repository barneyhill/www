# DAZ4

## Overview
DAZ4 (Deleted in Azoospermia 4) is a gene located on the Y chromosome, belonging to the DAZ gene family, which is integral to the process of spermatogenesis. The gene encodes the DAZ4 protein, which is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, facilitating its role in RNA binding and regulation. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes, specifically in testicular germ cells, where it contributes to the development and maturation of sperm cells. The DAZ4 protein is involved in RNA processing, potentially influencing mRNA metabolism during the early stages of germ cell development, particularly in premeiotic spermatogonia. The presence and function of DAZ4 are crucial for normal spermatogenesis, and alterations in this gene, such as deletions, have been associated with male infertility conditions like azoospermia and oligozoospermia (Saxena2000Four; Huang2008Restricted).

## Function
DAZ4 (Deleted in Azoospermia 4) is a gene located on the Y chromosome, part of the DAZ gene family, which plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. The DAZ4 protein is involved in RNA binding and regulation, contributing to the development and maturation of sperm cells. It is primarily active in the testes, where it is expressed in testicular germ cells (Saxena2000Four).

The DAZ4 gene encodes a protein that contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is essential for its role in RNA binding. This domain is predicted to be involved in RNA processing, suggesting that DAZ4 may influence mRNA metabolism during spermatogenesis (Saxena2000Four; Kim2009Polymorphic). The DAZ4 protein is 579 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of approximately 65 kDa (Saxena2000Four).

In healthy human cells, DAZ4 is thought to play a role in the early stages of germ cell development, particularly in premeiotic spermatogonia. Its expression is restricted to specific cells within the testes, indicating a specialized function in male fertility (Huang2008Restricted). The presence of DAZ4 and its homologs is crucial for normal spermatogenesis, and deletions in this gene are associated with male infertility (Lin2005Polymorphisms).

## Clinical Significance
The DAZ4 gene, part of the DAZ gene family located on the Y chromosome, plays a significant role in male fertility. Alterations in DAZ4, such as deletions, have been associated with male infertility conditions, particularly azoospermia and oligozoospermia, which are characterized by reduced or absent sperm production. Studies have shown that deletions involving DAZ4, along with other DAZ gene copies, can lead to spermatogenic impairment. For instance, the loss of DAZ1 and DAZ2 is linked to severe oligozoospermia, while deletions of DAZ3 and DAZ4 are found in men with normal fertility, suggesting that DAZ4 deletions might not always impact fertility (Vogt2004Molecular).

In the context of partial AZFc deletions, such as gr/gr deletions, DAZ4 is often involved, and these deletions are considered a significant risk factor for spermatogenic impairment. The prevalence of these deletions is higher in infertile men compared to normozoospermic fertile men, indicating a complex relationship between these deletions and infertility (Shahid2010Associations). The genetic redundancy of the AZFc locus, which includes DAZ4, may allow for some deletions without affecting fertility, but the specific impact of DAZ4 deletions remains an area of ongoing research (Vogt2004Molecular).
