# UBE2V1

## Overview
UBE2V1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and plays a significant role in the process of ubiquitination, which is essential for protein regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control. UBE2V1 forms a heterodimeric complex with UBE2N, facilitating K63-linked ubiquitination, which is primarily involved in non-degradative cellular signaling pathways, such as inflammatory responses and DNA damage repair (Burge2020Leishmania). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Markson2009Analysis). UBE2V1's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in various biological processes, including cancer progression and immune response, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Ma2023Clinicopathological; Shen2018Ube2v1mediated).

## Function
UBE2V1, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1, is involved in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including protein degradation, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. In humans, UBE2V1 forms a heterodimeric complex with UBE2N, which is specific for K63-linked ubiquitination. This type of ubiquitination is associated with non-degradative signaling pathways, such as inflammatory signaling and DNA damage response pathways (Burge2020Leishmania). The UBE2N-UBE2V1 complex is involved in extending ubiquitin chains, a process that is essential for signaling and regulatory functions within the cell (Burge2020Leishmania).

UBE2V1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress responses. It plays a role in the regulation of protein interactions and modifications, which are vital for maintaining cellular functions and responding to environmental changes (Markson2009Analysis). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, UBE2V1 has consistently shown unfavorable predicted interaction energies in some studies, yet it frequently appears in yeast two-hybrid interaction studies, indicating its functional significance in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Markson2009Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2V1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In the context of sexually acquired HIV-1, genetic variants in UBE2V1 have been associated with an increased risk of infection. Specifically, a variant in the 5'-UTR of UBE2V1 was significantly associated with a higher risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women, suggesting a potential role in modulating susceptibility to the virus (Mackelprang2017Whole).

In cancer, UBE2V1 is involved in the regulation of the p53 protein, which is crucial for cell cycle control and apoptosis. In pancreatic cancer, UBE2V1 is upregulated and acts as an oncogene, promoting proliferation and metastasis, particularly in cells with mutant p53. This is mediated through the miR-4689/UBE2V1 axis, where UBE2V1 stabilizes p53 by attenuating Hdm2-induced polyubiquitination (Zhang2023Hypoxia-induced). The gene's expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA LINC00460, which is upregulated in hypoxic conditions and associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer (Zhang2023Hypoxia-induced).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of UBE2V1 in both infectious diseases and cancer, with its role varying depending on the cellular context and genetic background.

## Interactions
UBE2V1, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the ubiquitination process. UBE2V1 forms a heterodimer with UBE2N (Ubc13), which is essential for catalyzing the formation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. This interaction is significant in the context of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBE2V1, despite lacking the conserved catalytic cysteine residue, plays a role in ubiquitin chain assembly through its partnership with UBE2N (van2009A).

In colorectal cancer, UBE2V1 interacts with Ubc13 to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of Sirt1, a process that suppresses autophagy and promotes metastasis. This interaction is critical for the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, highlighting UBE2V1's role in cancer progression (Shen2018Ube2v1mediated).

UBE2V1 is also involved in activating the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which is implicated in cancer regulation. This activation occurs through its complex formation with Ube2n, further underscoring its role in cellular signaling pathways related to cancer (Ma2023Clinicopathological).
