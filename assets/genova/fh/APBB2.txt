# APBB2

## Overview
The APBB2 gene encodes the protein amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 2, also known as Fe65L, which is an adaptor protein involved in cellular signaling and neuronal function. This protein is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate interactions with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), playing a crucial role in APP processing and the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity (Guénette2017APP; Liu2018APBB2). APBB2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, due to its influence on amyloidogenic pathways and β-amyloid peptide production (Liu2018APBB2). Additionally, APBB2 is involved in cancer biology, where its expression is regulated by microRNAs, affecting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhou2021HsamiR30a3p). Understanding the function and interactions of APBB2 is essential for elucidating its role in both neuronal health and disease.

## Structure
APBB2, also known as amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 2, is characterized by its interaction with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. The PTB domain facilitates the binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, which is a key aspect of its function.

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. These modifications are essential for regulating the protein's function and its involvement in signaling pathways. APBB2 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may have different affinities for binding partners or distinct roles in cellular processes.

Understanding the structure of APBB2, including its domains and post-translational modifications, is important for elucidating its role in cellular mechanisms and its potential implications in diseases. The structural insights into APBB2 can provide a better understanding of its interactions with APP and its involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions.

## Function
The APBB2 gene encodes an adaptor protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and neuronal function by interacting with the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity, as APBB2 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of APP, influencing its processing and the production of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides (Liu2018APBB2). APBB2 contains two phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains, which are involved in signal transduction processes (Liu2018APBB2).

In healthy human cells, APBB2 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences transcriptional regulation. This protein is implicated in the modulation of synaptic signaling pathways, potentially affecting synaptic structure and function (Guénette2017APP). The interaction of APBB2 with APP and its involvement in γ-secretase processing suggests a role in the regulation of amyloidogenic pathways, which are important for maintaining neuronal health and function (Liu2018APBB2).

APBB2's role in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal outcomes, particularly in the context of neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity.

## Clinical Significance
The APBB2 gene has been implicated in several diseases, primarily Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, genetic variations in APBB2, particularly the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs13133980, have been associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). This SNP is notably linked to the age of onset, with a stronger association observed in individuals who develop the disease before the age of 75 (Giri2017Unraveling; Li2005Genetic). The GG genotype of another SNP in APBB2 is associated with a later age of onset compared to other genotypes (Li2005Genetic). Additionally, decreased mRNA levels of APBB2 have been observed in the entorhinal cortex of AD patients, suggesting a role in the disease's pathophysiology (Singh2015Role).

In NSCLC, APBB2 is targeted by miR-205-3p, which downregulates its expression, promoting cancer progression. Knockdown of miR-205-3p in NSCLC cells increases apoptosis, indicating that APBB2 may act as a tumor suppressor (Xu2021miR‑205‑3p). These findings highlight the clinical significance of APBB2 in both neurodegenerative and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
APBB2, also known as Fe65L, is a protein that interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and plays a significant role in its processing. APBB2 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of APP, and this interaction is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. The interaction between APBB2 and APP is competitive with APBB1 (Fe65), as increasing concentrations of APBB2 reduce the binding of APBB1 to APP, indicating that APBB2 and APBB1 compete for the same binding site on APP (Kim2011A).

The study of these interactions has been facilitated by techniques such as FRET-FACS, which have proven more robust and reliable than other methods like BRET and FLIM for analyzing protein-protein interactions in living cells (Kim2011A). APBB2 is also implicated in regulating APP processing, as its overexpression increases the maturation and secretion of APP and the production of amyloid-beta peptide, while reducing the response to apoptotic stimuli (Li2005Genetic).

In addition to its role in Alzheimer's disease, APBB2 is involved in cancer biology. In gastric adenocarcinoma, APBB2 expression is regulated by hsa-mir-30a-3p, which binds to the 3′-UTR of APBB2, down-regulating its expression and affecting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Zhou2021HsamiR30a3p).
