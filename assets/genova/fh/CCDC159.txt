# CCDC159

## Overview
CCDC159 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 159, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC159 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC159 protein remain to be fully elucidated, emerging research has begun to explore its potential involvement in various diseases, including lung adenocarcinoma and conditions related to aging, such as Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration (Zhao2024A; Devyatkin2020SingleNucleotide). The identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the CCDC159 gene further underscores its potential significance in disease pathogenesis, warranting further investigation into its functional roles and clinical implications.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CCDC159 gene is emerging, with recent studies suggesting its potential involvement in various diseases. In a study on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCDC159 was identified as an influential gene through a multi-omics integration approach. This study applied the max-ratio criterion to gene expression data integrated with CNV and DNA methylation data, highlighting CCDC159 as a novel finding in the context of LUAD. To the best of the authors' knowledge, CCDC159 had not been previously reported in the literature in relation to LUAD or any other conditions, indicating a new area of research for this gene (Zhao2024A).

Additionally, CCDC159 has been noted in a study focusing on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the senescence-accelerated phenotype of OXYS rats, a model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study identified a novel SNP in CCDC159 resulting in a His239Leu amino acid change in the prefrontal cortex tissue. However, the specific diseases or conditions associated with this mutation in CCDC159 were not detailed, suggesting that its role in these pathologies requires further investigation (Devyatkin2020SingleNucleotide).
