# USPL1

## Overview
The USPL1 gene encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase like 1, which is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. Unlike typical USPs that target ubiquitin, USPL1 is specialized for the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), classifying it as a deSUMOylase. This protein is predominantly localized in the nucleus, specifically within Cajal Bodies, where it plays a significant role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and is involved in various cellular processes such as mRNA processing, alternative splicing, and telomere maintenance (Li2022Structural; Bermejo2013Exploring). USPL1's unique structural features, including a zinc-finger motif and specific residues for SUMO binding, facilitate its interaction with SUMO2/3, distinguishing it from other SUMO proteases (Li2022Structural). The gene's involvement in critical cellular functions and its association with diseases such as cancer and spinal muscular atrophy underscore its biological and clinical importance (Sanchez2015A; Doherty2022Integrating).

## Structure
USPL1 is a unique member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, characterized by its specificity for the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) rather than ubiquitin. The protein's catalytic domain spans residues Met212 to Leu514 and features a catalytic triad composed of Cys236, His456, and Asp472, which is crucial for its deSUMOylase activity (Li2022Structural). This domain adopts a typical USP fold with palm, fingers, and thumb subdomains, forming a right hand-like structure (Li2022Structural).

USPL1 lacks the blocking loops found in other USPs, facilitating SUMO binding. Instead, it has evolved specific residues, such as Phe457 and Tyr451, that interact with the C-terminal tail of SUMO, essential for its binding and catalytic activity (Li2022Structural). The fingers subdomain is stabilized by a zinc-finger motif, which is coordinated by conserved cysteine residues (Li2022Structural).

The protein's structure is further characterized by unique surface elements that enable its specificity for SUMO2, involving specific contacts and a hydrogen bond network distinct from other SUMO proteases (Li2022Structural). USPL1's structural adaptation exemplifies divergent evolution within the USP family, allowing it to interact with SUMO rather than ubiquitin (Li2022Structural).

## Function
The USPL1 gene encodes an atypical ubiquitin-specific protease that primarily targets the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO, rather than ubiquitin itself. This protein is a component of Cajal Bodies (CBs) in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with coilin and plays a crucial role in the formation and dynamics of these structures (Li2022Structural; Bermejo2013Exploring). USPL1 is involved in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is essential for cell growth and proliferation (Claessens2024SUMO; Li2022Structural). 

Despite its localization in Cajal Bodies, USPL1's essential function in CB biology appears to be independent of its SUMO protease activity (Claessens2024SUMO). The protein's activity influences mRNA processing, alternative splicing, and telomere integrity, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proliferation (Bermejo2013Exploring). USPL1 interacts with both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3, showing higher activity for SUMO2/3, and its structural adaptations facilitate this specificity (Li2022Structural). The gene's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in cell biology and its potential impact on organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the USPL1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). In cancer, USPL1 expression is frequently altered. For instance, copy number loss of USPL1 is common in cancer cell lines, which predicts increased sensitivity to its knockout, suggesting potential therapeutic targeting (Doherty2022Integrating). USPL1 is also associated with tumorigenesis, with genetic variants linked to grade-3 breast cancer and involvement in the signaling pathway of multiple myeloma (Li2022Structural). In gastric cancer, USPL1 expression is increased, indicating a possible role in oncogenesis (Sun2019The).

In the context of spinal muscular atrophy, aberrant splicing of USPL1 pre-mRNA is observed in SMA patient cells, with an over-representation of an isoform including exon 2 in severe SMA cases (Sanchez2015A). This splicing alteration is also noted in a mouse model of SMA, where increased usage of exon 2 is more pronounced in muscle tissue, suggesting a tissue-specific splicing change that may contribute to disease pathology (Bäumer2009Alternative). These findings highlight the clinical significance of USPL1 in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
USPL1 is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of RNA polymerase II-mediated snRNA transcription. It interacts with components of the Little Elongation Complex (LEC), including ELL and Ice1, which are essential for snRNA expression. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that USPL1 can be pulled down with ELL, indicating a physical interaction (Hutten2014A). USPL1, ELL, and Ice1 also localize to Cajal bodies, and their recruitment to these nuclear structures appears to be interdependent (Hutten2014A).

USPL1 is associated with U snRNA gene loci, such as U1 and U2, and its presence at these loci is crucial for maintaining snRNA levels. Knockdown of USPL1 results in reduced RNA polymerase II occupancy at these gene regions, suggesting its role in transcription regulation (Hutten2014A). USPL1 also interacts with the spliceosome machinery, as its knockdown affects pre-mRNA splicing patterns (Hutten2014A).

In addition to its role in transcription, USPL1 forms a covalent complex with SUMO2, facilitated by specific structural adaptations that allow it to bind SUMO rather than ubiquitin. This interaction is distinct from other ubiquitin-specific proteases and highlights USPL1's unique binding mechanism (Li2022Structural).
