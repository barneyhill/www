# TTLL13

## Overview
TTLL13 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 13) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) family, which is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin. The protein encoded by TTLL13 functions as an elongase, playing a critical role in the polyglutamylation of tubulin, a modification that influences microtubule dynamics and stability. This process is essential for various cellular activities, including intracellular transport and cell division. TTLL13 is particularly active in the cytoplasm of cells with high microtubule activity, where it interacts with proteins such as CSAP to enhance its activity and regulate microtubule severing. The study of TTLL13 and its interactions provides valuable insights into the regulation of microtubule modifications and their broader implications for cellular function and homeostasis (Mahalingan2020Structural; Bompard2018CSAP).

## Function
TTLL13 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 13) is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) family, which is involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through the addition of glutamate residues, a process known as polyglutamylation. This modification plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics and stability, influencing cellular processes such as intracellular transport and cell division. TTLL13 functions as an elongase, meaning it is responsible for extending the polyglutamate chains on tubulin, which can affect the interaction of microtubules with motor proteins and other cellular components (Mahalingan2020Structural).

In healthy human cells, TTLL13 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in regions with high microtubule activity. Its activity is enhanced by the protein CSAP, which binds to TTLL13 and increases its microtubule severing activity, thereby promoting microtubule dynamics (Bompard2018CSAP). This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining microtubule function and stability, which are critical for various cellular functions, including the maintenance of cell shape, motility, and intracellular transport. The role of TTLL13 in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and function.

## Interactions
TTLL13 interacts with CSAP (cilia and spindle-associated protein), which acts as a regulator of TTLL-mediated microtubule glutamylation. CSAP specifically binds to autonomously active glutamylases, including TTLL13, and significantly enhances their glutamylation activity. The interaction between CSAP and TTLL13 leads to a four-fold increase in the number of cells with severed microtubules, indicating that CSAP enhances the microtubule severing activity of TTLL13. This suggests that CSAP is a critical regulator that activates both the initiating and elongating activities of TTLL13, thereby influencing microtubule dynamics (Bompard2018CSAP).

The presence of CSAP increases the enzymatic activity of TTLL13, similar to its effect on other TTLL enzymes, by promoting microtubule severing. This interaction highlights a regulatory mechanism for tubulin glutamylation that involves CSAP as a TTLL-interacting protein, which alters the level of this modification beyond the balance of glutamylating and deglutamylating enzymes (Bompard2018CSAP). The study of TTLL13's interactions with CSAP provides insights into the regulation of microtubule modifications and their implications for cellular processes.
