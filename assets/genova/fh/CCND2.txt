# CCND2

## Overview
CCND2 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin D2, a member of the D-type cyclins, which are integral to the regulation of the cell cycle. Cyclin D2 functions primarily as a regulatory subunit for cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, facilitating the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development, and is particularly significant in hematopoietic stem cell expansion, neurodevelopment, and pancreatic B-cell proliferation. Cyclin D2's activity is modulated by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, ensuring precise control over cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of CCND2, through mutations or altered expression, is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia, megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome, and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Saleban2023DType; Eisfeld2016Mutations; Pirozzi2021Proximal).

## Function
Cyclin D2 (CCND2) is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, particularly involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. It forms active complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which phosphorylate tumor-suppressor proteins such as retinoblastoma (Rb), p107, and p130. This phosphorylation event leads to the release of E2F transcription factors, initiating the transcription of genes necessary for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Saleban2023DType). Cyclin D2 acts as a growth factor sensor, integrating mitogenic signals from pathways like Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K-Akt to regulate its transcription and activation (Saleban2023DType).

In healthy human cells, cyclin D2 is essential for the proper progression of the cell cycle and is involved in the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells during development (Saleban2023DType). It is the only D-type cyclin expressed in the adult hippocampus, playing a significant role in neurodevelopment and the regulation of cell cycle exit in neural progenitor cells (Saleban2023DType). Cyclin D2 is also involved in early limb bud development and pancreatic B-cell proliferation (Saleban2023DType). Its activity is tightly regulated through phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, nuclear export, and degradation to ensure proper cell cycle control (Saleban2023DType).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCND2 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in patients with the t(8;21) translocation, mutations in CCND2, especially at the Thr280 position, lead to a constitutively active protein that increases cell proliferation and signaling, contributing to the disease's progression (Eisfeld2016Mutations). These mutations are rare in non-CBF-AML patients, indicating a specific role in this subtype of leukemia.

CCND2 is also associated with megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, where gain-of-function variants affect the PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway, leading to brain overgrowth and cortical malformations (Pirozzi2021Proximal). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in CCND2 are linked to microcephaly, short stature, and developmental delays, highlighting the gene's role in brain growth regulation (Pirozzi2021Proximal).

In prostate cancer, CCND2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with lower expression levels associated with aggressive disease forms and poorer prognosis (Chen2017Genetic). In mantle cell lymphoma, CCND2 rearrangements are frequent in cyclin D1-negative cases, leading to overexpression of cyclin D2 and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Salaverria2013CCND2).

## Interactions
Cyclin D2 (CCND2) is involved in several interactions that influence its role in cell cycle regulation. It interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells, where it has an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. This interaction is crucial for its function in AR-dependent prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells, where CCND2 suppresses proliferation and induces cell death in a cdk-independent manner (Kobayashi2009Restoration).

CCND2 is also regulated by epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications. The protein PICOT interacts with EED, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), to modulate the expression of CCND2. This interaction increases H3K27me3 marks at the CCND2 promoter, leading to its repression. Knockdown of PICOT results in reduced H3K27me3 and increased CCND2 expression, highlighting the role of PICOT in the epigenetic regulation of CCND2 (Pandya2019PICOT).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, CCND2 expression is influenced by the lncRNA PDIA3P, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-185-5p. This interaction modulates CCND2 expression, promoting cell proliferation (Sun2017The).
