# RSPO4

## Overview
RSPO4 is a gene that encodes the protein R-spondin 4, a member of the R-spondin family of secreted proteins known for their role in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. R-spondin 4 is characterized by its conserved domain structure, which includes furin-like cysteine-rich domains, a thrombospondin type 1 repeat domain, and a basic amino acid-rich C-terminal domain. These structural features facilitate its interaction with leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGR4, LGR5, LGR6) and E3 ubiquitin ligases (ZNRF3, RNF43), enhancing Wnt signaling by preventing the degradation of Frizzled receptors. This protein is crucial for various developmental processes, particularly in limb and nail formation, and mutations in RSPO4 are linked to anonychia, a condition marked by the absence of nails. Additionally, RSPO4 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its overexpression observed in certain aggressive breast cancer subtypes (ter2021The; Coussy2017Clinical; Raslan2019Rspondins:).

## Structure
RSPO4, a member of the R-spondin family, is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a signal peptide, two furin-like cysteine-rich domains (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domain, and a basic amino acid-rich C-terminal domain (ter2021The; Tocci2020R‐spondin‐mediated). The furin-like domains are crucial for binding interactions with ZNRF3/RNF43 and LGR4/5/6 receptors, which are essential for its role in enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Zebisch2013Structural; Raslan2019Rspondins:).

The FU1 domain primarily interacts with ZNRF3/RNF43, while the FU2 domain binds to LGR receptors (Zebisch2013Structural). These interactions are stabilized by disulfide bridges, which are critical for maintaining the protein's conformation and function (Wang2013Structural). Mutations in the cysteine residues of these domains can lead to developmental defects, highlighting their importance (Wang2013Structural).

RSPO4 shares structural motifs with other R-spondins, such as the b-hairpin protrusion, which is involved in binding interactions (Chen2013The). Despite its structural similarities with other R-spondins, RSPO4 is relatively inactive in Wnt pathway activation compared to RSPO2 and RSPO3 (Kim2008RSpondin).

## Function
RSPO4 (R-spondin 4) is a secreted signaling protein that plays a crucial role in enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. RSPO4 interacts with leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors (LGR4, LGR5, LGR6) and E3 ubiquitin ligases (ZNRF3, RNF43) to potentiate Wnt signaling by inhibiting the degradation of Frizzled receptors, thereby stabilizing β-catenin and activating target genes (ter2021The; Raslan2019Rspondins:). This interaction is facilitated by the protein's conserved domain structure, which includes furin-like cysteine-rich domains essential for binding to its receptors and other components of the signaling pathway (Wang2013Structural).

RSPO4 is particularly important in the development of limbs and nails, with genetic mutations in RSPO4 linked to anonychia, a condition characterized by the absence of nails (ter2021The). The protein's ability to modulate Wnt signaling is not limited to canonical pathways; it can also influence non-canonical Wnt signaling and other pathways, such as BMP signaling, highlighting its versatile role in cellular communication and development (ter2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RSPO4 gene are primarily associated with anonychia congenita, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the absence or severe underdevelopment of fingernails and toenails. This condition is often caused by homozygous mutations in RSPO4, which impair the synthesis of a functional RSPO4 protein, crucial for nail development (Ishii2008Mutations). Specific mutations, such as the Gly67Arg substitution, disrupt the normal binding pattern of RSPO4 with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs), leading to a significant reduction in β-catenin levels and resulting in anonychia (Raza2017GLY67ARG).

Alterations in RSPO4 expression have also been implicated in cancer biology. RSPO4 is overexpressed in certain subtypes of breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metaplastic breast cancer (MBC). This overexpression is associated with aggressive cancer characteristics and may result from gene amplification or hypomethylation (Coussy2017Clinical). While RSPO4 overexpression does not directly correlate with poorer metastasis-free survival, its role in activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway suggests a potential contribution to cancer progression (Coussy2017Clinical).

## Interactions
RSPO4 (R-spondin 4) is known for its role in enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through interactions with leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) 4, 5, and 6. These interactions occur at specific sites where LGR-specific N-terminal loop residues bind to the RSPO4-specific N-terminal β-hairpin, and LGR-specific N-terminal β-sheets bind with the C-terminal β-hairpin of RSPO4 (Raza2017GLY67ARG). RSPO4 contains two Furin-like Cysteine-Rich Domains (Fu-CRDs) that are crucial for binding to LGRs (Raza2017GLY67ARG).

The interaction of RSPO4 with LGRs is essential for the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for various cellular processes. Mutations in RSPO4, such as the Gly67Arg substitution, disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions like anonychia, characterized by the absence of nails (Raza2017GLY67ARG). RSPO4 also interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 and RNF43, which are involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Wnt receptors. RSPO4 inhibits the activity of these ligases, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling (Zebisch2013Structural). These interactions highlight the critical role of RSPO4 in modulating Wnt signaling pathways.
