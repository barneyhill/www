# CYP2C19

## Overview
CYP2C19 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in drug metabolism. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a variety of therapeutic drugs, including proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Lasker1998Characterization; Gardiner2006Pharmacogenetics). The CYP2C19 enzyme is characterized by its heme-binding domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Von1995Structures). Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 lead to significant interindividual variability in drug metabolism, classifying individuals as poor, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizers, which has important implications for drug efficacy and safety (Zanger2013Cytochrome; sienkiewicz2018cyp2c19). Understanding these genetic variations is critical for personalized medicine, allowing for tailored drug dosing to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects (sienkiewicz2018cyp2c19).

## Structure
The CYP2C19 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in drug metabolism. The primary structure of CYP2C19 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Von1995Structures). The tertiary structure of CYP2C19 is a compact, globular form with a heme-binding domain, which is central to its catalytic activity (Von1995Structures). The heme group is coordinated by a conserved cysteine residue, a characteristic feature of P450 enzymes (Von1995Structures).

CYP2C19 typically functions as a monomer, and details on its quaternary structure are less defined (Wang20073D). The enzyme's active site is shaped by specific amino acid residues that influence substrate binding and specificity, such as His74, Ser331, and Phe75, which form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (LEWIS1998Molecular). Common post-translational modifications for cytochrome P450 enzymes include phosphorylation and glycosylation, although specific modifications for CYP2C19 are not detailed in the provided context. The enzyme's structure is crucial for its function in metabolizing various substrates, including clinically important drugs (Wang20073D).

## Function
The CYP2C19 gene encodes an enzyme that is part of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of various drugs in the human liver. This enzyme is involved in the hydroxylation of several substrates, including S-mephenytoin and omeprazole, and contributes to the metabolism of tolbutamide, although its role in the latter is less significant compared to CYP2C9 due to lower expression levels in the liver (Lasker1998Characterization). CYP2C19 is polymorphically expressed, leading to variability in drug metabolism among individuals, which can classify them as poor metabolizers (PMs) or extensive metabolizers (EMs) (Gardiner2006Pharmacogenetics).

In healthy human cells, CYP2C19 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences drug efficacy and toxicity by metabolizing drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Gardiner2006Pharmacogenetics). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the metabolism of these drugs, and its expression levels correlate with the metabolic rates observed in human liver samples (Lasker1998Characterization). The enzyme's polymorphisms can lead to significant differences in drug concentrations, affecting therapeutic outcomes and necessitating dose adjustments in clinical practice (Gardiner2006Pharmacogenetics).

## Clinical Significance
The CYP2C19 gene is clinically significant due to its polymorphisms, which affect drug metabolism and response. Variants such as CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 are associated with poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes, leading to altered drug efficacy and safety. These alleles are more prevalent in certain populations, with up to 25% of Asians being PMs (Zanger2013Cytochrome). Poor metabolizers experience higher plasma levels of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole, resulting in better treatment outcomes for conditions such as H. pylori infections and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (Goldstein2001Clinical; Zanger2013Cytochrome).

CYP2C19 polymorphisms also impact the metabolism of clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug. PMs have reduced drug activation, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events, while carriers of the CYP2C19*17 allele, who are ultra-rapid metabolizers, may experience increased bleeding risk (Zanger2013Cytochrome; elfaki2018cytochrome). In psychiatry, CYP2C19 polymorphisms influence the metabolism of antidepressants, affecting drug plasma levels and treatment outcomes (sienkiewicz2018cyp2c19). These genetic variations necessitate personalized medicine approaches to optimize drug dosing and minimize adverse effects (sienkiewicz2018cyp2c19).

## Interactions
CYP2C19, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, engages in various protein-protein interactions that influence its metabolic activity. One significant interaction is with cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), which is crucial for electron transfer during the enzyme's catalytic cycle. The interaction between CYP2C19 and CPR is characterized by a high affinity, with a dissociation constant ranging from 5 to 110 nM, indicating strong binding. This interaction can be modulated by substrates, inhibitors, and different CYP isoforms (Kandel2014Role).

CYP2C19 also interacts with other CYP enzymes, such as CYP2C9, forming both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. These interactions can modulate the catalytic rates of the enzymes involved. For instance, when CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 are mixed, CYP2C19's methoxychlor-O-demethylation and S-mephenytoin hydroxylation are inhibited, while CYP2C9's diclofenac hydroxylation is activated. This suggests that CYP-CYP interactions can be substrate-dependent and affect metabolic outcomes (Kandel2014Role).

Additionally, genetic variations in CPR can affect CYP2C19 activity. For example, the Q153R CPR mutation increases CYP2C19 activity, highlighting the impact of subtle changes in protein-protein interactions on enzyme function (Kandel2014Role).
