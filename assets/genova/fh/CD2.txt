# CD2

## Overview
The CD2 gene encodes the CD2 protein, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction, which are essential for effective immune responses. The CD2 protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which contains immunoglobulin-like domains that mediate interactions with ligands such as CD58, crucial for the formation of the immunological synapse. This interaction is vital for T cell activation and the orchestration of immune responses. Additionally, CD2 is involved in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and the recruitment of signaling molecules, thereby influencing T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and NK cell cytotoxicity. The gene's expression and function are clinically significant, with implications in autoimmune diseases and immune cell differentiation (Arulanandam1993A; Binder2020CD2).

## Structure
The CD2 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein found on T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. The primary structure of CD2 includes 327 amino acids, or 351 when including the signal sequence, with a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa, which can increase to 50 kDa when fully glycosylated (Binder2020CD2). The extracellular domain (ECD) of CD2 consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains, spanning amino acids 25-209, and is involved in binding to the ligand LFA-3 (Binder2020CD2; Recny1990Structural).

The secondary structure of CD2 is characterized by alternating alpha-helices and beta-sheet structures, with the extracellular segments potentially adopting immunoglobulin-like beta-barrel conformations (Recny1990Structural). The tertiary structure involves a nine-stranded NH2-terminal V-set domain and a seven-stranded membrane-proximal C2-set domain, with the NH2-terminal domain mediating adhesion by binding to CD58 (Wyss1995Conformation).

CD2 can form quaternary structures, existing as monomers or dimers, with transitions between these states influenced by specific mutations (Murray1998Engineering). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at sites such as Asn65, which stabilizes the protein fold (Wyss1995Conformation).

## Function
The CD2 protein, encoded by the CD2 gene, is a critical component of the immune system, primarily expressed on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a significant role in T cell activation and cell-cell adhesion by interacting with its primary ligand, CD58, on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Arulanandam1993A; Binder2020CD2). This interaction is crucial for the formation and organization of the immunological synapse, facilitating effective T cell activation and signaling (Binder2020CD2).

CD2 is involved in the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and cellular signaling in T cells. Upon activation, it transitions to lipid rafts in the cell membrane, co-localizing with signaling molecules essential for TCR/CD3 and costimulatory receptor-mediated signaling (Binder2020CD2). CD2 also plays a role in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and the microtubule organizing center toward the immunological synapse (Binder2020CD2).

In NK cells, CD2 is involved in the conjugation to target cells and recruits CD16 to the NK cell immunological synapse, which is crucial for antibody-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity (Binder2020CD2). CD2's role in immune responses is further highlighted by its involvement in thymocyte maturation and T cell differentiation (Binder2020CD2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the CD2 gene are clinically significant in several autoimmune diseases. CD2 polymorphisms are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with a higher prevalence in females, likely due to the influence of estrogen on CD2 expression. These polymorphisms can enhance CD2 expression, contributing to joint inflammation and autoimmunity, as CD2 is upregulated in RA synovial tissue compared to osteoarthritis or healthy synovium (Lahore2021Polymorphic). The regulation of CD2 by estrogen is conserved across species, and higher CD2 expression levels in women may influence the efficacy of anti-CD2 therapies, such as Alefacept, which targets CD2 high T cells (Lahore2021Polymorphic).

CD2 is also implicated in the generation of Th17 and Treg-type responses, with alterations in its expression affecting the expansion of these cell types. Impaired CD2 signaling can lead to the upregulation of inhibitory markers like LAG-3, associated with T cell exhaustion (Lahore2021Polymorphic). The CD2/LFA3 costimulatory pathway plays a crucial role in immune defense, and disruptions in CD2 expression or function could impact immune responses, contributing to conditions such as immune evasion by pathogens or altered T cell differentiation in skin diseases like psoriasis (Binder2020CD2).

## Interactions
The CD2 molecule, a cell surface glycoprotein, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily through its extracellular and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain of CD2 interacts with CD58 (LFA-3) with low affinity, characterized by a fast dissociation rate, which is essential for transient cell adhesion processes (Wang1999Structure; van1994Human). This interaction is facilitated by polar interactions and involves a flat beta sheet in the membrane-distal domain of CD2 (Binder2020CD2).

CD2 also interacts with intracellular proteins through its cytoplasmic tail, which contains proline-rich motifs. These motifs are crucial for binding with proteins such as CD2BP2 and Fyn kinase. CD2BP2 binds to the CD2 tail via its GYF domain, while the SH3 domain of Fyn can also bind to the same proline-rich sequence, although this interaction is competitive and context-dependent (Freund2002Dynamic). These interactions are significant for regulating interleukin-2 production and T cell activation (Freund2002Dynamic).

CD2 is also involved in the formation and organization of the immunological synapse during T cell and antigen-presenting cell interactions, contributing to the assembly of supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs) (Binder2020CD2).
