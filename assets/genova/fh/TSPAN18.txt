# TSPAN18

## Overview
TSPAN18 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 18, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by its four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 18 is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in calcium signaling within endothelial cells. It facilitates the trafficking of the calcium channel Orai1 to the cell surface, which is essential for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and subsequent cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli (Gavin2020Tspan18; Noy2018Tspan18). This protein is also implicated in the regulation of blood vessel development and stability, as well as in the activation of the NFAT transcription factor, which is crucial for vascular health and inflammatory responses (Noy2018Tspan18; Li2020Tetraspanin18). Mutations and expression alterations in TSPAN18 have been associated with various diseases, including thrombo-inflammatory conditions, neurological disorders, and bone-related diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Becker2023Angular; Gavin2020Tspan18; Noy2018Tspan18).

## Structure
TSPAN18, a member of the tetraspanin family, is characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular domains of unequal sizes. The large extracellular domain (LED) contains conserved cysteine residues, including a CCG motif, which are crucial for maintaining its structure through disulfide bonds (Charrin2009Lateral). Tetraspanins, including TSPAN18, typically have short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails and a small extracellular loop (Skaar2015Expression).

The structural model of TSPAN18 is predicted based on the crystal structure of CD81, another tetraspanin, which suggests a rod-like shape with a large extracellular domain stabilized by disulfide bonds (Skaar2015Expression; Gavin2020Tspan18). This domain is thought to protrude a few nanometers from the membrane, forming a stalk and head subdomain with antiparallel α-helices (Charrin2009Lateral).

TSPAN18 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are common among tetraspanins and influence their function and localization within the cell membrane (Skaar2015Expression; Charrin2009Lateral). These modifications are typically attached to cysteine residues near the membrane-cytosol interface, contributing to the protein's stability and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
TSPAN18 is a tetraspanin protein that plays a significant role in regulating calcium signaling in endothelial cells. It specifically interacts with the calcium channel Orai1, facilitating its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, which is crucial for store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Gavin2020Tspan18; Noy2018Tspan18). This interaction is unique to TSPAN18 among tetraspanins, as it does not occur with other members of the family (Noy2018Tspan18). TSPAN18 is essential for calcium mobilization in response to inflammatory mediators such as thrombin and histamine, impacting processes like von Willebrand factor (VWF) release, which is critical for hemostasis and thrombo-inflammatory responses (Noy2018Tspan18).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, TSPAN18 is involved in the activation of the NFAT transcription factor, which is dependent on functional Orai1 channels (Noy2018Tspan18). TSPAN18's function extends to influencing blood vessel development, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish, where it is crucial for proper angiogenesis and vessel stability (Li2020Tetraspanin18). These functions highlight TSPAN18's importance in maintaining vascular health and responding to inflammatory stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TSPAN18 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of thrombo-inflammatory conditions, TSPAN18 is crucial for the regulation of the Ca2+ channel Orai1 and the release of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in endothelial cells. TSPAN18-knockout mice exhibit reduced thrombus formation and platelet deposition in models of deep vein thrombosis and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting a protective effect against these conditions when TSPAN18 function is disrupted (Noy2018Tspan18).

In neurological disorders, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5′ untranslated region of TSPAN18 have been associated with schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population, although these findings are controversial and not consistently replicated. Altered TSPAN18 expression in brain endothelial or other brain cells could affect Orai1/Ca2+ signaling, potentially contributing to neurological disorders (Gavin2020Tspan18).

TSPAN18 is also linked to bone-related diseases. In Rambouillet rams, mutations in TSPAN18 are associated with angular limb deformity, a condition affecting bone and cartilage development. This is thought to involve disturbances in endochondral ossification and may have implications for similar conditions in humans (Becker2023Angular).

## Interactions
TSPAN18, a member of the tetraspanin family, is known to interact with the calcium channel Orai1 in endothelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the trafficking of Orai1 to the cell surface, which is necessary for proper calcium signaling and the release of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a key player in thrombo-inflammatory processes (Gavin2020Tspan18; Noy2018Tspan18). TSPAN18 co-immunoprecipitates with Orai1, indicating a direct physical interaction, and this interaction is specific, as other tetraspanins do not show the same association with Orai1 (Noy2018Tspan18). 

TSPAN18's role in Orai1 trafficking suggests it may facilitate the clustering of Orai1 at the cell surface, affecting calcium signaling dynamics (Gavin2020Tspan18). In TSPAN18-knockout models, impaired Orai1 trafficking leads to reduced calcium signaling and VWF release, highlighting the functional significance of this interaction (Gavin2020Tspan18). 

Additionally, TSPAN18 is involved in maintaining Cad6B protein levels during the development of cranial neural crest cells, suggesting a role in post-translational regulation. This interaction is crucial for cell-cell adhesion and is regulated by the transcription factor FoxD3 (Fairchild2013Tetraspanin18).
