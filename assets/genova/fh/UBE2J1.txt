# UBE2J1

## Overview
UBE2J1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is primarily involved in the process of ubiquitination, where it facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation. UBE2J1 is categorized as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is particularly active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and the maintenance of protein homeostasis. The enzyme's interactions with various E3 ligases, such as RNF26 and TRIM25, underscore its importance in cellular processes, including the regulation of the endolysosomal pathway and the suppression of cancer progression. UBE2J1's function is modulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its activity and interaction with other proteins, making it a vital player in cellular stress responses and homeostasis (Rodriguez2023UBE2J1; Cremer2020ERembedded; Elangovan2017The).

## Function
UBE2J1 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, primarily functioning in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation, thus maintaining protein homeostasis and quality control within cells (Elangovan2017The; Cremer2021The). UBE2J1 collaborates with the E3 ligase RNF26 to regulate the endolysosomal pathway, ensuring the proper positioning and movement of endosomes and lysosomes within the cell. This regulation is crucial for the timely degradation of cargos such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the inactivation of downstream signaling pathways like the AKT cascade (Cremer2021The).

UBE2J1 is also essential for ER-associated degradation (ERAD), where it facilitates the degradation of misfolded proteins during ER stress recovery. Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with E3 ligases, promoting efficient ubiquitin transfer to substrates (Elangovan2017The). This function is vital for cell survival and recovery from ER stress, highlighting UBE2J1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Elangovan2017The).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2J1 has significant clinical implications in cancer, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and prostate cancer (PCa). In CRC, UBE2J1 is downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with poor prognosis. This downregulation leads to increased tumor proliferation and metastasis by failing to ubiquitinate and degrade the ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a process crucial for inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. The loss of UBE2J1 expression correlates with larger tumor size, higher T classification, advanced TNM stage, and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Wang2022UBE2J1).

In PCa, UBE2J1 is responsible for the degradation of the androgen receptor (AR). Loss of UBE2J1 function results in impaired AR degradation, leading to resistance against antiandrogen therapies, such as enzalutamide. This resistance is particularly noted in high-grade PCa and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The absence of UBE2J1 leads to AR protein accumulation, enhancing AR signaling and contributing to therapy resistance. Restoring AR degradation through ubiquitination-based AR degraders has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance (Rodriguez2023UBE2J1).

## Interactions
UBE2J1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, enhancing the ubiquitination and degradation of RPS3, a protein involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated by the RING domain of TRIM25 and the UBC domain of UBE2J1, and it is essential for suppressing colorectal cancer progression by downregulating RPS3 (Sun2022UBE2J1).

UBE2J1 also interacts with RNF26, an E3 ubiquitin ligase embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This UBE2J1/RNF26 complex is involved in the spatiotemporal control of the endolysosomal pathway, particularly affecting the positioning of endosomes and lysosomes in the perinuclear region of the cell (Cremer2020ERembedded; Cremer2021The).

In the context of viral infections, UBE2J1 interacts with IRF3, a transcription factor in the interferon pathway. This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF3, modulating the host's antiviral response and promoting RNA virus infection (Feng2018Ubiquitinconjugating).

UBE2J1 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), regulating its degradation and influencing antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer cells (Rodriguez2023UBE2J1).
