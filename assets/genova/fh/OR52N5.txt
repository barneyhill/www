# OR52N5

## Overview
The OR52N5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily N member 5, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. These receptors are a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR52N5 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. While the primary function of olfactory receptors is related to olfaction, emerging research suggests that OR52N5 may have additional roles in various physiological and pathological processes, including potential implications in cancer biology (Khan2015Acquired; Marchocki2022Impact). Further studies are needed to elucidate the full spectrum of functions and clinical significance of OR52N5.

## Clinical Significance
The OR52N5 gene has been implicated in various studies related to cancer and other conditions, although its specific clinical significance remains under investigation. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, OR52N5 was found to have emergent mutations in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) samples from platinum-resistant cases, suggesting a potential association with chemotherapy resistance (Marchocki2022Impact). Additionally, copy number changes in OR52N5 were observed in these resistant cases, indicating its possible role in the development of resistance to platinum-based treatments (Marchocki2022Impact).

In neuroblastoma, OR52N5 was identified among genes with copy-number variations, specifically gains in coding regions, which may contribute to the aggressive characteristics of the disease (Khan2015Acquired). However, the study did not directly link OR52N5 to specific clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma.

In multiple myeloma, OR52N5 is located in a minimal common region of genomic alterations, but its direct involvement in disease progression or clinical outcomes has not been established (Carrasco2006Highresolution).

Overall, while OR52N5 has been associated with genetic changes in various cancers, its precise role and clinical implications require further research.
