# CNNM1

## Overview
CNNM1 is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin and CBS domain divalent metal cation transport mediator 1, which is part of the CNNM family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of magnesium ion transport across cell membranes, contributing significantly to cellular magnesium homeostasis. It is predominantly expressed in the testis and brain, with lower expression levels in other tissues such as the stomach, kidney, and heart. The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including stem cell maintenance, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation, particularly in spermatogonial stem cells. While its exact mechanism in magnesium transport is not fully understood, CNNM1 may function as a transporter, sensor, or homeostatic mediator, and it has been suggested to act as a cytosolic copper chaperone. Its role in metal ion homeostasis is further supported by its structural similarity to proteins in yeast and bacteria that are involved in metal ion transport and resistance (GiménezMascarell2019Current; Chandran2016Expression).

## Function
CNNM1, a member of the CNNM family, is involved in the regulation of magnesium ion transport across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular magnesium homeostasis. This protein is primarily expressed in the testis and brain, with lower levels in other tissues such as the stomach, kidney, and heart (GiménezMascarell2019Current). In the testis, CNNM1 is expressed in spermatogonial stem cells, where it is associated with stemness, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation. Its expression decreases during differentiation, indicating a role in maintaining stem cell properties (Chandran2016Expression).

CNNM1 is thought to either directly transport magnesium ions or act as a sensor or homeostatic mediator. It has been proposed to function as a cytosolic copper chaperone, although its precise role in magnesium transport remains unclear (GiménezMascarell2019Current). The protein is involved in the transition from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, as evidenced by its nuclear localization in certain cell types (Chandran2016Expression). CNNM1's potential function in metal ion homeostasis is supported by its similarity to yeast and bacterial proteins involved in metal ion transport and resistance (Chandran2016Expression).
