# DIO2

## Overview
The DIO2 gene encodes the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase 2, a selenoprotein that plays a pivotal role in thyroid hormone metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the more active triiodothyronine (T3). This enzyme is integral to maintaining appropriate thyroid hormone levels and ensuring proper cellular responses, particularly in tissues such as the central nervous system, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Gereben2008Cellular; Luiza2005Type). As a member of the deiodinase family, DIO2 is characterized by its selenocysteine residue, which is essential for its catalytic function (Schweizer2015New). The enzyme's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which modulates its stability and function in response to cellular conditions (Schweizer2015New). Variations in the DIO2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Castagna2017DIO2; Bianco2018Pathophysiological).

## Structure
The DIO2 gene encodes the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase 2, which is involved in thyroid hormone activation. This enzyme is a selenoprotein, characterized by the presence of a selenocysteine residue, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Schweizer2015New). The primary structure of DIO2 includes a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is essential for the incorporation of selenocysteine during protein synthesis (Schweizer2015New).

The secondary structure of DIO2 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Schweizer2015New). The tertiary structure of DIO2 involves a thioredoxin fold, a common motif in proteins that participate in redox reactions (Schweizer2015New). DIO2 functions as a homodimer, indicating its quaternary structure, which is important for its enzymatic activity (Schweizer2015New).

Post-translational modifications of DIO2 include ubiquitination, which can lead to its inactivation and subsequent degradation or reactivation through deubiquitination (Schweizer2015New). These modifications play a significant role in regulating the enzyme's stability and activity in response to cellular conditions (Schweizer2015New).

## Function
The DIO2 gene encodes the enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2), which is crucial for thyroid hormone regulation by converting the prohormone thyroxine (T4) into the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) within cells. This conversion is essential for maintaining proper thyroid hormone levels and ensuring appropriate cellular responses (Gereben2008Cellular; Luiza2005Type). D2 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences the intracellular concentration of T3, particularly in tissues such as the central nervous system, brown adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle (Luiza2005Type; Zeöld2006Characterization).

In brown adipose tissue, D2 plays a significant role in adaptive thermogenesis by increasing T3 production, which is crucial for the induction of thermogenic genes like uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) (Gereben2008Cellular). In the central nervous system, D2 is expressed in astrocytes and tanycytes, where it helps regulate local T3 levels, thus influencing brain function and development (Zeöld2006Characterization). D2-generated T3 is more effective in activating gene transcription compared to T3 from other sources, highlighting its unique role in cellular metabolism and thyroid hormone signaling (Luiza2005Type).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the DIO2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. The Thr92Ala polymorphism is linked to several disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, bipolar disorder, and mental retardation. It is also associated with altered responsiveness to thyroid hormone replacement therapy in hypothyroid patients, suggesting that carriers may benefit more from combination therapy with levothyroxine (LT4) and liothyronine (LT3) rather than LT4 alone (Castagna2017DIO2; Bianco2018Pathophysiological).

In iodine-deficient areas, variations in the DIO2 gene, particularly the SNPs rs225012 and rs225010, have been linked to an increased risk of mental retardation, indicating a genetic component in the condition's development (Guo2004Positive). The rs225014 polymorphism, also known as Thr92Ala, has been associated with liver disease progression in chronic hepatitis B carriers, with the TT genotype linked to an increased risk of advanced liver fibrosis (Rybicka2023Polymorphisms).

The DIO2 gene's role in thyroid hormone metabolism is crucial, and its polymorphisms can lead to reduced deiodinase activity, impacting the conversion of T4 to T3. This can result in hypothyroid-like symptoms and affect psychological well-being and cognitive function (Panicker2009Common; Castagna2017DIO2).

## Interactions
The DIO2 protein, also known as type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase, is involved in several interactions with other proteins that regulate its activity and stability. DIO2 forms a homodimer, which is crucial for its enzymatic function. This dimerization occurs through interactions at both the transmembrane and globular domains, with the latter involving a thioredoxin fold-like interface (Sagar2007UbiquitinationInduced).

DIO2 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases WSB-1 and TEB4, which target it for proteasomal degradation. WSB-1-mediated ubiquitination is influenced by the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which accelerates DIO2 ubiquitination and affects local T3 production (Sagar2007UbiquitinationInduced; Zavacki2009The). TEB4 specifically interacts with DIO2, leading to its degradation, and this interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Zavacki2009The).

DIO2 also interacts with the ubiquitin conjugase UBC-7 and the deubiquitinase VDU-1. These interactions are part of a regulatory complex that controls DIO2 activity through cycles of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. VDU-1 can reverse the ubiquitination of DIO2, rescuing it from proteasomal degradation and restoring its activity (Sagar2007UbiquitinationInduced).
