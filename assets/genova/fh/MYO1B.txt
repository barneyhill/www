# MYO1B

## Overview
MYO1B is a gene that encodes the protein myosin IB, a member of the class I myosins, which are single-headed, actin-associated molecular motors. Myosin IB is characterized by its ability to interact with actin filaments and is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane remodeling and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein plays a significant role in linking the cytoskeleton to cellular membranes, influencing processes such as endocytosis, cell migration, and neuronal development. Myosin IB is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and is particularly important in the regulation of actin networks, where it modulates the organization and density of actin filaments. The protein's interactions with phosphoinositides and its involvement in signaling pathways, such as EphB signaling, underscore its critical role in cellular morphology and function (Komaba2010Localization; Stafford2005Mammalian; Prospéri2015Myosin).

## Structure
The MYO1B protein is a class I myosin with a distinct molecular structure characterized by a monomeric form. It consists of a heavy chain of approximately 130 kDa and multiple calmodulin light chains of 17 kDa each, with a total molar mass of 213 kDa (Stafford2005Mammalian). The protein is tadpole-shaped, with a motor domain and a lever arm that includes five calmodulin-binding IQ motifs, resulting in a total length of about 27.9 nm (Stafford2005Mammalian).

The secondary structure includes a motor domain and a lever arm, which is flexible and undergoes conformational changes during ATP hydrolysis (Stafford2005Mammalian). The tertiary structure is modeled as a bead model, with the head domain, five IQ domains, and two tail domains, showing a bent conformation in electron microscopy images (Stafford2005Mammalian).

Myo1b can cross-link actin filaments, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements (Stafford2005Mammalian). The protein's interaction with actin is modulated by loop 1 in the transducer region, which affects actin affinity, ATPase activity, and nucleotide access (Clark2005Loop).

## Function
MYO1B (myosin IB) is a class I myosin that functions as a single-headed, actin-associated molecular motor involved in various cellular processes. It is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and plays a crucial role in linking the cytoskeleton to membranes, influencing membrane remodeling and actin dynamics (Stafford2005Mammalian; Prospéri2015Myosin). MYO1B is involved in the regulation of actin networks, where it can flatten and prune branched actin filaments, thus controlling the density and organization of actin networks, particularly in neuronal growth cones (Pernier2020Myosin).

MYO1B is also essential in the endocytic pathway, where it modulates the morphology and protein transport within multivesicular sorting endosomes (SalasCortes2005Myosin). It interacts with phosphoinositides such as PIP2 and PIP3, which are crucial for its localization to actin-enriched membrane projections like filopodia, impacting cell migration and membrane-cytoskeleton interactions (Komaba2010Localization).

In the context of EphB signaling, MYO1B acts as an effector, facilitating cell repulsion and tissue patterning by controlling the formation of filopodia and retraction fibers (Prospéri2015Myosin). It is also involved in neuronal development, promoting axon formation by regulating actin wave propagation and growth cone dynamics (Iuliano2018Myosin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MYO1B gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In cervical cancer, MYO1B is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor survival outcomes and aggressive clinical behaviors, such as increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MYO1B expression is correlated with factors like FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, HPV infection, and pathological grade, suggesting its role in cervical cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2018Myosin).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), MYO1B is also upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It is involved in a ceRNA network that affects survival and is associated with increased cell migration and metastasis. MYO1B expression is influenced by DNA methylation and is inversely correlated with certain immune cell infiltrations, indicating its role in tumor progression and immune response modulation (Li2023CCND1associated; Yamada2017Passenger).

In colorectal cancer, MYO1B overexpression is associated with malignant phenotypes, including increased tumor progression and angiogenesis. It promotes these processes by inhibiting autophagic degradation of HIF-1α, leading to enhanced VEGF secretion (Chen2022Myo1b).

## Interactions
MYO1B interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is associated with endosomes and co-immunoprecipitates with Pmel17, suggesting a regulatory role in protein trafficking through early sorting multi-vesicular endosomes (MVEs) (SalasCortes2005Myosin). MYO1B also interacts with EphB2 receptors, acting as an effector in EphB-ephrinB signaling, which is crucial for cell repulsion and morphology changes. This interaction involves the tail domain of MYO1B, which is tyrosine phosphorylated in an EphB2-dependent manner (Prospéri2015Myosin). The interaction with EphB2 is independent of EphB2 stimulation but requires its kinase activity, and MYO1B's motor activity and phosphorylation are essential for the distribution of non-muscle myosin II and the formation of filopodia (Prospéri2015Myosin).

MYO1B also binds specifically to phosphoinositides, such as PIP2 and PIP3, through its tail domain, which contains a putative Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain. This interaction is crucial for MYO1B's localization to the cell periphery and filopodia (Komaba2010Localization). These interactions highlight MYO1B's role in membrane remodeling and actin dynamics regulation.
