# CCDC190

## Overview
CCDC190 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 190, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in cellular structural organization or signaling pathways. Although the specific biological functions of CCDC190 are not fully elucidated, its expression patterns and interactions indicate its involvement in critical cellular mechanisms, including those related to cancer and other diseases. The gene's differential expression in various pathological conditions highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2019Genomic; Roundhill2021RNA; Ohguro2023Lipid).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CCDC190 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of myopia, CCDC190 is one of the top down-regulated genes in human scleral stroma fibroblasts from eyes with high axial lengths, suggesting a role in the regulatory mechanisms responsible for myopic scleral elongation (Ohguro2023Lipid). In Ewing sarcoma, CCDC190 is differentially expressed in cancer stem cells compared to parental cells, with its expression having prognostic significance in terms of event-free survival (Roundhill2021RNA). This suggests that CCDC190 may serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in this type of cancer.

In triple-negative breast cancer, CCDC190 is significantly downregulated following treatment with amorphophalli rhizoma, and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and migration, indicating its involvement in cancer cell dynamics (Wu2019Genomic). Additionally, in the context of chronic kidney disease, CCDC190 is among the significantly downregulated genes in human coronary artery endothelial cells exposed to uremic serum, although specific diseases or conditions associated with these alterations are not detailed (RangelLópez2021Gene).
