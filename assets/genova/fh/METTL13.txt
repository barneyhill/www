# METTL13

## Overview
METTL13 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 13, eEF1A N-terminus and K55, which is a dual methyltransferase enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), specifically targeting its N-terminus and lysine 55 (Lys55) for methylation. METTL13 plays a critical role in modulating translation rates and protein synthesis dynamics, thereby influencing cellular growth and proliferation. The enzyme is characterized by its unique structure, comprising two distinct seven beta strand (7BS) domains, which are responsible for its methyltransferase activity. METTL13's function is highly specific to eEF1A, and its activity has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and cellular signaling pathways (Jakobsson2021Structure; Jakobsson2018The; Liu2019METTL13).

## Structure
METTL13 is a dual methyltransferase enzyme characterized by its unique domain organization, comprising two distinct seven beta strand (7BS) domains: MT13-N and MT13-C. These domains belong to the 7BS superfamily but are not closely related. The MT13-C domain is structurally similar to spermidine synthase, while the MT13-N domain is related to lysine-specific methyltransferases, such as CS-KMT (METTL12) and eEF1A-KMT4 (Jakobsson2021Structure).

The MT13-C domain, responsible for trimethylation of the eEF1A N-terminal, exhibits a classic Rossmann fold-like 7BS structure, featuring a twisted 7BS sheet surrounded by six α-helices. Key residues involved in AdoHcy coordination, such as Gly503 and Glu524, have been identified, along with a short DG-motif (Asp551-Gly552) (Jakobsson2018The). The MT13-N domain is responsible for dimethylation of Lys55 in eEF1A (Jakobsson2021Structure).

METTL13's structure has been studied using crystallization and X-ray diffraction, with the MT13-C domain crystallized and resolved using molecular replacement techniques (Jakobsson2018The). The enzyme's specificity for eEF1A is highlighted by its preference for specific amino acids at various positions in the peptide sequence (Jakobsson2018The).

## Function
METTL13 is a dual methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) in human cells. It specifically targets the N-terminus and lysine 55 (Lys55) of eEF1A, modulating codon-specific translation rates and influencing protein synthesis dynamics (Jakobsson2018The). The methylation of eEF1A by METTL13 is essential for maintaining proper translation rates, as it affects the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome during mRNA translation, thereby optimizing protein synthesis (Jakobsson2018The).

In healthy human cells, METTL13-mediated methylation of eEF1A is widespread and has been observed across various cell lines and tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Jakobsson2021Structure; Jakobsson2018The). The enzyme's activity is highly specific to eEF1A, with the N-terminal domain of METTL13 responsible for trimethylation and the C-terminal domain for dimethylation of Lys55 (Jakobsson2021Structure; Jakobsson2018The). This methylation enhances the GTPase activity of eEF1A, thereby increasing the overall rate of translation and protein synthesis, which is crucial for cell growth and proliferation (Jakobsson2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the METTL13 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, METTL13 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with increased tumor size and metastasis. Knockdown of METTL13 in gastric cancer cell lines suppresses cell growth and metastasis, while overexpression promotes these processes, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Wu2022METTL13). In pancreatic and lung cancers, METTL13 is responsible for the methylation of eEF1A at lysine 55, which enhances translational output and tumorigenesis. Depletion of METTL13 in these cancers reduces tumor growth and sensitizes cells to growth-signaling pathway inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2019METTL13).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, METTL13 appears to have a tumor-suppressive role by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling pathway and c-Myc expression. Overexpression of METTL13 in this context leads to reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2021METTL13). METTL13 is also involved in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is upregulated by HN1L, promoting tumor growth and metastasis through the upregulation of transcription factors TCF3 and ZEB1 (Li2019HN1Lmediated). These findings underscore the complex role of METTL13 in cancer, acting as an oncogene in some contexts and a tumor suppressor in others.

## Interactions
METTL13 is known to interact specifically with the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), targeting its N-terminus and lysine 55 (K55) for methylation. This interaction is crucial for modulating translation rates and enhancing protein synthesis. METTL13's methylation of eEF1A at K55 is a significant physiological activity, as demonstrated by in vitro methylation assays showing that METTL13 can methylate eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, but not when a K55R substitution is present (Jakobsson2018The; Liu2019METTL13).

The interaction between METTL13 and eEF1A is highly specific, with METTL13 not methylating other proteins such as histones, nucleosomes, or ribosomal subunits, indicating that eEF1A is a primary substrate (Liu2019METTL13). Structural modeling and immunoprecipitation studies have been used to analyze the interaction between METTL13 and eEF1A, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cellular processes (Liu2019METTL13).

In gastric cancer cells, METTL13 regulates the expression of HN1L through eEF1A, although this regulation is independent of K55 methylation. This suggests a complex interaction network where METTL13 influences other proteins and pathways beyond direct methylation (Wu2022METTL13).
