# MCHR1

## Overview
The MCHR1 gene encodes the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is integral to various physiological processes, particularly in the central nervous system. As a member of the GPCR family, MCHR1 is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in signal transduction. The receptor is primarily activated by the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), influencing energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, and sleep regulation. MCHR1's involvement extends to modulating primary cilia length and impacting behavioral functions such as anxiety and reward processing. The gene's expression and function are subject to regulation through post-translational modifications and interactions with proteins like MRAP2, which modulate its signaling pathways. Alterations in MCHR1 have been linked to clinical conditions such as obesity and anxiety disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2024Structural; He2024Mechanisms; Wang2022Determination).

## Structure
The melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a canonical seven transmembrane helix domain (TMD) structure, typical of GPCRs (He2024Mechanisms). The receptor's primary structure includes specific amino acids crucial for its function, such as Arg11 and D123(3.32), which are involved in key interactions for receptor activation (Vitale2004Structural). 

In terms of secondary and tertiary structures, MCHR1 features interactions and movements of various helices, including the outward motion of helix 3 and shifts in helices 2, 4, 6, and 7, which are important for its activation mechanism (Vitale2004Structural). The receptor also has a helix 8, predicted to be functionally significant (Saito2013Regulated).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in MCHR1's function. Glycosylation, particularly N-linked glycosylation at Asn13, Asn16, and Asn23, is essential for receptor folding, trafficking, and stability (Saito2013Regulated). Phosphorylation sites are predicted, although their functional roles are not fully understood (Saito2013Regulated).

MCHR1's quaternary structure involves its interaction with G proteins, forming complexes such as the MCHR1-Gi1 complex, which is crucial for its signaling functions (Gong2023Structural). The receptor's structure is stabilized in studies using techniques like cryo-EM, providing detailed insights into its active and inactive states (Ye2024Structural).

## Function
Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCHR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. MCHR1 is activated by the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide that influences energy balance by stimulating food intake and promoting body weight gain (Ye2024Structural). In healthy human cells, MCHR1 is involved in various physiological processes, including sleep regulation, where it facilitates slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) by inhibiting wakefulness-inducing neurotransmitter systems (Ye2024Structural).

MCHR1 is also implicated in modulating primary cilia length, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The receptor is enriched in primary cilia and regulates ciliary length through a Gi/o-mediated pathway, involving Akt phosphorylation (Hamamoto2016Modulation). This modulation of ciliary length is linked to the receptor's role in feeding and energy metabolism, with dysfunction potentially leading to metabolic disorders (Hamamoto2016Modulation).

In addition to its role in energy balance, MCHR1 affects various behavioral and physiological functions such as reward processing, learning, olfaction, anxiety, and nociception (Ye2024Structural). Understanding the interactions of MCHR1 with its ligands is crucial for its function and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MCHR1 gene have been implicated in several conditions, particularly obesity and anxiety disorders. MCHR1 is a receptor for the melanin-concentrating hormone, which plays a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. Studies have shown that MCHR1-deficient mice exhibit hyperphagia and resistance to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that disruptions in MCHR1 can lead to altered energy balance and body weight regulation (Chen2002Targeted). 

In humans, allele-specific methylation of the MCHR1 gene has been associated with body mass index (BMI) and age, indicating that epigenetic modifications can influence MCHR1 expression and potentially contribute to obesity (Stepanow2011AlleleSpecific). The GT allele of MCHR1 shows lower methylation and higher expression, which may affect food intake and BMI (Stepanow2011AlleleSpecific).

MCHR1 also plays a role in mood regulation. Mice with a null mutation in the MCHR1 gene display anxiolytic-like behavior, suggesting that MCHR1 is involved in anxiety processes. This has led to the hypothesis that MCHR1 receptor antagonists could be explored as potential treatments for anxiety disorders (Roy2005Genetic).

## Interactions
MCHR1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various physiological processes. It forms a complex with the Gi1 protein, where the primary interface is established by the intracellular cavity of MCHR1 and the α5 helix of Gαi1. Specific residues such as R210, A213, R319, and T326 in MCHR1 are involved in polar interactions with the α5 helix, and the ICL2 and ICL3 regions of MCHR1 also contribute to the interface with the Gα subunit (Gong2023Structural).

MCHR1 also interacts with the Melanocortin Receptor Accessory Protein 2 (MRAP2), which modulates its signaling. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence assays, indicating that MRAP2 can inhibit MCHR1 signaling in vitro. The C-terminal domains of MRAP2 are crucial for this modulation, affecting intracellular calcium signaling and membrane transport (Wang2022Determination).

The interaction between MCHR1 and MRAP2 is specific, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, which show that MCHR1 strongly co-purifies with MRAP2 but not with MRAP1. This suggests a functional complex formation between MCHR1 and MRAP2, potentially influencing energy metabolism and feeding behavior (Wang2022Determination).
