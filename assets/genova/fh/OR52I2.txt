# OR52I2

## Overview
OR52I2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily I member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR52I2 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting additional roles in local signaling pathways, including potential involvement in neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (enz2020chronic). The gene has also been implicated in clinical contexts, such as therapy resistance in cancer treatment and associations with physiological traits like bilirubin levels and drug response (Que2023Safety; gilly2019sequencing). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of OR52I2's functions and its implications in health and disease remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Function
OR52I2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants, functioning as part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily located in the olfactory epithelium, where they play a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. The protein encoded by OR52I2 binds specific odorant molecules, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory responses (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR52I2 has been implicated in various biological processes beyond the olfactory system. It is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in local signaling pathways. For instance, in the context of multiple sclerosis, OR52I2 is differentially expressed in demyelinated cortical grey matter, indicating a possible involvement in the pathology of the disease. The expression of OR52I2 in neurons and blood vessels suggests it may have roles in local or systemic signaling within the brain (enz2020chronic). The exact molecular mechanisms and organismal outcomes of OR52I2's activity in these contexts remain areas of active research.

## Clinical Significance
The OR52I2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts. In a study involving pediatric patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies treated with sintilimab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, mutations in OR52I2 were associated with nonresponse to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a potential role of OR52I2 mutations in therapy resistance and immune evasion in these patients (Que2023Safety).

In genetic studies of founder populations, OR52I2 has been associated with bilirubin levels, although this association was not replicated in a separate cohort, indicating that the link may not be robust. The gene's prior association was with the response to serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs in major depressive disorder, highlighting its potential involvement in diverse physiological processes (gilly2019sequencing).

Additionally, OR52I2 was identified as differentially expressed between microcystic congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) and congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of these conditions. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from OR52I2 mutations or expression alterations remain underexplored (Hong2019Gene).
