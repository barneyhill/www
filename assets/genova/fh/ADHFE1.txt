# ADHFE1

## Overview
ADHFE1 is a gene that encodes the protein alcohol dehydrogenase iron containing 1, which is a member of the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase family. This protein functions as a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes, specifically catalyzing the oxidation of 4-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde. It is categorized within the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) family and plays a significant role in energy production and detoxification pathways. The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of iron metabolism and cellular redox balance, contributing to metabolic flexibility and homeostasis. ADHFE1 is expressed primarily in adult liver tissue and is subject to alternative splicing, which may influence its function during embryonic development. The gene has been implicated in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer, where it may act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the context (Deng2002Cloning; Chen2021ADHFE1; Mishra2017ADHFE1).

## Structure
The ADHFE1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase family. The protein consists of 467 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 50 kD, and includes a long open reading frame of 1401 base pairs (Deng2002Cloning). The primary structure of ADHFE1 features a putative initiation ATG codon and a polyadenylation signal. Sequence analysis reveals a conserved NAD(H) binding site and an iron-binding motif, which includes three histidine residues typical of type III alcohol dehydrogenases. However, in ADHFE1, one of these histidine residues is replaced by tyrosine, indicating variability in metal ion requirements (Deng2002Cloning).

The protein also contains a unique 13-residue insert in the conserved motif, shared only with T. volcanium, suggesting evolutionary divergence (Deng2002Cloning). ADHFE1 is expressed primarily in adult liver tissue, with alternative splicing resulting in two variants, one of which includes a 351 bp insert leading to a different protein of 303 amino acids (Deng2002Cloning). This splicing may influence gene expression during embryonic development. The protein's structure and expression patterns suggest its involvement in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism and potentially cancer development (Chen2021ADHFE1).

## Function
ADHFE1 is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes. It catalyzes the oxidation of 4-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde, a process coupled with the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) (Mishra2017ADHFE1). This enzyme is part of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) family and is involved in energy production and detoxification pathways within the mitochondria (Deng2002Cloning).

ADHFE1 is also implicated in the regulation of iron metabolism, as its expression is upregulated by Fe2+ and linked to MYC signaling, which is a key regulator of iron metabolism (Mishra2017ADHFE1). The enzyme's activity contributes to the maintenance of cellular redox balance by increasing the NADPH to NADP ratio, which is essential for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense (Mishra2017ADHFE1).

In terms of cellular outcomes, ADHFE1 is involved in the synthesis of metabolites that support lipogenesis and energy production, particularly under hypoxic conditions. This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting metabolic flexibility in response to environmental changes (Mishra2017ADHFE1).

## Clinical Significance
ADHFE1 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly breast cancer, where it functions as an oncogene. Its overexpression is associated with metabolic reprogramming, leading to increased production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which contributes to cancer progression by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing cell invasion (Mishra2017ADHFE1). High ADHFE1 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients, suggesting its role in aggressive cancer phenotypes (Mishra2017ADHFE1). 

In colorectal cancer, hypermethylation of the ADHFE1 gene is associated with increased cell proliferation, indicating a potential role in cancer progression through modulation of cell cycle progression (Hypermethylation; Hu2019&lt; p&gt). In contrast, ADHFE1 expression is generally downregulated in several cancers, including breast, colon, and gastric cancers, often due to hypermethylation, which correlates with poor survival outcomes (Chen2021ADHFE1). This downregulation suggests a potential tumor-suppressing function in certain contexts, highlighting the complex role of ADHFE1 in cancer biology. The gene's involvement in metabolic pathways and its interaction with MYC signaling further underscore its significance in cancer pathogenesis (Mishra2017ADHFE1).

## Interactions
ADHFE1, an enzyme involved in metabolic processes, participates in various protein-protein interactions. A study using the STRING database identified a network of 11 proteins, including ADHFE1, that are involved in oxidation and metabolism processes. This network suggests that ADHFE1 interacts with other proteins to facilitate its role in cellular detoxification and energy metabolism (Chen2021ADHFE1).

In the context of cancer, ADHFE1 is implicated in pathways related to energy metabolism, DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation. Its expression is negatively correlated with genes associated with DNA replication and cell cycle regulation, indicating potential regulatory interactions that may influence cancer progression (Chen2021ADHFE1).

Additionally, ADHFE1 is involved in the metabolism of γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. It encodes a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (HOT) enzyme, which is related to bacterial GHB dehydrogenases. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of GHB to succinic semialdehyde, highlighting its role in metabolic pathways within neuronal-like cells (Lyon2009Enzymes).

These interactions and roles underscore the importance of ADHFE1 in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in cancer and neuronal metabolism.
