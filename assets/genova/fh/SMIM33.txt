# SMIM33

## Overview
SMIM33, or small integral membrane protein 33, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that occur at or across the cell membrane. Transmembrane proteins like SMIM33 often play critical roles in signaling pathways, transport, and cellular communication, although the specific functions of SMIM33 remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
