# CPSF1

## Overview
CPSF1, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 1, is a gene that encodes a critical protein component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. This protein, also known as CPSF160, functions primarily as a scaffold within the complex, facilitating the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, a crucial step in mRNA maturation. The CPSF1 protein is characterized by its large size and the presence of WD repeat domains, which enable it to mediate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and function of the CPSF complex (Liu2024Modulation). Through its interactions with other subunits, such as CPSF30 and WDR33, CPSF1 plays a pivotal role in recognizing the polyadenylation signal (PAS) and coordinating the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA, processes vital for mRNA stability and gene expression (Kumar2019Mechanistic; Chen2021Cleavage). The gene's involvement in alternative polyadenylation and its implications in various diseases, including cancers and developmental disorders, underscore its significance in cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Sakai2020Aberrant; Ouyang2019CPSF1).

## Structure
CPSF1, also known as CPSF160, is a key component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is crucial for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing. CPSF1 is characterized by its large size, approximately 160 kDa, and features three β-propeller domains arranged in a triangular formation, each containing seven WD repeats. These WD domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CPSF1 acts as a scaffold within the CPSF complex (Liu2024Modulation).

The CPSF complex, including CPSF1, forms a stable heterotetrameric core that recognizes the polyadenylation signal (PAS) motif. CPSF1, along with WDR33, forms the structural scaffold of the CPSF complex, with CPSF30 bridging interactions between CPSF1-WDR33 and Fip1 (Kumar2019Mechanistic). CPSF1's role is to position CPSF30 and WDR33 for proper PAS recognition, although it does not directly interact with the PAS itself (Liu2024Modulation).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CPSF1 are not provided, the protein's structural role in the CPA complex and its importance in coordinating interactions necessary for mRNA 3' end processing are highlighted (Liu2024Modulation). Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of CPSF1 is not available in the provided context.

## Function
CPSF1, also known as CPSF160, is a crucial component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA in healthy human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the cleavage of pre-mRNA and the subsequent addition of a poly(A) tail, processes that are vital for mRNA stability, export, and translation (Chen2021Cleavage; Liu2024Modulation). CPSF1 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to ensure proper mRNA maturation, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Chen2021Cleavage).

CPSF1 acts as a scaffold protein within the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) machinery, coordinating interactions among various subunits. It positions CPSF30 and WDR33 for proper recognition of the polyadenylation signal (PAS), although it does not directly interact with the PAS itself (Liu2024Modulation). The protein is involved in recognizing the conserved AAUAAA polyadenylation signal near the polyadenylation site, facilitating the cleavage and addition of a polyadenosine tail to mRNA, a process known as alternative polyadenylation (APA) (Chen2021Cleavage). This process contributes to transcriptome diversity by generating different lengths of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) from a single gene.

## Clinical Significance
CPSF1 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 1) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in mRNA processing. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CPSF1 is overexpressed, leading to increased tumorigenicity and aberrant alternative splicing events, which contribute to cancer progression (Sakai2020Aberrant). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CPSF1 is upregulated and associated with poor patient outcomes. Its high expression levels correlate with increased cell proliferation, migration, and adverse clinicopathological features, making it a potential prognostic marker (Chen2021Cleavage).

In ovarian cancer, CPSF1 expression is significantly elevated, and its knockdown results in reduced cell proliferation, suggesting its role in tumor growth (Zhang2017Targeting). CPSF1 mutations have also been linked to early-onset high myopia (eoHM), where loss-of-function variants are associated with altered retinal ganglion cell axon projection, indicating a role in eye development (Ouyang2019CPSF1).

These findings highlight CPSF1's involvement in various cancers and developmental disorders, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker for disease progression.

## Interactions
CPSF1, also known as CPSF160, is a key component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA 3' end processing. CPSF1 acts as a scaffold protein within the CPSF complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as CPSF100 and WDR33. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the CPSF complex, as CPSF1 helps position CPSF30 and WDR33 for proper recognition of the polyadenylation signal (PAS) (Liu2024Modulation).

CPSF1 also interacts with the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is involved in splicing. CPSF100, a subunit of CPSF, directly interacts with components of the U2 snRNP, such as SF3b, to mediate the coupling of 3' end processing and splicing (Kyburz2006Direct). CPSF1's interaction with the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal is mediated by WDR33 and CPSF30, which directly bind to this sequence (Chan2014CPSF30).

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, CPSF1 is involved in modulating alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, interacting with various proteins including splicing factors and ribonucleoproteins (Chen2021Cleavage). CPSF1 also regulates the alternative splicing of interleukin 7 receptor exon 6 by binding to the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, influencing spliceosome binding (Evsyukova2012Cleavage).
