# ABRACL

## Overview
The ABRACL gene encodes the ABRA C-terminal like protein, which is integral to the regulation of actin dynamics and cell migration. This protein is categorized as an actin-associated protein due to its involvement in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cellular processes such as shape, motility, and adhesion (Hsiao2021Human; de2022Proteomic). ABRACL interacts with cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor, and is localized to regions rich in F-actin, such as lamellipodia, suggesting its role in stabilizing actin filaments (Hsiao2021Human). The gene is expressed in various human tissues and is implicated in embryonic development, particularly in cell proliferation and migration (Troumpoukis2023Characterization). Additionally, ABRACL has clinical significance in oncology, where its expression levels are associated with cancer progression and prognosis, as well as in psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder (Wang2019High; Eugene2018Predicting).

## Structure


## Function
The ABRACL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in modulating actin dynamics and cell migration, which are crucial processes in cellular function and structure. In healthy human cells, ABRACL is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape, motility, and possibly adhesion (Hsiao2021Human; de2022Proteomic). The protein interacts with cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing factor, and is known to colocalize with it at lamellipodia, suggesting a role in promoting the distribution of actin to the F-actin fraction (Hsiao2021Human). 

ABRACL is also expressed in several cell types of adult human tissues and is located on chromosome 6. It is present in the primary cilium, indicating a potential role in cellular signaling or structure (Troumpoukis2023Characterization). During embryogenesis, ABRACL is expressed in the subventricular and mantle zones, as well as in migratory cell populations, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and migration (Troumpoukis2023Characterization). The protein's involvement in actin dynamics and cell motility suggests it plays a role in maintaining cellular structure and function in healthy human cells (Wang2019High).

## Clinical Significance
ABRACL (ABRA C-terminal like) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer, ABRACL is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, with higher expression levels linked to more aggressive cancer phenotypes, advanced tumor stages, and distant metastasis. This upregulation is associated with poorer overall survival rates, suggesting that ABRACL could serve as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer (Wang2019High).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ABRACL is identified as a high-risk factor, with its expression contributing to worse outcomes. It is part of a seven-gene signature used to predict overall survival in TNBC patients (Li2023Identification). Similarly, in bladder cancer, ABRACL is considered a favorable prognostic gene, with its expression levels significantly associated with patient prognosis (Chen2020Evaluating).

ABRACL is also noted in endometrial cancer, where it is identified as a potential biomarker due to its role in actin dynamics and cell motility, which are crucial for cancer progression (Ura2017A). Additionally, in the context of bipolar disorder, ABRACL is part of a gene expression model predicting lithium treatment response in female patients, highlighting its potential role in psychiatric conditions (Del2023Machine; Eugene2018Predicting).

## Interactions
ABRACL (ABRA C-terminal like) is known to interact with the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a key regulator of actin dynamics. This interaction is supported by colocalization studies in cells, particularly at lamellipodia, and confirmed through proximity ligation assays and immunoprecipitation techniques (Hsiao2021Human). ABRACL modulates cofilin's activity by inhibiting cofilin-stimulated actin disassembly, thereby promoting F-actin stability. Despite this functional interaction, ABRACL does not inhibit cofilin's binding to F-actin (Hsiao2021Human).

ABRACL is also associated with the actin cytoskeleton, localizing to the leading edge of migrating cells. It is suggested that ABRACL may localize to F-actin-rich regions through its interaction with cofilin, although it does not robustly bind F-actin in vitro (Hsiao2021Human). The protein's structural features, including a non-typical winged-helix structure with charged surfaces and a hydrophobic groove, suggest potential interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, although specific interactions beyond cofilin are not detailed (Wang2019High).

In cancer cells, ABRACL's interaction with cofilin and its role in actin dynamics are linked to processes such as cell migration and tumorigenic growth (Hsiao2021Human).
