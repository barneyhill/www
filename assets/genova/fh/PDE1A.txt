# PDE1A

## Overview
PDE1A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphodiesterase 1A, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides, specifically cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which are critical second messengers in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner, which is essential for its activation and function (Goraya2005Ca2+calmodulindependent). PDE1A is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle tissues, where it plays a significant role in regulating vascular contraction and cardiac muscle physiology (Samidurai2021Role). The gene is known to produce multiple isoforms through alternative splicing, which allows for diverse regulatory roles in different tissues (Snyder1999Isolation). Alterations in PDE1A expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and kidney disorders, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2017PDE1A; Nagel2006Role).

## Structure
The PDE1A protein is a Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP. It contains conserved catalytic domains and regulatory regions that are crucial for its function. The protein structure includes calmodulin-binding domains, which are essential for its activation by Ca2+/calmodulin. Two specific calmodulin-binding domains, labeled as domain A and domain B, have been identified, with domain B being sufficient for activation (Sonnenburg1995Identification). The amino-terminal sequences of PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 isoforms are divergent, affecting their affinity for calmodulin (Sonnenburg1995Identification).

PDE1A exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including PDE1A1, PDE1A2, and PDE1A3, which differ in their amino and carboxy termini (Snyder1999Isolation). The human PDE1A gene is organized into 17 exons and 16 introns, with nine splice variants sharing exons 4-12 (Michibata2001Human). The protein is a homodimer in its native form, and deletion mutations do not affect its catalytic function or quaternary structure (Sonnenburg1995Identification). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, can decrease the activation potency of Ca2+-bound calmodulin (Sonnenburg1995Identification).

## Function
PDE1A (phosphodiesterase 1A) is a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways by hydrolyzing cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, into their inactive forms. This hydrolysis is crucial for modulating the levels of these second messengers, which are involved in various cellular processes (Goraya2005Ca2+calmodulindependent; Samidurai2021Role).

In healthy human cells, PDE1A is predominantly found in the smooth muscle layer of muscular arteries and is involved in regulating vascular contraction and myocardial processes. It is activated by intracellular calcium concentrations, which are essential for cardiac muscle physiology and metabolism (Samidurai2021Role). The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation events mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, which can alter its sensitivity to calcium (Michibata2001Human).

PDE1A's dual substrate specificity allows it to hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP, facilitating cross-talk between these signaling pathways. This function is vital for maintaining normal cardiac function and metabolism, as well as for other physiological responses in various tissues (Goraya2005Ca2+calmodulindependent; Samidurai2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PDE1A gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of nephrolithiasis, a condition characterized by kidney stones, a specific mutation in PDE1A, rs182089527, has been associated with increased susceptibility. This mutation leads to decreased protein and mRNA expression levels of PDE1A, contributing to elevated creatinine and urea levels in patients (Yang2017PDE1A).

PDE1A is also involved in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Mutations in PDE1A can exacerbate the severity of the disease, particularly when combined with mutations in other genes like PKD2. This interaction affects intracellular calcium and cAMP levels, which are crucial in the progression of ADPKD (Wang2017Generation).

In cardiovascular health, PDE1A plays a role in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and survival. Altered expression of PDE1A is linked to conditions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, where it contributes to neointimal formation and vascular remodeling. Inhibition of PDE1A can reduce VSMC proliferation and increase apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nagel2006Role; Samidurai2021Role).

## Interactions
Phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) is known to interact with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, which is crucial for its activation. PDE1A contains two potential CaM-binding domains, labeled A and B, with domain B being sufficient for activation of the PDE1A isozymes. However, domain A may also contribute, particularly in PDE1A1 (Sonnenburg1995Identification). The interaction with CaM involves structural changes in CaM upon binding with calcium ions, which exposes hydrophobic residues essential for binding and activating PDE1A (Goraya2005Ca2+calmodulindependent).

PDE1A also interacts with YTHDF2, a protein involved in m6A-containing RNA binding, which promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This interaction is implicated in the regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway and influences the fate of SOCS2 mRNA, a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT pathway. The PDE1A-YTHDF2 interaction is critical for NSCLC metastasis and affects chemotherapy resistance by regulating MET and NRF2 expression (Zhang2024Phosphodiesterase).

Inhibitors such as chlorpromazine (CPZ) and malbrancheamide (MBC) can affect the Ca2+-CaM-PDE1A complex, potentially blocking CaM's interaction with PDE1A and leading to non-functional complexes or dissociation (González‐Andrade2013Importance).
