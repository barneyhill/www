# OVCH1

## Overview
The OVCH1 gene encodes the protein ovochymase 1, which is a serine protease involved in various biological processes. Serine proteases are a class of enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins, playing critical roles in digestion, immune response, and blood coagulation. The OVCH1 gene is expressed in specific tissues and is implicated in the regulation of cellular pathways that are essential for maintaining normal physiological functions. Mutations or dysregulation of OVCH1 have been associated with certain pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
