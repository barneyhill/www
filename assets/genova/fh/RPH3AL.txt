# RPH3AL

## Overview
RPH3AL is a gene that encodes the protein rabphilin 3A-like, which is involved in the regulation of exocytosis, particularly in endocrine and exocrine cells. This protein plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, influencing cellular communication and synaptic function (Putcha2015Clinical; Morahan2009A). Rabphilin 3A-like is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein associated with synaptic vesicles, where it is implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process essential for neurotransmission (Craxton2010A). The protein interacts with Rab GTPases, such as RAB3A and RAB27A, facilitating vesicle docking and membrane fusion (Napolioni2021Recent). RPH3AL is also involved in calcium-regulated exocytosis, promoting intracellular Ca2+ increases during secretory processes (Putcha2015Clinical). The gene has clinical significance, with implications in diseases such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Chen2011Detection; Putcha2015Clinical; Napolioni2021Recent).

## Function
The RPH3AL gene encodes a protein involved in the regulation of exocytosis, particularly in endocrine and exocrine cells. It plays a crucial role in the normal regulation of vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, influencing cellular communication and synaptic function (Putcha2015Clinical; Morahan2009A). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with synaptic vesicles, where it is implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a process essential for neurotransmission (Craxton2010A).

RPH3AL is involved in calcium-regulated exocytosis, promoting intracellular increases in Ca2+ during the exocytosis of zymogen granules in pancreatic acinar cells (Putcha2015Clinical). This function is critical for the release of hormones and other secretory processes. The gene's product interacts with the cytoskeleton, facilitating vesicle docking and membrane fusion, which are vital for efficient exocytosis (Chen2011Detection).

In the context of neurogenesis and apoptosis, RPH3AL contains transcriptional binding motifs for homeodomain proteins, suggesting its involvement in these processes (Morahan2009A). The protein's role in calcium signaling is crucial for synaptic function and neurotransmitter release, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology (MartinezArroyo2021Small).

## Clinical Significance
The RPH3AL gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In breast cancer, a significant proportion of cases exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the RPH3AL locus, which is associated with larger tumor size, nodal metastasis, advanced cancer stages, and poor survival outcomes. This LOH is considered a strong prognostic indicator, particularly when combined with LOH at the TP53 locus, although RPH3AL LOH alone may not independently predict cancer-related mortality (Putcha2015Clinical). Missense point mutations in exon-6 of RPH3AL have also been identified in breast cancer, suggesting a role in tumor pathogenesis (Putcha2015Clinical).

In colorectal cancer, autoantibodies against the RPH3AL protein have been proposed as potential biomarkers for early detection. These autoantibodies are significantly more prevalent in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy controls, indicating their potential utility in diagnosis (Chen2011Detection).

The RPH3AL gene is also associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A specific variant, RPH3AL p.A303V, has been linked to an increased risk of LOAD, suggesting a functional role in the disease's pathogenesis (Napolioni2021Recent).

## Interactions
RPH3AL, also known as rabphilin 3A-like, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. It acts as an effector for the Rab GTPases, specifically interacting with RAB3A and RAB27A, which are essential for secretory vesicle exocytosis in endocrine and exocrine cells (Napolioni2021Recent). These interactions facilitate the regulation of vesicle docking and exocytosis processes, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (MartinezArroyo2021Small).

In the context of kidney function, the Rab3A-Rph3A complex is significant for podocyte biology, influencing vesicle docking and cytoskeletal interactions. This complex is crucial for maintaining podocyte homeostasis and has been implicated in renal damage, as demonstrated in Rab3A knockout mouse models (MartinezArroyo2021Small). The interaction between Rph3A and Rab27a, along with the recruitment of Rab3IL1, catalyzes GDP-GTP exchange on Rab3a, which is essential for vesicle docking at target membranes (MartinezArroyo2021Small).

RPH3AL's role extends to its involvement in calcium-regulated exocytosis, where it interacts with the cytoskeleton to regulate hormone exocytosis in endocrine cells (Chen2011Detection). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RPH3AL in cellular processes across different tissues.
