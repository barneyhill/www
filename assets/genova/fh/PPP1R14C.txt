# PPP1R14C

## Overview
PPP1R14C is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14C, a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. This protein is categorized as an inhibitory subunit and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction and cell division, by regulating the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). PPP1R14C is also involved in the regulation of parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) signaling in osteoblast-lineage cells, impacting bone metabolism and remodeling through its interaction with the retromer complex component VPS35 (Xiong2016Retromer). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its role as a potent inhibitor of PP1 (Casamayor2020Controlling).

## Structure
The PPP1R14C protein, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14C, is part of a family of small inhibitory subunits that regulate the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). A key feature of this protein family is the presence of a central PP1 inhibitory domain, known as the PHIN domain, which includes a phosphorylatable threonine residue near the N-terminus. This phosphorylation is crucial for converting the protein into a potent inhibitor of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R14C also contains diverse myristylation motifs at the N-terminus, which may play a role in its cellular localization and function (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein is activated as an inhibitor upon phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and is inactivated by protein kinase A (PKA), highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in its regulatory function (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of PPP1R14C are not provided, its role as an inhibitory subunit interacting with other proteins, such as VPS35 in osteoblasts, suggests a complex involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Xiong2016Retromer).

## Function
PPP1R14C, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14C, plays a significant role in modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a critical enzyme involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP1R14C acts as an inhibitory subunit of PP1, influencing the regulation of parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) signaling in osteoblast-lineage cells. This regulation is crucial for the proper trafficking and signaling of PTH1R, which impacts bone metabolism and remodeling (Xiong2016Retromer).

PPP1R14C interacts with VPS35, a component of the retromer complex, to modulate PTH1R signaling by promoting its translocation to the Golgi apparatus, thereby preventing receptor degradation and terminating signaling. This interaction is essential for the retrieval of GPCR-family receptors and the suppression of their signaling, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Xiong2016Retromer).

Additionally, PPP1R14C is involved in the regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) activity, particularly in a PKC-dependent manner, which is important for muscle contraction and other cellular processes. This suggests that PPP1R14C plays a role in cellular homeostasis by modulating MLCP activity (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Interactions
PPP1R14C, also known as KEPI, is a regulatory protein that interacts with various components to modulate cellular signaling pathways. It is an inhibitory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular functions. PPP1R14C binds to PP1, affecting its activity and thereby influencing processes such as muscle contraction and cell division (Casamayor2020Controlling).

In osteoblast-lineage cells, PPP1R14C interacts with the retromer complex component VPS35 and the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R). This interaction is crucial for regulating PTH1R signaling and trafficking. PPP1R14C forms a complex with PTH1R, and this interaction is enhanced by parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulation. VPS35 negatively regulates the interaction between PTH1R and PPP1R14C, and its depletion results in increased association of PPP1R14C with PTH1R, enhancing PTH-driven signaling (Xiong2016Retromer).

PPP1R14C is also involved in the activation of non-canonical PTH1R signaling pathways. It enhances PTH-driven phosphorylation of CREB and Erk1/2, indicating its role as a positive regulator of PTH signaling. However, it does not significantly affect the canonical cAMP pathway (Xiong2016Retromer).
