# SPON1

## Overview
The SPON1 gene encodes the protein spondin 1, an extracellular matrix protein that plays a crucial role in neural development and cell adhesion. Spondin 1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an N-terminal domain similar to reelin, a spondin domain, and multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats, facilitating its interaction with the extracellular matrix and membrane receptors (Akle2012FSpondinspon1b). Functionally, spondin 1 is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, as well as modulating the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Ho2004Binding; Schubert2005F‐spondin). Beyond its neural functions, SPON1 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in ovarian cancer, where it serves as a prognostic marker and is involved in oncogenic fusion events (Nagasawa2022Identification; Miyakawa2023SPON1). The gene's involvement in both neurodevelopmental and oncogenic processes underscores its importance in human health and disease.

## Structure
The SPON1 gene encodes the protein spondin 1, which is an extracellular matrix protein involved in cell adhesion and neural development. The primary structure of spondin 1 consists of approximately 800 amino acids (Akle2012FSpondinspon1b). The protein features several distinct domains, including an N-terminal domain homologous to the amino terminus of reelin, a spondin domain, and six C-terminal thrombospondin type 1 repeats (Akle2012FSpondinspon1b). These domains are crucial for its ability to bind to the extracellular matrix or membrane receptors, influencing various cellular processes.

The secondary structure of spondin 1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with thrombospondin repeats, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure would involve the overall 3D conformation of these domains, facilitating interactions with other proteins and matrix components. The quaternary structure is not detailed in the provided context.

Post-translational modifications of spondin 1 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common in extracellular matrix proteins, although specific modifications are not mentioned in the context. The protein's structure allows it to play a role in neural cell adhesion and outgrowth, as well as in the modulation of amyloid precursor protein cleavage, relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Park2020SPON1; Jahanshad2013Genomewide).

## Function
The SPON1 gene encodes the protein F-spondin, which plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. F-spondin is involved in promoting neurite outgrowth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons, influencing cell adhesion and axonal guidance (Schubert2005F‐spondin). It acts as an extracellular matrix protein, facilitating cell-substratum adhesion and promoting nerve precursor differentiation by increasing the expression of neuronal markers such as MAP2ab and β-tubulin III (Schubert2005F‐spondin).

F-spondin also interacts with the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), modulating its cleavage and potentially influencing APP's role in cell adhesion and signaling (Ho2004Binding). This interaction is significant because APP is associated with cholesterol, a major component of myelin in white matter fibers, linking F-spondin to neural connectivity and myelin integrity (Jahanshad2013Genomewide).

In addition to its role in neural development, F-spondin is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms by influencing the migration of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms (Carrillo2018Fspondin). These functions highlight F-spondin's importance in both cellular and organismal processes related to the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
The SPON1 gene, encoding the protein spondin-1, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In ovarian cancer, high SPON1 expression is identified as an independent poor prognostic marker. It is associated with advanced disease stages, peritoneal dissemination, and recurrence, leading to significantly lower 5-year recurrence-free survival rates compared to patients with low SPON1 expression (Miyakawa2023SPON1). The SPON1 gene is also involved in the formation of a novel oncogenic fusion gene, SPON1-TRIM29, in ovarian cancer. This fusion gene promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance, suggesting its role in cancer progression and therapy resistance (Nagasawa2022Identification).

In neurodegenerative diseases, a variant in the SPON1 gene has been associated with brain connectivity and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. This variant influences brain structure, particularly in regions affected early in Alzheimer's, and is linked to milder clinical dementia scores (Jahanshad2013Genomewide). These findings highlight SPON1's potential role in both cancer and neurodegenerative conditions, indicating its significance in disease pathogenesis and progression.

## Interactions
SPON1, also known as spondin 1, is an extracellular matrix protein that participates in various protein interactions, influencing neural development and disease processes. SPON1 interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its reelin and spondin domains, but not the thrombospondin domain, affecting APP processing and potentially modulating amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (Hoe2005FSpondin; Ho2004Binding). This interaction is confirmed in both COS7 cells and primary neuronal cultures (Hoe2005FSpondin).

SPON1 also interacts with the apolipoprotein E receptor ApoEr2, enhancing the coimmunoprecipitation of APP and ApoEr2, which suggests a role in facilitating their interaction and processing. This interaction is mediated through the thrombospondin domain of SPON1 and the ligand binding domain of ApoEr2 (Hoe2005FSpondin). The presence of receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist of the LDL receptor family, inhibits SPON1's effect on ApoEr2 processing, indicating a direct interaction (Hoe2005FSpondin).

In the context of cancer, SPON1 is involved in protein-protein interaction networks, including integrin binding, heparin binding, and metalloendopeptidase activity, which may play roles in cancer progression (Miyakawa2023SPON1).
