# UHRF1

## Overview
UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING Finger Domains 1) is a gene that encodes a multi-domain protein involved in the regulation of epigenetic processes. The protein, also referred to as UHRF1, plays a pivotal role in maintaining DNA methylation patterns during cell division, particularly by recruiting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to hemimethylated DNA sites. This function is crucial for the propagation of epigenetic information across cell generations. Structurally, UHRF1 contains several domains, including a ubiquitin-like domain, tandem Tudor domain, plant homeodomain, SET and RING-associated domain, and a RING finger domain, which collectively facilitate its interactions with DNA and histones, as well as its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Gao2018An; Song2023Mechanistic). UHRF1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, and its dysregulation is associated with the development and progression of multiple cancers, making it a significant focus of research in cancer biology (Choudhry2017Targeting; Polepalli2019Role).

## Structure
UHRF1 is a multi-domain protein involved in epigenetic regulation, featuring several key structural domains. It includes an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, a tandem Tudor domain (TTD), a plant homeodomain (PHD), a SET and RING-associated (SRA) domain, and a C-terminal RING finger domain (Gao2018An; Song2023Mechanistic). The TTD and PHD domains are crucial for recognizing specific histone modifications, such as trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and unmodified arginine 2, which are important for UHRF1's role in epigenetic regulation (Gao2018An; Cheng2013Structural).

The TTD domain of UHRF1 is composed of two subdomains, TTDn and TTDc, which recognize dimethylated and trimethylated lysine residues (Song2023Mechanistic). The PHD domain interacts with the N terminus of histone H3, and its interaction is inhibited by methylation of H3R2 (Cheng2013Structural). The SRA domain binds to hemimethylated CpG DNA, facilitating UHRF1's association with replicating heterochromatin during the S phase of the cell cycle (Gao2018An). The RING finger domain acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediating histone ubiquitylation and recruiting DNMT1 to replication foci (Gao2018An).

UHRF1 undergoes conformational changes from a closed to an open state, influenced by interactions with hemimethylated DNA and other factors, which enhance its chromatin binding and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities (Gao2018An; Song2023Mechanistic). These structural transitions are linked to cell cycle-dependent chromatin localization and ubiquitylation activity (Gao2018An).

## Function
UHRF1, also known as ICBP90 in humans, is a crucial protein for maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells. It plays a significant role in the propagation of DNA methylation patterns during cell division, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. UHRF1 interacts with the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, facilitating its association with chromatin. This interaction is essential for the stable maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, as UHRF1 recruits DNMT1 to hemimethylated CG sites, which are the physiological substrates for DNMT1 (Bostick2007UHRF1).

The protein contains a methyl DNA binding domain known as the SRA domain, which preferentially binds to hemimethylated CG dinucleotides, ensuring that methylation patterns are faithfully copied to daughter strands during DNA replication. This binding specificity is unique to UHRF1 and is not observed in other SRA domain-containing proteins (Bostick2007UHRF1).

In the absence of UHRF1, there is a significant global loss of DNA methylation, leading to improper differentiation and embryonic lethality, although cells remain proliferative as embryonic stem cells (Bostick2007UHRF1). UHRF1 is active in the nucleus and is involved in cell cycle regulation and gene expression, highlighting its critical function in DNA methylation processes in healthy human cells (Bostick2007UHRF1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the UHRF1 gene are significantly associated with various malignancies. Overexpression of UHRF1 is linked to the progression and poor prognosis of several cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, and others. In these cancers, high UHRF1 levels correlate with advanced stages, larger tumor sizes, metastasis, and reduced survival rates (Polepalli2019Role). UHRF1 overexpression is also implicated in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) through DNA methylation, contributing to cancer cell proliferation and migration. This is observed in breast cancer, where UHRF1 regulates BRCA1 transcription and silences KLF17, and in bladder cancer, where it silences KISS1 (Polepalli2019Role).

In hepatoblastoma, UHRF1 forms a repression complex with DNMT1 and USP7, leading to the silencing of TSGs such as HHIP, IGFBP3, and SFRP1. Knockdown of UHRF1 results in the reactivation of these genes, indicating its role in maintaining epigenetic silencing (Beck2018Overexpression). UHRF1's overexpression is also linked to the hypermethylation of TSG promoters in lung cancer, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Choudhry2017Targeting). These findings highlight UHRF1 as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
UHRF1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in epigenetic regulation. It is known to recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to DNA replication forks, which is essential for maintaining DNA methylation during replication (Zhang2011S). UHRF1 also interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 7 (USP7), forming a multicomponent complex that regulates DNA replication and chromatin remodeling (Cheng2013Structural).

The protein contains a tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and a plant homeodomain (PHD), which are involved in recognizing specific histone modifications. The TTD specifically recognizes trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), while the PHD recognizes the N terminus of unmodified histone H3 (Cheng2013Structural). UHRF1 also interacts with the MYST domain of TIP60, a histone acetyltransferase, which affects the stability and function of both UHRF1 and DNMT1 (Ashraf2017Interaction).

In cancer cells, UHRF1 is involved in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by interacting with proteins like EZH2 and Suv39H1, which are involved in histone modifications (Babbio2012The). These interactions highlight UHRF1's role in coordinating DNA methylation and histone modification processes.
