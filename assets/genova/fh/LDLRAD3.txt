# LDLRAD3

## Overview
LDLRAD3 is a gene that encodes the protein low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 3, which is a member of the LDL-receptor family. This protein is characterized by its low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LA) domain, which plays a crucial role in mediating interactions with various viral proteins, including those of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu2021Genomewide; Basore2021Structure). The protein's ability to bind to viral components highlights its significance in viral entry into host cells, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, LDLRAD3 is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, where it influences oncogenic signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment dynamics (Yao2019Downregulation; Su2023A). The multifaceted roles of LDLRAD3 in both viral infections and cancer underscore its importance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

## Structure
The LDLRAD3 protein is characterized by a low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LA) domain, which is approximately 40 amino acids in length. This domain contains six disulfide-bound cysteine residues and a cluster of conserved acidic residues that coordinate calcium ions, contributing to its structural stability and function (Basore2021Structure). The LA domain architecture is highly conserved, with numerous structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), indicating a well-established structural framework (Basore2021Structure).

LDLRAD3 interacts specifically with the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) at the E2-E1 heterodimer interface, with the D1 domain being crucial for this interaction. The D2 domain does not contribute to VEEV binding, as evidenced by weak electron density in structural analyses (Basore2021Structure). The interaction involves specific residues in the D1 domain, which are essential for viral binding and infection (Basore2021Structure).

The protein is part of the LDL-receptor family, which is known for mediating the entry of various viruses. The structural analysis of LDLRAD3 has been conducted using cryo-electron microscopy, providing near-atomic-resolution reconstructions of its interaction with VEEV (Basore2021Structure).

## Clinical Significance
LDLRAD3 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. In NSCLC, high expression of LDLRAD3 is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic factor. It is linked to oncogenic signaling pathways, such as MYC targets and MTORC1 signaling, and is negatively correlated with immune responses, suggesting an immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment (Su2023A). Overexpression of LDLRAD3 in NSCLC cell lines promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its involvement in cancer progression (Su2023A).

In pancreatic cancer, circ-LDLRAD3, a circular RNA derived from LDLRAD3, acts as an oncogene by sponging miR-137-3p, which regulates the expression of pleiotrophin (PTN). This interaction contributes to cancer progression, and knockdown of circ-LDLRAD3 has been shown to suppress tumor growth and invasion (Yao2019Downregulation).

LDLRAD3 also plays a role in viral infections, serving as a receptor necessary for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) infectivity. Mutations in the D1 domain of LDLRAD3 can impact the virus-receptor interaction, affecting susceptibility to VEEV infection (Basore2021Structure).

## Interactions
LDLRAD3 is involved in interactions with several viral proteins, playing a role in viral entry into host cells. It interacts with the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) structural proteins, specifically binding to the E2-E1 heterodimers. The interaction occurs at two distinct interfaces: the 'wrapped' and 'intraspike' heterodimer interfaces, with specific residues of LDLRAD3 contributing to these interactions (Basore2021Structure). Mutations in certain residues of LDLRAD3, such as G33D, M36T, P44R, and D57V, disrupt its ability to support VEEV infection, highlighting their importance in binding (Basore2021Structure).

LDLRAD3 also interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, specifically binding to its N-terminal domain (NTD). This interaction facilitates viral entry into host cells, even in the absence of the ACE2 receptor, which is the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The binding of LDLRAD3 to the spike protein has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays (Zhu2021Genomewide; Zhu2021Genomewidea). The interaction between LDLRAD3 and the spike protein is significant enough to trigger membrane fusion, indicating its functional role in the viral entry process (Zhu2021Genomewidea).
