# CACNA1S

## Overview
The CACNA1S gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S, a critical component of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, specifically the CaV1.1 channel, which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. This protein functions as a transmembrane channel that plays a pivotal role in excitation-contraction coupling, a process essential for translating electrical signals into muscle contractions. The CaV1.1 channel is composed of four homologous domains, each containing six transmembrane segments, and operates as a heteromultimer with auxiliary subunits that modulate its function. The alpha1 S subunit serves as the primary voltage sensor and ion conduction pathway, facilitating the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is crucial for muscle contraction. Mutations in the CACNA1S gene have been implicated in various muscle disorders, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis and malignant hyperthermia, underscoring its clinical significance (Beam2017Pharmacogenetics; Bannister2013CaV1.1:; Sangkuhl2020PharmGKB).

## Structure
The CACNA1S gene encodes the CaV1.1 protein, a voltage-gated calcium channel primarily expressed in skeletal muscle. The protein is a single polypeptide composed of four homologous repeats (I-IV), each containing six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (Tuluc2011Divergent; Bannister2013CaV1.1:). The S1-S4 segments form the voltage-sensing domain, with the S4 segment containing positively charged amino acids crucial for voltage sensing (Tuluc2016Molecular). The S5 and S6 segments flank the pore-forming P-loop, which is essential for the channel's gating machinery (Tuluc2011Divergent).

CaV1.1 assembles as a heteromultimer with auxiliary subunits, including α2δ-1, β1a, and γ1, which modulate its function (Bannister2013CaV1.1:). The β1a subunit is critical for channel trafficking to the plasma membrane, while the α2δ-1 subunit affects activation kinetics (Bannister2013CaV1.1:). The channel's selectivity for Ca2+ is due to a tetra-acidic structure in the pore, with E-E-E-E residues providing binding sites for divalent cations (Bannister2013CaV1.1:).

Splice variants of CaV1.1, such as CaV1.1a and CaV1.1e, exhibit different biophysical properties. The CaV1.1e variant, which lacks exon 29, shows increased voltage sensitivity and current amplitude compared to CaV1.1a (Tuluc2016Molecular; Tuluc2011Divergent). This structural variation affects the IVS3-S4 linker, influencing the channel's gating properties (Tuluc2016Molecular).

## Function
The CACNA1S gene encodes the alpha-1S subunit of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, also known as the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), which is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells. This subunit is integral to the function of the CaV1.1 channel, playing a crucial role in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), a process that translates electrical signals into muscle contractions. The alpha-1S subunit contains the ion conduction pore, voltage sensor, and gating apparatus, and is organized into four homologous domains, each with six transmembrane segments (LaugelHaushalter2018Genetic; Sangkuhl2020PharmGKB).

In healthy human cells, the CACNA1S protein acts as a voltage sensor that triggers the opening of ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) channels, facilitating the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the myoplasm. This calcium release is essential for muscle contraction (LaugelHaushalter2018Genetic; Sangkuhl2020PharmGKB). The alpha-1S subunit also participates in both orthograde and retrograde signaling, which are vital for the proper functioning of the ECC apparatus (Sangkuhl2020PharmGKB). The gene's role in regulating calcium ion flow is critical for maintaining normal muscle function and preventing excessive calcium release, which could lead to muscle disorders (Sangkuhl2020PharmGKB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNA1S gene are associated with several muscle-related diseases. One of the primary conditions linked to CACNA1S mutations is hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoKPP), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by episodes of muscle weakness and low serum potassium levels. Specific mutations such as R528H, R1239H, and R1239G are known to cause HypoKPP, with these mutations often occurring at arginine residues in the voltage-sensing domain of the calcium channel (Wang2005Novel; Nuzhnyi2023Case; Li2011A).

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is another condition associated with CACNA1S mutations. MH is a life-threatening reaction to certain anesthetics, characterized by a hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle. Mutations such as p.Arg1086His and p.Arg174Trp have been identified as risk factors for MH, although only about 1% of MH cases are attributed to CACNA1S mutations (Beam2017Pharmacogenetics).

CACNA1S mutations are also linked to congenital myopathies and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, although the mechanisms are less well understood. These mutations can lead to altered calcium ion flow, affecting muscle contraction and leading to various clinical manifestations (Szymanowicz2024A; Bidaud2006Voltage-gated).

## Interactions
The CACNA1S gene encodes the CaV1.1 protein, which is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle function. CaV1.1 interacts with the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) to facilitate excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, a process essential for muscle contraction. This interaction can be direct or mediated by accessory proteins such as STAC3, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing CaV1.1 and facilitating its interaction with RyR1 (Flucher2020Skeletal; Flucher2019STAC).

STAC3 interacts with CaV1.1 at the C-terminus and the II-III loop, acting as a chaperone and modulator in the EC coupling mechanism. The SH3-1 domain of STAC3 binds to the II-III loop of CaV1.1, which is critical for this interaction (Flucher2019STAC). Additionally, STAC3 can inhibit calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) in L-type calcium channels by interacting with the C-terminal CaM binding motif (Flucher2019STAC).

Calmodulin (CaM) also interacts with CaV1.1, binding to its C-terminal region. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of calcium ions and is crucial for the trafficking and functional expression of CaV1.1. CaM and STAC3 independently enhance CaV1.1's surface-membrane trafficking and open probability, with their coexpression resulting in a significant increase in surface-membrane expression (Niu2018Duplex).
