# CHP2

## Overview
CHP2 is a gene that encodes the calcineurin-like EF-hand protein 2, a member of the calcineurin homologous protein subfamily. This protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for calcium binding, and it plays a significant role in cellular ion transport and pH regulation. As a calcium-binding protein, CHP2 is involved in the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), enhancing its activity and thereby influencing intracellular pH and cell proliferation. The protein's structure includes two globular domains connected by a unique flexible linker, known as the CHP-loop, which is not present in other calcium-binding proteins. CHP2 is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the intestines and is also found in the kidney and stomach, albeit at lower levels. Its high expression in cancer cells and involvement in the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway suggest a potential role in oncogenesis, making it a protein of interest in cancer research (Di2012Calcineurin; Ammar2006Crystal; Li2008CHP2).

## Structure
The human gene CHP2 encodes the calcineurin-like EF-hand protein 2, which is characterized by its EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium binding. The molecular structure of CHP2 consists of two globular domains, the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes, each containing two EF-hand motifs. These lobes are connected by a unique flexible linker region known as the CHP-loop, which is not found in other Ca2+-binding proteins (Ammar2006Crystal; Liang2020Calcium). The structure of CHP2 includes 12 α-helices and four short β-strands, forming a hydrophobic cleft that interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) (Ammar2006Crystal).

CHP2 binds two Y3+ ions at the EF3 and EF4 sites in the C-lobe, which are crucial for its high-affinity interaction with NHE1 (Ammar2006Crystal). The protein is myristoylated, a post-translational modification that may influence its membrane association, although its exact physiological role remains unclear (Ammar2006Crystal). CHP2 is highly expressed in cancer cells and differs from its homolog CHP1 in its expression pattern and specific structural features (Liang2020Calcium; Ben2005Crystallization).

## Function
CHP2, a member of the calcineurin homologous protein subfamily, is primarily involved in regulating the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) by binding to its juxtamembrane region. This interaction enhances NHE1 activity by increasing both the maximal exchanger activity (Vmax) and the H+ affinity, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular pH. This regulation is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly under conditions of serum deprivation, where CHP2 helps protect cells from death (Di2012Calcineurin; Inoue2003Calcineurin).

CHP2 is expressed predominantly in the small and large intestines, where it is localized in the epithelial cell layer of the villi, suggesting a role in the absorptive epithelium. It is also expressed in the kidney and stomach, albeit at lower levels (Di2012Calcineurin; Inoue2003Calcineurin). CHP2's high Ca2+ binding affinity (Kd = 1 nM) indicates its function as a Ca2+ sensor, responding to changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Di2012Calcineurin).

CHP2 may also play a role in the regulation of the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway, enhancing calcineurin activity and inducing NFAT activation, which contrasts with the negative regulation by CHP1 (Di2012Calcineurin).

## Clinical Significance
CHP2 (calcineurin like EF-hand protein 2) is implicated in cancer progression due to its role in enhancing cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Overexpression of CHP2 has been linked to increased proliferation and tumorigenic capacity in cell lines such as HEK293, suggesting its involvement in oncogenic processes (Li2008CHP2). CHP2 is highly expressed in malignant tissues, including hepatocellular carcinoma, and its expression is low in normal tissues, indicating a potential role in cancer (Li2008CHP2). The protein enhances the activity of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway, which is associated with tumor development and progression (Di2012Calcineurin; Li2008CHP2).

CHP2 also interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), enhancing its activity and increasing intracellular pH, which is linked to cell proliferation and survival, particularly in cancer cells (Di2012Calcineurin; Ammar2006Crystal). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the active conformation of NHE1, which is important for cellular ionic homeostasis and response to extracellular stimuli (Ammar2006Crystal). The dysregulation of CHP2 and its interactions may contribute to aggressive cancer behavior, including organ invasion (Di2012Calcineurin).

## Interactions
CHP2 (calcineurin like EF-hand protein 2) is known for its interaction with the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1), where it plays a crucial role in regulating ion transport and pH balance. CHP2 binds to the juxtamembrane regions of NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3, with a stronger affinity for NHE1 compared to CHP1, suggesting a competitive interaction for the common binding site (Pang2002Expression). The interaction between CHP2 and NHE1 is characterized by strong hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond formation, ensuring a high degree of specificity. The cytoplasmic alpha-helix of NHE1 is inserted into the hydrophobic cleft formed by the N- and C-lobes of CHP2 (Ammar2006Crystal).

Mutations in the CHP-binding domain of NHE1, specifically in the region from amino acids 516-540, significantly reduce the affinity for interaction with CHP2. This highlights the importance of hydrophobic and polar interactions in the strong and specific association between NHE1 and CHP2 (Ammar2006Crystal). CHP2's interaction with NHE1 is also modulated by calcium ions (Ca2+), which induce conformational changes in CHP2, affecting its binding affinity. Ca2+ binding increases the affinity of CHP2 for NHE1, suggesting an isoform-specific regulatory interaction (Liang2020Calcium).
