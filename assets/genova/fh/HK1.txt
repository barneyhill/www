# HK1

## Overview
Hexokinase 1 (HK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme hexokinase 1, a pivotal player in cellular glucose metabolism. As a member of the kinase family, hexokinase 1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the initial step in the glycolytic pathway, thereby facilitating glucose uptake and utilization within cells (Sun2008Glucose; Wilson2003Isozymes). The HK1 gene is expressed in various tissues, with its protein product predominantly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) to integrate glycolysis with mitochondrial energy production (Wilson2003Isozymes). Beyond its metabolic role, HK1 is involved in cellular stress responses, protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Sun2008Glucose; Pilic2023Hexokinase). Mutations in the HK1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4G and retinitis pigmentosa, underscoring its significance in both metabolic and neurological health (Goleyjani2023Expanding; Sullivan2014A).

## Structure
The human HK1 gene encodes the hexokinase 1 protein, which plays a crucial role in glycolysis by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. The primary structure of HK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with the HK1-I isoform being 917 amino acids long (Sullivan2014A). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of hexokinases, although specific details are not provided in the context.

HK1's tertiary structure is important for its enzymatic activity, with the protein having distinct regulatory and catalytic domains. The ATP- and glucose-binding domains are located in the carboxy-terminal (catalytic) half, while similar domains are present in the amino (regulatory) half (Griffin1991Mammalian). The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, although specific details are not mentioned.

HK1 contains specific domains, such as the porin-binding domain (PBD) in the HK1-I isoform, which localizes it to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Sullivan2014A). Post-translational modifications include myristoylation and palmitoylation in the sperm-specific isoform HK1S, which are crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane (Kumar2015Novel). HK1 has several splice variant isoforms, differing in their N-terminal regions and subcellular localization (Sullivan2014A).

## Function
Hexokinase 1 (HK1) is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis. This reaction is crucial for maintaining the concentration gradient necessary for glucose transport into cells, thereby playing a significant role in cellular energy production (Sun2008Glucose; Wilson2003Isozymes). HK1 is predominantly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). This localization allows HK1 to efficiently utilize ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation for glucose phosphorylation, linking glycolysis with mitochondrial energy production (Wilson2003Isozymes).

HK1 also plays a protective role in cellular stress responses. It can bind to mitochondria, potentially inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition and reducing reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Sun2008Glucose). During energy stress, HK1 forms ring-like structures around mitochondria, preventing mitochondrial fission by displacing the protein Drp1. This action helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and rewires cellular metabolism, promoting lactate production and increased TCA cycle activity (Pilic2023Hexokinase). These functions highlight HK1's critical role in both energy metabolism and cellular protection mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HK1 gene are associated with several diseases, primarily affecting the nervous system and the retina. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4G (CMT4G) is linked to mutations in the HK1 gene, characterized by progressive distal muscle weakness, sensory impairment, and demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy. This condition was initially reported in European Roma communities and has been identified in other populations, including a case in Iran, suggesting a broader geographical distribution (Goleyjani2023Expanding).

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a form of retinal degeneration, is also associated with dominant mutations in the HK1 gene, such as the p.Glu847Lys mutation. This mutation affects the retina specifically, despite not impacting the enzymatic function of HK1 or glucose metabolism (Sullivan2014A). Another variant, p.E851K, has been linked to autosomal dominant RP and other forms of retinal dystrophy, demonstrating phenotypic variability (Yuan2017The).

In pancreatic beta-cells, non-coding regulatory mutations in HK1 can lead to congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) by causing inappropriate expression of the gene, disrupting normal insulin secretion (Wakeling2021A). These mutations highlight the importance of regulatory elements in maintaining proper gene expression and function.

## Interactions
Hexokinase 1 (HK1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes beyond its enzymatic function in glycolysis. One of the key interactions is with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting apoptosis, as it helps regulate the formation of pro-apoptotic channels in the mitochondrial membrane (Schindler2013Hexokinase; Sullivan2014A). HK1 interacts with VDAC1 through its hydrophobic N-terminal domain, and mutations affecting this interaction can lead to increased apoptosis (Sullivan2014A).

HK1 also interacts with the neuronal EF-hand protein DREAM in a calcium-dependent manner, which appears to regulate apoptosis (Sullivan2014A). In the retina, HK1 forms substantial interactions with RanBP2 and Cox11. Cox11 binds to HK1 at a site distinct from the active site, inhibiting its catalytic activity, while RanBP2 modulates this interaction and may act as a chaperone for HK1 (Sullivan2014A).

Additionally, HK1 interacts with KRAS4A, a splice variant of the KRAS oncogene, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is unique to KRAS4A and affects HK1's activity, suggesting a role in metabolic regulation (Amendola2019KRAS4A).
