# FAM9C

## Overview
FAM9C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 9, specifically member C. This gene is part of the cancer/testis (CT) gene family, which is known for its restricted expression pattern, primarily in germ cells and various cancer types. The protein encoded by FAM9C is involved in critical cellular processes, including meiosis and chromatin organization, and is homologous to the meiosis gene SYCP3, indicating its potential role in germ cell development and differentiation (Stouffs2009Male). FAM9C is expressed in the nucleus, aligning with its functions related to meiosis and chromatin dynamics. Its expression is notably observed in the mature meiotic oogonia stage in 46,XX ovaries, suggesting a role in meiotic cytoskeleton functions (McGlackenByrne2023Singlenucleus). Additionally, FAM9C has been implicated in various cancers, where it may act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context, highlighting its complex role in tumorigenesis and reproductive health (Liao2024Construction; Nagirnaja2022Diverse).

## Function
FAM9C is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to meiosis and chromatin organization. It is homologous to the meiosis gene SYCP3 and is located in the nucleus, which is typical for genes involved in meiosis (Stouffs2009Male). FAM9C is part of the cancer/testis (CT) gene family, which is presumed to play roles in germ cell development, differentiation, and survival (Stouffs2009Male). 

In the context of ovarian development, FAM9C has been noted for its anti-apoptotic role in the testis and its potential involvement in meiotic processes, possibly related to cytoskeleton organization during meiosis (McGlackenByrne2023Singlenucleus). The gene is expressed in the mature meiotic oogonia stage in 46,XX ovaries, suggesting a role in meiotic cytoskeleton functions (McGlackenByrne2023Singlenucleus). 

FAM9C is also associated with specific components in testicular tissues, showing high specificity towards gene ontology categories related to meiosis, indicating its involvement in germ cell development (Nagirnaja2022Diverse). Despite these associations, the specific functions of FAM9C in healthy human cells remain not fully defined (Stouffs2009Male).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM9C gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in tumorigenesis and reproductive health. In breast cancer, FAM9C is identified as one of the metastasis-related genes associated with overall survival, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression (Liao2024Construction). Overexpression of FAM9C in liver cancer has been reported to promote tumor cell proliferation, immune evasion, invasion, and metastasis, indicating its oncogenic potential in certain cancer types (Liao2024Construction). Conversely, in cervical cancer, FAM9C may function as a tumor suppressor gene, where its expression is reduced or silenced due to abnormal promoter methylation, particularly in the context of HPV infection (Liao2024Construction).

In reproductive health, FAM9C is involved in the genetic basis of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe form of male infertility. It is part of a group of genes with distinct expression patterns in testicular cells, suggesting its role in spermatogenesis and potential contribution to NOA when mutated or dysregulated (Nagirnaja2022Diverse). Additionally, FAM9C is noted for its anti-apoptotic role in the testis and its involvement in meiotic processes, which may be relevant to ovarian development and insufficiency in Turner Syndrome (McGlackenByrne2023Singlenucleus).
