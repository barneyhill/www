# FAM220A

## Overview
FAM220A is a gene that encodes the protein known as family with sequence similarity 220 member A. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in the positive regulation of protein binding activity, which facilitates interactions between proteins. The FAM220A protein is typically localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it may influence gene expression and cellular responses, although its precise molecular functions are still under investigation (Mao2023Comparative). The gene exhibits differential expression across tissues in humans compared to macaques, suggesting its involvement in RNA regulation, protein synthesis, and metabolism, with potential implications for species-specific gene regulation and function (Mao2023Comparative). FAM220A has been associated with several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in various pathological contexts (Zou2023Advances; Frenkel2019Genomewide; Zhang2021Functional).

## Structure


## Function
The FAM220A gene, also known as family with sequence similarity 220 member A, is involved in the positive regulation of protein binding activity, suggesting its role in facilitating interactions between proteins and potentially influencing various cellular processes (Mao2023Comparative). This gene is differentially expressed across multiple tissues in humans compared to macaques, indicating its upregulation in humans and potential involvement in RNA regulation, protein synthesis, and metabolism (Mao2023Comparative). Structural variations between humans and macaques, such as additional segmental duplications in humans, suggest differences in gene regulation and function between the species (Mao2023Comparative).

While the specific molecular activities and cellular locations of the FAM220A protein in healthy human cells are not detailed in the provided context, it is implied that the protein may play a role in cellular signaling pathways and could be involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. The protein is typically localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular responses (Mao2023Comparative). However, the precise molecular functions and organismal outcomes of FAM220A remain under investigation.

## Clinical Significance
FAM220A has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its involvement in genetic variations and interactions. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a deletion at the 7p22.1 cytoband, which includes the FAM220A gene, was identified in four IBD samples but not in control samples. This deletion suggests a potential role for FAM220A in the pathogenesis of IBD, possibly due to its involvement in the regulation of the STAT-signaling pathway, which is crucial for immune response and inflammation (Frenkel2019Genomewide).

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, FAM220A is part of a novel miR-92a-3p/FAM220A/STAT3 pathway that may influence atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) models. This pathway suggests that FAM220A regulation could impact the pro-atherosclerotic activity of STAT3, a proinflammatory transcription factor, indicating its potential role in cardiovascular complications associated with CKD (Zou2023Advances).

FAM220A has also been associated with lung cancer, where a decrease in its levels was noted to benefit patients, suggesting its potential role in lung cancer treatment. This highlights the importance of understanding subtype-specific gene interactions for effective therapies (Zhang2021Functional). Additionally, FAM220A is identified as a shared genetic locus between gallstone disease and coronary artery disease, indicating its involvement in shared biological mechanisms such as cholesterol metabolism and protein signaling (Zhang2023Impact).
