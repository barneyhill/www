# PTTG1

## Overview
PTTG1, or pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1, is a gene that encodes the protein known as securin, which plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability. Securin is an intrinsically disordered oncoprotein that functions primarily as an inhibitor of separase, an enzyme crucial for sister chromatid separation during mitosis. By preventing premature chromatid separation, securin ensures proper cell division and maintains chromosomal integrity. The protein is characterized by its lack of stable tertiary structure and contains proline-rich motifs that are essential for its oncogenic activity. Securin is also involved in transcriptional activation, influencing the expression of oncogenes and factors related to tumor angiogenesis. Overexpression and genetic alterations of PTTG1 have been implicated in various cancers, making it a significant focus of research for its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target (Wang2024MultiOmics; Hamid2005EctopicexpressionofPTTG1securinpromotestumorigenesisinhumanembryonickidneycells; Mo2009Antitumor).

## Structure
The PTTG1 protein, also known as securin, is an intrinsically disordered oncoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa. It lacks a stable tertiary structure and contains minimal secondary structure, which is characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (Prabu2020Unravelling). PTTG1 is involved in the regulation of sister chromatid separation during cell division, acting as an inhibitor of Separase. It is degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex at the end of metaphase, allowing separase to mediate the degradation of cohesins (Mo2009Antitumor).

The protein contains several proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in its C-terminal domain, which serve as potential binding sites for SH3 domains. These motifs are crucial for its oncogenic function, as mutations in these regions abrogate its tumorigenic properties (Hamid2005EctopicexpressionofPTTG1securinpromotestumorigenesisinhumanembryonickidneycells). PTTG1 also has a transcriptional activation domain at the C terminus, which can induce the expression of oncogenes like c-myc, bFGF, and VEGF (Mo2009Antitumor). The protein can be phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase during mitosis, which is a common post-translational modification that may regulate its function (Lai2007The).

## Function
PTTG1, also known as securin, is a protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability. In healthy human cells, PTTG1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm with partial nuclear localization, and its expression peaks during mitosis (Lai2007The). It functions by inhibiting the separation of sister chromatids, thereby preventing premature chromatid separation and ensuring proper mitosis. This inhibition is achieved through its interaction with separase, an enzyme responsible for cleaving cohesin, which holds sister chromatids together (Lai2007The).

PTTG1 is also involved in cell-cycle progression and chromosome stability, contributing to appropriate cell division. It can be phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase during mitosis, which is crucial for its function in cell-cycle control (Lai2007The). Additionally, PTTG1 has transcriptional activation capabilities, as it can directly bind to the c-myc promoter sequence to upregulate its expression, suggesting a role in cellular transformation by activating oncogenes (Lai2007The).

PTTG1 also stimulates the expression and secretion of mitogenic and angiogenic factors such as bFGF and VEGF, indicating its involvement in tumor angiogenesis (Lai2007The).

## Clinical Significance
The pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and genetic alterations. PTTG1 is significantly upregulated in numerous tumor types, including glioblastomas, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis (Wang2024MultiOmics; Lin2019PTTG1). In bladder carcinoma, PTTG1 overexpression is linked to increased tumor cell proliferation and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Li2022Clinical).

PTTG1 also plays a role in the tumor microenvironment by interacting with immune checkpoint genes, potentially aiding tumors in evading immune surveillance (Wang2024MultiOmics). In multiple myeloma, high PTTG1 expression correlates with hyperproliferation and poor prognosis, indicating its role in disease progression (Noll2015PTTG1). Additionally, PTTG1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell expansion, contributing to tumor malignancy and metastasis, particularly in prostate cancer (Dai2021CDC20).

Genetic alterations in PTTG1, such as amplifications and missense mutations, further contribute to its oncogenic potential, with amplification being notably common in kidney renal clear cell carcinomas (Wang2024MultiOmics). These findings underscore PTTG1's significance as a potential therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
PTTG1, also known as securin, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with approximately 80 proteins, including transcription factors such as TBPL1 and ABT1. Notable interactions include those with PBF, p53, Sp1, and USF1. The interaction between PTTG1 and PBF is crucial for the nuclear translocation and regulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and sodium-iodine symporter expression (Tong2009Transcriptional). PTTG1 also induces p53 expression and apoptosis, with specific residues being important for their interaction (Tong2009Transcriptional). The PTTG1-Sp1 interaction involves the N-terminus of PTTG1 and the C-terminus of Sp1, affecting the cell cycle by transactivating cyclin D3 and p21 (Tong2009Transcriptional).

In seminoma tumors, PTTG1 interacts with the SPTBN1 gene product, which functions as a cytoplasmic anchor, impairing PTTG1's nuclear-associated oncogenic activity. This interaction is particularly significant in the TCAM2 cell line, where increased binding of PTTG1 and SPTBN1 correlates with reduced nuclear localization of PTTG1 and less aggressive cell behavior (Teveroni2023SPTBN1). The SECURA-3 RNA aptamer has been developed to target PTTG1, showing high affinity and specificity, and it can disrupt PTTG1's interaction with the CXCR2 enhancer sequence, indicating potential therapeutic applications (Prabu2020Unravelling).
