# CA2

## Overview
The CA2 gene encodes the enzyme carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA II), a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining acid-base balance in the body and is widely distributed across various tissues, including red blood cells, kidneys, and the brain (Lindskog1997Structure; Tashian1989The). CA II is characterized by its compact, globular structure, which includes a zinc ion in the active site essential for its catalytic function (Lindskog1997Structure; Imtaiyaz2013Structure). The enzyme is involved in numerous physiological processes, such as acid-base homeostasis, CO2 transport, and fluid secretion, underscoring its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and supporting metabolic functions (Sly1995HUMAN). Mutations in the CA2 gene can lead to carbonic anhydrase 2 deficiency syndrome, highlighting the clinical significance of this enzyme in human health (Shaik2019Molecular).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) is a small monomeric enzyme consisting of 260 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa (Shaik2019Molecular). The primary structure of CA2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by 9 α-helices, 14 β-pleated sheets, and 22 loops (Shaik2019Molecular). The tertiary structure of CA2 is compact and globular, stabilized by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds, with a zinc ion located in the active site, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Lindskog1997Structure). The zinc ion is coordinated by three conserved histidine residues (His94, His96, His119) and a water molecule, forming a tetrahedral configuration (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). The active site is divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic halves, with specific residues contributing to each (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). The enzyme functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure (Shaik2019Molecular). Common post-translational modifications of CA2 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its activity and stability (Lindskog1997Structure).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) is a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a critical role in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a reaction essential for maintaining acid-base balance in the body (Lindskog1997Structure; Tashian1989The). This enzyme is highly active and widely distributed across various tissues, including red blood cells, kidneys, and the brain, where it facilitates the transport of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate between tissues and the bloodstream (Lindskog1997Structure; Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

In cellular biology, CA II is involved in several physiological processes. It contributes to acid-base homeostasis by promoting H+ secretion in gastric parietal cells and renal tubular cells, and HCO3- secretion in pancreatic duct cells and other epithelial tissues (Sly1995HUMAN). CA II also plays a role in CO2 exchange in erythrocytes, lungs, and renal proximal tubules, enhancing urinary acidification and facilitating rapid CO2 transport (Sly1995HUMAN; Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for various organismal outcomes, including bone resorption, renal acidification, and the secretion of fluids like gastric juice and saliva (Tashian1989The). CA II's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and supporting metabolic functions (Sly1995HUMAN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CA2 gene, which encodes the carbonic anhydrase 2 enzyme, lead to carbonic anhydrase 2 deficiency syndrome. This rare inherited disorder is characterized by osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and cerebral calcification. Patients may also experience developmental delay, short stature, fractures, weakness, cranial nerve compression, dental malocclusion, and mental abnormalities (Shaik2019Molecular). The deficiency results from mutations that cause structural deformations in the CA2 protein, affecting its stability and flexibility (Shaik2019Molecular).

The CA2 protein is crucial for maintaining cellular pH balance, and its deficiency disrupts bicarbonate reabsorption in bones, contributing to the symptoms of the syndrome (Shaik2019Molecular). Computational studies have identified several destabilizing missense mutations, such as K18E and G195R, which alter the protein's structure and function (Shaik2019Molecular).

Additionally, CA2 interacts with other proteins involved in pH regulation, such as SLC4A4 and SLC9A1. Mutations in CA2 may share pathological features with conditions like proximal renal tubular acidosis and cerebellar ataxia, suggesting a broader impact on cellular processes (Shaik2019Molecular).

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular processes. CA2 interacts with the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter SLC4A4 and the sodium/hydrogen exchanger SLC9A1, both of which are crucial for pH regulation and bicarbonate transport. These interactions suggest shared pathological features in conditions like CA2 deficiency syndrome (Shaik2019Molecular). 

CA2 is also identified as a significant off-target of the inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. This interaction is characterized by MCC950 acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of CA2, with molecular docking studies indicating that MCC950 binds to the catalytic zinc ion of CA2, similar to sulfonamide inhibitors (Kennedy2021A). 

The protein interactome analysis of CA2 reveals interactions with several partners, including CDH1 and CTNNB1, which are involved in processes like adherens junction organization and cadherin binding (Shaik2019Molecular). These interactions highlight CA2's role in maintaining cellular structure and signaling pathways. Through these interactions, CA2 plays a critical role in ion transport, pH regulation, and cellular signaling.
