# HSPA1L

## Overview
HSPA1L is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, specifically known as heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 1 like. This protein functions as a molecular chaperone, playing a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of nascent polypeptides, preventing protein aggregation, and facilitating the refolding of misfolded proteins. HSPA1L is involved in various cellular processes, including chaperone-mediated autophagy and mitophagy, which are essential for cellular stress responses and mitochondrial quality control. The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell survival and stress resilience. Mutations in the HSPA1L gene have been linked to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and spontaneous preterm birth, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular health and function (Nakatsuka2021A; Takahashi2017De; Wisniewska2010Crystal; Lee2020Melatonin; Huusko2018Whole).

## Structure
HSPA1L is a member of the Hsp70 family, which are heat shock proteins involved in protein folding and protection against stress. The primary structure of HSPA1L consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-level structures. The secondary structure of HSPA1L typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of HSPA1L forms a three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its function, often featuring a nucleotide-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain. These domains are essential for the protein's role in binding and hydrolyzing ATP, as well as interacting with substrate proteins.

The quaternary structure of HSPA1L may involve interactions with other proteins, which can be important for its function in cellular stress responses. Common post-translational modifications of HSPA1L include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions. These modifications are critical for the protein's ability to respond to cellular stress and maintain protein homeostasis. The structural features of HSPA1L, including its domains and post-translational modifications, are integral to its role in the cellular stress response and protein maintenance.

## Function
HSPA1L, a member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, functions as a molecular chaperone involved in various cellular processes. It plays a crucial role in protein homeostasis by assisting in the folding of nascent polypeptides, preventing protein aggregation, and facilitating the refolding of misfolded proteins. This activity is essential for maintaining cellular stress responses and ensuring proper protein function within the cell (Wisniewska2010Crystal).

HSPA1L is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cell survival and stress resilience. It is involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy, a process that helps degrade and recycle damaged proteins, thereby maintaining cellular health (Nakatsuka2021A). In healthy cells, HSPA1L cooperates with other chaperones to stabilize preexisting proteins against aggregation and mediate the folding of newly translated polypeptides in the cytosol and within organelles (Muhammad2021SARSCoV2).

HSPA1L also plays a role in mitochondrial function and quality control, particularly under stress conditions. It is involved in mitophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function (Lee2020Melatonin). This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and preventing oxidative stress.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSPA1L gene have been associated with several diseases, notably inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). In the context of IBD, mutations such as p.Ser277Leu, p.Gly77Ser, and p.Leu172del have been identified in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. These mutations are located at conserved residues and are associated with a loss of chaperone activity, suggesting a potential causative role in the disease's pathogenesis (Takahashi2017De). The HSPA1L gene is located in the MHC class III region, a known genetic linkage region for IBD, and its mutations may disrupt the HSP70 chaperone system, affecting intestinal barrier function (Takahashi2017De).

In the case of SPTB, rare variants in the HSPA1L gene, such as rs34620296 (Ala268Thr), have been linked to this condition. These variants are thought to affect the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining pregnancy. The association of HSPA1L variants with SPTB has been observed in Finnish and Danish families, with some variants showing a higher frequency in preterm birth cases compared to controls (Huusko2018Whole). These findings suggest that HSPA1L plays a significant role in both IBD and SPTB through its involvement in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis.

## Interactions
HSPA1L, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for cellular stress responses. In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), HSPA1L interacts with parkin, a cytoplasmic protein, to facilitate mitophagy under oxidative stress conditions. This interaction is essential for the translocation of parkin to damaged mitochondria, initiating the mitophagy signaling cascade. The binding of HSPA1L to parkin stabilizes parkin and enhances mitophagy, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and reducing apoptosis in hMSCs (Yoon2019Melatonin).

In the context of diabetic kidney disease, HSPA1L forms a complex with vaspin, an adipokine, in proximal tubular cells (PTCs). This interaction is involved in protecting PTCs from organelle stress by promoting chaperone-mediated autophagy and inhibiting p62 accumulation. HSPA1L also binds to lamp2, similar to its homolog Hsc70 (HSPA8), suggesting a role in autophagy processes (Nakatsuka2021A). The vaspin-HSPA1L complex is internalized via clathrin heavy chain (CHC)-mediated endocytosis, indicating its involvement in intracellular transport and stress adaptation (Nakatsuka2021A).
