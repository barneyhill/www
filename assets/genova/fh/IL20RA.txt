# IL20RA

## Overview
The IL20RA gene encodes the interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha, a critical component of the receptor complex for cytokines such as IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. This receptor is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a significant role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating immune responses and maintaining epithelial homeostasis (McGovern2016Capture). The protein is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, including keratinocytes, and is involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue repair (Kragstrup2018The). IL20RA is also implicated in immune surveillance by influencing dendritic cell migration, thereby contributing to immune homeostasis (Bech2016Interleukin). Its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yu2021SuperEnhancer; McGovern2016Capture).

## Function
The IL20RA gene encodes the interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha, which is a component of the receptor complex for interleukins IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. This receptor complex is involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining epithelial homeostasis. IL20RA is expressed in various cell types, including keratinocytes and other epithelial cells, where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation (McGovern2016Capture).

In healthy human cells, IL20RA is involved in tissue homeostasis and repair mechanisms, particularly in the skin, gut, and airways. It is implicated in wound healing and tissue repair processes, contributing to the maintenance of epithelial integrity (Kragstrup2018The). The receptor's activity is primarily observed in epithelial cells, where it helps regulate responses to inflammation and injury.

The IL-20 receptor complex, including IL20RA, is also associated with the regulation of dendritic cell migration, which is essential for immune surveillance and response. This function highlights its role in modulating immune cell trafficking and maintaining immune homeostasis (Bech2016Interleukin). Overall, IL20RA is integral to the balance of immune responses and epithelial cell function in healthy tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL20RA gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and autoimmune conditions. In CRC, IL20RA is regulated by super-enhancers, leading to increased expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with tumor proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion, suggesting its role in promoting cancer progression (Yu2021SuperEnhancer). Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing IL20RA expression decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC (Yu2021SuperEnhancer).

In autoimmune diseases, IL20RA has been identified as a novel causal gene in the 6q23 locus, a region associated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis. The risk allele of SNP rs6927172 is linked to increased IL20RA expression, particularly in CD4+ T-cells, suggesting its involvement in disease susceptibility (McGovern2016Capture). The IL20RA gene is also implicated in inflammatory colitis, where it is regulated by microRNA 452 (MIR452), affecting the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. Alterations in this pathway are associated with both CRC and colitis, highlighting the gene's role in inflammatory and cancer-related processes (Lamichhane2021MicroRNA).

## Interactions
IL20RA, the interleukin 20 receptor subunit alpha, forms a heterodimeric receptor complex with IL20RB to bind cytokines such as IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. This receptor complex is involved in activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in immune responses and epithelial innate immunity (McGovern2016Capture). In ovarian cancer, IL20RA interacts with IL-20 and IL-24 produced by peritoneal mesothelial cells, activating a signaling pathway that includes the OAS/RNase L-mediated NLR inflammasome pathway. This leads to the production of IL-18, which is essential for macrophage polarization to an M1-like phenotype, thereby suppressing cancer metastasis (Li2021Aa).

IL20RA is also a direct target of microRNA 452 (MIR452) in colorectal cancer, where MIR452 regulates the IL20RA-mediated JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction was demonstrated through a luciferase reporter assay, showing that MIR452 reduces IL20RA expression, affecting downstream signaling molecules like phosphorylated JAK1 and STAT3 (Lamichhane2021MicroRNA). These interactions highlight IL20RA's role in various signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression and immune modulation.
