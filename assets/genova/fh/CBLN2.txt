# CBLN2

## Overview
CBLN2 is a gene that encodes the cerebellin 2 precursor protein, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in synaptic organization and function within the central nervous system. As a member of the C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein family, cerebellin 2 is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses by forming trans-synaptic adhesion complexes. These complexes are established through interactions with presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic receptors such as GluD1 and GluD2, which are crucial for normal synaptic function and behavior (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2). The protein is expressed in various brain regions, including the cerebellum and dorsal raphe, where it regulates serotonergic circuits and contributes to synaptic communication and plasticity (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2; Yang2010Identification). CBLN2's involvement in synaptic processes underscores its importance in neurodevelopment and its potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Function
CBLN2 (cerebellin 2 precursor) is a secreted glycoprotein involved in synaptic organization and function, primarily active in the central nervous system. It is part of the C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein family, playing a crucial role in synapse formation and maintenance. CBLN2 forms trans-synaptic adhesion complexes by binding to presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic GluD1 and GluD2, which are essential for maintaining normal synaptic function and behavior (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2). 

In the cerebellum, CBLN2 is thought to have functional redundancy with CBLN1, promoting the formation and stability of excitatory synapses between cerebellar granule neurons and Purkinje cells (Sandor2018Spinal). CBLN2 is expressed in various brain regions, including the dorsal raphe, where it regulates serotonergic circuits implicated in controlling compulsive behaviors (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2). The protein is also involved in bidirectional signaling between pre-and postsynaptic neurons, suggesting a role in synaptic communication and plasticity (Yang2010Identification). CBLN2's expression in sensory and spinal cord neurons before the formation of appropriate projections indicates its participation in synapse formation and maintenance (Yang2010Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CBLN2 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have linked CBLN2 and its binding partners, such as neurexins and GluD1/2, to disorders characterized by behavioral disinhibition, including Tourette syndrome, ADHD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2). The loss of CBLN2 in mice has been associated with compulsive behaviors, hyperactivity, and decreased serotonin levels in the brain, which are symptoms that can be partly alleviated by serotonin-related treatments (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2). This suggests that CBLN2 plays a critical role in regulating serotonergic circuits, and its disruption may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Seigneur2021Cerebellin2).

CBLN2 has also been implicated in the regulation of synaptogenesis and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex, with potential links to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Shibata2021Homininispecific). Alterations in synaptic proteins and connectivity within the frontal lobe, potentially involving the NXRN-GRID trans-synaptic complex that includes CBLNs, may underlie the pathophysiology of ASD and schizophrenia (Shibata2021Homininispecific). Additionally, a single-nucleotide polymorphism near the CBLN2 gene has been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, indicating a broader impact of CBLN2 on health (Huang2018CBLN2).

## Interactions
CBLN2, a member of the cerebellin family of proteins, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for synaptic function. It binds to β-neurexins, specifically the S4-containing splice variants of Nrxn1β, Nrxn2β, and Nrxn3β, with a similar avidity to CBLN1, although its binding to Nrxn3β is weaker (wei2012cbln; rong2012comparison). CBLN2 also interacts with α-neurexins, binding to Nrxn1α and Nrxn2α, but not to Nrxn3α (wei2012cbln). 

In addition to neurexins, CBLN2 binds to the postsynaptic receptor Grid2, although with less affinity compared to CBLN1 (rong2012comparison). CBLN2's interaction with GluRδ receptors is less effective than CBLN1, showing weak binding to GluRδ1 and less effective binding to GluRδ2 (wei2012cbln). 

CBLN2 does not significantly interact with other membrane proteins, such as those with complement C1q domains or immunoglobulin-like domains (wei2012cbln). Glycosylation of CBLN2 affects its receptor binding, with mutations enhancing its interactions with neurexins and Grid2 (Rong2018Glycosylation). These interactions highlight CBLN2's role in synaptic organization and function.
