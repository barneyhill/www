# S100A7A

## Overview
S100A7A is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium binding protein A7A, a member of the S100 family of proteins known for their role in calcium binding. These proteins are characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structural domains capable of binding calcium ions. The S100A7A protein is involved in various cellular processes, including regulation of cell cycle progression and differentiation. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and has been implicated in inflammatory responses and certain skin conditions. The protein's function and interactions suggest it may play a role in the pathophysiology of diseases such as psoriasis and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Qiu2020aarFDC).
