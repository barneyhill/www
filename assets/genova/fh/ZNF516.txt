# ZNF516

## Overview
ZNF516 is a gene located on chromosome 18q23 that encodes the zinc finger protein 516, a member of the Krüppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by interacting with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST corepressor complex. The zinc finger protein 516 is characterized by its 10 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions necessary for its repressive functions (Li2017ZNF516). It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, chromosomal stability, and cellular proliferation (Brebi2013Genomewide; Li2017ZNF516). Alterations in ZNF516 expression and methylation have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ili2018Loss; Li2017ZNF516).

## Structure
ZNF516 is a transcription repressor gene located on chromosome 18q23, encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 124.3 kDa. The protein consists of eight exons and seven introns and is characterized by the presence of 10 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are typical of the Krüppel C2H2-type zinc-finger family involved in transcriptional regulation (Li2017ZNF516). These zinc finger domains are crucial for the protein's ability to bind DNA and interact with other proteins, facilitating its role in transcriptional repression (Li2017ZNF516).

The N-terminal region of ZNF516, specifically the 1-9 zinc fingers, is responsible for its interaction with the ELM2-SANT II domain of CoREST and the PLDLS and RRT-binding domains of CtBP1/2, forming a multiprotein complex with CtBP1/2, CoREST, LSD1, and HDAC1/2 (Li2017ZNF516). This interaction is essential for its function in transcription repression, particularly in the context of EGFR expression (Li2017ZNF516).

ZNF516 is primarily localized in the nucleus and exhibits variable expression levels across different cell lines (Li2017ZNF516). The protein's evolutionary conservation suggests a significant functional role across species (Li2017ZNF516). However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ZNF516 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ZNF516 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a significant role in gene regulation within healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex, a group known for its involvement in transcriptional repression (Li2017ZNF516). This interaction allows ZNF516 to regulate the expression of various genes, including those involved in critical cellular processes such as focal adhesion, mitotic nuclear division, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, and apoptosis (Li2017ZNF516).

ZNF516 is also implicated in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. It acts by recruiting the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex to the EGFR promoter, thereby repressing its transcription. This repression is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing oncogenic pathways (Li2017ZNF516). The protein's role in transcriptional repression is further supported by its ability to inhibit reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its involvement in controlling gene expression levels (Li2017ZNF516).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF516 is involved in maintaining chromosomal stability, as its loss is associated with DNA replication stress and chromosome abnormalities (Brebi2013Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF516 has been implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and methylation status. In cervical cancer, ZNF516 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its reduced expression. This hypermethylation is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and is considered a potential biomarker for early detection of cervical neoplasia (Ili2018Loss; Brebi2013Genomewide). The loss of ZNF516 expression is linked to an increased risk of developing cervical preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, and its expression is inversely related to the presence of HR-HPV (Ili2018Loss).

In breast cancer, ZNF516 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the EGFR gene. Its reduced expression is associated with the upregulation of EGFR, contributing to cancer progression. ZNF516 expression is lower in more aggressive breast cancer subtypes, and its loss is linked to poor survival outcomes (Li2017ZNF516). The gene also experiences frequent copy number loss in colorectal cancer, which is associated with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy (Li2017ZNF516).

Overall, ZNF516's role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in transcriptional repression make it a significant focus for cancer research and potential therapeutic targeting.

## Interactions
ZNF516 is a transcription repressor that interacts with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex, a corepressor complex involved in transcriptional repression. This interaction is crucial for ZNF516's role in gene regulation, particularly in the suppression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. ZNF516 physically associates with components of the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex, including CtBP1/2, CoREST, LSD1, HDAC1/2, and RBBP4/7, as demonstrated through affinity purification and mass spectrometry (Li2017ZNF516). The N-terminal region of ZNF516 is responsible for its interaction with specific domains of CoREST and CtBP1/2, as identified by GST pull-down experiments (Li2017ZNF516).

ZNF516's interaction with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex is essential for its transcriptional repression activity. This complex recruits epigenetic modifiers such as histone deacetylases and demethylases, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Li2017ZNF516). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-based deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified numerous ZNF516-specific binding peaks, indicating its role in targeting specific genes for repression (Li2017ZNF516). These interactions highlight ZNF516's significant role in cellular processes, including cell proliferation and motility, by modulating the expression of target genes through its association with the CtBP/LSD1/CoREST complex (Li2017ZNF516).
