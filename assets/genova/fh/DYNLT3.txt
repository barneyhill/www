# DYNLT3

## Overview
DYNLT3 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain Tctex-type 3, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex. This protein is integral to the retrograde transport along microtubules, playing a pivotal role in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in the movement and distribution of melanosomes within melanocytes. As a part of the dynein complex, dynein light chain Tctex-type 3 is involved in various cellular functions, including the regulation of melanosome dynamics, which is crucial for proper pigmentation. The protein's activity is modulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which influences melanosome localization and maturation. Additionally, DYNLT3 is implicated in the transport of viral components, such as those from human papillomavirus and Herpes Simplex virus, highlighting its role in both cellular and viral processes (Lai2021A; Aktary2021A; Aktary2021Dynlt3).

## Function
DYNLT3, or dynein light chain Tctex-type 3, is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport along microtubules in cells. This protein plays a significant role in the intracellular trafficking of melanosomes, organelles responsible for pigment production in melanocytes. DYNLT3 is involved in melanosome movement, distribution, acidity, and transfer, which are essential processes for proper pigmentation (Aktary2021A).

DYNLT3's function is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where β-catenin negatively regulates its expression. This regulation affects melanosome localization, with decreased DYNLT3 levels leading to more peripheral melanosome distribution and increased acidity, indicating immature melanosomes (Aktary2021A; Aktary2021Dynlt3). The protein's role in melanosome dynamics is crucial for maintaining proper skin pigmentation and may have broader implications in pigmentation disorders (Aktary2021Dynlt3).

DYNLT3 is also involved in the competition between kinesin and dynein motors on microtubules, influencing the directionality and motility of melanosomes. This interaction is vital for avoiding traffic jams within cells and ensuring efficient organelle transport (Aktary2021A).

## Clinical Significance
DYNLT3 has been implicated in breast cancer progression. Studies have shown that DYNLT3 is upregulated in certain breast cancer subtypes and is associated with tumor-promoting functions. Knockdown experiments in breast cancer cell lines, such as BT-474 and MDA-MB-231, demonstrated that reducing DYNLT3 expression decreased cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation in vitro. However, in vivo experiments did not show a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth or metastasis, suggesting that the in vitro effects might be compensated in vivo (Gu2020Ageassociated). DYNLT3's expression is also predictive of relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (Gu2020Ageassociated).

In the context of neurological disorders, DYNLT3 levels were found to be significantly increased in a mouse model carrying a mutation in the DYNC1LI1 gene, which affects the dynein complex. This mutation led to increased anxiety-like behavior and defects in neuronal migration and morphology, although the direct role of DYNLT3 in these phenotypes was not fully elucidated (Banks2011Behavioral). These findings suggest that alterations in DYNLT3 expression or its interactions within the dynein complex may contribute to both cancer progression and neurological abnormalities.

## Interactions
DYNLT3, a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It interacts with the L2 protein of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), forming a complex with RanBP10 and KPNA2. This complex facilitates the transport of viral DNA during mitosis, indicating DYNLT3's role in the nuclear import process of HPV16 (Lai2021A). DYNLT3 is part of a dynein-dependent transport mechanism, essential for the minus-end directed movement of viral DNA towards the microtubule organizing centers during mitosis (Lai2021A).

DYNLT3 also interacts with viral proteins from other viruses, such as the Herpes Simplex virus capsid protein VP26, to hijack the cytoplasmic dynein complex for nuclear transport (Aktary2021A). In melanocytes, DYNLT3 is involved in melanosome movement and distribution, where it is regulated by β-catenin activity. Its expression is negatively regulated by β-catenin, affecting melanosome maturity and acidity (Aktary2021A). These interactions highlight DYNLT3's role in both viral transport and cellular processes related to pigmentation.
