# EPM2AIP1

## Overview
EPM2AIP1 is a gene that encodes the protein EPM2A interacting protein 1, which is implicated in glycogen metabolism. This protein is known for its interaction with laforin, a dual-specificity phosphatase encoded by the EPM2A gene, and is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation. EPM2AIP1 is a component of the laforin-malin complex, which is essential for maintaining normal glycogen metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The protein's role in colocalizing with laforin at the endoplasmic reticulum and its concentration on Lafora bodies highlights its significance in the pathophysiology of Lafora disease, a severe form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Nicolescu2019Diabetes; Chan2004Laforin). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms involving EPM2AIP1 in glycogen metabolism pathways (Nicolescu2019Diabetes).

## Structure


## Interactions
EPM2AIP1, also known as EPM2A interacting protein 1, is known to interact with the laforin protein, which is encoded by the EPM2A gene. Laforin is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in glycogen metabolism and is associated with Lafora disease, a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. EPM2AIP1 colocalizes with laforin at the endoplasmic reticulum and is strongly concentrated on Lafora bodies, which are starch-like polyglucosans that form in the absence of laforin (Chan2004Laforin). 

EPM2AIP1 is part of the laforin-malin complex, which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The absence of EPM2AIP1 can lead to hepatic insulin resistance due to its role in the allosteric activation of glycogen synthase by glucose 6 phosphate (Nicolescu2019Diabetes). Although specific physical interactions of EPM2AIP1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, it is suggested to interact with proteins involved in glycogen metabolism pathways, such as glycogen synthase and other regulatory subunits (Nicolescu2019Diabetes). The exact molecular interactions and functions of EPM2AIP1 in these complexes remain an area for further research.
