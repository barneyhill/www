# HIKESHI

## Overview
HIKESHI is a gene that encodes the heat shock protein nuclear import factor hikeshi, a crucial component in the cellular stress response mechanism. This protein functions as a nuclear transport factor, specifically facilitating the import of heat shock proteins from the Hsp70 family into the nucleus. Unlike traditional nuclear import pathways that rely on the importin β family and the Ran GTPase system, HIKESHI operates independently, utilizing the ATPase cycle of Hsp70s for energy. The protein is evolutionarily conserved across species, from yeast to mammals, and plays a vital role in maintaining nuclear proteostasis and regulating the transcriptional activity of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) under both stressed and nonstressed conditions. Mutations in the HIKESHI gene have been linked to severe neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and stress adaptation (Imamoto2012Heatshock; Kose2022Lack; Kose2012Hikeshi).

## Structure
The HIKESHI protein is a nuclear transport factor responsible for the import of heat-shock proteins from the Hsp70 family. Structurally, HIKESHI is a dimeric protein composed of two domains. The N-terminal domains (NTDs) are crucial for interaction with nucleoporins (Nups), which are components of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (Christie2016Structural). The dimeric nature of HIKESHI is asymmetric, which is suggested to be important for recognizing the ATP-bound form of Hsp70 proteins (Christie2016Structural).

HIKESHI operates independently of the importin β family and does not rely on the Ran GTPase system. Instead, it utilizes the ATPase cycle of Hsp70s for energy, binding to the ATP-bound form of Hsp70s in the cytoplasm and releasing them in the nucleus (Kose2012Hikeshi). This process is regulated by co-chaperones such as Hsp110 and Hsp40, which modulate the nucleotide state of Hsp70s (Kose2012Hikeshi).

The protein is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals and consists of 197 amino acids (Kose2012Hikeshi). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of HIKESHI are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HIKESHI, also known as heat shock protein nuclear import factor, plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of HSP70 proteins in human cells. Under both nonstressed and heat-shock conditions, HIKESHI mediates the localization of HSP70 to the nucleus, where it is essential for maintaining nuclear proteostasis and regulating the transcriptional activity of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (Kose2022Lack). HIKESHI facilitates the nuclear import of ATP-bound HSP70s, which function as molecular chaperones in the nucleus, helping to counteract heat shock damage and stabilize nuclear proteins (Kose2012Hikeshi).

In healthy cells, HIKESHI negatively regulates HSF1 activity by ensuring the proper nuclear accumulation of HSP70, which is crucial for the deactivation of HSF1 under nonstressed conditions (Kose2022Lack). The absence of HIKESHI leads to reduced nuclear HSP70 levels, resulting in increased transcriptional activity of HSF1 and potential instability of nuclear proteins (Kose2022Lack). This regulation is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the aggregation of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Kose2022Lack). HIKESHI's function is essential for cellular adaptation to stress and the prevention of protein aggregation-related pathologies (Kose2022Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HIKESHI gene are associated with a specific type of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, a severe neurological disorder characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. This condition presents with symptoms such as early hypotonia, feeding difficulties, poor growth, dystonia, pyramidal signs, lower limb spasticity, severe motor delay, cognitive impairment, nystagmus, and visual impairment. A recurrent variant, p.(Val54Leu), is particularly prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, with a carrier rate estimated between 1:168 and 1:370 in different communities (Helman2021Further). 

Another variant, c.11G>C p.(Cys4Ser), was identified in a Finnish patient, leading to hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy with additional features such as periventricular cysts and vermian atrophy. This variant is associated with clinical features including lower limb spasticity, optic atrophy, nystagmus, severe developmental delay, and epileptic seizures (Vasilescu2016Absence). 

The HIKESHI gene plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) during cellular stress. Dysfunction in this process due to HIKESHI mutations can lead to impaired cellular stress responses, contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Imamoto2012Heatshock).

## Interactions
HIKESHI interacts with the Hsp70 family of heat shock proteins, facilitating their nuclear import during stress conditions. This interaction is regulated by the nucleotide state of Hsp70s, with HIKESHI preferentially binding to the ATP-bound form of Hsp70s in the cytoplasm. The binding is disrupted when Hsp70s are in the ADP-bound form, a process facilitated by J-domain-containing co-chaperones like the Hsp40 family (Imamoto2012Heatshock; Kose2012Hikeshi). Hsp110, another co-chaperone, acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70s, enhancing the interaction between HIKESHI and Hsp70s in the presence of ATP (Kose2012Hikeshi).

HIKESHI also interacts with FG-Nups, such as Nup62 and Nup153, which are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). This interaction allows HIKESHI to translocate through the NPC independently of other soluble factors, a process that can be inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin and importin β (Kose2012Hikeshi). The interaction with FG-Nups is crucial for HIKESHI's role as a nuclear import carrier, distinct from the conventional importin β-mediated pathway (Kose2012Hikeshi).
