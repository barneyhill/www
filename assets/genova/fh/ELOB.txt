# ELOB

## Overview
Elongin B (ELOB) is a gene that encodes the protein elongin B, a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcription elongation and protein degradation. As a component of the Elongin BC complex, elongin B is involved in enhancing the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II and is integral to the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are crucial for protein homeostasis. The protein's structure includes an N-terminal ubiquitin-homology domain, which is essential for its interaction with elongin C, forming a heterodimer that is vital for the complex's function. Elongin B is also implicated in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs and cytokine signaling pathways, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular regulation. Additionally, its involvement in the degradation of tumor suppressor proteins links it to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kamura1998The; Sui2024Elongin; Lonergan1998Regulation).

## Structure
Elongin B (ELOB) is a ubiquitin-like protein composed of 118 amino acids, featuring an 84-amino-acid N-terminal ubiquitin-homology (UbH) domain and a 34-amino-acid C-terminal tail (Kamura1998The). The N-terminal UbL domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Elongin C (EloC) and shows marked sequence similarity to ubiquitin, with a tertiary structure similar to ubiquitin (Wang2013Interactions). This domain is crucial for the formation of the Elongin BC complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation and protein degradation pathways (Kamura1998The).

The C-terminal region of ELOB is highly conserved and plays a significant role in binding with HIV-1 Vif, impacting Vif-mediated degradation of A3G (Wang2013Interactions). The Elongin BC complex, which includes ELOB, interacts with the BC-box motif, distinct from the F-box motif recognized by Skp1, and is a component of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor complex (Kamura1998The). ELOB forms a heterodimer with EloC, enhancing the activity of Elongin A (ELOA) and participating in the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitylation and degradation of the RPB1 subunit of stalled Pol II (Chen2023Structure).

## Function
Elongin B (ELOB) is a component of the Elongin BC complex, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the rate of RNA polymerase II transcription elongation. This complex is involved in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with various proteins, including Elongin A and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. The Elongin BC complex binds to a BC-box motif present in these proteins, facilitating their regulatory functions (Kamura1998The).

ELOB is also a part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. This function is particularly important in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs, where ELOB, along with Elongin C and Cul2, forms a complex with VHL to regulate the stability of these mRNAs (Lonergan1998Regulation).

In addition to its role in transcription and protein degradation, the Elongin BC complex interacts with SOCS-box proteins, which are involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling pathways. This interaction helps stabilize SOCS-1, a member of the SOCS-box family, thereby modulating signal transduction processes (Kamura1998The).

## Clinical Significance
ELOB (elongin B) has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer due to its role in the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p14/ARF. Overexpression of ELOB is observed in breast cancer tissues and is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in HR+/HER2- subtypes, where it correlates with larger tumor size and worse relapse-free survival (Sui2024Elongin). The high expression of ELOB is linked to cancer-promoting pathways, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and PI3K-Akt signaling, which contribute to malignant biological behaviors (Sui2024Elongin).

Mechanistically, ELOB, as part of the CRL2 E3 ligase complex, facilitates the degradation of p14/ARF, a process that promotes cancer cell proliferation. Knockdown of ELOB results in the accumulation of p14/ARF, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and suppressing tumor growth in vivo (Sui2024Elongin). These findings suggest that ELOB could serve as a potential target for anticancer therapy, as its inhibition may prevent breast cancer progression by stabilizing p14/ARF levels (Sui2024Elongin). The clinical significance of ELOB in breast cancer highlights its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ELOB, or elongin B, is a component of the elongin complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription elongation and the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. ELOB interacts with elongin C (ELOC) to form a heterodimer that is essential for the recruitment of CBF-β to the HIV-1 Vif protein, facilitating the degradation of APOBEC3 proteins (Wang2013Interactions). This interaction is critical for the stability and solubility of Vif, as ELOB and ELOC together enhance Vif's proper folding (Wang2013Interactions).

The PPLP motif of Vif interacts specifically with residues 101 to 104 of ELOB, forming an alpha-helix that is crucial for recruiting Cul5 and assembling a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Bergeron2010The). ELOB's C-terminal tail is important for its interaction with Vif, and a deletion mutant lacking this region impairs Vif-induced degradation of A3G, highlighting its role in enhancing Vif function (Wang2013Interactions).

In Drosophila, ELOB is part of the Elongin complex, which includes ELOA and ELOC. This complex is involved in determining wing cell identity and interacts with the chromatin factor Corto, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Rougeot2013The).
