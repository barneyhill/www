# SLC27A5

## Overview
SLC27A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 27 member 5, also known as FATP5. This protein is a transmembrane enzyme primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a pivotal role in fatty acid transport and bile acid metabolism. As a very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, FATP5 facilitates the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids, which are crucial for lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism (Xu2023SLC27A5; Gao2019SLC27A5). Additionally, FATP5 is involved in the reconjugation of bile acids during enterohepatic circulation, contributing to the maintenance of lipid balance within the body (Zhang2021Identifying). The protein's interactions with various cellular pathways, including the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, underscore its role in modulating oxidative stress and maintaining redox homeostasis (Gao2019SLC27A5). Alterations in SLC27A5 expression have been linked to liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholestasis, highlighting its clinical significance (EspinosaEscudero2022Cholestasis; Gao2019SLC27A5).

## Function
SLC27A5, also known as FATP5, is primarily expressed in the liver and plays a crucial role in fatty acid transport and bile acid metabolism. It functions as a very long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, facilitating the uptake and activation of long-chain fatty acids, which are essential for various metabolic processes (Xu2023SLC27A5; Gao2019SLC27A5). SLC27A5 is involved in the reconjugation of bile acids during enterohepatic circulation, contributing to lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism (Zhang2021Identifying).

In healthy human cells, SLC27A5 is significant for maintaining lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by studies in Slc27a5-knockout mice, where the absence of this gene led to reduced fatty acid uptake and increased de novo synthesis in hepatocytes (Gao2019SLC27A5). The protein is localized in the cell membrane and is responsible for the production of triglycerides, glycerophospholipids, and cholesteryl esters (Korbecki2023Reduced).

SLC27A5 also plays a role in maintaining redox homeostasis by modulating oxidative stress responses. It negatively regulates the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, which is involved in cellular redox regulation, thereby preventing excessive reactive oxygen species generation and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Gao2019SLC27A5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC27A5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in liver-related diseases. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SLC27A5 expression is notably downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This downregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages, larger tumor size, poor differentiation, and worse overall survival, suggesting that SLC27A5 acts as a tumor suppressor. The deficiency of SLC27A5 in HCC is linked to increased lipid peroxidation and activation of the KEAP1/NRF2/TXNRD1 signaling pathway, which contributes to oxidative stress and tumor progression (Gao2019SLC27A5; Zhang2021Identifying).

SLC27A5 is also involved in bile acid metabolism, and mutations in this gene can lead to cholestasis. A deficiency in the enzyme encoded by SLC27A5, known as BACS, results in a high proportion of unconjugated bile acids, which can contribute to liver disease. This condition was observed in individuals with a homozygous mutation in SLC27A5, highlighting its role in bile acid conjugation and enterohepatic recirculation (EspinosaEscudero2022Cholestasis).

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the deletion or knockdown of SLC27A5 in animal models has been shown to reverse the disease and improve glucose homeostasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kumari2020Bile).

## Interactions
SLC27A5, also known as FATP5, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver metabolism. SLC27A5 interacts with the tetraspanin TM4SF5 in hepatocytes. This interaction is constitutive and plays a role in the regulation of free fatty acid uptake, with SLC27A5 being a dominant player in this process (Park2021Tetraspanin).

SLC27A5 also interacts with the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway, where it negatively regulates NRF2 signaling by repressing the oxidative modification of KEAP1. This interaction involves critical cysteine residues in KEAP1, which act as sensors for oxidative stress, thereby modulating NRF2 activity (Gao2019SLC27A5). The interaction between SLC27A5 and the NRF2 pathway is significant in maintaining redox homeostasis and combating oxidative stress in HCC (Gao2019SLC27A5).

In the context of sorafenib resistance in HCC, SLC27A5 interacts with the NRF2/GSR pathway. Its deficiency leads to the activation of this pathway, contributing to drug resistance. The interaction with glutathione reductase (GSR) is crucial, as SLC27A5 overexpression can sensitize cells to ferroptosis by downregulating GSR, thus affecting glutathione homeostasis (Xu2023SLC27A5).
