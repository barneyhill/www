# BIRC2

## Overview
BIRC2, also known as baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2, is a gene that encodes the cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein 1 (cIAP1), a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family. This protein is characterized by its multiple domains, including baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains, a ubiquitin associating (UBA) domain, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and a RING finger domain, which collectively contribute to its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs; Tencer2023Molecular). cIAP1 is integral to the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and innate immunity, primarily through its involvement in the ubiquitylation of proteins and modulation of the Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways (Estornes2015IAPs; Hrdinka2019Inhibitor). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including histones, DNA, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), underscore its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and immune response (Varfolomeev2007IAP; Tencer2023Molecular).

## Structure
BIRC2, also known as cIAP1, is a protein characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple domains that contribute to its function in inhibiting apoptosis. The protein contains three baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains, a ubiquitin associating (UBA) domain, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and a RING finger domain (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs; Tencer2023Molecular). The BIR domains are involved in binding and inhibiting active caspases, which are crucial for the protein's anti-apoptotic activity (Verhagen2001Inhibitorofapoptosisproteinsandtheirrelatives:IAPsandotherBIRPs). The RING finger domain functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediating autoubiquitination and ubiquitination of protein substrates (Tencer2023Molecular).

The BIR3 domain of BIRC2 has been structurally characterized, revealing a compact globular structure with five short α-helices, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and a zinc-binding cluster (Tencer2023Molecular). This domain interacts with the histone H3 tail, forming a complex stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (Tencer2023Molecular). The BIR domains also share a binding site with ligands such as SMAC and caspase-9 (Tencer2023Molecular).

Post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation, influence BIRC2's stability and function (Tencer2023Molecular). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in regulating apoptosis, cell proliferation, and other cellular processes.

## Function
The BIRC2 gene encodes the cellular Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein 1 (cIAP1), which is a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family. cIAP1 plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis, inflammation, and innate immunity. It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitylation of proteins, which is essential for protein degradation and signal transduction (Estornes2015IAPs; Hrdinka2019Inhibitor). cIAP1 is involved in the regulation of the Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, promoting the expression of pro-survival molecules and regulating Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase (RIPK)-1 and -3 activities, contributing to cell survival (Estornes2015IAPs).

In the context of immune responses, cIAP1 is a positive regulator of NOD1/2-dependent immune responses, promoting the ubiquitylation of RIPK2, which is critical for the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, leading to cytokine secretion (Bertrand2009Cellular). cIAP1 is also involved in the regulation of both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, maintaining low levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) in resting cells to prevent excessive NF-κB activation (Thorne2023Differential). These functions highlight the role of cIAP1 in both apoptosis regulation and immune response modulation in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BIRC2 gene, also known as baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 2, have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), BIRC2 is significantly overexpressed compared to adjacent normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. BIRC2 promotes HCC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by reducing the expression of cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 7, making it an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in HCC patients (Zhang2024NAP1L1).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and melanoma, BIRC2 expression impairs anti-cancer immunity and reduces the efficacy of immunotherapy. It inhibits the expression of CXCL9, a chemokine that recruits immune cells to tumors, thereby decreasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. Knockdown of BIRC2 enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy by increasing immune cell infiltration and reducing tumor growth (Samanta2020BIRC2).

In osteosarcoma, BIRC2 is located near the chromosome 9A1 amplicon and is highly expressed in tumors with this amplification. Its overexpression contributes to tumor growth and reduced apoptosis, particularly in the context of p53 deficiency (Ma2009MMP13).

## Interactions
BIRC2, also known as cIAP1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in regulating apoptosis and cell signaling pathways. BIRC2 interacts with histones and DNA through its BIR domains. The BIR2 and BIR3 domains specifically bind to the histone H3 tail, while the BIR1 domain binds to DNA, allowing BIRC2 to engage with chromatin in a multivalent manner (Tencer2023Molecular). 

BIRC2 also interacts with caspases and functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase via its RING finger domain, mediating ubiquitination processes (Tencer2023Molecular). It forms complexes with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), particularly TRAF2, which is part of the TNFR2 signaling complex. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the noncanonical NF-kB pathway, as BIRC2 acts as an E3 ligase responsible for the degradation of NIK, a kinase involved in this pathway (Varfolomeev2007IAP).

The small molecule inhibitor LCL161 disrupts BIRC2's association with histone H3, promoting cell death in cancer cells and mediating the degradation of BIRC2 in HIV-1-infected human CD4+ T cells (Tencer2023Molecular).
