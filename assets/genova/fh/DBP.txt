# DBP

## Overview
The DBP gene encodes the D-box binding PAR bZIP transcription factor, a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind DNA as a dimer, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the liver. DBP is involved in the transcriptional activation of genes by forming homo- or heterodimers with other PAR family members, such as hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), and requires the p300 coactivator for its activity. The protein's expression is regulated by the CLOCK protein, linking it to the circadian feedback loop. DBP's function extends to the regulation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, and its dysregulation has been associated with various clinical conditions, including sleep and mood disorders, as well as hematopoietic disorders (Schrem2004LiverEnriched; Gachon2006The; Ripperger2000CLOCK).

## Structure
The DBP (D-box binding PAR bZIP transcription factor) protein is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family, characterized by its leucine zipper motif. This motif consists of amphipathic alpha-helical domains that form parallel coiled-coils, stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions (Eileen1996DNABinding). The protein's structure includes a carboxy-terminal leucine zipper that facilitates dimerization and a basic region for DNA binding. The leucine zipper forms a coiled-coil structure with parallel amphipathic alpha-helices interacting via hydrophobic side chains (Wuarin1992The).

DBP binds to DNA as a dimer, making contacts with nucleotide bases at either side of the dyad-symmetrical recognition sequence (Eileen1996DNABinding). The N-terminal region of DBP contains transcription activation domains, and overexpression of this region can attenuate DBP-mediated transcription activation (Wuarin1992The). In the liver, DBP is highly phosphorylated, although dephosphorylation does not affect its DNA-binding equilibrium constant, suggesting that phosphorylation may influence the dynamics of DNA binding or the transcription activation potential of DBP (Wuarin1992The). The protein does not heterodimerize with C/EBPß, despite similarities in DNA binding sites (Eileen1996DNABinding).

## Function
The DBP gene encodes a transcription factor that is part of the PAR bZIP family, which includes proteins like thyroid embryonic factor (TEF) and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF). DBP plays a crucial role in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation, particularly in the liver, where it influences the expression of genes such as albumin and factor VIII (Schrem2004LiverEnriched). It is involved in the circadian regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C6, and its expression follows a circadian rhythm, peaking in the evening and declining at night (Schrem2004LiverEnriched).

DBP functions as a transcriptional activator by binding to specific DNA sequences as homo- or heterodimers, similar to other members of the PAR family (Schrem2004LiverEnriched). It requires the p300 coactivator for its activity and forms dimers with other PAR family members to regulate gene expression (Schrem2004LiverEnriched). DBP is not essential for embryonic development or survival but influences circadian outputs such as locomotor activity and liver gene expression (Ripperger2000CLOCK). Its expression is regulated by the CLOCK protein, which binds to E-box motifs in the DBP gene's regulatory regions (Ripperger2000CLOCK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DBP gene, which encodes the D-box binding PAR bZIP transcription factor, have been implicated in various clinical conditions. DBP is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and its expression is linked to several physiological processes. Alterations in DBP expression or function can impact circadian regulation, potentially affecting sleep disorders and mood disorders (Schrem2004LiverEnriched; Ripperger2000CLOCK).

DBP is also associated with hematopoietic disorders. It is implicated in the regulation of erythropoiesis and may play a role in conditions like polycythemia vera, where it is involved in oxygen sensing and erythropoietin expression (SethuNarayanan2011Role). DBP's interaction with elastase and its regulation of angiotensinogen may contribute to cyclic neutropenia and other hematopoietic disorders (SethuNarayanan2011Role).

In the context of detoxification, DBP, along with other PAR bZip transcription factors, regulates genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Mice lacking these proteins show increased sensitivity to drugs and xenobiotics, suggesting that DBP alterations could lead to increased drug toxicity and related health issues (Gachon2006The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DBP in various health conditions.

## Interactions
The D-box binding PAR bZIP transcription factor (DBP) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. DBP forms homo- and heterodimers with other members of the proline and acidic-rich (PAR) protein family, such as hepatic leukemia factor (HLF). These interactions are crucial for the transactivation of promoters of blood coagulation factors like Factor VIII and Factor IX, with increased binding of HLF-DBP heterodimers to promoter sites (Schrem2004LiverEnriched; Begbie1999Enhanced). The transactivation by DBP is mediated by the p300 coactivator, with the PAR domain being essential for this activation (Schrem2004LiverEnriched).

DBP's expression is subject to circadian regulation, with its levels oscillating in a circadian manner in hepatocytes and neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. CLOCK, a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS protein, regulates DBP transcription by binding to E-box motifs within enhancer regions of the DBP gene, suggesting a direct connection to the circadian feedback circuitry (Schrem2004LiverEnriched). DBP also interacts with specific DNA sequences, binding to consensus DNA recognition sequences as homo- or heterodimers, similar to C/EBP family members (Schrem2004LiverEnriched). These interactions highlight DBP's role in controlling circadian outputs and affecting the expression of liver genes such as steroid 15α hydroxylase (CYP2a4) and coumarin 7 hydroxylase (CYP2a5) (Schrem2004LiverEnriched).
