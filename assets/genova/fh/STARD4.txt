# STARD4

## Overview
STARD4 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 4, which is a member of the START (StAR-related lipid transfer) domain family. This protein is categorized as a soluble sterol transport protein and plays a pivotal role in the intracellular transport of cholesterol, contributing to the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis within cells. The STARD4 protein is characterized by a single sterol-binding domain that facilitates the non-vesicular transfer of cholesterol between cellular membranes, particularly between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Maxfield2016Role; Iaea2020Stable). Its structural features, including a conserved alpha-helix/beta-grip fold and a hydrophobic pocket, are essential for its function in sterol binding and transport (Tan2019Structural). The gene's expression and the protein's activity are implicated in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer progression and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular lipid regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Soccio2002The; Zhang2020STARD4).

## Structure
The human STARD4 protein is characterized by a single sterol-binding domain composed of 205 amino acids. It features a conserved alpha-helix/beta-grip fold with a deep hydrophobic pocket, essential for its function in sterol transport (Tan2019Structural). The tertiary structure of STARD4 reveals a single α/β domain with a 10-stranded U-shaped β-sheet flanked by long α-helices. The sterol-binding pocket is centrally located, with a cavity volume slightly larger than that of cholesterol, indicating its role in sterol binding and transport (Tan2019Structural).

The protein's structure includes a U1-loop that acts as a lid for the hydrophobic pocket, which is crucial for sterol binding. This loop contains hydrophobic residues that form contacts with helix a4, closing the tunnel entrance (Tan2019Structural). The conformational dynamics of STARD4 involve significant changes in the H4-Ω1 gate and β8-β9 corridor, which are essential for cholesterol binding and release (Xie2023Allosterically).

STARD4 does not have a quaternary structure involving multiple subunits, as it is composed of a single START domain. The protein's interaction with membranes and its role in sterol transport are influenced by specific conformational states and structural motifs (Xie2023Allosterically).

## Function
STARD4 is a soluble sterol transport protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in healthy human cells. It facilitates the non-vesicular transport of cholesterol between cellular membranes, particularly between the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Maxfield2016Role; Iaea2020Stable). This transport is essential for regulating cholesterol distribution and ensuring proper lipid homeostasis within cells (Iaea2020Stable).

STARD4 is involved in the rapid equilibration of sterol between membranes, especially those with anionic lipid headgroups, which is crucial for maintaining the biophysical properties of cell membranes (Maxfield2016Role). The protein's activity is influenced by the lipid composition of membranes, with anionic lipids like phosphatidylinositol biphosphates enhancing its cholesterol transfer activity (Talandashti2023Membrane).

In the ER, STARD4's function likely increases cholesterol ester synthesis by activating acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity, which converts cholesterol to cholesterol esters (Clark2020The). This process is important for suppressing ER cholesterol sensing and maintaining cellular lipid balance (Clark2020The). Despite its significant role, STARD4 knockout mice do not exhibit a clear phenotype, suggesting compensatory mechanisms may exist (Iaea2020Stable).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STARD4 gene have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. High levels of STARD4 expression are associated with shorter distant metastasis-free survival times in breast cancer patients, particularly in those with ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-positive subtypes (Zhang2020STARD4; Asif2021STARD3:). The gene appears to promote breast cancer cell malignancy by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle progression while reducing apoptosis (Zhang2020STARD4). Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing STARD4 expression can suppress tumor growth and cell migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020STARD4).

STARD4 is also involved in cholesterol homeostasis, and its dysregulation may contribute to metabolic disorders. Although the specific clinical significance of STARD4 mutations is not well-documented, its role in cholesterol transport suggests that alterations could impact conditions like atherosclerosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Soccio2002The; Maxfield2016Role). The gene's regulation by sterols and its involvement in lipid-related signaling pathways further highlight its potential impact on disease development (Clark2011The).

## Interactions
STARD4, a sterol transfer protein, is involved in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and interacts with various lipid components and membranes. It does not have a specific subcellular localization motif, which allows it to be distributed throughout the cytosol and transiently interact with organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) (Maxfield2016Role). The protein's interaction with membranes is influenced by the presence of anionic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), which modulate its activity (Maxfield2016Role; Xie2023Allosterically).

STARD4's binding to membranes is facilitated by specific structural motifs, including the β1 and β2 strands and the Ω1, Ω2, and Ω4 loops, with the Ω4 loop playing a significant role in anchoring the protein to the membrane (Talandashti2023Membrane). The protein's interaction with cholesterol involves two distinct binding modes within its hydrophobic pocket, which are crucial for its function in cholesterol uptake and release (Xie2023Allosterically). These interactions are part of an allosteric network that coordinates cholesterol binding and the movement of structural motifs, similar to cholesterol-binding LAM protein complexes (Xie2023Allosterically).
