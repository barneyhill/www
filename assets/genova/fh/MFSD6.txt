# MFSD6

## Overview
MFSD6 (major facilitator superfamily domain containing 6) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), a large group of membrane proteins known for their role in transporting small solutes across cellular membranes. The MFSD6 protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane segments, a hallmark of MFS proteins, and is primarily expressed in neuronal cells, particularly excitatory neurons (Bagchi2020Probable; Perland2017Characteristics). While the specific substrates and transport mechanisms of MFSD6 remain to be fully elucidated, it is presumed to play a role in cellular nutrient uptake and waste removal, contributing to metabolic homeostasis. The gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential role in cancer prognosis and metabolic processes, although its precise functions and pathways in human health and disease are still under investigation (Chiu2018FBXL7; Ceder2020Glucose).

## Structure
The MFSD6 protein is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and is characterized by a typical MFS structure with 12 transmembrane segments (TMS) (Bagchi2020Probable; Perland2017Characteristics). Both the N and C terminals of MFSD6 are located intracellularly, and the protein features a classical MFS fold between TMS 6 and 7 (Bagchi2020Probable). The protein has a relatively long amino acid sequence, consisting of 791 residues, and includes a significant extracellular loop between TMS 3 and 4 (Perland2017Characteristics).

The tertiary structure of MFSD6 suggests the formation of a pore, which is typical for substrate transport in MFS proteins (Bagchi2020Probable). Structural predictions and homology models indicate that MFSD6 has a GMQE value of 0.27, reflecting the quality of the model used for its 3D structure (Bagchi2020Probable). The protein is expressed in neuronal cells, particularly in excitatory neurons, and is not found in astrocytes (Bagchi2020Probable). MFSD6 is phylogenetically related to other MFS proteins, such as MFSD8 and MFSD10, and shares a close evolutionary relationship with some members of the human Solute Carrier (SLC) transporter family (Bagchi2020Probable).

## Function
MFSD6 (major facilitator superfamily domain containing 6) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, which is involved in the transport of small solutes across cell membranes. Proteins in this superfamily typically function as transporters, facilitating the movement of molecules such as ions, sugars, and metabolites. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting various metabolic processes. Although the specific role and molecular mechanisms of MFSD6 in human cells are not fully characterized, it is presumed to participate in similar transport activities within the cell. The protein likely contributes to the regulation of intracellular concentrations of various solutes, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal health. The precise substrates and pathways involving MFSD6 remain to be elucidated, but its function as a transporter suggests a significant role in cellular nutrient uptake and waste removal, impacting overall metabolic efficiency and cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
The MFSD6 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are not well-documented. In ovarian cancer, high levels of MFSD6 transcripts are associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in patients receiving post-operative taxol adjuvant therapy. This association was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression tests, indicating that MFSD6, along with FBXL7, correlates with poor survival outcomes in these patients (Chiu2018FBXL7).

In the context of glucose metabolism, MFSD6 expression is affected by glucose availability. Studies in mice cortex cell cultures and Drosophila melanogaster have shown that glucose starvation can alter the expression of MFSD6, suggesting its potential role in metabolic processes. However, the exact implications of these changes in human diseases remain unclear (Ceder2020Glucose).

Additionally, an epigenome-wide association study identified DNA methylation loci within MFSD6 that are associated with handgrip strength in Chinese monozygotic twins. This suggests that epigenetic modifications of MFSD6 may influence muscle strength, although the clinical significance of this finding requires further investigation (Luo2024Epigenomewide).
