# BEST4

## Overview
BEST4 is a gene that encodes the protein bestrophin 4, a member of the bestrophin family of anion channels. These channels are primarily involved in the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining ion homeostasis and fluid balance within epithelial cells. Bestrophin 4 is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the colon and small intestine, where it contributes to the absorptive functions of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (Ito2013LineageSpecific). The protein is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain with transmembrane regions, indicative of its role as a transmembrane channel, and a variable C-terminal domain that may modulate its function (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction). Beyond its physiological roles, BEST4 has clinical significance in gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels are linked to disease progression and patient prognosis (Serigado2022Ulcerative; Wang2022Uncovering).

## Structure
The BEST4 protein is a member of the bestrophin family of anion channels, characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain and a variable C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain includes putative transmembrane regions and shares 56-66% sequence identity with other human bestrophins, indicating a high level of conservation across species (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction). The C-terminal domain, however, is highly variable and shows minimal homology with other bestrophins, suggesting a potential role in modulating the protein's function or interactions (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction).

The primary structure of BEST4 consists of 474 amino acids, confirmed through cDNA assembly from human testis and fetal brain (Tsunenari2003StructureFunction). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of BEST4 are not provided, insights can be drawn from the structural characteristics of other bestrophin family members. For instance, Best1, another bestrophin, forms a pentameric assembly with each subunit crossing the membrane four times, primarily as α-helices (Kane2014Structure). This structural feature may be relevant to understanding the potential architecture of BEST4, given their shared family characteristics. However, detailed structural information specific to BEST4 remains limited.

## Function
BEST4 (bestrophin 4) is a member of the bestrophin family of anion channels, primarily involved in chloride ion transport across cell membranes. It is expressed in epithelial cells, particularly in the colon and small intestine, where it contributes to maintaining ion homeostasis and fluid balance. BEST4 is identified as an absorptive cell-specific gene expressed in both the small intestine and the colon, playing a role in the absorptive function of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (Ito2013LineageSpecific). It is associated with the regulation of ion transport and absorption processes, contributing to the maintenance of intestinal fluid homeostasis (Ito2013LineageSpecific).

BEST4-positive IECs are post-mitotic and do not co-express markers for secretory lineage cells, indicating a specific expression in absorptive cells (Ito2013LineageSpecific). The expression of BEST4 is stable even under pathological conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, suggesting its role in maintaining absorptive cell function in both healthy and diseased states (Ito2013LineageSpecific). BEST4 is also involved in setting colonic epithelial cGMP tone in response to luminal pH, indicating its role in pH sensing and electrolyte transportation (Parikh2019Colonic).

## Clinical Significance
The BEST4 gene has been implicated in several gastrointestinal conditions, particularly ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In the context of UC, studies have shown varying results regarding the number and function of BEST4+ cells. The Broad study reported a reduction in these cells in UC, while the Oxford study found stable numbers. Despite these differences, both studies noted changes in gene expression associated with UC, suggesting that BEST4+ cells may play a role in maintaining host protective functions during the disease (Serigado2022Ulcerative).

In colorectal cancer, the expression of BEST4 is significantly decreased in colon tumors, colon adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, and CRC. This downregulation is associated with a negative impact on the survival probability of CRC patients post-surgery, indicating that BEST4 may have prognostic value. BEST4 is among the top down-regulated genes in CRC, and its expression level is linked to patient survival time, suggesting its involvement in CRC development (Wang2022Uncovering). The diagnostic potential of BEST4 in CRC is supported by ROC curve analyses, which show its significant diagnostic value (Wang2022Uncovering).

## Interactions
BEST4 interacts with several proteins to play a role in the suppression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer cells. It interacts with the transcription factor Hes4, both at transcriptional and translational levels, to regulate its own expression and function. Hes4 binds to the promoter region of BEST4, enhancing its expression, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase assays (Wang2023Bestrophin4). 

BEST4 also interacts with Twist1, a key regulator of EMT. This interaction occurs in the nucleus and is crucial for the downregulation of Twist1, which leads to the suppression of EMT. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between BEST4 and Twist1, and nuclear colocalization has been observed (Wang2023Bestrophin4). The interaction between BEST4 and Twist1 is independent of BEST4's channel function, indicating a specific regulatory role in EMT suppression (Wang2023Bestrophin4). 

These interactions form a regulatory axis involving Hes4, BEST4, and Twist1, which is significant in countering EMT and potentially inhibiting colorectal cancer progression (Wang2023Bestrophin4).
