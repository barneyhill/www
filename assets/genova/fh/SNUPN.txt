# SNUPN

## Overview
The SNUPN gene encodes the protein snurportin 1 (SPN1), a nuclear import adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in the transport of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) into the nucleus. SPN1 is characterized by its Importin β binding (IBB) domain and trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap-binding domain, which facilitate its function in RNA processing and nuclear import (Mitrousis2008Molecular; Nashabat2024SNUPN). The protein is involved in the formation of oligomeric complexes, which are essential for its function and stability (Nashabat2024SNUPN). SNUPN is highly expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and the cerebral cortex, underscoring its importance in these areas (Nashabat2024SNUPN). Mutations in the SNUPN gene have been associated with a recessive form of muscular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

## Structure
The SNUPN gene encodes the snurportin 1 (SPN1) protein, which is composed of 360 amino acids and includes two key domains: the Importin β binding (IBB) domain and the trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap-binding domain (Nashabat2024SNUPN). The IBB domain is located at the N-terminus and is crucial for the nuclear import of uridine-rich ribonucleoproteins by recruiting importin β (Mitrousis2008Molecular). This domain is bipartite, with two distinct binding determinants for importin β, spanning residues 1-65 (Mitrousis2008Molecular).

The C-terminal region of SPN1 is essential for its cellular localization and oligomerization, containing an alpha helix between Gly303 and Glu322, which is crucial for SPN1 self-interaction (Nashabat2024SNUPN). Pathogenic variants in this region can disrupt the protein's function, leading to muscular dystrophy (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

SPN1 can form homo-dimers or tetramers in the cytoplasm, as indicated by the presence of stable oligomeric complexes (Nashabat2024SNUPN). The protein is also involved in the nuclear export process, where it interacts with CRM1 and RanGTP, with the m3G cap-binding domain playing a significant role in this interaction (Monecke2009Crystal).

## Function
SNUPN (snurportin 1) is a crucial protein in the nuclear import of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing in healthy human cells. SNUPN functions as an import adaptor by binding to the trimethylguanosine cap (m3G cap) and Importin-β1 (Imp-β1), forming the snRNP import complex necessary for transporting snRNPs into the nucleus. This transport is vital for spliceosome assembly in Cajal bodies, where SNUPN plays a role in spliceosomal maturation and mRNA splicing (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

In the cytoplasm, SNUPN oligomerizes, forming higher-order complexes such as homo-dimers or tetramers, which are essential for its function. These oligomeric forms are resistant to dissociation by SDS but can be disrupted by DTT, indicating covalent linkages (Nashabat2024SNUPN). The C-terminal domain of SNUPN is critical for its oligomerization and function, with pathogenic variants in this region leading to impaired oligomerization and function (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

SNUPN is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and the cerebral cortex, indicating its fundamental role in these tissues. It ensures the proper localization and function of cellular components, maintaining normal levels and localization of the SPN1 protein (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SNUPN gene, which encodes the SNURPORTIN-1 protein, have been linked to a recessive form of muscular dystrophy. This condition is characterized by RNA mis-splicing and extracellular matrix (ECM) dysregulation, leading to muscle weakness and elevated serum creatinine kinase levels. Patients often present with proximal muscular weakness, abnormal muscle fibers, and increased endomysium thickness, indicative of fibrosis (Nashabat2024SNUPN). The mutations predominantly occur in the C-terminal region of the SNUPN gene, affecting the protein's ability to oligomerize, which is crucial for its function in spliceosomal maturation (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

The clinical manifestations of SNUPN mutations extend beyond muscular dystrophy, with patients also experiencing extramuscular symptoms such as neurodegeneration and cataracts. These symptoms are attributed to the disruption of ECM-cytoskeleton crosstalk and defective snRNP biogenesis, which are essential for muscle homeostasis and function (Nashabat2024SNUPN). The severity of the disease correlates with the type of SNUPN mutation, with protein-truncating variants leading to more severe phenotypes (Nashabat2024SNUPN). Understanding these molecular mechanisms highlights potential therapeutic targets for treating muscular dystrophies associated with SNUPN mutations (Nashabat2024SNUPN).

## Interactions
SNUPN (snurportin 1) is a nuclear import adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) into the nucleus. It interacts with the trimethylguanosine (m3G) cap of U snRNAs, which is essential for its function in RNA processing and nuclear import (KuhnHolsken2010Mapping). SNUPN binds directly to importin-β through its N-terminal importin β binding (sIBB) domain, facilitating the nuclear import of U snRNPs (Mitrousis2008Molecular).

SNUPN also interacts with CRM1, a nuclear export receptor, forming a trimeric complex with CRM1 and RanGTP. This interaction is crucial for the recycling of SNUPN to the cytoplasm after it has delivered its cargo to the nucleus (Paraskeva1999CRM1-mediated). The binding of SNUPN to CRM1 is mutually exclusive with its binding to the m3G-cap, indicating a regulatory mechanism that controls SNUPN's affinity for its import substrate during nuclear entry and reexport (Paraskeva1999CRM1-mediated).

In the context of the U1 snRNP complex, SNUPN interacts with the Sm proteins B and D3, as well as with stem-loop III of U1 snRNA, highlighting its role in the spatial arrangement and mutual orientation of components within the complex (KuhnHolsken2010Mapping). These interactions underscore SNUPN's multifaceted role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and RNA processing.
