# MYBBP1A

## Overview
MYBBP1A is a gene that encodes the MYB binding protein 1a, a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and cell cycle control. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several domains that facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization within the nucleus and nucleolus (Keough2003Mybbinding). MYB binding protein 1a acts as a co-repressor in transcriptional regulation and is involved in the negative regulation of rRNA gene transcription, playing a critical role in ribosomal RNA processing (Hochstatter2012Mybbinding). It also participates in cellular stress responses, particularly through its interaction with the tumor suppressor p53, and is implicated in the regulation of myogenic differentiation (Yang2012Epigenetic). Clinically, alterations in MYBBP1A expression have been associated with various cancers, where it can influence tumorigenesis and response to therapies (Hsieh2020Growth; Weng2019Targeting).

## Structure
MYBBP1A is a nuclear protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a central acidic domain, two putative leucine zipper-like motifs, and several potential leucine charged domain (LCD) sequences. The carboxyl terminus of MYBBP1A is rich in proline and serine and features seven short basic amino acid sequences crucial for its nuclear and nucleolar localization (Keough2003Mybbinding). These structural features are important for its interaction with importin-α/β, facilitating nuclear import (Keough2003Mybbinding).

MYBBP1A also contains leucine-rich motifs that resemble nuclear export signals (NESs), which are involved in its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Notably, NES 4 and NES 5 are identified as significant for its nuclear export, with NES 4 acting as a CRM1-dependent export sequence (Keough2003Mybbinding). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase, with serine 1303 being a major phosphorylation site (Perrera2010Identification).

MYBBP1A interacts with various transcription factors and is involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a co-repressor on the Per2 promoter (Hara2008Molecular). The protein's structure and modifications suggest a role in both nuclear transport and transcriptional regulation.

## Function
MYBBP1A (MYB binding protein 1a) is a nuclear protein that plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis and rRNA metabolism. It is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it interacts with RNA Polymerase I and various ribosomal proteins, acting as a negative regulator of rRNA gene transcription and being essential for the correct processing of pre-rRNA (Hochstatter2012Mybbinding). MYBBP1A is involved in the processing of the 47 S precursor rRNA into mature rRNAs, including 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S rRNAs, and is associated with pre-ribosomal complexes (Hochstatter2012Mybbinding).

The protein also plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and differentiation. It is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Aurora B, which is crucial for mitosis progression and spindle assembly (FelipeAbrio2020The; Perrera2010Identification). MYBBP1A is involved in activating the tumor suppressor p53 in response to nucleolar stress, indicating its involvement in cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Hochstatter2012Mybbinding). Additionally, MYBBP1A acts as a co-repressor in the regulation of myogenic genes, maintaining a repressive state that antagonizes MyoD-mediated transcriptional activation, which is important for muscle differentiation (Yang2012Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the MYBBP1A gene have been implicated in various cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), hemizygous loss of MYBBP1A due to chromosomal 17p deletion is common. This partial loss promotes tumorigenesis, while complete loss impairs cell growth. MYBBP1A hemizygous tumors are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, which can reduce tumor size and impair cell growth (Hsieh2020Growth).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MYBBP1A is overexpressed, correlating with poor survival outcomes. Its suppression inhibits cell proliferation and migration by affecting the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting MYBBP1A as a potential therapeutic target (Weng2019Targeting).

MYBBP1A also plays a role in renal cancer, where its downregulation leads to a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, enhancing tumorigenic properties under low-glucose conditions. This switch is associated with the activation of PGC1a and c-MYB, indicating MYBBP1A's involvement in metabolic regulation (Felipe‐Abrio2019c‐MYB‐).

In head and neck cancer, specifically oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, low MYBBP1A expression is linked to poor prognosis and increased radioresistance, highlighting its role in cancer progression (George2015Regulation).

## Interactions
MYBBP1A (MYB binding protein 1a) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with TPPII and CDK2, forming a protein-protein interaction network that is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. These interactions have been confirmed using in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation assays in cell lines such as HEK293 and HeLa (Nahálková2014TPPII).

MYBBP1A is also a substrate for Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates it during mitosis, affecting mitotic progression and spindle assembly. This interaction is essential for proper cell division and has been demonstrated through mass spectrometry and RNA interference studies (Perrera2010Identification).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, MYBBP1A acts as a co-repressor of NF-kB by binding to the RelA/p65 complex, thereby inhibiting NF-kB transcriptional activity. It also interacts with p53, stabilizing its tetramer formation and promoting acetylation, which enhances p53 transcriptional activity (Nahálková2016The).

MYBBP1A interacts with SIRT7, inhibiting histone H3 deacetylation, and with SIRT6, a tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair and metabolism (Nahálková2016The). These interactions highlight MYBBP1A's role in regulating cellular senescence, aging, and tumorigenesis.
