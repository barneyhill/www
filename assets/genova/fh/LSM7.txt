# LSM7

## Overview
LSM7 is a gene that encodes the LSM7 protein, a crucial component of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes involved in RNA processing and degradation. The LSM7 protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a significant role in mRNA decay and splicing processes. It is integral to the formation and function of these complexes, which are essential for the regulation of gene expression through mRNA degradation and processing. The Lsm1-7 complex is primarily associated with mRNA decay in the cytoplasm, while the Lsm2-8 complex is involved in nuclear splicing activities, particularly interacting with U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (Montemayor2020Molecular; Derksen2021Variants). Variants in the LSM7 gene can disrupt these processes, leading to neurodevelopmental issues and contributing to various diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders (Xia2021Dysregulated; Derksen2021Variants). The protein's interactions with other Lsm proteins and RNA molecules underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular RNA homeostasis (FromontRacine2000GenomeWide).

## Structure
The LSM7 protein is a component of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, which are involved in RNA processing and degradation. The primary structure of LSM7 includes highly conserved amino acid residues, with specific variants such as p.Asp41Asn and p.Arg69Pro identified as potentially deleterious (Derksen2021Variants). The secondary structure of LSM7 is characterized by a five-stranded beta-sheet, with beta strands composed of residues 33-40, 43-54, 57-67, 80-89, and 93-98 (Wu2012Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, LSM7 lacks an N-terminal alpha helix, which is a common feature in other Lsm proteins (Wu2012Crystal). The quaternary structure involves LSM7 forming part of a hexameric ring in the SpLsm5/6/7 complex, where it interacts with Lsm5 and Lsm6, although the interaction with Lsm6 is weaker (Wu2012Crystal). LSM7 is also part of the heteroheptameric Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes, which have distinct cellular functions related to mRNA decay and splicing (Montemayor2020Molecular). The protein's role in these complexes is crucial for their assembly and function, as variants in LSM7 can impair complex formation and lead to neurodevelopmental issues (Derksen2021Variants).

## Function
The LSM7 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the LSM1-7 and LSM2-8 complexes, which are involved in mRNA decay and splicing processes in human cells. These complexes play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating mRNA degradation and processing. The LSM1-7 complex is primarily associated with mRNA decay in the cytoplasmic processing bodies, enhancing decapping in the 5'-3' pathway, a crucial step in mRNA degradation (Derksen2021Variants). The LSM2-8 complex, on the other hand, is localized in the nucleus and interacts with U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), acting as a chaperone to support its rearrangements during splicing and recycling following the spliceosome reaction (Derksen2021Variants).

LSM7 is essential for the assembly of these complexes and their interaction with mRNA decay factors like PATL1 and EDC4, as well as splicing factors such as PRPF3, PRPF4, SART3, and SNRNP200. These interactions are crucial for the formation of the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP complex, a precursor in the major spliceosome reaction (Derksen2021Variants). Mutations in LSM7 can lead to defects in complex assembly, resulting in impaired mRNA processing and splicing, which are vital for maintaining normal cellular function (Derksen2021Variants).

## Clinical Significance
LSM7 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is significantly overexpressed in several cancer types, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and others, compared to normal tissues (Ye2022Comprehensive). In breast cancer, high expression levels of LSM7 are associated with poor prognostic outcomes, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.54 for recurrence-free survival (Ta2021Potential). Similarly, in gastric cancer, LSM7 is identified as a hub gene, although it does not show significant differences in expression between chemoresistant and sensitive groups (Liu2023Identification).

In neurological and psychiatric disorders, LSM7 is one of the differentially expressed spliceosome genes shared by multiple conditions, suggesting its role in the aberrant mRNA splicing process common to these disorders (Xia2021Dysregulated). The gene's expression is also linked to cancer progression, with lower expression levels correlating with better survival outcomes in several cancer types, such as adrenocortical carcinoma and bladder urothelial carcinoma (Ye2022Comprehensive). These findings highlight LSM7's potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its involvement in disease mechanisms related to RNA processing.

## Interactions
LSM7 is a component of the Lsm1-7 complex, which is involved in mRNA decapping and degradation. This complex forms a heptameric ring structure, with LSM7 specifically interacting with Lsm5 and Lsm4 to stabilize the assembly (Zhou2014Crystal). LSM7 also plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing by interacting with U6 snRNA. It maintains contact with U6 RNA as it is incorporated into various snRNP complexes, including U6 snRNPs, U4/U6 di-snRNPs, and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs (VIDAL1999Characterization). 

In stress granule (SG) formation, LSM7 forms phase-separated condensates that promote the nucleation of Pab1, a known SG marker. These condensates enhance Pab1 droplet formation, suggesting that LSM7 may substitute Pab1-RNA interactions with LSM7-RNA interactions or strong LSM7-Pab1 condensate interactions (Lindström2022Lsm7). LSM7's interaction with RNA is crucial for its function, as it co-localizes with RNA in vivo and requires non-translating mRNA to form foci (Lindström2022Lsm7). 

LSM7 also interacts with other Lsm proteins, such as Lsm8 and Prp24, a protein associated with U6 snRNA, indicating its involvement in the U6-associated complex (FromontRacine2000GenomeWide). These interactions highlight LSM7's role in RNA processing and stress response mechanisms.
