# RFPL4AL1

## Overview
RFPL4AL1 (ret finger protein like 4A like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and regulation within cells. The protein encoded by RFPL4AL1 is thought to possess ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, similar to other members of the RFPL family, which plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by tagging proteins for degradation. While the specific functions and cellular localization of the RFPL4AL1 protein remain to be fully characterized, it is hypothesized to be involved in essential biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development. These functions suggest that RFPL4AL1 may have significant roles in normal cellular activities and organismal development (Ferreira2021Genomic; AzotlaVilchis2021Transcriptome).

## Structure


## Function
RFPL4AL1 (ret finger protein like 4A like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in various cellular processes. Proteins in the RFPL family, including RFPL4AL1, are often associated with ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation. This activity is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a pathway that tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein levels and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Although the specific functions of RFPL4AL1 in healthy human cells are not well-characterized, it is likely that RFPL4AL1 participates in similar pathways as other RFPL proteins, influencing cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development. These processes are essential for normal cellular function and organismal development, suggesting that RFPL4AL1 may play a role in these critical biological activities. The precise molecular activities of RFPL4AL1 and its specific cellular localization remain to be fully elucidated, but its potential involvement in ubiquitin-protein ligase activity indicates a significant role in maintaining cellular protein balance and function.

## Clinical Significance
The RFPL4AL1 gene has been identified as significantly upregulated in the human glioblastoma cell line AHOL1, with a fold change of 55.87, suggesting its potential involvement in glioblastoma pathology (Ferreira2021Genomic). This upregulation indicates that alterations in RFPL4AL1 expression may contribute to the aggressive nature of glioblastoma, although the specific mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The study by Ferreira et al. highlights the gene's significant differential expression, which could be linked to the regulation and metabolism processes associated with cancer progression (Ferreira2021Genomic).

In another study, RFPL4AL1 was noted as differentially expressed in an inducible glial cell model of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), with a fold change of 2.93, indicating its potential role in the altered gene expression regulation observed in this condition (AzotlaVilchis2021Transcriptome). These findings suggest that RFPL4AL1 may be involved in various cellular processes that, when dysregulated, could contribute to disease states. However, the precise clinical implications of RFPL4AL1 mutations or expression changes in these and other conditions require further investigation to establish definitive associations and mechanisms.
