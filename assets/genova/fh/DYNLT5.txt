# DYNLT5

## Overview
DYNLT5 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain Tctex-type family member 5, which is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and is integral to retrograde intracellular transport along microtubules. The dynein light chain Tctex-type family member 5 is involved in critical cellular processes such as organelle positioning, vesicle trafficking, and mitotic spindle organization, contributing to cellular homeostasis and division. It is particularly active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and motility, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating movement. The expression of DYNLT5 in endothelial cells suggests its involvement in vascular biology, although it is not expressed in muscle fibers, indicating a potentially indirect role in muscle tissue (NievesRodriguez2023Transcriptomic; McInnis2023Unravelling).

## Function
DYNLT5, or dynein light chain Tctex-type family member 5, is a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, which is a motor protein responsible for retrograde intracellular transport along microtubules. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including organelle positioning, vesicle trafficking, and mitotic spindle organization. DYNLT5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell division.

In healthy human cells, DYNLT5 is associated with cellular adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cellular motility. These functions are essential for the structural integrity and movement of cells, impacting processes such as tissue development and repair. The protein's involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics suggests a role in the organization and stability of the cytoskeleton, which is vital for cell shape and intracellular transport (McInnis2023Unravelling).

DYNLT5 is expressed in endothelial cells, indicating its potential involvement in vascular biology and endothelial cell function. However, its expression is not detected in fast or slow muscle fibers, suggesting that its role in muscle tissue may be indirect or mediated through other cell types (NievesRodriguez2023Transcriptomic).
