# ALG10

## Overview
ALG10 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ALG10 alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase, which is integral to the N-linked glycosylation pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is classified as a glucosyltransferase and is responsible for the addition of the third glucose residue to lipid-linked oligosaccharides, a critical step in the dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation process. This modification is essential for the proper folding and stability of glycoproteins within the endoplasmic reticulum. The ALG10 gene's function is crucial for maintaining protein structure and function, and its activity is highly conserved across eukaryotic species (Xu2022A; Burda1998The). Mutations in ALG10 have been associated with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Courage2021Progressive).

## Structure
ALG10 (ALG10 alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase) is an enzyme involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, where it plays a crucial role by adding glucose residues to lipid-linked oligosaccharides. The primary structure of ALG10 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the ALG10 gene. This sequence determines the protein's specific function and interaction with other molecules.

The secondary structure of ALG10 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and folding. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This folding allows ALG10 to form specific domains that are responsible for its function in the glycosylation process.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, can influence the function of ALG10, potentially affecting its enzymatic activity and interactions with other cellular components. The existence of splice variant isoforms of ALG10 may lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing the enzyme to perform its role under various cellular conditions. These isoforms can result in differences in the protein's structure, which may impact its activity and regulation within the glycosylation pathway.

## Function
The ALG10 gene encodes an alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a process essential for protein folding and stability in the endoplasmic reticulum of healthy human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of the third glucose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, a critical step in the dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation pathway. This modification is necessary for the proper N-glycosylation of proteins, ensuring that glycoproteins are correctly formed and function properly (Courage2021Progressive).

The ALG10 enzyme's activity is vital for the efficient recognition and transfer of oligosaccharides to nascent polypeptide chains by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex. This process occurs at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly conserved across eukaryotic cells (Burda1998The). The presence of the terminal glucose added by ALG10 is crucial for substrate recognition, and its absence can lead to hypoglycosylation of proteins, affecting their stability and function (Burda1998The). In humans, the ALG10 gene's function is primarily related to protein glycosylation and quality control, maintaining proper protein structure and function (Xu2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG10 gene have been implicated in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), a group of rare, genetically heterogeneous disorders characterized by frequent myoclonus, rare tonic-clonic seizures, ataxia, and mild cognitive dysfunction (Courage2021Progressive). A specific homozygous frameshift variant, c.1170_1171delAA (p.Lys391Valfs*35), was identified in an individual with PME, initially considered of uncertain significance due to the lack of prior disease association (Courage2021Progressive). Functional studies demonstrated hypo-glycosylation of reporter proteins ICAM1 and LAMP1 in fibroblasts, indicating a defect in alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase activity, which supports the pathogenicity of the ALG10 variant (Courage2021Progressive). Despite this evidence, the variant was classified as disease-causing with moderate confidence due to its detection in only one individual with PME (Courage2021Progressive).

The role of ALG10 in PME is further supported by its involvement in the dolichol-dependent protein glycosylation pathway, which is crucial for proper protein folding and function. Mutations in this pathway can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, affecting various biological processes and contributing to the PME phenotype (Courage2021Progressive). Further studies are needed to establish ALG10 as a definitive disease gene for PME (Courage2021Progressive).
