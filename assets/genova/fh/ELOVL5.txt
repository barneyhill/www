# ELOVL5

## Overview
ELOVL5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5, which is integral to the biosynthesis of very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) by elongating fatty acid chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is part of a family of elongases characterized by their role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the elongation of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, which are crucial for maintaining cellular membrane fluidity and function (Morais2009Highly; Nikulin2023ELOVL5). The ELOVL5 protein is a transmembrane enzyme with seven helical domains, and its activity is essential for regulating mitochondrial homeostasis and reactive oxygen species levels within cells (Centenera2021ELOVL5; Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). Mutations in the ELOVL5 gene, such as the p.G230V variant, are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia 38 (SCA38), a neurodegenerative disorder, highlighting the clinical significance of this gene in human health (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar; Di2014ELOVL5).

## Structure
The ELOVL5 protein is a long-chain fatty acyl-CoA elongase located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. It is characterized by seven transmembrane helical domains (TM1-TM7) and six intervening loops (Loop 1-Loop 6), which are typical for this family of proteins (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). The protein includes a His motif (HxxHH) catalytic site crucial for its enzymatic function and two cysteine residues, C96 and C225, that form an intramolecular disulfide bond connecting Loop 2 and Loop 6 (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). This disulfide bond is specific to elongases and contributes to substrate specificity (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

The ELOVL5 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at three putative sites (T281, S283, S285), which regulate its activity and stability (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). The G230V mutation in ELOVL5, associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 38 (SCA38), causes a positional shift in Loop 6, affecting the disulfide bond length and protein stability, leading to ER stress (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). Despite these structural changes, the enzymatic activity of the mutant ELOVL5 remains normal, although its localization is altered (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

## Function
The ELOVL5 gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the elongation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically those with a chain length of more than 16 carbons. This enzyme is part of a family of elongases responsible for adding carbon units to the carboxyl terminal of fatty acid chains, a process essential for synthesizing very long-chain fatty acids (Centenera2021ELOVL5). ELOVL5 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells, where it contributes to lipid metabolism by elongating n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, which are important for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell membrane fluidity and function (Morais2009Highly; Nikulin2023ELOVL5).

In healthy human cells, ELOVL5 is involved in the elongation of C20 and C22 PUFAs, which are critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis and proper cellular function. The enzyme's activity is vital for regulating mitochondrial homeostasis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, ensuring that cells do not exceed a cytotoxic ROS threshold, which is crucial for cell survival and function (Centenera2021ELOVL5). ELOVL5 expression is notably high in tissues such as the adrenal glands, testis, and prostate, indicating its significant role in these organs (Centenera2021ELOVL5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELOVL5 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 38 (SCA38), a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder. SCA38 is characterized by symptoms such as gait ataxia, nystagmus, anosmia, and cerebellar atrophy. The disorder is linked to specific mutations like c.689G>T (p.Gly230Val), which affect the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and lead to decreased levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (Di2014ELOVL5). This mutation causes protein mislocalization and accumulation in the Golgi complex, triggering the unfolded protein response and ER stress-induced apoptosis (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

The p.G230V mutation in ELOVL5 is also associated with structural changes in the protein, leading to increased disulphide bond length and altered bond angles, which affect protein stability and function (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). This mutation induces toxic effects due to conformational changes, contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA38 by inducing ER stress and affecting neuronal health (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

Altered expression of ELOVL5 may also impact lipid metabolism, potentially influencing conditions like essential fatty acid deficiency, prostate cancer, and diet-induced obesity (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

## Interactions
ELOVL5, a fatty acid elongase, is involved in the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. It interacts with GOSR2/membrin, a cis-Golgi protein involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking. This interaction is part of the SNARE complex, which is crucial for vesicle fusion, although the physiological significance of ELOVL5 binding to GOSR2 is not fully understood and requires further study (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

The p.G230V variant of ELOVL5, associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 38 (SCA38), leads to protein mislocalization and accumulation in the Golgi complex, triggering the unfolded protein response and ER stress-induced apoptosis. This variant does not affect the catalytic activity of ELOVL5 but causes toxic effects due to conformational changes, impacting protein stability and potentially altering interactions with other proteins (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar).

While ELOVL5 is suggested to form homo- and hetero-oligomers, indicating potential physical interactions with other proteins, specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature (Ferrero2023Spinocerebellar). The study of ELOVL5's interactions is ongoing, with a focus on understanding its role in lipid biosynthesis and its implications in diseases like SCA38.
