# RO60

## Overview
The RO60 gene encodes the Ro60 protein, a Y RNA binding protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA quality control and cellular homeostasis. Ro60 is a component of the Ro ribonucleoprotein complex and is characterized by its ability to bind Y RNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs involved in various cellular processes. The protein is evolutionarily conserved across a wide range of organisms, including most animal cells, some prokaryotic genomes, and archaea (Boccitto2019Ro60). Structurally, Ro60 is defined by a monomeric ring formed by antiparallel α-helical repeats, which facilitates its interaction with RNAs that have protein-free helical regions and single-stranded 3' ends (Boccitto2019Ro60). Functionally, Ro60 is crucial for maintaining RNA integrity by preventing the accumulation of misfolded RNAs and is involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism (Driedonks2019Circulating; Leng2020Noncoding). Clinically, the RO60 gene is significant due to its association with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome, where alterations in Ro60 expression or function can lead to the production of autoantibodies (Bettacchioli2024Association; Boccitto2019Ro60).

## Structure
Ro60, also known as the Y RNA binding protein, is characterized by a monomeric ring structure formed by antiparallel α-helical repeats known as HEAT repeats, which are closed by a von Willebrand factor A domain (vWFA) (Boccitto2019Ro60). This domain includes a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which is involved in ligand binding and conformational changes (Boccitto2019Ro60). The protein's structure allows it to bind RNAs with protein-free helical regions and single-stranded 3' ends, with the single-stranded tail of a misfolded RNA inserting through the central cavity of the Ro60 ring (Boccitto2019Ro60).

Ro60 is a component of the Ro ribonucleoprotein complex and is involved in RNA binding and quality control. It is evolutionarily conserved across most animal cells, some prokaryotic genomes, and archaea (Boccitto2019Ro60). The protein's flexibility is indicated by different conformations in RNA-free, Y RNA-bound, and misfolded RNA-bound states, suggesting it can adapt to different binding partners (Boccitto2019Ro60). Ro60 may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and has splice variant isoforms that can affect its function.

## Function
Ro60, also known as the Y RNA binding protein, is a crucial component of ribonucleoprotein complexes in healthy human cells. It primarily functions in RNA quality control by binding to Y RNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and RNA stability (Driedonks2019Circulating; GREEN1998Binding). Ro60 stabilizes Y RNAs in the cytoplasm and facilitates their nuclear export, playing a significant role in maintaining RNA integrity by preventing the accumulation of misfolded RNAs (Driedonks2019Circulating).

Ro60 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm but can also be found in the nucleus. Its interaction with Y RNAs is essential for the regulation of RNA metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Leng2020Noncoding). In the absence of Y RNAs, Ro60 levels decrease, and its subcellular distribution shifts, with increased presence in the nucleoli, indicating that Y RNAs help retain Ro60 in the cytoplasm (Leng2020Noncoding). Ro60's ability to bind various structured RNA substrates, including misfolded non-coding RNAs, highlights its role in RNA processing and cellular stress responses (Boccitto2019Ro60).

## Clinical Significance
The RO60 gene, encoding the Ro60 protein, is clinically significant due to its association with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome. Alterations in the expression or function of Ro60 can lead to the production of autoantibodies, which are prevalent in these conditions. In SLE, anti-Ro60 antibodies are linked to clinical features like photosensitivity and skin lesions, and they can precede clinical symptoms by several years (Boccitto2019Ro60; Lee2020Identification). In Sjögren's syndrome, the presence of anti-Ro60 antibodies is associated with increased disease severity and earlier onset of symptoms (Bettacchioli2024Association).

Ro60 is also implicated in neonatal lupus, where maternal anti-Ro antibodies can cross the placenta, leading to congenital heart block and skin lesions in newborns (Boccitto2019Ro60). The absence of Ro60 in mice results in a lupus-like syndrome, characterized by the development of autoantibodies and increased sensitivity to UV light, suggesting its protective role against autoimmunity (Xue2003A). These findings underscore the importance of Ro60 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
RO60, also known as Ro60 or TROVE2, is a protein that binds to Y RNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of Y RNAs, playing a role in RNA quality control and autoimmunity. In mouse embryonic stem cells, Y RNAs scaffold the interaction of Ro60 with various proteins, including Mov10, Lrpprc, Igf2bp1/Zbp1, Ssb/La, Ptbp1, Orf1, and Y-box proteins Ybx1 and Ybx3. These interactions are dependent on the presence of Y RNAs, as these proteins are absent in cells lacking Y RNAs (Leng2020Noncoding).

Y RNAs also influence the subcellular distribution of Ro60, primarily keeping it in the cytoplasm by masking a nuclear localization sequence. In the absence of Y RNAs, Ro60 accumulates in nuclear foci, co-localizing with nucleolar markers (Leng2020Noncoding). The binding of Ro60 to Y RNAs is facilitated by specific structural features, such as conserved bulges in the RNA, which are crucial for recognition. The presence of a bulged cytidine is particularly important for binding (GREEN1998Binding).

Ro60's interaction with Y RNAs is also linked to its association with other proteins, such as Ro52 and La, which are part of the Ro ribonucleoprotein complex (Pruijn1991Analysis).
