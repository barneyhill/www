# DNPH1

## Overview
The DNPH1 gene encodes the enzyme 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1, which is a crucial component in the maintenance of nucleotide pool balance within human cells. This enzyme, categorized as a hydrolase, plays a pivotal role in nucleotide sanitization by hydrolyzing hydroxymethyl deoxyuridine monophosphate (hmdUMP) to prevent its incorporation into DNA, thereby safeguarding genomic integrity (Fugger2021Targeting; Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). Structurally, the DNPH1 protein functions as a homodimer, with each monomer adopting a Rossmann-like fold essential for its enzymatic activity (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). The enzyme's activity is vital in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to nucleotide salvage pathways and DNA repair processes, thus playing a significant role in preventing the accumulation of cytotoxic nucleotides (Fugger2021Targeting). DNPH1's involvement in cellular proliferation and nucleotide metabolism has also been linked to various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Amiable2013N6Substituted).

## Structure
The DNPH1 protein, also known as 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1, is characterized by a homodimeric arrangement essential for its enzymatic activity (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). Each monomer of DNPH1 adopts a Rossmann-like fold, consisting of five core β-strands surrounded by five major α-helices (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). The protein structure includes two smaller α-helices, one comprising amino acids 54-59 and another helical extension comprising amino acids 128-133 (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism).

The active site of DNPH1 is formed by the second and third α-helices and the first β-strand, with a catalytic triad consisting of Y24, D80, and E104, which are crucial for its function (Carberry2024Human; Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). The enzyme's quaternary structure is a dimer, which is vital for its biological activity (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism).

The DNPH1 protein also features a shielding loop that precedes the second α-helix, although this region is not conserved and appears highly mobile (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). The helical extension is a conserved region, contributing to the enzyme's structural stability and function (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism).

## Function
The DNPH1 gene encodes the enzyme 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate N-glycosidase, which plays a critical role in nucleotide pool sanitization in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for hydrolyzing hydroxymethyl deoxyuridine monophosphate (hmdUMP) to prevent its incorporation into genomic DNA, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Fugger2021Targeting; Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). DNPH1 operates by removing hmdUMP from the nucleotide pool, which is crucial to avoid a cascade of nucleotide phosphorylation events that could lead to DNA damage and apoptosis (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism).

The enzyme functions through a catalytic mechanism involving key residues such as D80 and E104, which facilitate the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, essential for maintaining nucleotide pool balance (Rzechorzek2023Mechanism). DNPH1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it hydrolyzes deoxynucleoside monophosphates to deoxynucleosides and inorganic phosphate, contributing to nucleotide salvage pathways and DNA repair processes (Fugger2021Targeting).

In healthy human cells, DNPH1's activity is vital for preventing the accumulation of cytotoxic nucleotides, such as hmdU, which can arise from oxidative damage or epigenetic regulation, thus playing a significant role in maintaining genomic integrity (Fugger2021Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DNPH1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. DNPH1 is up-regulated in several types of cancer, making it a potential target for anti-cancer therapies. Its involvement in cellular proliferation and nucleotide metabolism suggests that it may play a role in maintaining a balanced pool of nucleotides or detoxifying modified nucleotides, which is crucial for cancer cell survival (Amiable2013N6Substituted).

In the context of BRCA-deficient cancers, DNPH1 has been identified as a nucleotide sanitizer that hydrolyzes hydroxymethyl-deoxyuridine monophosphate (hmdUMP) to prevent its incorporation into genomic DNA. Inhibition of DNPH1 sensitizes BRCA-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), suggesting a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of PARPi in treating these cancers. This is particularly relevant for breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers associated with BRCA mutations (Fugger2021Targeting).

In gastric cancer, DNPH1 is one of the genes with higher frequencies of copy number variation (CNV) amplification, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and as a prognostic marker (Liu2023The). These findings highlight DNPH1's significance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.
