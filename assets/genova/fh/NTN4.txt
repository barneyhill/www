# NTN4

## Overview
Netrin-4 (NTN4) is a gene that encodes the secreted protein netrin 4, which is part of the netrin family known for its involvement in axon guidance and cell migration. Unlike other netrins, netrin 4 does not interact with netrin-1 receptors but instead binds to laminin γ1 chains, playing a crucial role in basement membrane assembly and tissue morphogenesis (Reuten2016Structural; Schneiders2007Binding). The protein is characterized by a unique structural arrangement, including a laminin-type globular domain and epidermal growth factor repeats, which contribute to its function in vascular and neural development (Yin2000Identification; Reuten2016Structural). Netrin 4 is involved in maintaining endothelial homeostasis, inhibiting inflammation, and promoting cell adhesion, with significant implications in angiogenesis and axon branching (Hayano2014Netrin4; Zhang2021Netrin4). Its expression and interactions are critical in various physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and Meniere's Disease, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and disease (GallegoMartinez2019Enrichment; Xu2016NTN4).

## Structure
Netrin-4 (NTN4) is a secreted protein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the NTN4 gene, which spans 132,958 base pairs of genomic DNA and includes 10 exons and nine introns (Zhang2004Identification). The full-length cDNA of netrin-4 encodes a 591 amino acid polypeptide (Zhang2004Identification).

The secondary structure of netrin-4 includes an amino-terminal signal sequence, a laminin-type globular domain of the 'VI' type, and three laminin-type epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats (Yin2000Identification). The tertiary structure features a unique head to stalk arrangement, with the N-terminal domain forming the head and three and a half rod-like LE domains making up the stalk. This structure is stabilized by a complex pattern of disulfide bridges (Reuten2016Structural).

Netrin-4 does not interact with netrin-1 receptors, as the binding epitopes of netrin-1 are absent in netrin-4 (Reuten2016Structural). Instead, it forms a high-affinity complex with the laminin γ1 chain, disrupting laminin networks and basement membranes (Reuten2016Structural). This interaction is crucial for its role in axon growth and angiogenesis (Reuten2016Structural).

Alternative splicing of the NTN4 gene results in different isoforms, such as netrin-4_v2, which lacks a signal peptide and part of the N-terminal domain, suggesting potential intracellular functions (Zhang2004Identification).

## Function
Netrin-4 (NTN4) is a secreted protein that plays a significant role in maintaining endothelial homeostasis and vascular health. It is highly expressed in endothelial cells and is involved in inhibiting endothelial inflammation and senescence. NTN4 expression is regulated by hemodynamic factors and inflammation, with increased expression under laminar flow conditions and decreased expression when stimulated with inflammatory cytokines like TNFα and IL1β (Zhang2021Netrin4).

NTN4 contributes to the structural integrity and function of endothelial cells by promoting cell survival, inhibiting cell migration, and supporting vascular system development. It enhances endothelial cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and maintains barrier function by increasing VE-cadherin expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway (Zhang2024Netrin‑4). NTN4 also interacts with the laminin γ1 chain in the basement membrane, influencing basement membrane assembly and tissue morphogenesis (Schneiders2007Binding).

In the nervous system, NTN4 is involved in axon guidance and branching, particularly in thalamocortical axon branching, where it acts as a branch-promoting molecule in an activity-dependent manner (Hayano2014Netrin4). These functions highlight NTN4's crucial role in both vascular and neural development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NTN4 gene have been implicated in various cancers and other diseases. In cancer, NTN4 is involved in several mechanisms that affect tumor progression and metastasis. For instance, in breast cancer, NTN4 expression is reduced, and its overexpression inhibits cell migration and invasion, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Xu2016NTN4). Conversely, in glioblastoma, NTN4 promotes cell proliferation through its interaction with integrin β4, activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (Hu2012Netrin4). The expression of NTN4 is downregulated in glioblastoma, correlating with poor patient survival, while ITGB4 expression is upregulated (Hu2012Netrin4).

NTN4 is also implicated in sporadic Meniere's Disease (MD), where rare damaging missense variants in the gene may contribute to the disease's development. The gene's interaction with other genes like UNC5A and UNC5C is thought to increase the risk of MD, highlighting the importance of the axonal guidance signaling pathway in its genetic architecture (GallegoMartinez2019Enrichment).

Overall, NTN4's role in disease is complex, with its effects varying depending on the type of cancer or condition, as well as its expression levels and interactions with other proteins.

## Interactions
Netrin-4 (NTN4) is known for its interactions with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. NTN4 interacts with laminin proteins, particularly binding to the short arms of laminin γ1 and γ3 chains. This interaction is crucial for basement membrane assembly, as NTN4 can inhibit the polymerization of laminin-111, affecting basement membrane stability and epithelial branching morphogenesis (Schneiders2007Binding).

NTN4 also forms a ternary complex with Laminin γ1 (LMγ1) and Neogenin-1 (NEO1) in neuroblastoma cells, acting as a cell adhesion molecule that promotes cell migration. This complex is essential for the chemotactic and adhesion-induced migration of neuroblastoma cells (Villanueva2018The).

In the context of angiogenesis, NTN4 binds to the neogenin receptor and recruits Unc5B, which is crucial for its antiangiogenic activity. This interaction converts an attraction toward a netrin gradient into a repulsive activity, inhibiting endothelial cell migration and vascular tube formation (Lejmi2008Netrin4). These interactions highlight NTN4's multifaceted role in regulating cellular dynamics and tissue homeostasis.
