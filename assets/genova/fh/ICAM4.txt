# ICAM4

## Overview
ICAM4, or intercellular adhesion molecule 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, primarily expressed on erythrocytes. The protein, also known as the Landsteiner-Wiener blood group antigen, is characterized by its two immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion processes (Hubbard2000Intercellular). Unlike other members of the ICAM family, ICAM4's expression is restricted to red blood cells, where it interacts with β2 integrins such as LFA-1 and Mac-1, playing a crucial role in maintaining erythrocyte stability and integrity (Yusuf‐Makagiansar2002Inhibition). ICAM4 is also involved in host-pathogen interactions, serving as a receptor for Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the malaria parasite's invasive form (Bhalla2015Host). This protein's unique expression pattern and functional roles underscore its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts, including its potential involvement in immune-related conditions and as a target for therapeutic interventions against malaria.

## Structure
ICAM4, also known as the Landsteiner-Wiener blood group antigen, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed on erythrocytes and erythroid precursors. The protein structure of ICAM4 includes two immunoglobulin-like domains, which is fewer than other ICAM family members such as ICAM-1 and ICAM-3, which have five domains each (Hubbard2000Intercellular). These domains are typical of the immunoglobulin fold, characterized by beta-sheet structures that form a stable framework (Hubbard2000Intercellular).

ICAM4 interacts with β2 integrins, specifically LFA-1 and Mac-1, which are important for cell adhesion processes (Yusuf‐Makagiansar2002Inhibition). The protein's expression is restricted to red blood cells, and its specific function in these cells is not fully detailed in the available literature (Hubbard2000Intercellular).

Post-translational modifications of ICAM4 may include glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Hubbard2000Intercellular). The quaternary structure of ICAM4, involving interactions with other cell surface proteins, is not explicitly detailed in the provided sources.

## Function
ICAM4, or intercellular adhesion molecule 4, is a protein primarily expressed on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). It plays a crucial role in cell adhesion processes, particularly in the context of erythrocytes. ICAM4 is involved in the interaction with integrins, which facilitates cell-cell interactions and contributes to the stability and integrity of blood cells (Bhalla2015Host). This protein is unique among intercellular adhesion molecules due to its expression being restricted to RBCs, where it serves as a receptor for various ligands, including those on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the invasive form of the malaria parasite (Bhalla2015Host).

In healthy human cells, ICAM4 is involved in the molecular activities related to erythrocyte function and lifespan. It interacts with integrins such as CD11c/CD18 and av integrins, which are present on different cell types, including non-hematopoietic cells and platelets (Bhalla2015Host). These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of RBCs and facilitating their role in the circulatory system. ICAM4's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in the overall function and stability of erythrocytes in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
ICAM4 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and genetic variations. In the context of uterine fibroids, a study by Yafei Zhu et al. found that ICAM4 is significantly downregulated and identified as a top methylated driver gene. This downregulation is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids (Yafei2023DNA). The study highlights the importance of DNA methylation in regulating immune infiltration, which is crucial in the development of these tumors (Yafei2023DNA).

Additionally, genetic variations in the ICAM1-ICAM4-ICAM5 locus have been associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. Research by Kwangwoo Kim et al. demonstrated that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this locus are linked to increased SLE susceptibility across multiple ancestries. However, these genetic variations do not appear to affect the expression levels of ICAM4 (Kim2012Variation). The study suggests that variations in genes involved in ICAM-mediated adhesion may contribute to SLE susceptibility (Kim2012Variation). These findings underscore the potential clinical significance of ICAM4 in immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
ICAM4, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is primarily expressed on erythrocytes and plays a significant role in cell adhesion processes. It interacts with various integrins, including CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), α4β1, αIIbβ3, and αv integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion, hemostasis, and thrombosis (Sun2023Intercellular). These interactions facilitate the binding of ICAM4 to different cell types, including leukocytes and platelets, contributing to immune responses and cellular signaling (Yusuf‐Makagiansar2002Inhibition).

ICAM4 is also involved in the invasion process of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites into red blood cells. The protein M5 has been shown to bind to ICAM4, blocking the invasion of erythrocytes by the parasite, indicating that ICAM4 serves as a critical receptor in this process (Bhalla2015Host). The interaction between ICAM4 and merozoite ligands is essential for the parasite's invasion, and recombinant ICAM4 can inhibit this process by competing with its membrane-bound form on red blood cells (Bhalla2015Host). These findings suggest that ICAM4's interactions are not only pivotal in immune responses but also in host-pathogen interactions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions against malaria (Bhalla2015Host).
