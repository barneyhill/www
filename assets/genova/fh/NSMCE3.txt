# NSMCE3

## Overview
NSMCE3 is a gene that encodes the NSE3 homolog, a crucial component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, which is involved in maintaining genomic stability. The protein encoded by NSMCE3 is characterized by a conserved MAGE homology domain, which facilitates its interaction with other subunits within the complex, particularly NSE1 and NSE4, forming a stable heterotrimer. This interaction is essential for the complex's role in DNA repair, replication, and chromosome segregation. The SMC5-SMC6 complex, including the NSE3 protein, is vital for the proper progression of replication forks and the prevention of genomic instability, especially under conditions of replicative stress. Mutations in the NSMCE3 gene have been linked to severe pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining genome integrity and preventing disease (Pebernard2008Nse1; Grange2022Pathogenic; Lorite2024Crucial).

## Structure
NSMCE3, also known as NSE3, is a component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex and contains a conserved MAGE homology domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other subunits within the complex, particularly Nse4 (Pebernard2008Nse1). This domain is essential for the formation and stability of the Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 trimer, which plays a significant role in DNA repair and genome stability (Pebernard2008Nse1). The MAGE domain is a defining feature of NSMCE3, contributing to its function in DNA binding and interaction with other proteins in the complex (Lorite2024Crucial).

The quaternary structure of NSMCE3 involves its integration into the SMC5-SMC6 complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as NSE1 and NSE4, forming a critical part of the complex's architecture (Pebernard2008Nse1). The interaction between these subunits is vital for the complex's role in maintaining genome integrity and responding to DNA damage (Lorite2024Crucial). While specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures of NSMCE3 are not provided, its role within the complex highlights its importance in cellular processes related to DNA repair and stability.

## Function
NSMCE3, also known as NSE3, is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, which is crucial for maintaining genome stability in human cells. This complex is involved in various chromosomal transactions, including DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation. NSMCE3 is part of the Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 subcomplex, which plays a significant role in the stability of the entire Smc5/6 complex (Lorite2024Crucial).

The SMC5/6 complex, including NSMCE3, is essential for the proper progression and processing of replication forks, particularly under conditions of replicative stress. It contributes to the recruitment of fork protection factors, such as FANCD2 and FANCM, to stalled replication forks, ensuring the continuation of DNA replication and the prevention of genomic instability (Lorite2024Crucial).

NSMCE3 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in organizing chromatin fibers and chromosomes. This activity is crucial for the physical separation of sister chromatids during mitosis, thereby ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression (Lorite2024Crucial). The proper function of NSMCE3 within the SMC5/6 complex is vital for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing chromosomal abnormalities.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSMCE3 gene, a component of the SMC5/6 complex, are associated with severe pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. These clinical manifestations are thought to arise from the destabilization of the SMC5/6 complex caused by NSMCE3 missense variants, which is more pronounced than the destabilization caused by NSMCE2 nonsense variants (Grange2022Pathogenic). The SMC5/6 complex plays a crucial role in DNA repair and replication fork stability, and its dysfunction can lead to genomic instability, contributing to the development of these conditions (Grange2022Pathogenic).

The clinical phenotype associated with NSMCE3 mutations differs from those linked to other components of the SMC5/6 complex, such as NSMCE2, which is associated with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and insulin resistance. This difference in clinical outcomes may be due to the varying degrees of complex destabilization caused by different mutations (Grange2022Pathogenic). The NSMCE3 gene's role in maintaining genomic stability underscores its importance in preventing disease, and alterations in its expression or interactions can significantly impact cellular responses to DNA damage, potentially leading to developmental disorders and cancer (Grange2022Pathogenic).

## Interactions
NSMCE3, a component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in DNA repair and genome stability. Within the SMC5-SMC6 complex, NSMCE3 interacts with NSMCE1 and NSMCE4, forming a stable heterotrimer with Nse1 and Nse4, where Nse3 interacts with both Nse1 and Nse4 (Pebernard2008Nse1). The interaction between Nse3 and Nse4 requires the entire MAGE domain of Nse3, highlighting the importance of this domain for the complex's stability (Pebernard2008Nse1).

The SMC5-SMC6 complex, including NSMCE3, is essential for chromosome segregation and genome integrity. NSMCE3's interactions within this complex are critical for its function in homologous recombination and DNA damage response (Cho2023Chemogenetic). Although specific interactions of NSMCE3 with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in the complex suggests it may interact with DNA during repair processes.

The study of NSMCE3's interactions is ongoing, with methods such as AlphaFold-Multimer being used to predict and analyze these interactions, although specific details of NSMCE3's interactions in these studies are not provided (Cho2024NFATC2IP).
