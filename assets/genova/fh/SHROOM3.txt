# SHROOM3

## Overview
SHROOM3 is a gene that encodes the protein shroom family member 3, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. The SHROOM3 protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, characterized by its involvement in actomyosin contraction and cellular morphogenesis. It contains several functional domains, including a PDZ domain and actin-binding domains, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and the cytoskeleton (Tariq2011SHROOM3; Durbin2020SHROOM3). SHROOM3 is integral to processes such as neural tube closure and gut morphogenesis, primarily through its recruitment of Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCKs) to apical cell junctions, leading to myosin II activation and subsequent actomyosin contraction (Nishimura2008Shroom3mediated). The gene's expression and function are critical in various developmental pathways, including the planar cell polarity pathway, and its dysregulation is associated with several congenital conditions, such as neural tube defects and congenital heart defects (Takla2023A; Durbin2020SHROOM3).

## Structure
The SHROOM3 protein is composed of 1,996 amino acids and features several key domains that contribute to its function. It includes a PDZ domain, an actin cytoskeleton binding domain (ASD1), and a domain termed ASD2, which facilitates F-Actin and Myosin II constriction (Tariq2011SHROOM3; Durbin2020SHROOM3). The PDZ domain is located at the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 25 to 110, and is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Tariq2011SHROOM3). The ASD1 and ASD2 domains are involved in actin binding and are essential for the protein's role in cytoskeletal organization and cell shape regulation (Durbin2020SHROOM3).

SHROOM3 interacts with Rho-associated protein kinases, specifically ROCK1 and ROCK2, through its C-terminal domain, which is important for its function in actomyosin constriction and cell shape changes (Dickson2015Targeted; Durbin2020SHROOM3). The protein also forms complexes with other components of the planar cell polarity pathway, such as Dishevelled2 (DVL2), indicating its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Durbin2020SHROOM3). The presence of conserved domains and its interaction with key signaling molecules highlight SHROOM3's role in cellular architecture and morphogenesis.

## Function
SHROOM3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and cell shape in epithelial and neuroepithelial cells. The SHROOM3 protein plays a critical role in apical constriction, a process essential for various morphogenetic events, including neural tube closure and gut morphogenesis. It functions by recruiting Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs) to apical cell junctions, which leads to the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains (MLCs) and activation of myosin II, resulting in actomyosin contraction and tension generation at cell junctions (Nishimura2008Shroom3mediated).

In the developing gut, SHROOM3 is essential for maintaining the apicobasally elongated, high-columnar morphology of epithelial cells, which is crucial for proper tissue morphogenesis (Chung2010Direct). The protein is also involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, interacting with components like DVL2, and influencing the transcriptional regulation of PCP signaling components, which is important for cardiac development (Durbin2020SHROOM3). SHROOM3's activity is primarily localized at the apical junctional complex of cells, where it interacts with cytoskeletal proteins to regulate cell shape and organization (Li2024Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SHROOM3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of renal health, SHROOM3 is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). An intronic SNP, rs17319721, in SHROOM3 is linked to increased expression of the gene, which enhances TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling, promoting renal fibrosis. This SNP is particularly associated with CKD in European ancestry cohorts and CAN in renal transplant recipients, especially those with Caucasian donor allografts (Menon2014Intronic).

In cardiac development, SHROOM3 interacts with the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in SHROOM3 can lead to congenital heart defects (CHD), such as ventricular septal defects (VSD) and double outlet right ventricle (DORV). These defects are linked to disrupted cardiomyocyte organization and increased proliferation, highlighting SHROOM3's role as a critical actomyosin effector in cardiac morphogenesis (Durbin2020SHROOM3).

SHROOM3 is also associated with neural tube defects (NTDs), including exencephaly and anencephaly. Knockout models in mice and brain organoid studies have shown that SHROOM3 mutations can lead to structural abnormalities in neural development, suggesting a role in apical constriction and lumen morphology (Takla2023A).

## Interactions
SHROOM3 is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for its role in cellular morphogenesis and cytoskeletal organization. It interacts with Dishevelled2 (DVL2), a key component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, during cardiac development. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and organization, and disruptions can lead to congenital heart defects (Durbin2020SHROOM3).

SHROOM3 also interacts with Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs) through its ASD2 domain. This interaction is vital for the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which regulates actomyosin contraction necessary for neural tube closure and epithelial remodeling (Nishimura2008Shroom3mediated).

In the context of neural development, SHROOM3's interaction with N-cadherin is significant for apical constriction and neural tube closure. This interaction affects the dynamics of actin and N-cadherin, which are crucial for effective apical constriction in the neural ectoderm (Baldwin2022Global).

Additionally, SHROOM3's interaction with Rho kinase is targeted by the small molecule inhibitor CCG-17444, which disrupts this interaction to promote axon outgrowth by circumventing inhibitory signals from Nogo66 (Dickson2015Targeted).
