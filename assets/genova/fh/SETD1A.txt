# SETD1A

## Overview
SETD1A is a gene that encodes the protein SET domain containing 1A, a histone lysine methyltransferase. This enzyme is a critical component of the Set1/COMPASS complex, which is responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription start sites (Lee2008Wdr82). The protein plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, impacting processes such as cell differentiation, development, and DNA damage repair (Li2016Setd1a; Alsulami2019SETD1A). SETD1A's interactions with various proteins and RNA structures are crucial for its function in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle (Kranz2020The; Amin2023In). Clinically, mutations in the SETD1A gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its importance in neural development and function (Mukai2019Recapitulation; Singh2016Rare).

## Structure
SETD1A is a human protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a histone lysine methyltransferase. The protein contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is a functional RNA-binding unit. This domain is unique due to an extra α-helix at the C-terminal region, which allows RNA recognition through a broad surface, despite occluding traditional RNA binding surfaces. The RRM domain includes several positively charged amino acids, such as Arg106, His128, Arg130, Arg132, and Lys133, which are crucial for RNA interaction (Amin2023In).

SETD1A also features a SET domain, which is essential for its methyltransferase activity, specifically targeting the H3K4 residue on histones. This domain is flanked by an N-SET domain and a post-SET peptide, similar to its yeast counterpart, Set1 (Kranz2020The). The protein forms part of a complex with other proteins, including WDR82, which interacts with the RRM domain and is important for recruiting the SETD1A complex to transcription start sites (Lee2008Wdr82).

The quaternary structure of SETD1A involves its association with the COMPASS complex, where it interacts with WDR82 and other subunits, influencing chromatin targeting and RNA binding (Amin2023In). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in histone modification and gene regulation.

## Function
SETD1A is a gene encoding a histone lysine methyltransferase that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is a component of the Set1/COMPASS complex, which is responsible for the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), a modification associated with active transcription start sites (Lee2008Wdr82). This methylation is crucial for the proper initiation of transcription and is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure, impacting processes such as cell differentiation and development (Li2016Setd1a).

SETD1A is also involved in DNA damage repair pathways, interacting with proteins like RAD18 and FANCD2 to maintain genome stability (Higgs2018Histone; Alsulami2019SETD1A). It protects stalled replication forks from degradation, ensuring the stability of nascent DNA during replication stress (Higgs2018Histone). In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, SETD1A is essential for DNA repair and maintaining cell cycle regulation, preventing the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (Kranz2020The).

In the context of cell proliferation, SETD1A regulates the expression of mitotic genes, preventing premature senescence and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Tajima2019SETD1A). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in cellular fitness and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SETD1A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Rare loss-of-function (LoF) variants in SETD1A have been significantly linked to an increased risk of schizophrenia, with a P-value of 3.3 × 10^-9, indicating a strong genetic association (Singh2016Rare). These variants are also associated with developmental disorders, intellectual disabilities, and early-onset epilepsy (Wang2021SETD1A). Individuals with SETD1A mutations may exhibit symptoms such as cognitive impairments, learning difficulties, and various neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Mukai2019Recapitulation; Singh2016Rare).

SETD1A haploinsufficiency, which results in reduced gene expression, has been linked to cognitive impairments and alterations in cortical synaptic structures, potentially disrupting neural network activities (Mukai2019Recapitulation). In mouse models, SETD1A deficiency leads to working memory deficits and changes in axonal branching, which can be partially reversed through pharmacological interventions (Mukai2019Recapitulation). The gene's role in chromatin regulation and its interaction with transcription factors like Mef2 are crucial for understanding its involvement in these disorders (Mukai2019Recapitulation).

## Interactions
SETD1A is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the COMPASS complex, interacting with proteins such as WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2L, which are essential for its histone methyltransferase activity (Alsulami2019SETD1A). SETD1A also interacts with WDR82, a protein that helps recruit the SETD1A complex to transcription start sites by binding to the C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) (Lee2008Wdr82).

The RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of SETD1A is a functional RNA-binding unit, interacting with various RNA structures in a non-canonical manner. This domain is involved in RNA processing and splicing, as evidenced by its colocalization with SC-35, a nuclear speckle marker protein, and its interaction with splicing-related non-coding RNAs (Amin2023In).

SETD1A also plays a role in the DNA damage response through its interaction with cyclin K, which is crucial for the expression of DNA damage response genes and leukemia cell proliferation (Hoshii2018A). Additionally, SETD1A interacts with the DNA damage repair protein RAD18, suggesting a functional link in DNA repair pathways (Alsulami2019SETD1A).
