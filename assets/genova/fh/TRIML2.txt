# TRIML2

## Overview
TRIML2 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif family like 2, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain and a PRY/SPRY domain, but it notably lacks the RING and B-box domains typical of other TRIM proteins. TRIML2 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis, particularly in the context of eutherian placentation and cancer biology. It functions as a regulatory inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine production, which is crucial for maintaining a low inflammatory status during extended pregnancies. Additionally, TRIML2 is involved in post-translational modifications, enhancing the sumoylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, thereby influencing the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes. This protein is implicated in the modulation of immune responses and has been associated with various cancers, where its expression levels can either promote or inhibit tumor progression depending on the context (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific; Kung2015Identification; Liu2021Tumor).

## Structure
The TRIML2 protein is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain and a PRY/SPRY domain, but notably lacks the RING and B-box domains typical of other TRIM proteins (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific). The coiled-coil domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially allowing TRIML2 to modulate the function of other TRIM proteins (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific). The PRY/SPRY domain is under significant positive selection, suggesting its importance in interactions with viral elements and its role in the evolutionary diversification of eutherian placentation (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific).

TRIML2 is involved in post-translational modifications, particularly enhancing the sumoylation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 with SUMO-2, which affects the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes (Kung2015Identification). This modification is distinct from mono-SUMOylation by SUMO-1 and suggests a role in regulating p53-mediated apoptosis (Kung2015Identification). The protein's structure and modifications contribute to its functional diversity, particularly in immune regulation and inflammation attenuation during placentation (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific).

## Function
TRIML2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, TRIML2 functions as a regulatory inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine production, which is essential for maintaining a low inflammatory status during extended pregnancies, a characteristic unique to eutherians (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific). The protein is expressed in preimplantation embryos and trophoblast-derived structures, such as the chorion and placental disc, where it helps modulate inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific).

TRIML2 is also a novel target of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, enhancing p53's sumoylation and regulating the transactivation of proapoptotic genes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in response to DNA damage and stress (Kung2015Identification). TRIML2 influences the transcriptional activity of p53, affecting the expression of genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis, thereby playing a role in cellular decision-making processes between these two outcomes (Kung2015Identification).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein ubiquitination and degradation pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress response (Kung2015Identification).

## Clinical Significance
TRIML2 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. It is overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting a role in tumor progression in these specific cancer types (Hayashi2019Increased; Liu2021Tumor). In OSCC, TRIML2 upregulation is associated with increased tumor growth, and its knockdown results in decreased cellular proliferation due to cell-cycle arrest (Hayashi2019Increased). 

Conversely, TRIML2 is frequently downregulated in several other cancers, including gastric, colorectal, lung, and liver cancers, indicating a potential anti-cancer function in these contexts (Kung2015Identification). The gene's expression is influenced by p53 variants, with the Arg72 variant inducing TRIML2, while the Pro72 variant does not, potentially affecting tumor suppression and apoptosis (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific; Kung2015Identification).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), TRIML2 is part of a gene signature associated with poor prognosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and immune response modulation (Liu2023Developing). These findings highlight the complex role of TRIML2 in cancer biology, where its expression and interaction with p53 can significantly impact tumor development and progression.

## Interactions
TRIML2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its sumoylation with SUMO-2/3, which regulates the transactivation of pro-apoptotic genes. This interaction is particularly significant in cells expressing the R72 variant of p53, which has increased apoptotic potential. TRIML2's role in modifying p53 was confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays, showing that it can post-translationally modify p53 without enhancing its ubiquitylation or SUMO-1 sumoylation (Kung2015Identification).

TRIML2 is also involved in the reactivation of the lytic cycle of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). During this process, TRIML2 undergoes modifications such as SUMOylation and ubiquitination. It is essential for the reactivation of the lytic cycle and contributes to virion production. The interaction between TRIML2 and STAT6 is crucial, as the degradation of STAT6 by RTA is necessary for the reactivation process, with TRIML2's ubiquitin-modified form being required for this reactivation (Gu2018STAT6).

In the context of placentation, TRIML2 is expressed in trophoblast-derived tissues and plays a role in regulating inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface. Its expression is influenced by TP53 variants, with the Arg72 variant inducing TRIML2 expression (Zhang2019EutherianSpecific).
