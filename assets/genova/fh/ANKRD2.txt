# ANKRD2

## Overview
ANKRD2, or ankyrin repeat domain 2, is a gene that encodes a protein predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. The protein, also referred to as Ankrd2, is characterized by its ankyrin repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is categorized as a mechanosensing protein. Ankrd2 plays a critical role in muscle cell signaling, structural integrity, and response to mechanical stress. It is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle differentiation, growth, and remodeling, by interacting with key transcription factors and signaling pathways. The protein's ability to shuttle between the sarcomere and the nucleus allows it to act as a molecular messenger, linking mechanical stress signals to gene regulation. Alterations in ANKRD2 expression and function are associated with several muscle-related diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, and cardiac pathologies (Cenni2019Ankrd2; Bang2014The; Kojic2011Muscle).

## Structure
ANKRD2, also known as ankyrin repeat domain 2, is a protein primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The protein is characterized by several structural motifs, including tandem ankyrin repeats, a coiled-coil domain, PEST motifs, and nuclear localization signals (NLS) (Kojic2011Muscle). Ankyrin repeats are common motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial in systems with intensive protein communication, such as muscle cells (Kojic2011Muscle). The coiled-coil domain aids in subunit oligomerization and protein-protein interactions, typically forming a supercoil of two to five α-helices (Kojic2011Muscle). PEST motifs, which are rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine, signal for proteolytic degradation, contributing to protein instability. ANKRD2 is predicted to contain one PEST motif (Kojic2011Muscle).

ANKRD2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser-99 by Akt2, which influences its function and cellular localization, particularly under oxidative stress conditions (Cenni2011Ankrd2ARPP). This phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation of myogenesis and stress response (Cenni2011Ankrd2ARPP). The protein's expression and localization can change in response to various physiological and pathological conditions (Kojic2011Muscle).

## Function
ANKRD2, also known as Ankrd2, is a mechanosensing protein primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, particularly in slow muscle fibers, and plays a significant role in muscle cell signaling and structural integrity. It is involved in intracellular and intercellular communication, interacting with proteins containing PDZ and SH3 domains, which are crucial for signaling pathways (Belgrano2011MultiTasking). ANKRD2 is implicated in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which inhibits myogenic differentiation, and it may function similarly to IκB, an inhibitor of NF-κB (Pallavicini2001Characterization).

The protein is involved in muscle differentiation, growth, and remodeling, acting as a central node within regulatory networks that control muscle phenotype and protein turnover (Belgrano2011MultiTasking). ANKRD2 interacts with transcription factors such as p53, MyoD, and Nkx2.5, influencing gene expression and chromatin remodeling (Belgrano2011MultiTasking; Kojic2004The). It is also a substrate for calpain 3, which may regulate its interactions and localization, particularly under stress conditions (Belgrano2011MultiTasking).

ANKRD2's ability to shuttle between the sarcomere and the nucleus suggests it acts as a molecular messenger, linking mechanical stress signals to gene regulation (Kojic2004The). This protein is crucial for maintaining muscle structure and function, particularly in response to mechanical stress (Kojic2011Muscle).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the ANKRD2 gene are associated with various muscle-related diseases. In muscular dystrophies, ANKRD2 expression is generally downregulated, particularly in slow MHC-positive type 1 myofibers, although some hypertrophic myofibers maintain normal expression levels. In congenital myopathies, ANKRD2 expression is induced in atrophic or damaged myofibers, suggesting a role in muscle damage and regeneration (Kojic2011Muscle). 

ANKRD2 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of muscular laminopathies, where its interaction with mutated A-type lamins can lead to its abnormal retention in the nucleus. This retention is associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) release, apoptotic cell death, and impaired muscle regeneration, contributing to the symptoms of these conditions (Cenni2019Ankrd2). 

In cardiac pathologies, ANKRD2 is upregulated in human dilated cardiomyopathy, indicating its involvement in cardiac muscle adaptation and remodeling (Bang2014The). Additionally, ANKRD2's interaction with proteins involved in mechanosignaling and transcription regulation, such as p53, suggests its potential role in tumorigenesis, particularly in rhabdomyosarcomas, where it may serve as a diagnostic marker (Kojic2011Muscle).

## Interactions
ANKRD2, also known as Arpp, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in muscle function and signaling. It binds to the Z-disc protein telethonin, also known as T-cap, both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments and GST-overlay assays (Kojic2004The). ANKRD2 also interacts with the transcription factor YB-1, with the N-terminal region of ANKRD2 responsible for this binding, as shown by GST pull-down assays (Kojic2004The).

ANKRD2 can dimerize, binding to native recombinant ANKRD2 fused to GST, and co-localizes with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in nuclear bodies of myoblasts. This interaction is confirmed through in vivo and in vitro binding experiments, specifically with PML isoform IV (Kojic2004The). ANKRD2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing the up-regulation of the p21 promoter by p53, acting as an enhancer of p53-mediated activation (Kojic2004The).

ANKRD2 and inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) cooperatively inhibit myoblast differentiation through a physical interaction, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Mohamed2013Ankyrin). These interactions suggest that ANKRD2 plays a crucial role in linking the sarcomere to the nucleus in skeletal muscle cells and in regulating gene expression in response to muscle stress.
