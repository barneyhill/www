# BROX

## Overview
The BROX gene encodes a protein known as BRO1 domain and CAAX motif containing, which is integral to the endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking processes in human cells. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Bro1 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a CAAX motif, which is involved in post-translational modifications such as prenylation. These features are crucial for the protein's localization and function within the cell. BROX is a component of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway, playing a pivotal role in membrane remodeling processes, including intraluminal vesicle formation, cytokinesis, and virus budding. The protein's interactions with components of the ESCRT-III complex, particularly CHMP4B and CHMP5, underscore its importance in facilitating membrane fission events. Additionally, BROX is implicated in modulating endosomal traffic, which is essential for intracellular vesicle transport and the regulation of ion channels at the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling (GonzálezFernández2015The; Mu2012Two; Zhai2011Structure).

## Structure
The BROX protein is characterized by a single Bro1 domain, which forms a curved structure with dimensions of 90x63x38 Å. This domain is composed of a core of three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-like helical hairpins arranged in a right-handed solenoid, flanked by a two-stranded hairpin and a helical bundle (Zhai2011Structure). The C-terminus of BROX features a short helix that extends back across the domain, suggesting a role in membrane association due to the presence of a Cys408 farnesylation site (Zhai2011Structure). The Bro1 domain of BROX is similar to those found in ALIX and Bro1p, with primary sequence identities ranging from 20 to 24% and root mean square deviations (RMSDs) between 2.6 and 3.1 Å over the first 372 residues (Zhai2011Structure).

The BROX protein interacts with CHMP4B and CHMP5, part of the ESCRT-III machinery, through its Bro1 domain. These interactions involve hydrophobic contacts, with CHMP4B adopting an alpha-helical structure and CHMP5 forming a tandem beta-hairpin structure (Mu2012Two). The binding of BROX to these proteins is crucial for its recruitment to membrane fractions, highlighting its role in membrane remodeling processes (Mu2012Two). The BROX protein crystallizes in space group C2, with three molecules forming a triangle in the asymmetric unit (Zhai2011Structure).

## Function
The BROX gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the endosomal sorting and membrane trafficking processes within human cells. The BROX protein contains a BRO1 domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions, and a CAAX motif, which is involved in post-translational modifications such as prenylation, affecting the protein's localization and function (Mu2012Two; Zhai2011Structure).

BROX is part of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway, which is essential for membrane remodeling processes, including intraluminal vesicle formation, cytokinesis, and virus budding (Zhai2011Structure). The protein interacts with components of the ESCRT-III complex, specifically CHMP4B and CHMP5, facilitating membrane fission events (Mu2012Two). BROX's interaction with CHMP5 is unique among Bro1 domain proteins, suggesting a specialized role in recruiting CHMP5 to membrane fractions, which is significant for its function during membrane remodeling (Mu2012Two).

In addition to its role in membrane dynamics, BROX is implicated in the modulation of endosomal traffic, which is crucial for intracellular vesicle transport and the regulation of ion channels at the plasma membrane (GonzálezFernández2015The). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BROX gene have been associated with familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC), particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified loss-of-function variants in the BROX gene in families with multiple members affected by PTC. These variants include a frameshift deletion that results in a truncated protein lacking the Bro1 domain, which is crucial for the morphogenesis of multivesicular bodies and endosomal sorting of cargo proteins (SánchezAres2022Susceptibility; Pasquali2020BROX).

The BROX gene's role in endosomal sorting and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation suggests that its haploinsufficiency may lead to EGFR accumulation in follicular thyroid cells, potentially causing aberrant cell growth and contributing to thyroid cancer development (SánchezAres2022Susceptibility). Although the exact mechanism remains unverified, these findings highlight the potential clinical significance of BROX mutations in thyroid cancer predisposition (Pasquali2020BROX).

Further research is needed to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic utility of BROX gene alterations in non-syndromic familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (NS-FNMTC) and to explore their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention (SánchezAres2022Susceptibility).

## Interactions
The BROX protein, encoded by the human BROX gene, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily through its Bro1 domain. BROX interacts with members of the CHMP family, specifically CHMP4 isoforms (CHMP4a, CHMP4b, and CHMP4c), which are components of the ESCRT-III complex. This interaction is crucial for BROX's role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and membrane remodeling (Ichioka2008Brox). The interaction with CHMP4B is facilitated by hydrophobic residues in an amphipathic alpha helix, while CHMP5 binds through a tandem beta-hairpin structure, indicating distinct binding modes (Mu2012Two).

BROX also interacts with the nucleocapsid (NC) region of the HIV-1 Gag protein, a feature shared with other Bro1 domain proteins like ALIX and HD-PTP. This interaction is mediated by zinc finger motifs in the NC, which are essential for BROX's incorporation into virus-like particles (Popov2009Divergent). Despite these interactions, BROX does not bind to RabGAPLP, a protein that interacts with Alix, highlighting its unique interaction profile (Ichioka2008Brox). The farnesylation of BROX, facilitated by its C-terminal CAAX motif, influences its subcellular localization and interaction dynamics, although it is not essential for all interactions (Ichioka2008Brox).
