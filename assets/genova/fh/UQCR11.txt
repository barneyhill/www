# UQCR11

## Overview
UQCR11 is a gene that encodes the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, complex III subunit XI, a protein integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is a component of complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex, which plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. This process is essential for establishing a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, ultimately driving ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. The proper function and regulation of UQCR11 are crucial for maintaining efficient energy metabolism and cellular health, as it ensures the effective operation of mitochondrial respiration (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase).

## Function
UQCR11 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex III, also known as the cytochrome bc1 complex, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a vital role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. This electron transfer is essential for creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is used to drive ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase).

In healthy human cells, UQCR11 is involved in oxidative phosphorylation, a fundamental process for energy production. The protein's activity is critical for maintaining efficient mitochondrial respiration, which is necessary for the energy demands of various cellular processes. The regulation of UQCR11, along with other components of the electron transport chain, ensures proper energy metabolism and cellular function (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase).

While the specific function of UQCR11 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed in the provided context, its role in mitochondrial respiration underscores its importance in energy metabolism and overall cellular health (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase).

## Interactions
UQCR11, a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III, is involved in several interactions crucial for its function in oxidative phosphorylation. It is part of the cytochrome bc1 complex, where it interacts with other subunits such as cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. These interactions facilitate electron transfer within the complex, which is essential for ATP production (Dennerlein2021Defining).

In the context of heart regeneration, UQCR11 is regulated by N-acetyltransferase 10 (Nat10), which represses its expression independently of ac4C modification. Nat10 binds to Uqcr11 mRNA, inhibiting its nuclear export and translation, thereby reducing the number of translatable mRNAs. This regulation is crucial for cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration, as it shifts the metabolic mode from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase). The repression of UQCR11 by Nat10 is part of a broader mechanism that involves metabolic reprogramming to promote heart regeneration (Ma2024NAcetyltransferase). These interactions highlight the role of UQCR11 in both mitochondrial function and cellular metabolic regulation.
