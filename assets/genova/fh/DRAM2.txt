# DRAM2

## Overview
The DRAM2 gene encodes the DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway, a cellular process essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. This protein is expressed in various tissues, with significant importance in the retina, where it contributes to the maintenance and function of photoreceptors by facilitating the degradation of their outer segments. DRAM2 localizes to lysosomal membranes, underscoring its role in cellular maintenance and protection against damage. Mutations in the DRAM2 gene are linked to retinal dystrophies, such as cone-rod dystrophy and rod-cone dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in visual health (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical; Krašovec2022The).

## Function
The DRAM2 gene encodes a 266-amino acid transmembrane protein involved in autophagy, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. This protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the lymph nodes, spleen, heart, and placenta, and is particularly important in the retina (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical; Krašovec2022The). DRAM2 localizes to lysosomal membranes, where it plays a role in the autophagy process, contributing to cellular maintenance and protection against cellular damage (Krašovec2022The).

In the retina, DRAM2 is found in the inner segments of photoreceptors and the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. It is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and function by facilitating the degradation of the outer segments of photoreceptors, thus supporting photoreceptor renewal and preventing light-induced damage (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical; Krašovec2022The). The protein's role in autophagy is essential for cellular metabolism and stress relief, particularly in high-demand tissues like the retina, where its malfunction can lead to retinal degeneration (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical). DRAM2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DRAM2 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy known as DRAM2 retinopathy, which includes conditions such as cone-rod dystrophy (CORD21) and rod-cone dystrophy. These conditions are characterized by progressive degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, leading to symptoms such as central visual loss, night blindness, and difficulty with dark adaptation (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical; Krašovec2022The). The onset of DRAM2 retinopathy typically occurs in the third decade of life, but can range from teenage years to the sixth decade (Krašovec2022The). 

The clinical presentation of DRAM2 retinopathy is variable, with some patients exhibiting cone-rod dystrophy, characterized by central visual loss and decreased visual acuity, while others show rod-cone dystrophy, presenting with night blindness and peripheral vision loss (Krašovec2022The). The disease progression is generally slow, with peripheral changes occurring around the median age of 50 (Krašovec2022The). 

DRAM2 mutations can also lead to macular dystrophy, with fundus examinations revealing macular atrophy or a granular appearance, and imaging often showing a central hypoautofluorescent area surrounded by a hyperautofluorescent ring (Krašovec2022The). Despite the gene's ubiquitous expression, systemic symptoms are not typically observed in patients with DRAM2-associated retinopathy (Kuniyoshi2020Clinical).
