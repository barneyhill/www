# ASCC1

## Overview
The ASCC1 gene encodes the protein activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 1, which is a vital component of the activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes, particularly in response to alkylation damage. ASCC1 contains a K homology (KH) domain and a C-terminal RNA ligase-like domain, which are crucial for its interactions within the ASC-1 complex and its role in maintaining genomic stability (Soll2018RNA). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-kB, and SRF, influencing various cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation (Jung2002Novel). Mutations in the ASCC1 gene are associated with Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Congenital Bone Fractures 2 (SMABF2), a rare neuromuscular disorder, and have been linked to Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its significance in both genetic and oncological contexts (Orloff2011Germline; Giuffrida2019A).

## Structure
The ASCC1 protein contains distinct domains that contribute to its function in DNA repair and cellular stress responses. It features a K homology (KH) domain at its N terminus, which is known to facilitate RNA binding, similar to the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (mordue2020identification). Adjacent to the KH domain is an unstructured region, while the C terminus contains an RNA ligase-like domain, part of the 2H phosphoesterase family. This C-terminal domain is suggested to be an RNA-binding domain, containing conserved His-Xaa-Thr motifs important for RNA or nucleotide binding (Soll2018RNA).

The N-terminal region of ASCC1 is crucial for binding to ASCC3, a component of the ASCC complex, while the C-terminal region is not necessary for this interaction (Soll2018RNA). The C-terminal domain is implicated in the regulation of ASCC complex recruitment and function, possibly through substrate binding (Soll2018RNA). ASCC1 is constitutively present at nuclear speckle foci and is removed upon alkylation damage, indicating its role in modulating ASCC3 recruitment during such damage (Soll2018RNA). The protein's structure and domain organization suggest a significant role in the ASCC complex's function during alkylation damage repair.

## Function
The ASCC1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the activating signal cointegrator 1 (ASC-1) complex, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes. In healthy human cells, ASCC1 is involved in the cellular response to alkylation damage, where it regulates the ASCC complex's function during DNA repair. The protein contains a C-terminal RNA ligase-like domain, essential for its role in modulating the recruitment and function of the ASCC complex, ensuring efficient DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Soll2018RNA).

ASCC1 is also part of the transcriptional coregulator complex ASC-1, which influences the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts, crucial for bone formation and homeostasis. It regulates the TGF-b/SMAD pathway, affecting osteogenesis and adipogenesis, and is involved in maintaining proper collagen fibril organization and bone remodeling (Voraberger2023Investigating).

Additionally, ASCC1 is implicated in the regulation of transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-kB, and SRF, which are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival (Meunier2021Inherited; Jung2002Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASCC1 gene are associated with a rare autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder known as Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Congenital Bone Fractures 2 (SMABF2). This condition is characterized by severe muscular hypotonia, respiratory distress, congenital joint contractures, and prenatal fractures of long bones, often leading to a poor prognosis and early death (Voraberger2023Investigating; Giuffrida2019A). The disorder is caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in ASCC1, which result in premature stop codons and potential mRNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay (Meunier2021Inherited; Giuffrida2019A).

The most commonly identified mutation is a frameshift allele, NM_001198799.2:c.157dupG, p.Glu53Glyfs*19, frequently reported in families from the Mediterranean area (Meunier2021Inherited). ASCC1 dysfunction leads to downregulation of key regulators of bone development, such as RUNX2 and SERPINF1, affecting osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation (Voraberger2023Investigating). Histopathological features in affected individuals include muscle fiber size variation and myofibrillar disorganization (Meunier2021Inherited).

Additionally, mutations in ASCC1 have been linked to Barrett esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, suggesting a broader role in disease development beyond neuromuscular disorders (Orloff2011Germline).

## Interactions
ASCC1 is a component of the Activation Signal Cointegrator Complex (ASCC), which includes ASCC2, ASCC3, and TRIP4. ASCC1 directly interacts with ASCC3, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells. This interaction is crucial for the formation and function of the ASCC complex, particularly during alkylation damage repair (Soll2018RNA). ASCC3 acts as a scaffold between ASCC1 and ASCC2, as ASCC1 and ASCC2 do not interact directly. The necessity of ASCC3 for bridging ASCC1 and ASCC2 was confirmed by experiments showing that knocking out ASCC3 in PC-3 cells prevents ASCC2 from coimmunoprecipitating with ASCC1 (Soll2018RNA).

ASCC1 contains a K homology (KH) domain at its N terminus, which is necessary for binding to ASCC3, while its C-terminal RNA ligase-like domain is implicated in its localization and function during alkylation damage (Soll2018RNA). The interaction between ASCC1 and ASCC3 is mediated by the N terminus of ASCC1, which acts as a specificity determinant for ASCC3 localization at nuclear foci (Soll2018RNA). ASCC1's role in the ASCC complex suggests a regulatory mechanism for the ALKBH3-ASCC repair pathway (Soll2018RNA).
