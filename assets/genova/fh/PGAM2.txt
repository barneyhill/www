# PGAM2

## Overview
Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 2, a critical component of the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, where it facilitates the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate, a key step in glycolysis essential for energy production and cellular function. PGAM2 is categorized as a glycolytic enzyme and functions as a homodimer, with its activity regulated by post-translational modifications such as sumoylation. These modifications are crucial for its role in muscle cell differentiation and energy metabolism. Mutations in the PGAM2 gene are linked to glycogen storage disease type X (GSDX), a metabolic disorder characterized by exercise-induced muscle cramps and myoglobinuria, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Naini2009Muscle; Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient).

## Structure
The phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2) protein is a glycolytic enzyme with a high-resolution crystal structure determined at 1.29 Å resolution. It crystallizes in the P41212 space group and forms a homodimer, with interactions between subunits mediated by salt bridges, ionic interactions, and π-π stacking (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution). The structure of PGAM2 is similar to that of PGAM1, sharing over 80% sequence identity, but with notable differences such as a phenylalanine residue at position 26 instead of a tyrosine, which affects its phosphorylation potential (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution).

PGAM2 contains surface-exposed, positively charged residues (K33, K49, K129, K146) that are not present in PGAM1, which may be involved in nuclear localization (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution). The protein's structure includes a catalytic domain typical of the phosphoglycerate mutase family, and it functions as a dimer, indicating a quaternary structure (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution).

Post-translational modifications such as sumoylation at lysine residues K49 and K176 are crucial for PGAM2's function, impacting myogenic differentiation and glycolytic activity (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient). These modifications are essential for its role in muscle cell differentiation and energy production (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient).

## Function
Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2) is a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, primarily active in skeletal muscle and heart tissues. It catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate, a key step in glycolysis, which is essential for energy production and the synthesis of molecules necessary for cellular function and survival (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient). PGAM2's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, which is crucial for its function in myogenic differentiation, a process vital for muscle development and regeneration (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient).

In healthy human cells, PGAM2 is involved in energy metabolism, particularly in muscle tissues, where it supports muscle function and energy production. The enzyme is not regulated transcriptionally by heat-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF1a), indicating that its activity is primarily controlled through post-translational modifications (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient). PGAM2's sumoylation at specific lysine residues, such as K49 and K176, is essential for maintaining the full capacity of myogenic cells for terminal differentiation and myoblast fusion, as well as for normal energy production (Zhang2022Sumoylationdeficient). This highlights the enzyme's significant role in muscle physiology and energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PGAM2 gene are associated with glycogen storage disease type X (GSDX), a rare metabolic disorder characterized by exercise-induced muscle cramps, myalgia, and recurrent episodes of myoglobinuria. This condition results from a partial block in glycolysis due to reduced phosphoglycerate mutase activity, leading to symptoms such as muscle pain and cramps after physical exertion (Naini2009Muscle; Oh2006Exercise‐induced). 

PGAM2 mutations can include nonsense mutations, frameshift variants, and missense mutations, which lead to truncated or dysfunctional proteins. For instance, a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 2 and a single nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift have been identified in patients, resulting in premature stop codons and reduced enzyme activity (Naini2009Muscle). A specific missense mutation, W78X, has been reported in homozygous patients, leading to significantly reduced PGAM activity (Salameh2012Phosphoglycerate; Oh2006Exercise‐induced).

The condition is observed across various ethnic groups, with a notable prevalence among African Americans due to a founder effect, but it is also reported in Italian, Danish, Pakistani, and Japanese individuals (Naini2009Muscle). Treatment options like dantrolene have been explored to manage symptoms by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease (Vissing1999Muscle).

## Interactions
Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its function and localization. PGAM2 forms a homodimer, with interactions between subunits facilitated by salt bridges, ionic interactions, and π-π stacking (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution). It interacts with the 14-3-3ζ/δ protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is involved in various cellular processes. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear import of PGAM2 and is regulated by the insulin/IGF1-PI3K signaling pathway (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution). The binding site for 14-3-3 proteins on PGAM2 has been identified as the sequence 60LKRAIRTLWAI70 (Wiśniewski2022HighResolution).

PGAM2 also interacts with SIRT2, a deacetylase that regulates PGAM2 activity by deacetylating lysine 100 (K100). This interaction is NAD+-dependent and is crucial for maintaining low levels of K100 acetylation, thereby enhancing PGAM2 activity (Xu2014Oxidative). These interactions highlight the role of PGAM2 in cellular metabolism and its regulation by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions.
