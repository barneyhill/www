# TMEM91

## Overview
TMEM91 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 91, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 91 remain under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in cellular communication and possibly in the regulation of certain pathways. Understanding the role of TMEM91 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease.
