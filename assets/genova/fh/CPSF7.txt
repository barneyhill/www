# CPSF7

## Overview
CPSF7, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 7, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the essential process of mRNA maturation. The protein, also named CPSF7, is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is crucial for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. This process includes the cleavage of pre-mRNA and the addition of a poly(A) tail, which are vital for mRNA stability, nuclear export, and translation efficiency (Kuo2018Interactome). CPSF7 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and RNA maturation (Kuo2018Interactome). The protein's interactions with other components of the mRNA processing machinery underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in various disease processes, including cancer and genetic disorders (Li2024A; Kuo2018Interactome).

## Function
CPSF7, or cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 7, is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. This protein plays a critical role in the cleavage of pre-mRNA and the subsequent addition of a poly(A) tail, processes that are vital for mRNA stability, export from the nucleus, and translation into proteins (Kuo2018Interactome). CPSF7 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and RNA maturation (Kuo2018Interactome).

In healthy human cells, CPSF7 is involved in mRNA splicing and 3'-end processing, which are crucial for the proper maturation and function of mRNA molecules. The protein's interaction with other components of the mRNA processing machinery, such as CPSF2, highlights its role in pre-mRNA polyadenylation, a key step in mRNA maturation (Kuo2018Interactome). CPSF7's involvement in these processes ensures the correct expression of genes and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Its function in mRNA processing is also linked to the regulation of antiviral responses, as it interacts with viral proteins that aim to disrupt host mRNA maturation (Kuo2018Interactome).

## Clinical Significance
CPSF7 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in mRNA processing. In cancer, CPSF7 is involved in regulating liver cancer growth and metastasis through the WWP2/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that alterations in CPSF7 expression or function can contribute to the progression of liver cancer by affecting key signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and metastasis (Li2024A).

In the context of canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, genetic variants in the CPSF7 gene have been associated with the condition in West Highland White Terriers. Although no genome-wide significant variants were detected, one variant was identified at a suggestive level of significance, indicating a potential role for CPSF7 in this disease. The study highlights the significance of CPSF7 in the genetic landscape of this condition, although it does not directly address other diseases or conditions associated with CPSF7 (Piras2020Association).

These findings underscore the importance of CPSF7 in disease contexts, particularly in cancer and genetic disorders, where its altered expression or mutations can have significant clinical implications. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its role and potential as a therapeutic target.
