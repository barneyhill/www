# APCDD1

## Overview
APCDD1 (adenomatosis polyposis coli down-regulated 1) is a gene that encodes a membrane-bound glycoprotein involved in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway for numerous developmental and cellular processes. The protein encoded by APCDD1 acts as an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with components such as WNT3A and LRP5, thereby preventing the formation of the Wnt receptor complex and inhibiting downstream signaling (Shimomura2010APCDD1). This regulatory function is essential for maintaining normal physiological processes, including hair follicle development and adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, APCDD1 is implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hereditary hypotrichosis simplex and certain cancers, due to its role in modulating Wnt signaling (Han2017Epigenetic; Shimomura2010APCDD1).

## Structure


## Function
The APCDD1 gene encodes a membrane-bound glycoprotein that functions as an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes and cellular functions. In healthy human cells, APCDD1 is involved in regulating Wnt signaling by interacting with key components such as WNT3A and LRP5, thereby preventing the formation of the Wnt receptor complex and inhibiting downstream signaling (Shimomura2010APCDD1). This inhibition is essential for maintaining normal hair follicle function and structure, as it prevents excessive Wnt activity that could lead to conditions like hereditary hypotrichosis simplex (Shimomura2010APCDD1).

APCDD1 also plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation by repressing Wnt signaling, which negatively regulates adipogenesis. This regulation promotes the expression of adipogenic transcription factors such as C/EBPα and PPARγ, facilitating the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (Yiew2017A). In the context of oligodendrocyte differentiation, APCDD1 suppresses β-catenin-dependent Wnt activation, promoting the maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into myelinating oligodendrocytes, which is crucial for central nervous system development and repair (Lee2015Apcdd1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APCDD1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. One notable condition is hereditary hypotrichosis simplex (HHS), a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss. This condition is linked to mutations such as the L9R variant, which disrupts the processing and stability of the APCDD1 protein, leading to its impaired function as a Wnt signaling inhibitor (Shimomura2010APCDD1).

APCDD1 is also implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its involvement in the Wnt signaling pathway. A specific variant, p.R299H, has been identified as a potential cancer-predisposing factor in familial CRC cases, suggesting a role in cancer susceptibility (Skopelitou2021Whole).

In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, APCDD1 expression is reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences the gene. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor cell invasion and metastasis, indicating that APCDD1 may function as a tumor suppressor (Han2017Epigenetic).

APCDD1 is also linked to central iris hypoplasia, where its upregulation due to chromosomal translocation affects eye development, highlighting its complex role in various developmental processes (Sun2024Altered).

## Interactions
APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that interacts with several key proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway. It has been identified as a novel inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by binding with Wnt3A and LRP5, which are crucial for hair follicle induction (Shimomura2010APCDD1). The extracellular domain of APCDD1 can coprecipitate with recombinant tagged forms of Wnt3A and LRP5, suggesting that APCDD1 modulates the Wnt pathway through interactions at the cell surface (Shimomura2010APCDD1).

In the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, APCDD1 interacts with Wnt5a and Ror2, forming a tripartite complex with Vangl2 in the presence of Wnt5a. This indicates that APCDD1 may act as a co-receptor in the Wnt5a/c-Jun pathway, promoting c-Jun phosphorylation and positively regulating this signaling pathway (Wang2019APCDD1).

APCDD1 also associates with β-catenin, a key regulator of Wnt signaling, suggesting a role in bridging the Wnt receptor complex and transcriptional effectors. This interaction is crucial for its function in suppressing Wnt signaling and promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation (Lee2015Apcdd1).
