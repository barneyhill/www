# MAP1LC3C

## Overview
MAP1LC3C is a gene that encodes the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 gamma (LC3C), a member of the MAP1LC3/GABARAP family, which plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway. This protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold and is involved in the formation of autophagosomes, essential for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of damaged organelles and proteins. LC3C is categorized as a structural protein involved in autophagy, with its function extending to the regulation of lysosomal exocytosis and cellular responses to hypoxia. It acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating cancer stem cell activity and is implicated in various cancers, including renal and colorectal cancer, through its influence on lysosomal activity and zinc metabolism (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

## Structure
The MAP1LC3C protein, part of the human MAP1LC3/GABARAP family, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold. Its primary structure includes an amino-terminal extension with a polyproline II motif, which is connected to the core by a flexible linker described as a 'sticky arm' (Krichel2019Solution). The secondary structure of MAP1LC3C features a globular fold with four β-strands and three α-helices, forming a twisted, mixed parallel/antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Krichel2019Solution). 

The tertiary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, with two hydrophobic binding pockets that recognize targets with LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) (Krichel2019Solution). The protein's N-terminal region is highly flexible, while the core from Ser18 to Ala120 is more rigid (Krichel2019Solution). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Ser18 by protein kinase A, induce conformational changes that affect the LIR-binding interface, potentially modulating interactions with target proteins (Krichel2019Solution). The C-terminal region is involved in lipid conjugation and membrane anchoring, crucial for autophagosome formation (Krichel2019Solution).

## Function
MAP1LC3C, also known as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 gamma, is a crucial component in the autophagy process, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, MAP1LC3C is involved in the formation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that engulf and degrade damaged organelles and proteins. This process is vital for cellular clearance and the recycling of cellular components, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cellular health and function (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

MAP1LC3C is lipidated on its C-terminal glycine, allowing it to integrate into the elongating membrane of forming autophagosomes. This integration facilitates the tethering of cargo receptors, which are responsible for bringing ubiquitinated cargo to the autophagosomes for degradation (Verma2022MAP1LC3C). Beyond its role in autophagy, MAP1LC3C also regulates lysosomal exocytosis, a process where lysosomes move to the cell periphery and secrete their contents. This function is important for cellular clearance, detoxification, and membrane repair, and is independent of its autophagic activity (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

MAP1LC3C is also implicated in cellular responses to hypoxia and acts as a tumor suppressor by limiting the activity of cancer stem cells (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

## Clinical Significance
The MAP1LC3C gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In renal cancer, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), MAP1LC3C exhibits tumor-suppressing properties. Loss of MAP1LC3C expression leads to increased lysosomal exocytosis, which is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and tumor initiation in xenograft models. This process also results in decreased intracellular zinc levels, affecting zinc-dependent epigenetic modifications and gene expression, which may contribute to cancer progression (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

In colorectal cancer, MAP1LC3C is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, although the change in expression is not among the most significant when adjusted for multiple testing (Gil2018The). The gene is also differentially expressed in breast cancer (BRCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), with decreased abundance observed in these cancer types (Lebovitz2015Crosscancer).

These findings suggest that alterations in MAP1LC3C expression or function could have significant implications for cancer biology, influencing tumorigenic potential and progression through mechanisms involving lysosomal activity and zinc metabolism (Verma2022MAP1LC3C).

## Interactions
MAP1LC3C, also known as LC3C, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in autophagy. It interacts with proteins containing LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) through its hydrophobic binding pockets, which are formed by its ubiquitin-like fold structure (Krichel2019Solution). The protein's N-terminus forms a polyproline II helix, a common motif for protein-protein interactions, which may interact with domains such as WW and SH3, despite deviating from typical ligand motifs (Krichel2019Solution).

LC3C interacts with the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1, with a measured dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 1 µM, indicating no selectivity among the six human Atg8 proteins (Wesch2020Atg8Family). It also interacts with proteins like AnkG, AnkB, PLEKHM1, PCM1, ULK1, ATG13, FIP200, and p62/SQSTM1, showing varying affinities (Wesch2020Atg8Family). LC3C is recruited to invading bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium via the SAR, NDP52, which is essential for autophagy-mediated bacterial growth restriction (Wesch2020Atg8Family).

Phosphorylation of LC3C at Ser18 by protein kinase A can modulate its interactions, affecting its affinity and specificity for LIRs (Krichel2019Solution). This phosphorylation leads to conformational changes that influence its LIR-binding interface (Reid2022Canonical).
