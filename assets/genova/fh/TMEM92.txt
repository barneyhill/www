# TMEM92

## Overview
TMEM92 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 92, which is part of the STMC6 protein family. This family is characterized by a conserved cysteine pattern, suggesting a role as transmembrane adaptors that may interact with other membrane proteins or cellular components (Pei2012Unexpected). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly those involving membrane proteins, as evidenced by its interactions with RTP2 and DERL3 (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). TMEM92 has garnered attention in cancer research, being identified as a hub gene in pancreatic cancer and included in prognostic models for breast cancer, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Gao2023Integrative; Wu2021A). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in breast carcinoma, where it functions as an oncogene, promoting tumor progression through mechanisms such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Lin2020Transmembrane). Additionally, TMEM92 is expressed in prostate cancer tumors but not in normal tissues, highlighting its potential as a cancer-specific marker (Lin2020Transmembrane).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM92 has been implicated in the progression of breast carcinoma (BC). Studies have shown that TMEM92 is upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines compared to normal controls, and its high expression is associated with advanced disease stages, metastasis, and poor overall survival in patients. TMEM92 acts as an oncogene by promoting tumor cell growth, invasiveness, and motility, primarily through the modulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Silencing TMEM92 expression in BC cells results in reduced cell viability, invasiveness, and motility, while overexpression leads to the opposite effects. This suggests that TMEM92 plays a significant role in tumor progression by influencing key cellular processes such as cell adhesion and signaling, particularly through the degradation of β-catenin and E-cadherin (Lin2020Transmembrane).

In addition to its role in breast carcinoma, TMEM92 expression is cancer-specific in prostate cancer, where it is expressed in tumors but not in normal tissues, indicating its potential as a cancer-specific marker (Lin2020Transmembrane). These findings highlight the potential of TMEM92 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in breast carcinoma.

## Interactions
TMEM92 is known to participate in protein-protein interactions, as evidenced by its interaction with RTP2 and DERL3, identified through yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. These interactions highlight the potential role of TMEM92 in cellular processes involving membrane proteins, although the specific functional implications of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

TMEM92 is also part of the STMC6 protein family, which includes proteins characterized by a conserved cysteine pattern. These proteins are suggested to function as transmembrane adaptors, potentially interacting with other membrane proteins or cellular components. However, specific interaction partners for TMEM92 within this family have not been detailed (Pei2012Unexpected).

In the context of cancer research, TMEM92 has been identified as a hub gene in a gene module associated with pancreatic cancer, although specific interactions involving TMEM92 in this context are not detailed (Wu2021A). Additionally, TMEM92 is included in a prognostic model related to breast cancer, suggesting its involvement in cancer-related pathways, but again, specific interactions are not described (Gao2023Integrative).
