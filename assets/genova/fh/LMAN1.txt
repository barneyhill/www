# LMAN1

## Overview
LMAN1, also known as ERGIC-53, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in the transport of glycoproteins within the secretory pathway. The protein, lectin, mannose-binding 1, is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and functions as a cargo receptor. It plays a critical role in the transport of specific glycoproteins, including coagulation factors V and VIII, by binding mannose in a calcium-dependent manner. The protein's structure includes a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that facilitates its mannose-binding capability, essential for its function as a molecular chaperone. LMAN1 forms a complex with MCFD2, which is crucial for the efficient secretion of certain proteins. Mutations in the LMAN1 gene are linked to combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII, highlighting its clinical significance in hemostasis (Fu2019LMAN1; Tang2023Cargo; Zheng2013Combined).

## Structure
LMAN1, also known as ERGIC-53, is a type I transmembrane protein involved in the transport of glycoproteins. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that is specific for mannose binding (Yamada2009A). The secondary structure of LMAN1 features a series of beta-sheets, which contribute to the formation of its lectin domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to bind mannose, a key function in its role as a molecular chaperone (Yamada2009A).

The tertiary structure of LMAN1 involves the lectin domain, which is responsible for its mannose-binding capability. This domain is located on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is essential for the protein's interaction with cargo proteins (Everett2020Altered). In terms of quaternary structure, LMAN1 forms a homodimer, which is important for its function in glycoprotein transport (Everett2020Altered).

LMAN1 also contains a coiled-coil domain and undergoes N-glycosylation as a post-translational modification, which may influence its stability and function within the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (Everett2020Altered).

## Function
LMAN1, also known as ERGIC-53, is a type I transmembrane protein that functions as a cargo receptor in the transport of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. It primarily resides in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and is involved in the cycling between the ER, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi (Everett2020Altered; Tang2023Cargo). LMAN1 binds to mannose in a calcium-dependent manner, facilitating the export of specific secretory proteins, including coagulation factors V and VIII, and α1-antitrypsin (Zhu2018Analysis; Itin1996ERGIC53).

The protein forms a complex with MCFD2, a soluble protein, which is essential for the efficient ER exit of certain cargoes. This complex is crucial for the secretion of several proteins, including factor V, factor VIII, and α1-antitrypsin (Zhang2022Separate; Tang2023Cargo). LMAN1's carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) binds to high-mannose glycans, and its C-terminal tail contains motifs necessary for ER export and retrieval (Everett2020Altered; Watanabe2024Structure). In healthy human cells, LMAN1 ensures the proper transport and secretion of these coagulation factors, maintaining normal hemostasis (Yamada2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMAN1 gene are associated with combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII (F5F8D), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by reduced levels of these coagulation factors, leading to mild-to-moderate bleeding symptoms such as bleeding from trauma or surgery, epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising, and menorrhagia (Zhang2022Separate; Zheng2013Combined). The disorder results from mutations that disrupt the LMAN1-MCFD2 complex, which is essential for the transport of these factors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus (Zhu2018Analysis; Zheng2013Combined).

Various mutations in LMAN1, including insertion/deletion, nonsense, and splice site mutations, have been identified, which completely abolish the protein function (Zheng2013Combined). Specific missense mutations, such as W67S and C475R, have been shown to impair the protein's ability to bind mannose or oligomerize, respectively, which are crucial for its function (Zheng2013Combined). LMAN1 mutations are also frequently found in colorectal and gastric cancer patients with microsatellite instability, although the relevance to cancer development is unclear (Zheng2013Combined). Additionally, altered expression levels of LMAN1 can affect the secretion of other proteins, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin, indicating broader roles in protein secretion (Everett2020Altered).

## Interactions
LMAN1, also known as ERGIC-53, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the secretory pathway. It forms a complex with MCFD2, a zinc-binding protein, which is essential for the transport of coagulation factors V and VIII from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction stabilizes the structure of LMAN1 and modulates its cargo-binding capabilities (Watanabe2024Structure). The LMAN1-MCFD2 complex is necessary for the efficient secretion of these factors, with MCFD2 acting as a cargo capture module (Zhang2022Separate).

LMAN1 also interacts with neuroreceptors, such as GABA A receptors, facilitating their transport from the ER to the Golgi. This interaction occurs independently of the glycosylation status of the receptors, indicating a glycan-independent binding mechanism (Fu2019LMAN1). The CRD domain of LMAN1 is crucial for its interaction with GABA A receptor subunits, although the oligomerization status of LMAN1 does not affect this binding (Fu2019LMAN1).

LMAN1's interaction with MCFD2 and its role in neuroreceptor trafficking highlight its importance in protein transport processes within the cell (Fu2019LMAN1; Watanabe2024Structure).
