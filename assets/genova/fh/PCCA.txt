# PCCA

## Overview
The PCCA gene encodes the alpha subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a biotin-dependent enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of certain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol. This enzyme is crucial for converting propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, a reaction that feeds into the citric acid cycle, thereby influencing energy production and metabolic homeostasis (Ballhausen2009Evidence; Kalousek1980Isolation). The alpha subunit, characterized by its biotin carboxylase and biotin carboxyl carrier protein domains, is essential for the enzyme's catalytic function and interacts with the beta subunit to form a functional holoenzyme (Clavero2002Functional; Huang2010Crystal). Mutations in the PCCA gene can lead to propionic acidemia, a metabolic disorder marked by the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which can result in severe clinical symptoms (Ugarte1999Overview). Understanding the structure and function of the PCCA gene and its encoded protein is vital for elucidating the pathophysiology of related metabolic disorders and developing targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Structure
The PCCA gene encodes the alpha subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. The alpha subunit contains biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Huang2010Crystal). A newly identified domain, the BT domain, is crucial for interaction with the beta subunit, facilitating the assembly of the holoenzyme (Huang2010Crystal).

The quaternary structure of the enzyme is a dodecamer, composed of six alpha and six beta subunits, forming a complex with a molecular weight of approximately 750 kD (Huang2010Crystal). The alpha subunits are arranged as monomers around a central beta6 hexamer, with the BC and CT active sites separated by 55 Å, necessitating the translocation of the BCCP domain during catalysis (Huang2010Crystal).

The enzyme's structure is consistent with a protomeric tetramer of nonidentical subunits, with the larger subunit containing biotin in a 1:1 biotin/protein molar ratio (Kalousek1980Isolation). This structural organization is similar to that observed in other species, indicating a conserved architecture across different organisms (Kalousek1980Isolation).

## Function
The PCCA gene encodes the alpha subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a biotin-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in the catabolism of certain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol. PCC catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, a key step in the metabolic pathway that feeds into the citric acid cycle, impacting energy production and metabolic homeostasis (Ballhausen2009Evidence; Kalousek1980Isolation).

In healthy human cells, PCC is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the oxidation of propionate and aliphatic amino acids (Frenkel1975Intracellular). The enzyme is composed of nonidentical subunits, with the alpha subunit containing a binding site for the cofactor biotin, an ATP binding site, and a biotin carboxylating site (Kalousek1980Isolation). The biotinylation of the alpha subunit is essential for its function, although it can be imported into mitochondria as either an apo- or holoprotein (Taroni1991The).

Deficiency in PCC activity due to mutations in the PCCA gene can lead to propionic aciduria, characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites that interfere with mitochondrial function and other cellular processes, potentially causing neurological symptoms (Ballhausen2009Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PCCA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), are associated with propionic acidemia (PA), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. PA is characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites due to deficient PCC activity, leading to a range of clinical symptoms including metabolic ketoacidosis, vomiting, lethargy, and hypotonia (Ugarte1999Overview). The disorder can present in severe neonatal forms or milder late-onset forms, with symptoms such as seizures, poor feeding, and developmental delays (Bychkov2021Functional).

The PCCA gene has been found to have a high degree of mutational heterogeneity, with over 200 variant alleles reported, including missense mutations, small insertions/deletions, splicing mutations, and large genomic deletions (Richard2015Understanding). These mutations can lead to exon skipping, frameshifts, and premature stop codons, resulting in altered protein sequences and enzyme deficiency (Ugarte1999Overview). Large genomic deletions in the PCCA gene are significant contributors to PA, with a high frequency of such deletions identified in patients (Desviat2009High).

The clinical presentation of PA is heterogeneous, and the severity of symptoms can vary depending on the specific mutations present. Some mutations, such as those affecting the biotin carboxylase domain, can lead to decreased enzyme activity without causing intrinsic instability, resulting in milder clinical presentations (Desviat2004Propionic). Understanding the genetic basis of PA is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of the disorder.

## Interactions
The PCCA protein, a subunit of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme complex, interacts with the PCCB subunit to form a functional enzyme. This interaction is crucial for the assembly and activity of the PCC complex, which is involved in the catabolism of certain amino acids and fatty acids (Clavero2002Functional). The proper stoichiometric balance between PCCA and PCCB is essential for achieving maximal enzyme activity, as demonstrated by studies showing that co-transfection with both wild-type PCCA and PCCB cDNAs results in higher enzyme activity levels than transfection with PCCA alone (Clavero2002Functional).

Mutations in the PCCA gene can affect its interaction with PCCB, leading to impaired assembly and function of the PCC complex. For instance, certain mutations in the biotin carboxylase domain of PCCA cluster in regions important for protein function and stability, potentially affecting protein folding and leading to rapid degradation (Clavero2002Functional). These structural alterations can disrupt the assembly of the PCC oligomer, impacting its enzymatic activity. The interaction between PCCA and PCCB is also influenced by the presence of chaperonin proteins, such as groEL and groES, which assist in the proper folding and assembly of the PCC subunits (Kelson1996Chaperoninmediated).
