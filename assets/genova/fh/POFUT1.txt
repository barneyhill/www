# POFUT1

## Overview
Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) is a gene that encodes an enzyme of the same name, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the Notch signaling pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of O-linked fucose to serine or threonine residues on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch receptors, a modification essential for proper receptor function and signal transduction (Holdener2019Protein; McMillan2017Structure). POFUT1 is characterized by a GT-B fold structure, common among glycosyltransferases, and operates primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (LiraNavarrete2021Protein). Its activity is crucial for various developmental processes, and mutations in the POFUT1 gene have been linked to developmental disorders and conditions such as Dowling-Degos disease and coronary artery anomalies (Takeuchi2018Variant; Atzmony2019Phenotypic; Wang2017Uncontrolled).

## Structure
The human protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) is characterized by a GT-B fold, which is common among glycosyltransferases, and consists of two Rossmann-like fold domains that face each other (LiraNavarrete2021Protein). The enzyme's structure has been elucidated using X-ray crystallography, revealing its configuration in both free and GDP-fucose bound states. The structure of human POFUT1 closely resembles that of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, with a backbone RMSD of 0.93 Å over 355 residues, despite only 39% sequence identity (McMillan2017Structure).

The GDP-fucose substrate binds in a cleft between the enzyme's two lobes, with significant interactions involving residues from the C-terminal lobe. The nucleotide binding pocket is highly conserved, indicating its importance in substrate binding (McMillan2017Structure). POFUT1 does not exhibit major conformational changes or interdomain dynamics in crystal structures, even in the presence of GDP/GDP-fucose and different EGF-like repeats (LiraNavarrete2021Protein).

POFUT1 is involved in the fucosylation of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a modification essential for Notch signaling. This process is critical for the maturation and surface delivery of Notch1 (McMillan2017Structure). The enzyme's structural dynamics and potential as a therapeutic target in cancer therapies have been highlighted due to its role in Notch signaling (McMillan2017Structure).

## Function
Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell-cell communication and influences numerous cell fate decisions during development and in mature organisms. POFUT1 catalyzes the addition of O-linked fucose to serine or threonine residues on epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch receptors. This post-translational modification is crucial for the proper folding, stability, and function of these proteins, affecting their binding affinities and responsiveness to ligands such as DLL1 and JAG1 (Holdener2019Protein; McMillan2017Structure).

In healthy human cells, POFUT1 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it modifies properly folded EGF repeats containing a specific consensus sequence. This modification is essential for the interaction between Notch receptors and their ligands, facilitating effective signal transduction (Stahl2008Roles; Schneider2017Biological). The absence of POFUT1 leads to defects in Notch signaling, resulting in severe developmental abnormalities and embryonic lethality in model organisms, underscoring its essential role in development (Holdener2019Protein; Schneider2017Biological). POFUT1's activity is also linked to various developmental processes, including somite, neural tube, heart, and blood vessel development (Holdener2019Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POFUT1 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and conditions. A notable mutation, the homozygous p.Ser162Leu variant, is linked to a recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, global developmental delay, and cardiac and vascular anomalies. This variant significantly reduces the enzymatic activity of POFUT1, impacting Notch signaling, which is crucial for various developmental processes (Takeuchi2018Variant). The mutation disrupts an N-glycosylation site, leading to more than 90% loss of enzymatic activity, although it does not cause a complete loss of function, as evidenced by the healthy status of heterozygous parents (Takeuchi2018Variant).

POFUT1 mutations are also linked to Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), a skin disorder characterized by flexural reticulated hyperpigmentation and follicular-based lesions. A germline heterozygous deletion in POFUT1 causes a frameshift and premature codon termination, leading to a loss of function and reduced expression levels of POFUT1 and other key regulators of the Notch signaling pathway (Atzmony2019Phenotypic).

In mice, POFUT1 deficiency leads to coronary artery anomalies and early-onset ischemic heart disease due to disrupted Notch signaling, highlighting its critical role in coronary artery development (Wang2017Uncontrolled).

## Interactions
Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) is involved in several critical interactions within the Notch signaling pathway. POFUT1 physically interacts with the Notch receptor, facilitating its proper folding and secretion. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's function, as POFUT1 acts as a chaperone, promoting the folding of Notch independently of its enzymatic activity (Okajima2005Chaperone). The binding of POFUT1 to Notch is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct physical association (Okajima2005Chaperone).

POFUT1 also interacts with Fringe, another modulator of Notch signaling. Fringe can enhance the binding of Notch to its ligand Delta, counteracting the inhibitory effects of POFUT1 overexpression on this interaction. However, Fringe inhibits the binding of Notch to the ligand Serrate, even in the presence of POFUT1 (Okajima2003Modulation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory role of POFUT1 in modulating Notch receptor-ligand binding dynamics.

In addition to its role in Notch signaling, POFUT1 is involved in the fucosylation of other proteins, such as Cripto, agrin, and clotting factors, which further underscores its broad impact on cellular processes (Yao2011Protein).
