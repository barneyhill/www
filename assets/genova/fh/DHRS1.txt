# DHRS1

## Overview
The DHRS1 gene encodes the protein dehydrogenase/reductase 1, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in lipid metabolism, where it plays a significant role in the morphology and accumulation of lipid droplets within cells. DHRS1 is known to localize to lipid droplets and influence their size and triacylglycerol (TAG) content, suggesting its involvement in lipid storage and metabolic processes. The protein interacts with ERLIN1, a component of lipid raft-like domains, which may regulate its stability and function. Despite these insights, the complete physiological role of DHRS1 in human cells remains to be fully understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its contributions to cellular homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1).

## Function
The DHRS1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, which is involved in various metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism. In healthy human cells, DHRS1 localizes to lipid droplets, where it plays a role in lipid droplet morphology and triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Ectopic expression of DHRS1 in HeLa cells leads to an increase in lipid droplet size and TAG levels, suggesting its involvement in lipid storage and metabolism (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1).

DHRS1 interacts with ERLIN1, a protein associated with lipid raft-like domains, which may regulate DHRS1 protein turnover and stabilize its function in lipid droplets. This interaction is novel and suggests a potential mechanism by which DHRS1 influences lipid droplet dynamics and TAG accumulation (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1). Despite these findings, the exact function of DHRS1 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to understand its precise role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
DHRS1 (dehydrogenase/reductase 1) is known to interact with ERLIN1, a protein associated with non-caveolae lipid raft-like domains. This interaction was identified through protein-protein interaction studies using techniques such as FLAG immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, which confirmed ERLIN1 as a DHRS1-interacting protein (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1). Although initial Western blot analysis did not show a detectable interaction, further experiments using a bifunctional crosslinker confirmed the interaction between DHRS1 and ERLIN1 (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1). 

The interaction between DHRS1 and ERLIN1 suggests a potential role for ERLIN1 in stabilizing DHRS1 protein and regulating its turnover. This interaction may also influence DHRS1-induced changes in lipid droplet morphology and triacylglycerol levels in HeLa cells (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1). Despite the confirmed interaction, knocking out ERLIN1 in HeLa cells did not result in a detectable change in lipid droplet morphology, indicating that ERLIN1 may not be essential for the morphological changes induced by DHRS1. However, ERLIN1-deficient HeLa cells expressing DHRS1 showed fewer lipid droplets, suggesting a role for ERLIN1 in stabilizing DHRS1 protein (Bamigbade2023ERLIN1).
