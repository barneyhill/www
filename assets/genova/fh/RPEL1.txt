# RPEL1

## Overview
RPEL1 is a gene that encodes the protein ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase like 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as an epimerase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one sugar epimer to another, although its specific biological roles are still being elucidated. RPEL1 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including intracranial aneurysms and Parkinson's disease, where its expression patterns suggest potential regulatory functions. Despite initial investigations, RPEL1 has not been confirmed as a causative gene for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment DFNA21, highlighting the complexity of its involvement in human health and disease (Laarman2019Chromatin; Zhang2005Transcriptional; de2005Fine).

## Clinical Significance
RPEL1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Research has identified that putative enhancers in IA-associated regions interact with the promoter of RPEL1, suggesting a regulatory role in IA pathogenesis. The gene is expressed in the circle of Willis, a region where IAs develop, although its expression is relatively low compared to other candidate genes (Laarman2019Chromatin).

In the context of hearing impairment, RPEL1 was investigated as a candidate gene for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing impairment DFNA21. Despite its selection based on expression in the inner ear and potential interaction with actin, no mutations were found in RPEL1 in the studied individuals, suggesting it may not be the causative gene for DFNA21 (de2005Fine).

RPEL1 has also been studied in the context of Parkinson's disease, where its expression was found to be altered. However, the specific role of RPEL1 in Parkinson's disease mechanisms remains unclear, as the study focused on broader transcriptional changes rather than specific gene associations (Zhang2005Transcriptional).
