# NSD2

## Overview
NSD2, also known as WHSC1 or MMSET, is a gene that encodes the nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2, a histone methyltransferase involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. This protein is characterized by its catalytic SET domain, which facilitates the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36), a modification crucial for transcriptional activation and chromatin organization (Ma2023Drug; Li2022StructureBased). NSD2 is a member of the NSD family of histone methyltransferases, which also includes NSD1 and NSD3, and is known for its role in maintaining chromatin structure, preventing cellular senescence, and regulating cell cycle-associated genes (Tanaka2020The). The protein's interactions with various partners, such as PARP1 and transcription factors like BRD4, underscore its involvement in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Huang2019Defining). Mutations in the NSD2 gene are linked to developmental disorders and conditions, including a novel syndrome distinct from Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Zanoni2021Lossoffunction).

## Structure
NSD2, also known as MMSET or WHSC1, is a member of the NSD family of histone methyltransferases, which includes NSD1 and NSD3. The protein is characterized by a conserved catalytic SET domain, which is subdivided into pre-SET, SET, and post-SET domains. The SET domain is responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36), a modification that plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (Ma2023Drug; Li2022StructureBased).

NSD2 has three isoforms: NSD2-long (MMSET-II), NSD2-short (MMSET-I), and RE-IIBP. The NSD2-long isoform contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including two PWWP domains, five PHD domains, and a putative DNA-binding HMG-box domain. The NSD2-short isoform lacks the SET domain, and thus does not possess histone methyltransferase activity. The RE-IIBP isoform contains two PHD finger domains, a PWWP domain, and a SET domain but lacks an HMG-box domain (Ma2023Drug).

The PWWP domains, PWWP1 and PWWP2, are involved in chromatin binding, with PWWP1 acting as a reader domain that binds to nucleosomes containing H3K36me2. These domains help maintain NSD2's nuclear localization and stabilize its interaction with chromatin (Li2022StructureBased). NSD2's structure is further regulated by an autoinhibitory loop that changes conformation upon nucleosome binding, facilitating access to H3K36 (Sato2020Structural).

## Function
The NSD2 gene, also known as WHSC1 or MMSET, encodes a histone methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It specifically methylates histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36), which is associated with transcriptional activation and is essential for maintaining the expression of cell cycle-associated and DNA repair genes (Tanaka2020The; Zanoni2021Lossoffunction). NSD2 is enriched at the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, particularly at the 3′ region, and is associated with transcriptionally active histone marks such as H3K36me3 (Tanaka2020The).

In healthy human cells, NSD2 is involved in preventing cellular senescence by maintaining chromatin structure and function, thus playing a significant role in cell proliferation and development (Tanaka2020The). It regulates cell cycle-associated genes through the RB-mediated pathway and interacts with proteins like p53 and p21 to act as a cell cycle regulator (Tanaka2020The). NSD2 also contributes to DNA repair and alternative splicing, suggesting its function in epigenomic maintenance and gene regulation (Tanaka2020The).

NSD2 is active in the nucleus, where it impacts processes like DNA repair and replication, and is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle, being upregulated during cell cycle progression, particularly in the S and G2 phases (Tanaka2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSD2 gene, also known as WHSC1 or MMSET, are associated with a range of developmental disorders and conditions. Loss-of-function and missense variants in NSD2 lead to decreased histone methylation activity, resulting in a distinct developmental phenotype characterized by prenatal-onset growth retardation, low body mass index, mild developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and unique facial features. These phenotypes partially overlap with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), a condition linked to deletions on chromosome 4p16.3, where NSD2 is located (Zanoni2021Lossoffunction).

NSD2 mutations are also implicated in a novel syndrome distinct from WHS, proposed to be named Rauch-Steindl syndrome, which includes intellectual disability and behavioral issues. Patients with missense variants often exhibit taller stature and more frequent behavioral problems compared to those with truncating variants (Zanoni2021Lossoffunction).

Gain-of-function variants in NSD2, such as p.Glu1099Lys, are linked to a different set of abnormalities, including abnormal foot and hand morphology, large hands, and hypoplastic nails. These variants result in increased methylation activity and are associated with dysregulated cellular mechanisms, contributing to conditions like leukemia and organ overgrowth (Popp2022A).

## Interactions
NSD2, also known as nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in chromatin modification and gene expression. NSD2 interacts with Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), a significant binding partner that regulates NSD2's histone methyltransferase activity through PARylation. This modification reduces NSD2's ability to bind chromatin and decreases its recruitment to target genes, impacting gene expression regulation (Huang2019Defining). 

NSD2 also forms interactions with proteins involved in chromatin structure maintenance, transcriptional regulation, and RNA splicing. It interacts with transcription factors such as BRD4 and GATAD2B, suggesting a role in transcriptional elongation and gene expression regulation (Huang2019Defining). Additionally, NSD2 is associated with RNA splicing factors like DDX46 and SF3B2, indicating a potential function in RNA processing (Huang2019Defining).

The study by Wang et al. highlights the isoform-specific interactions of NSD2, identifying 890 isoform-specific protein partners, with 83% being novel. These interactions are enriched in pathways related to RNA splicing and chromatin remodeling, emphasizing the functional diversity of NSD2 isoforms (Wang2021Alternatively). The interaction between NSD2 and the ribosomal protein RPL10, associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, was experimentally validated, suggesting a role in developmental processes (Wang2021Alternatively).
