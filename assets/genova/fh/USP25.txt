# USP25

## Overview
USP25, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 25, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and turnover within cells. The protein, ubiquitin specific peptidase 25, is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an N-terminal domain, a central USP-like catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP25 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, and glucose transporter regulation. It is involved in the stabilization of proteins by removing ubiquitin moieties, thereby preventing their degradation. USP25's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which influence its function in cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms (Blount2012UbiquitinSpecific; Liu2018A; Niño2020USP25).

## Structure
USP25 is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a modular structure comprising an N-terminal domain (NTD), a central USP-like catalytic domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Liu2018A). The catalytic domain is divided into three subdomains: a palm-like catalytic domain, a long coiled-coil (LCC), and an inhibitory loop (IL-loop) (Liu2018A). The IL-loop plays a crucial role in the tetramer assembly by inserting into the catalytic domain of another molecule, preventing substrate binding and leading to autoinhibition (Liu2018A).

USP25 can exist in two oligomeric forms: a more active dimer and an autoinhibited tetramer. The tetramer is formed by a 'dimer of dimers' configuration, where the V-shaped dimerization interface of one dimer inserts between the catalytic domains of a second dimer (Gersch2019Distinct). This tetramerization involves interactions between the coiled-coil insertion domain and the ubiquitin-binding pocket at the catalytic domain (Liu2018A).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination modulate USP25's activity, either suppressing or enhancing its enzymatic function (Liu2018A). The protein may also have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Sauer2019Differential).

## Function
USP25 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 25) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by regulating protein stability and turnover. In healthy human cells, USP25 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), where it interacts with components such as HRD1 and VCP/p97. It deubiquitinates ERAD substrates, rescuing them from proteasomal degradation, and thus regulates the levels of proteins like the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is linked to Alzheimer's disease (Blount2012UbiquitinSpecific).

USP25 also influences the trafficking and degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Its depletion accelerates EGFR degradation by enhancing its internalization through non-clathrin endocytosis, indicating USP25's role in modulating EGFR fate (Niño2020USP25).

In adipocytes, USP25 is crucial for the regulation of the glucose transporter GLUT4. It prevents lysosomal degradation of GLUT4 by deubiquitinating it, thereby maintaining its levels and ensuring proper glucose transport in response to insulin (Sadler2019The).

USP25 also stabilizes tankyrases, which are involved in Wnt signaling, by deubiquitinating them and preventing their degradation. This function is essential for maintaining cellular processes such as signal transduction (Xu2017USP25).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the USP25 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. In IgG4-RD, reduced USP25 expression is associated with increased fibrosis and inflammation, mediated through the IL-1β inflammasome axis. This downregulation affects B cell metabolism via the PI3K-AKT pathway, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and altered immune responses (Jiang2024Expression). 

In cancer, USP25 plays a dual role depending on the type of cancer. It is overexpressed in breast cancer, promoting tumorigenesis by stabilizing tankyrases and affecting Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Xu2017USP25). Conversely, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), USP25 is targeted by miR-200c, which suppresses its expression, thereby reducing cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Li2014miRNA200c).

In Alzheimer's disease, USP25 is overexpressed due to its location on chromosome 21, contributing to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline by stabilizing amyloid precursor protein and promoting β-amyloid accumulation (Zhu2021Emerging). These findings highlight the clinical significance of USP25 in various pathological conditions, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
USP25 interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It is known to interact with tankyrases through its C-terminal tail, promoting their deubiquitination and stabilization, which impacts cell proliferation and cancer development (Liu2018A). USP25 also interacts with components of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as the ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and the AAA ATPase VCP/p97, suggesting a role in counteracting the ubiquitination of ERAD substrates and rescuing them from degradation (Blount2012UbiquitinSpecific).

The enzyme is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by vaccinia-associated kinase 2 (VRK2), which affects its deubiquitination activity (Zhu2021Emerging). USP25 is also modified by SMURF1 through Lys48-linked ubiquitination, impacting its stability and antiviral functions (Zhu2021Emerging). It interacts with SUMO2/3 proteins, and this interaction involves a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) within USP25, affecting its catalytic activity (Meulmeester2008Mechanism).

USP25's structural features, such as its ubiquitin-binding domains, play a role in its interactions and regulatory mechanisms. These domains are involved in substrate recognition and enzyme activity modulation, highlighting the complex regulation of USP25 through its interactions and modifications (Denuc2009The).
