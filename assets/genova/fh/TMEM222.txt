# TMEM222

## Overview
TMEM222 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 222, which is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes. This protein is characterized by its three transmembrane domains and a domain of unknown function (DUF778), and it is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere. The transmembrane protein 222 is localized in dendrites and is associated with postsynaptic vesicles, suggesting a role in synaptic function and neuronal communication. It is also found in early endosomes at synapses, indicating its involvement in endosomal trafficking and synaptic vesicle recycling. Mutations in the TMEM222 gene have been linked to a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and development (Polla2021Biallelic).

## Structure
The TMEM222 gene encodes a transmembrane protein consisting of 208 amino acids, featuring three transmembrane domains and a domain of unknown function (DUF778) (Polla2021Biallelic). The protein is predicted to localize within vesicles of the secretory system and is concentrated in dendrites, suggesting a role in postsynaptic vesicles (Polla2021Biallelic). Subcellular localization studies have shown that TMEM222 is present in early endosomes at synapses of mature neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Polla2021Biallelic).

The specific molecular structure of TMEM222, including its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, remains unclear due to the absence of known 3D structures or modeling templates (Polla2021Biallelic). This lack of structural information makes it challenging to predict the effects of amino acid changes on the protein's structure and function. Some variants in TMEM222 are predicted to disrupt protein localization and interactions, particularly affecting the transmembrane region, which may lead to a loss of function (Polla2021Biallelic). There is no detailed information available on post-translational modifications, specific folds, or splice variant isoforms for TMEM222.

## Function
The TMEM222 gene encodes the transmembrane protein 222, which is involved in neurodevelopmental processes. This protein consists of 208 amino acids and includes a domain of unknown function (DUF778) (Polla2021Biallelic). TMEM222 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, and tibial nerve, suggesting its significant role in neuronal development and function (Polla2021Biallelic). In mature human iPSC-derived glutamatergic cortical neurons, TMEM222 is localized in dendrites and is potentially involved in postsynaptic vesicle function. It partially colocalizes with the postsynaptic marker PSD95 and early endosomal markers, indicating a role in synaptic vesicle processes (Polla2021Biallelic).

The protein is also expressed in early endosomes within synapses of mature neurons, further supporting its involvement in synaptic function and brain development (Polla2021Biallelic). While the precise molecular activities of TMEM222 in healthy human cells remain unclear, its expression patterns and localization suggest a critical role in maintaining synaptic integrity and neuronal communication (Polla2021Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMEM222 gene have been linked to a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, speech delay, and various neurological symptoms, including aggressive behavior, body tremors, and decreased muscle mass. Affected individuals often present with moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and neuropsychiatric issues (Polla2021Biallelic). The study identified several deleterious variants in TMEM222, such as missense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, which were inherited in a recessive manner and not found in a homozygous state in large genetic databases (Polla2021Biallelic).

The TMEM222 gene is considered tolerant to missense variations, but biallelic variants are not tolerated, leading to severe clinical manifestations. These variants can result in nonsense-mediated decay, causing the absence or abnormal size of the protein, which may contribute to the observed neurodevelopmental symptoms (Polla2021Biallelic). The high expression of TMEM222 in the brain, particularly in regions like the cerebellum and parietal cortex, suggests its significant role in neurodevelopment, and mutations in this gene may lead to a neurodegenerative process (Polla2021Biallelic).

## Interactions
The TMEM222 protein is involved in several interactions within neuronal cells. It is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere, and is localized in dendrites. TMEM222 colocalizes with postsynaptic marker PSD95 and early endosomal markers, suggesting its involvement in postsynaptic vesicles in neurons (Polla2021Biallelic). This colocalization indicates that TMEM222 may play a role in synaptic function and neurodevelopment, potentially through interactions with other proteins involved in these processes.

The study of TMEM222's subcellular localization in human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into neurons revealed its presence in early endosomes at synapses. This suggests that TMEM222 might interact with proteins involved in endosomal trafficking and synaptic vesicle recycling (Polla2021Biallelic). However, specific protein interactions involving TMEM222 have not been detailed, and the exact mechanisms of these interactions remain to be elucidated.

Despite the lack of detailed interaction data, the presence of TMEM222 in these cellular components and its association with neurodevelopmental disorders imply that it may participate in critical protein interactions necessary for normal neuronal function (Polla2021Biallelic).
