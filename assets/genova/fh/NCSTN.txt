# NCSTN

## Overview
The NCSTN gene encodes nicastrin, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is an integral component of the γ-secretase complex, a multi-subunit protease complex involved in the intramembranous cleavage of various type I transmembrane proteins. Nicastrin plays a pivotal role in substrate recognition and recruitment within the complex, facilitating the proteolytic processing of key proteins such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors, which are crucial for cellular signaling pathways related to development and differentiation (Shah2005Nicastrin; Yu2000Nicastrin). The proper function of nicastrin is essential for maintaining the integrity and activity of the γ-secretase complex, with implications for both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and hidradenitis suppurativa (Petit2019Extracellular; Choi2020Essential).

## Structure
Nicastrin (NCSTN) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and a key component of the γ-secretase complex. It consists of 709 amino acids, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular domain (ECD), a single transmembrane domain, and a partially membrane-associated C-terminus (Fagan2001Nicastrin; Yu2017Highefficient). The ECD, spanning residues 34-663, is involved in substrate recognition and interaction with other γ-secretase components (Yu2017Highefficient). 

The secondary structure of nicastrin is predominantly alpha-helical, as revealed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Fluhrer2011The; Yu2017Highefficient). The ECD contains a tetratricopeptide repeat-like (TPR-like) domain, which is crucial for peptide recognition and γ-secretase activity (Zhang2012Identification). 

Nicastrin undergoes complex N-glycosylation, with 16 potential glycosylation sites, although glycosylation is not essential for γ-secretase activity (Zhang2012Identification; Yu2017Highefficient). The quaternary structure involves its assembly into the γ-secretase complex, where it interacts with other components like presenilin, APH-1, and PEN-2 (Yu2017Highefficient; Li2009Toward).

## Function
Nicastrin (NCSTN) is a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, which is involved in the intramembranous proteolytic processing of type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors. This complex plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, such as Notch/GLP-1 signal transduction, which is essential for cell differentiation and development (Yu2000Nicastrin).

Nicastrin functions as a substrate receptor within the γ-secretase complex, facilitating the recognition and binding of substrates through its ectodomain. This interaction is critical for the subsequent cleavage of substrates by γ-secretase, highlighting nicastrin's role in substrate recruitment rather than catalysis (Shah2005Nicastrin). The glycosylation of nicastrin is important for the assembly and function of the γ-secretase complex, ensuring its stability and activity (Choi2020Essential).

In healthy human cells, nicastrin is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it co-localizes with presenilins, indicating its involvement in cellular processing pathways (Yu2000Nicastrin). The proper function of nicastrin is essential for maintaining the integrity of the γ-secretase complex and facilitating its role in cellular signaling and immune responses (Choi2020Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NCSTN gene are implicated in several diseases, most notably hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HS, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, mutations in NCSTN, a component of the γ-secretase complex, are linked to both familial and sporadic forms of the disease. These mutations can lead to defective hair follicle homeostasis, resulting in follicular occlusion and inflammation (Vellaichamy2021Insights; Liu2016Genetic). NCSTN haploinsufficiency has been shown to increase the expression of type I interferon-stimulated genes, contributing to the inflammatory response in HS (Cao2019Nicastrin).

In HCC, NCSTN is frequently overexpressed, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the activation of the β-catenin pathway through Notch1 and AKT signaling, facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Li2020NCSTN). The role of NCSTN in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory skin diseases. Additionally, NCSTN mutations have been associated with familial acne inversa, impacting keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation through the Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways (Xiao2016Nicastrin).

## Interactions
Nicastrin (NCSTN) is a crucial component of the γ-secretase complex, which also includes presenilin (PSEN), APH-1, and PEN-2. This complex is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of several type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch receptors. Nicastrin functions as a substrate receptor within the γ-secretase complex, interacting directly with the C-terminal fragments of APP, such as C99, and Notch, such as N100, to facilitate their cleavage (Shah2005Nicastrin).

The ectodomain of nicastrin is particularly important for substrate recognition, as it binds to the new amino terminus generated upon proteolysis of the extracellular domains of APP and Notch (Shah2005Nicastrin). This interaction is essential for recruiting these substrates into the γ-secretase complex for subsequent cleavage. Nicastrin also interacts with presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2), forming high molecular weight complexes that are crucial for the proteolytic processing of APP and Notch (Yu2000Nicastrin).

Mutations in nicastrin can affect its interaction with presenilin and alter amyloid-β (Aβ) production, highlighting its role in modulating γ-secretase activity and its potential impact on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (Petit2019Extracellular; Yu2000Nicastrin).
