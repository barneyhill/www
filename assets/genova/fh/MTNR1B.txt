# MTNR1B

## Overview
The MTNR1B gene encodes the melatonin receptor 1B (MT2), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the human retina and brain, where it is involved in regulating circadian rhythms and neurobiological functions. MTNR1B is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells, influencing insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, thereby linking it to metabolic regulation and the risk of type 2 diabetes (Bonnefond2016From; Nikolaev2021Membrane). The receptor's ability to interact with G proteins and other signaling molecules underscores its involvement in diverse cellular processes, including the modulation of sleep-wake cycles and metabolic pathways (Qiu2022Melatonin; Reppert1995Molecular). Genetic variations in MTNR1B have been associated with altered insulin release and increased fasting plasma glucose levels, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic disorders (Sparsø2009Gallele; Staiger2008Polymorphisms).

## Structure
The MTNR1B gene encodes the melatonin receptor 1B (MT2), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is characterized by a primary structure of 362 amino acids, forming seven transmembrane (TM)-spanning α-helical segments typical of GPCRs (Bonnefond2012Rare; Nikolaev2021Membrane). These helices are connected by alternating intracellular and extracellular loops, with the amino terminus located extracellularly and the carboxyl terminus intracellularly (Nikolaev2021Membrane).

The MT2 receptor features specific motifs, such as an NRY motif downstream of the third transmembrane domain and an NAXIY motif in transmembrane motif 7, distinguishing it from other GPCRs that typically have DRY and NPXXY motifs (Nikolaev2021Membrane). The receptor also contains conserved cysteines and residues like Asn175 and His208, which are crucial for ligand binding (Nikolaev2021Membrane).

Post-translational modifications include an N-terminal asparagine-linked glycosylation site and phosphorylation sites at the carboxyl terminus for casein kinase 1α, casein kinase II, and protein kinase C. These modifications may influence receptor function and membrane localization (Nikolaev2021Membrane). The MT2 receptor can form homo- and heterodimers, affecting its pharmacological profile and signaling pathways (Nikolaev2021Membrane).

## Function
The MTNR1B gene encodes the melatonin receptor 1B (MT2), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological processes. This receptor is primarily expressed in the human retina and brain, where it plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms and neurobiological functions. In the retina, MTNR1B is involved in mediating melatonin's effects, such as inhibiting the Ca2+-dependent release of dopamine, which influences light-dependent functions like photopigment disc shedding and phagocytosis (Reppert1995Molecular).

MTNR1B is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it influences insulin secretion. Variants in this gene have been associated with altered insulin release and increased fasting plasma glucose levels, contributing to the risk of type 2 diabetes (Bonnefond2016From). The receptor's signaling through Gi/o proteins and β-arrestin1/2 affects glucose homeostasis, highlighting its role in metabolic regulation (Nikolaev2021Membrane).

In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, MTNR1B is involved in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and other circadian processes, as it is activated by melatonin at subnanomolar concentrations, influencing various cellular and physiological responses (Nikolaev2021Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and genetic variations in the MTNR1B gene, which encodes the melatonin receptor 1B, have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within MTNR1B, such as rs10830963, are associated with higher fasting plasma glucose levels and decreased insulin secretion, contributing to β-cell dysfunction and increased diabetes risk (Sparsø2009Gallele; Staiger2008Polymorphisms). The minor G allele of rs10830963 is particularly noted for its association with impaired fasting glycemia and type 2 diabetes, as it leads to decreased insulin release and hepatic insulin resistance (Sparsø2009Gallele).

The MTNR1B gene's role in circadian rhythm regulation also implicates it in glucose metabolism. Variants like rs1387153, located near MTNR1B, have been shown to modulate fasting plasma glucose levels and increase type 2 diabetes risk, potentially through melatonin signaling pathways that affect insulin secretion (BouatiaNaji2008A). Alterations in MTNR1B expression, particularly in pancreatic islets, have been correlated with impaired insulin secretion, further linking this gene to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Lyssenko2008Common). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MTNR1B in metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
MTNR1B, or melatonin receptor 1B, is involved in several protein interactions that mediate its biological effects. It primarily interacts with the G protein Gαi2, which is crucial for its signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, where MTNR1B activation by melatonin leads to the recruitment of Gαi2, regulating downstream signaling pathways that affect cell metabolism and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) (Qiu2022Melatonin). The MTNR1B/Gαi2 interaction also plays a role in chordoma cells, where it mediates the repression of β-catenin signaling, a pathway involved in cell proliferation and survival. This interaction recruits CSK, leading to the phosphorylation of SRC at Y530, which negatively regulates SRC kinase activity, ultimately suppressing β-catenin signaling (Liu2019MTNR1B).

MTNR1B also influences the phosphorylation and acetylation of β-catenin, affecting its transcriptional activity and nuclear localization. This modulation is linked to the inhibition of SRC kinase activity, which is known to phosphorylate β-catenin and enhance its transcriptional activity (Liu2019MTNR1B). These interactions highlight MTNR1B's role in regulating various cellular processes through its interactions with G proteins and other signaling molecules.
