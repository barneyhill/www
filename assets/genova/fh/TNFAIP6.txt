# TNFAIP6

## Overview
TNFAIP6, also known as tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6, is a gene that encodes the TSG-6 protein, a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling. The TSG-6 protein is categorized as a secreted glycoprotein and is characterized by its ability to interact with various components of the extracellular matrix, including hyaluronan and inter-α-inhibitor. These interactions are crucial for modulating cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses. TNFAIP6 expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, and the protein plays a significant role in maintaining skin integrity, extracellular matrix organization, and immune modulation. It is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory skin diseases, urothelial carcinomas, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute ischemic stroke, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease activity and prognosis (Evrard2021Deletion; Yu2016TNFAIP6; Chan2019High; Qu2022Plasma).

## Structure
The TNFAIP6 protein, also known as TSG-6, is a 35 kDa secreted glycoprotein involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling. It is composed mainly of contiguous Link and CUB modules. The Link module is a hyaluronan-binding domain, which allows TNFAIP6 to interact with various glycosaminoglycans and proteins, including hyaluronan, chondroitin 4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin, inter-α-inhibitor, versican, aggrecan, thrombospondin-1, and PTX3 (Danchuk2011Human; Sayasith2007Molecular). The CUB domain is found in various proteins involved in fertilization and development, although its precise physiological role in TNFAIP6 remains unclear (Sayasith2007Molecular).

TNFAIP6 is often glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that may affect its function and stability (Sayasith2007Molecular). The protein can exist in different forms, including monomeric, dimeric, and glycosylated forms, as well as complexes with heavy chains of inter-alpha-inhibitor (IaI) (Sayasith2007Molecular). These structural features contribute to its role in modulating cell adhesion and migration, as well as its anti-inflammatory properties. The protein's ability to bind and sequester hyaluronan fragments is crucial for inhibiting neutrophil activation and migration, as well as tissue remodeling (Danchuk2011Human).

## Function
TNFAIP6, also known as TSG-6, is a protein involved in various molecular processes crucial for maintaining skin integrity and function. It plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the skin, particularly in the epidermis, where it is secreted by fibroblasts and other cell types in response to proinflammatory stimuli. TSG-6 interacts with hyaluronic acid (HA) to enhance its binding to the CD44 receptor, which is important for keratinocyte adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. This interaction helps maintain a pericellular matrix around keratinocytes, which is essential for proper ECM organization and cell migration (Evrard2021Deletion).

In healthy skin, TSG-6 is present in both the dermis and living epidermal layers, and its expression increases upon skin injury. It is involved in ECM remodeling and barrier functions, contributing to the retention of HA within the epidermis. This retention is crucial for maintaining skin barrier function and responding to inflammatory and infectious challenges (Evrard2021Deletion). TSG-6 also plays a role in modulating immune responses, as it is induced by inflammatory cytokines and is associated with conditions like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (Evrard2021Deletion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TNFAIP6 gene, which encodes the TSG-6 protein, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, TNFAIP6 is significantly upregulated in response to inflammatory cytokines, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory response and extracellular matrix stabilization in these diseases (Evrard2021Deletion). 

In urothelial carcinomas (UC), high TNFAIP6 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including increased risk of cancer-specific deaths and metastatic tumor dissemination. This suggests that TNFAIP6 may play a role in tumor progression and could serve as a prognostic biomarker for UC (Chan2019High). 

TNFAIP6 is also elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where it correlates with disease activity and established inflammatory markers. This indicates its potential as a biomarker for assessing disease activity in IBD (Yu2016TNFAIP6). 

In non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (AIS), elevated plasma levels of TNFAIP6 are associated with worse clinical outcomes, suggesting its role as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator for AIS (Qu2022Plasma).

## Interactions
TNFAIP6, also known as TSG-6, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins and components of the extracellular matrix. It forms complexes with inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), facilitating the covalent transfer of heavy chains onto hyaluronan (HA), a process crucial for the stabilization of HA-rich matrices in inflammatory conditions (Rugg2005Characterization). This transfer involves TSG-6 acting as a catalyst, allowing the recycling of TSG-6 to form new complexes with IαI (Rugg2005Characterization).

TSG-6 also interacts with CD44, a cell surface receptor, enhancing the binding of HA to CD44-positive cells, which is significant for cell adhesion and migration (Baranova2013Interαinhibitor). However, the presence of IαI can impair this TSG-6-induced cross-linking of HA, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in HA binding (Baranova2013Interαinhibitor).

In addition, TSG-6 can noncovalently crosslink HA, a process modulated by other molecules such as heparin, heparan sulfate, and Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), which inhibit HA binding to TSG-6 (Sin2022Noncovalent). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TSG-6 in modulating the extracellular matrix and influencing cellular processes.
