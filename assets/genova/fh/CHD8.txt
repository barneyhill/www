# CHD8

## Overview
The CHD8 gene encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8, a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein functions as an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, playing a critical role in modulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. CHD8 is characterized by several conserved domains, including chromo, helicase ATP-binding, and helicase C-terminal domains, which are essential for its function in chromatin dynamics. The protein is also intrinsically disordered, with regions that facilitate interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids, contributing to its role in transcription regulation and neurodevelopment. Mutations in the CHD8 gene are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (SNM2020Autism; Thompson2008CHD8; Hoffmann2021Chromatin).

## Structure
The CHD8 protein is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family and is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein consists of 2,581 amino acids and includes key domains such as the Chromo domain (640-790aa), Helicase ATP-binding (807-1009aa), SNF2 N (825-1101aa), and Helicase C-terminal (1137-1288aa) (SNM2020Autism). These domains are essential for its function and are highly conserved, with a low SNP density but high sensitivity to variations (SNM2020Autism).

CHD8 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with two distinct intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) located at the N-terminal (around amino acids 1-600) and C-terminal regions (2500-2570 amino acids) (SNM2020Autism). These IDRs are rich in polar amino acids like proline and serine, while aromatic and positively charged amino acids are depleted. The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, carboxylation, ubiquitination, sulfation, and acetylation, with phosphorylation being the most common (SNM2020Autism).

CHD8 interacts with numerous proteins, forming part of a complex network involved in transcription regulation, and is associated with neurodevelopmental roles (SNM2020Autism). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in maintaining chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation.

## Function
The CHD8 gene encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin structure. In healthy human cells, CHD8 is involved in transcriptional regulation through its interaction with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. CHD8 binds to the promoters of several β-catenin-responsive genes, such as Axin2, Dkk1, and Nkd2, and functions as a negative regulator of these genes, thereby modulating β-catenin-mediated transcription (Thompson2008CHD8).

CHD8 also plays a significant role in maintaining neural progenitor proliferation and cortical development by regulating cell cycle genes and Wnt signaling. It binds directly to the promoters of cell cycle genes, facilitating their expression, and targets the PRC2 complex to regulate neurogenic divisions, ensuring the generation of appropriate numbers of neurons during cortical development (Durak2016Chd8).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, CHD8 is involved in chromatin remodeling by altering nucleosome positioning, which is essential for regulating gene expression. This activity is dependent on ATP hydrolysis, highlighting the necessity of its ATPase function for chromatin remodeling (Thompson2008CHD8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHD8 gene are significantly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are considered high-confidence risk factors for this condition. These mutations often lead to a loss of function and include frameshift, nonsense, missense, translocation, single nucleic acid deletion, and splice site variant mutations (Hoffmann2021Single-Cell; Hoffmann2021Chromatin). Individuals with CHD8 mutations frequently exhibit macrocephaly, facial dysmorphisms, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and sleep disturbances (Yasin2019A; Hoffmann2021Chromatin). 

CHD8 mutations are linked to a distinct neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by ASD, macrocephaly, and gastrointestinal problems (Yasin2019A). In some cases, these mutations are associated with regression in language and reasoning abilities (Merner2016A). Animal studies have shown that altered CHD8 expression can lead to impaired neurodevelopmental processes, such as reduced dendritic arborization and deficits in social behavior, which are consistent with ASD-like symptoms (Hoffmann2021Chromatin). 

CHD8 is also implicated in cancer pathways, as its binding sites are enriched for genes involved in pathways such as p53 and cell cycle regulation, suggesting a potential overlap between ASD and cancer (Barnard2015Mutations).

## Interactions
CHD8 is involved in various physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It interacts with elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), specifically with its phosphorylated forms, suggesting a role in transcription elongation (RodríguezParedes2009The). CHD8 also binds to histone H3 di-methylated at lysine 4, which may contribute to its recruitment to target genes (RodríguezParedes2009The).

CHD8 interacts with the transcription factor hStaf, contributing to transcription activation, and is localized on U6 and U1 promoters in vivo (Yuan2007CHD8). It also forms a complex with β-catenin, regulating β-catenin target genes and participating in the Wnt signaling pathway (Thompson2008CHD8). CHD8 is part of a large multisubunit complex, interacting with components of the MLL and CoREST chromatin-modifying complexes, as well as the SWI/SNF and NuRD ATP-dependent remodeling complexes (Thompson2008CHD8).

CHD8 interacts with CTCF, an insulator binding protein, affecting transcriptional regulation by maintaining boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin (Hall2007CHD). It also interacts with CHD7, another member of the CHD family, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional elongation (Batsukh2010CHD8).
