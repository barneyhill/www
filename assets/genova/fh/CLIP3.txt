# CLIP3

## Overview
CLIP3, or CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. The protein is categorized as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating the transport of cellular components. CLIP3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the growing ends of microtubules, where it contributes to cell shape, division, and intracellular signaling (Zhou2019GenomeWide). In addition to its structural roles, CLIP3 is implicated in metabolic processes, such as glucose metabolism, by regulating the trafficking of glucose transporters like GLUT3 to the cellular membrane (Kang2021Downregulated). The gene's expression and function are also influenced by interactions with other proteins and microRNAs, which can impact cellular processes such as insulin-regulated glucose metabolism and glioblastoma progression (Kang2021Downregulated; Yang2016MicroRNA5933p).

## Structure


## Function
CLIP3 (CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 3) is involved in microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. It functions as a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, playing a role in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating the transport of cellular components. CLIP3 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the growing ends of microtubules, contributing to cell shape, division, and intracellular signaling (Zhou2019GenomeWide).

In healthy human cells, CLIP3 is implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism. It is involved in the trafficking of glucose transporters, such as GLUT3, to the cellular membrane, which is crucial for glucose uptake (Kang2021Downregulated). This function is consistent with its role in vesicle and organelle transportation along the cytoskeletal network. CLIP3's interaction with microtubules and cellular organelles suggests its involvement in cellular structural organization and intracellular transport processes (Zhou2019GenomeWide).

CLIP3 also plays a role in insulin-regulated glucose metabolism by interacting with miR-593-3p, which targets CLIP3 to modulate its expression. This interaction affects insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and lactate production, indicating CLIP3's involvement in metabolic processes (Yang2016MicroRNA5933p).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLIP3 gene have been implicated in the development and progression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor. Downregulation of CLIP3 is associated with increased radioresistance in GBM cells by enhancing stemness and glycolytic flux, which are critical for tumor survival and growth under therapeutic stress (Kang2021Downregulated). The study by Kang et al. suggests that the Spy1-CLIP3 axis plays a significant role in this process, where Spy1 negatively regulates CLIP3 transcription, leading to increased glycolytic activity and stemness in GBM cells (Kang2021Downregulated).

In addition to its role in GBM, CLIP3 is also involved in insulin-regulated glucose metabolism. The microRNA miR-593-3p targets CLIP3, negatively regulating insulin-stimulated glucose consumption and lactate production. This interaction suggests that CLIP3 may play a role in metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, and potentially in cancer development, as alterations in its expression are observed in liver cancer tissues (Yang2016MicroRNA5933p). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CLIP3 in both cancer and metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
CLIP3, or CAP-Gly domain containing linker protein 3, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. In glioblastoma (GBM) cells, CLIP3 is regulated by the protein Spy1, which negatively influences its transcription through CDK2/NRF1 signaling. Spy1 activation of CDK2 decreases the DNA binding activity of NRF1, a transcriptional activator of CLIP3, thereby reducing CLIP3 transcription by releasing NRF1 from its promoter (Kang2021Downregulated).

CLIP3 also plays a role in the regulation of GLUT3 trafficking, which is crucial for glucose uptake in GBM cells. It disrupts Rab11a-positive endosomes, affecting the translocation of GLUT3 to the plasma membrane. This interaction suggests that CLIP3 may interact with cytoskeletal molecules to mediate GLUT3 translocation, as it contains a CAP-Gly domain involved in vesicle and organelle transportation along the cytoskeletal network (Kang2021Downregulated).

The study also highlights the potential of glimepiride, a diabetes drug, to activate CLIP3, which in turn suppresses GLUT3 cell surface trafficking. This suggests an indirect mechanism where targeting CLIP3 could disrupt glioblastoma stem cells without the side effects associated with direct GLUT3 inhibition (Kang2021Downregulated).
