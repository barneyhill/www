# CD302

## Overview
The CD302 gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein that functions as a C-type lectin receptor, primarily involved in cell adhesion and migration. The CD302 protein is characterized by a C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which facilitates carbohydrate binding, a feature common among proteins in the C-type lectin superfamily (Lo2016Characterization). This receptor is predominantly expressed in myeloid-derived cells, such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and is notably abundant in the liver, lungs, and spleen (Lo2016Characterization). CD302 plays a crucial role in the immune system by aiding the migration of dendritic cells to lymph nodes, thereby contributing to the priming of T cells (Lo2016Characterization). Additionally, CD302 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and low-grade glioma, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Lo2019Examination; An2020OSlgg:). The receptor's involvement in hepatitis C virus infection further underscores its significance in immune regulation and potential as a therapeutic target (Brown2020Liverexpressed).

## Structure
The CD302 protein is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a single C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which is a common feature in proteins that bind carbohydrates (Lo2016Characterization). The primary structure of CD302 includes a signal peptide, a CTLD, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Lo2016Characterization). The CTLD is defined by a double-loop structure stabilized by conserved disulfide bridges, which is typical of the C-type lectin superfamily (Brown2020Liverexpressed).

The protein's secondary structure is predicted to contain eight beta strands and two alpha helices, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (Lo2016Characterization). The tertiary structure of CD302 includes a canonical CTLD fold with a long loop region involved in Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate binding (Brown2020Liverexpressed).

CD302 is associated with the F-actin cytoskeleton within podosomes and lamellopodia, which are important for cell adhesion and migration (Lo2016Characterization). The protein is glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification that affects its function and stability (Chen2016Molecular). A splice variant lacking the spacer region encoded by exon 5 has been reported in mice, but not detected in humans (Lo2016Characterization).

## Function
The CD302 gene encodes a C-type lectin receptor that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and migration, particularly in dendritic cells (DCs) and other myeloid-derived cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. In humans, CD302 is primarily expressed in the liver, lungs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and spleen, with the highest expression in the liver (Lo2016Characterization). The receptor is involved in the migration of DCs from peripheral sites to lymph nodes, facilitating their movement through lymphatics and entry into draining lymph nodes, which is crucial for the priming of T cells to peripheral antigens (Lo2016Characterization).

CD302 colocalizes with F-actin-rich structures such as filopodia, lamellopodia, and podosomes, indicating its role in cell migration and adhesion (Lo2019Examination; Lo2016Characterization). Although a specific ligand for CD302 has not been identified, it is implicated in antigen uptake, albeit less efficiently than other receptors like CD205 or CD206 (Lo2016Characterization). The receptor's expression is modulated by the activation state of macrophages, with increased expression in M2 macrophages and decreased expression in M1 macrophages (Lo2016Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD302 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CD302 is highly expressed on leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in most patients, with particularly high expression in cases with monocytic differentiation. This expression pattern suggests that CD302 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for AML, as targeting it with monoclonal antibodies has shown efficacy in mediating antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and limiting leukemic cell engraftment in preclinical models (Lo2019Examination).

In low-grade glioma (LGG), elevated CD302 expression is associated with worse survival outcomes, indicating its role as an unfavorable prognostic predictor. High CD302 expression in LGG is linked to pathways involved in tumor progression, such as JAK/STAT signaling and cytokine receptor interaction (An2020OSlgg:).

Additionally, CD302 has been studied in the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, where its expression in murine hepatocytes appears to limit HCV permissiveness, suggesting a role in controlling viral infections (Brown2020Liverexpressed).

## Interactions
CD302, a C-type lectin receptor, is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses. It physically interacts with the Cr1l protein, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that CD302 and Cr1l may bind each other and act cooperatively to exert an anti-HCV effect (Brown2020Liverexpressed). This interaction is significant in restricting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by impeding the virus's entry into cells, potentially by competing with virus binding to canonical entry factors (Brown2020Liverexpressed).

CD302 is also associated with cell adhesion and migration, as it colocalizes with podosomes and lamellopodia structures, which are important for these processes (Lo2016Characterization). Although specific protein interactions in these contexts are not detailed, CD302's role in dendritic cell migration suggests potential interactions with lymphatic endothelial ligands (Lo2016Characterization). The receptor is highly expressed in migratory myeloid dendritic cells and is involved in their movement from lymphatics to lymph nodes, affecting immune cell distribution (Lo2016Characterization). These interactions highlight CD302's role in modulating immune responses and cellular dynamics.
