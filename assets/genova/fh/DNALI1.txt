# DNALI1

## Overview
The DNALI1 gene encodes the dynein axonemal light intermediate chain 1 protein, which is a crucial component of the inner dynein arms (IDAs) in flagella and cilia. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly and function of these structures, particularly in sperm motility and brain ciliary function. As a part of the dynein motor protein complex, DNALI1 is involved in intracellular transport processes and is essential for the proper localization of dynein heavy chain subunits within the flagella. Mutations in the DNALI1 gene have been linked to severe asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility, and hydrocephalus in mice, highlighting its importance in male fertility and brain function (Wu2023DNALI1; Sha2023Homozygous).

## Function
The DNALI1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the inner dynein arms (IDAs) in flagella, which are essential for the proper assembly and function of these structures in healthy human cells. DNALI1 is involved in the assembly of the flagellar inner dynein arms and the fibrous sheath, both of which are crucial for sperm motility. The protein interacts with specific dynein heavy chain subunits, such as DNAH1 and DNAH7, and is necessary for their proper localization within the flagella (Wu2023DNALI1). DNALI1 is strongly expressed in spermatocytes, spermatids, and the flagella of mature sperm, indicating its significant role in male reproduction. It is linked to the C-terminus of DNAH1, and its proper function is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the axoneme, a key component of the sperm flagellum (Sha2023Homozygous).

In addition to its role in sperm motility, DNALI1 is also a component of brain cilia, where its deficiency can lead to hydrocephalus in mice, indicating its role in ciliary function (Wu2023DNALI1). The protein is evolutionarily conserved and is involved in intracellular transport processes, as it is associated with dynein-1 and dynactin complex subunits, suggesting a role in the cytoplasmic transport of flagellogenesis-based cargoes during sperm morphogenesis (Wu2023DNALI1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNALI1 gene are associated with male infertility, specifically severe asthenozoospermia (AZS), a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. A homozygous frameshift mutation [c.663_666del (p.Glu221fs)] in DNALI1 has been identified in patients with AZS, leading to a complete loss of the DNALI1 protein in sperm. This deficiency disrupts the assembly of the flagellar inner dynein arms and the fibrous sheath, which are crucial for sperm motility, resulting in male infertility (Wu2023DNALI1).

In addition to its role in sperm motility, DNALI1 mutations have been linked to hydrocephalus in mice, a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to enlarged head size. This suggests that DNALI1 is also a component of brain cilia, although it is not expressed in respiratory cilia, indicating tissue-specific expression (Wu2023DNALI1; Zhou2023Dnali1).

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been suggested as an effective treatment for infertility caused by DNALI1 mutations, as demonstrated in both human cases and Dnali1-mutated mice (Wu2023DNALI1; Zhou2023Dnali1).

## Interactions
The DNALI1 protein is involved in several critical interactions that are essential for sperm flagellum assembly and function. It interacts with the MEIG1/PACRG complex within the manchette, a structure crucial for transporting proteins necessary for flagellum assembly. DNALI1 stabilizes PACRG, enhancing its protein stability without affecting its mRNA levels, as demonstrated in mammalian COS-1 cells and bacteria (Yap2023DNALI1). This stabilization is crucial for the proper localization and function of the MEIG1/PACRG complex during spermatogenesis (Yap2023DNALI1).

DNALI1 is also part of the inner dynein arm (IDA) component, which is essential for the beating of cilia and flagella, contributing to sperm motility. It interacts with dynein heavy chain 1, facilitating the transport of cargo proteins along the manchette microtubules (Yap2023DNALI1). Additionally, DNALI1 has been shown to interact with Î³-actin, supporting its involvement in spermiation and individualization (Yap2023DNALI1).

The interaction between DNALI1 and PACRG has been confirmed through various experimental approaches, including yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and luciferase complementation assays, highlighting its role in sperm flagellum assembly and male fertility (Yap2023DNALI1).
