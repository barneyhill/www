# RUNX3

## Overview
RUNX3 is a gene that encodes the RUNX family transcription factor 3, a pivotal protein involved in regulating gene expression across various biological processes. As a transcription factor, RUNX3 plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of hematopoietic and immune cells, influencing lineage decisions and maintaining immune homeostasis (Balogh2019RUNX3; Mevel2019RUNX). RUNX3 is also integral to TGF-β-mediated signaling pathways, impacting dendritic cell function and immune responses (Fainaru2004Runx3). In addition to its physiological roles, RUNX3 is implicated in cancer biology, where it can function as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cellular context. Its interactions with various proteins and post-translational modifications further modulate its activity and stability, highlighting its complex role in oncogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Kanumuri2021Small; Toska2023RUNX3).

## Structure


## Function
RUNX3 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in various cellular and molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), maintaining the balance between erythroid and myeloid lineages. RUNX3 expression declines with age, leading to a shift towards myeloid lineage at the expense of erythroid lineage, which is associated with aging-related anemias (Balogh2019RUNX3). In the immune system, RUNX3 is essential for T cell development, particularly influencing the lineage choice between CD4 and CD8 T cells. It acts as a transcriptional silencer for Cd4 in cytotoxic T-lineage cells and positively regulates Cd8 expression, promoting the cytotoxic T cell fate (Mevel2019RUNX).

RUNX3 also plays a significant role in dendritic cell (DC) function, particularly in TGF-β-mediated signaling. It regulates the maturation and function of DCs, ensuring proper immune responses and preventing excessive inflammatory reactions (Fainaru2004Runx3). In myeloid development, RUNX3 expression is higher in monocytes compared to granulocytes, indicating its role in differential myeloid cell differentiation (Menezes2022Increased). Overall, RUNX3 is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and proper cell differentiation in various hematopoietic and immune cell lineages.

## Clinical Significance
RUNX3 is a transcription factor with significant implications in various cancers due to its role in gene regulation. In gastric cancer, a loss or decrease in RUNX3 expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, and its restoration can suppress tumor growth and metastasis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wei2005Loss). In bladder cancer, RUNX3 is frequently inactivated through promoter hypermethylation and point mutations, contributing to tumor development and progression. This inactivation is linked to tumor recurrence and progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Kim2005RUNX3).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RUNX3 expression varies across subtypes. Overexpression is linked to poorer survival outcomes, particularly in non-core binding factor AML, where it inhibits normal myeloid development and is associated with chemoresistance (Menezes2022Increased). RUNX3 also plays a role in colorectal cancer, where its inactivation leads to increased oncogenic Wnt activity, contributing to cancer progression (Ito2011RUNX3). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, RUNX3 acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Kudo2011Oncogenic).

## Interactions
RUNX3, a transcription factor, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes and cancer. RUNX3 interacts with PAK1, a kinase that phosphorylates RUNX3 at threonine 209, a modification crucial for its oncogenic transformation. This interaction can be disrupted by the RMR peptide, which inhibits RUNX3 phosphorylation and affects the TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways (Kanumuri2021Small).

RUNX3 also interacts with ZEB1 in the context of chronic lung injury induced by methamphetamine abuse. This interaction, confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, affects cellular localization and viability, with ZEB1 moving from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and RUNX3 expression decreasing in the cytoplasm (Bao2022Proteinprotein).

In cancer, RUNX3 is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of oncogenic proteins. It interacts with GLI1 in colorectal cancer, MYCN in neuroblastoma, and HIF-1α in gastric carcinoma, facilitating their degradation. RUNX3's stability is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation, which influence its interactions and degradation (Toska2023RUNX3). These interactions highlight RUNX3's dual role as a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the cellular context.
