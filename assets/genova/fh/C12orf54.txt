# C12orf54

## Overview
C12orf54 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 54. This protein is categorized as a cancer testis antigen (CTA), which is typically expressed in the testis and various cancer cells, such as those found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Djureinovic2016Profiling). The expression of C12orf54 is notably altered in certain pathological conditions, including Pearson syndrome and specific cancer types, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Lareau2022Singlecell). Additionally, C12orf54 is involved in the differentiation processes of stem-precursor cells in the limbal-corneal epithelium, although its exact biological functions and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Wolosin2024A).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C12orf54 has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression levels. In Pearson syndrome (PS), a rare mitochondrial disorder, C12orf54 is specifically expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of affected individuals, while its expression in healthy adults is largely restricted to the testis. This suggests that C12orf54 may serve as a candidate biomarker for PS, although its specific clinical significance remains undefined (Lareau2022Singlecell).

In the context of cancer, C12orf54 has been identified as a cancer testis antigen (CTA) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in squamous carcinoma patients. Its expression is exclusive to these cancer cells, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis or as a target for cancer immunotherapy (Djureinovic2016Profiling).

Additionally, C12orf54 undergoes significant changes in expression during the transition of stem-precursor cells in the limbal-corneal epithelium, although the clinical implications of this are not yet clear (Wolosin2024A). Despite these associations, the precise role of C12orf54 in these conditions and its potential as a therapeutic target require further investigation.
