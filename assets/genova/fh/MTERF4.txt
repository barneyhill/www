# MTERF4

## Overview
MTERF4 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial transcription termination factor 4, a protein integral to mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis and transcription regulation. This protein is characterized by its canonical MTERF fold, which is essential for its ability to bind nucleic acids, thereby playing a pivotal role in mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 4 forms a complex with the rRNA methyltransferase NSUN4, facilitating the modification of mitochondrial rRNA, which is crucial for the assembly and stability of mitochondrial ribosomes. The protein's function is vital for maintaining normal mitochondrial activity and energy metabolism, and its disruption can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction and developmental defects. MTERF4's involvement in various diseases, including mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, highlights its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Yakubovskaya2012Structure; Ye2015MTERF4; Cámara2011MTERF4).

## Structure
MTERF4 is a protein involved in mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis and transcription regulation. It is characterized by a canonical MTERF fold, which consists of repeating MTERF motifs that form a superhelical structure. This fold is conserved across the MTERF family and is crucial for nucleic acid binding (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). The protein's structure includes a C-terminal distorted MTERF motif and additional alpha helices that facilitate its interaction with the rRNA methyltransferase NSUN4 (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). 

The interaction between MTERF4 and NSUN4 is primarily electrostatic, with a central patch of hydrophobic residues, and involves specific regions of both proteins, including a non-conserved loop and an alpha-helix in NSUN4 (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). MTERF4 forms a stable complex with NSUN4, characterized by a high affinity and low entropy of association, indicating that polar amino acids mediate the interaction (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). 

MTERF4's C-terminal tail, although not directly involved in the interaction with NSUN4, may play a role in increasing binding specificity or mediating additional protein interactions (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). The protein's structure allows it to bind both DNA and RNA, highlighting its versatility in mitochondrial gene expression regulation (Yakubovskaya2012Structure).

## Function
MTERF4 is a crucial protein involved in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and function. It forms a complex with the rRNA methyltransferase NSUN4, which is essential for targeting NSUN4 to the large ribosomal subunit in mitochondria. This interaction enhances the specificity of NSUN4 during methylation, a process vital for ribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation (Yakubovskaya2012Structure; Cámara2011MTERF4). MTERF4 binds to mitochondrial rRNA, facilitating the modification of 16S rRNA, which is necessary for the stability and assembly of functional ribosomes (Yakubovskaya2012Structure; Cámara2011MTERF4).

In healthy human cells, MTERF4 is predominantly localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a key role in regulating mitochondrial translation by ensuring the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits. The absence of MTERF4 leads to defects in ribosomal assembly, resulting in impaired mitochondrial translation and increased transcription of mitochondrial DNA as a compensatory response (Ye2015MTERF4; Cámara2011MTERF4). MTERF4 is essential for normal mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, and its disruption can lead to severe developmental defects and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ye2015MTERF4; Cámara2011MTERF4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the MTERF4 gene have been implicated in several diseases due to its critical role in mitochondrial function. In the context of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, disruption of MTERF4 in the heart leads to increased heart size, reduced lifespan, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, highlighting its importance in cardiac health (Cámara2011MTERF4). In Alzheimer's disease, overexpression of MTERF4 promotes amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by inhibiting ADAM10, a key enzyme in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This shift increases the production of neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides, suggesting a role for MTERF4 in Alzheimer's pathogenesis (Wang2017Overexpression).

In Parkinson's disease models, MTERF4 knockdown exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to increased reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. Conversely, overexpression of MTERF4 can partially restore mitochondrial function, indicating its protective role against mitochondrial impairment (Ye2015MTERF4). Additionally, MTERF4 has been associated with non-small cell lung cancer, where its expression levels correlate with patient survival, suggesting potential as a prognostic biomarker (Sun2019Prognostic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MTERF4 in various diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Interactions
MTERF4 interacts with the NSUN4 methyltransferase to form a stable complex essential for mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity and is exothermic, with a dissociation constant (K D) of 13.3 nM, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). MTERF4 and NSUN4 form a heterodimer with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and their interaction does not depend on the presence of the SAM cofactor (Yakubovskaya2012Structure). The interaction involves specific regions of both proteins: MTERF4 utilizes the last distorted MTERF motif and two C-terminal alpha helices, while NSUN4 involves an alpha-helix and two small nonconserved loops (Yakubovskaya2012Structure).

MTERF4 is also involved in targeting NSUN4 to the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is crucial for the proper localization and function of NSUN4 in mitochondrial translation (Cámara2011MTERF4). MTERF4 binds to mitochondrial rRNA, including 16S and 12S rRNA, and interacts with NSUN4 to facilitate rRNA modification (Cámara2011MTERF4). This interaction is essential for the assembly of functional mitochondrial ribosomes and the regulation of mitochondrial translation (Cámara2011MTERF4).
