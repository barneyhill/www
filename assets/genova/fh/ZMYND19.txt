# ZMYND19

## Overview
ZMYND19 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYND-type containing 19 protein, which is characterized by the presence of a MYND-type zinc finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's role in mediating protein-protein interactions, facilitated by its ability to bind zinc ions through conserved cysteine and histidine residues (Mugabo2021Docking). The ZMYND19 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including those related to energy balance and cell proliferation, and is associated with several diseases such as cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions. Its involvement in the FABP5P3/miR-589-5p/ZMYND19 axis highlights its role in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2018LncRNA).

## Structure
The ZMYND19 protein is characterized by the presence of a MYND-type zinc finger domain, which is crucial for its function in protein-protein interactions. This domain is known for its ability to bind zinc ions, facilitated by conserved cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the structural integrity and function of zinc finger proteins (Mugabo2021Docking). The protein's tertiary structure involves the folding of these zinc finger domains into a three-dimensional conformation, enabling the recognition of specific nucleotide or protein targets (Mugabo2021Docking).

The predicted 3D model of ZMYND19 has been evaluated for quality, showing a high percentage of residues in the core region, indicating a reliable structural model (Mugabo2021Docking). The docking studies have identified significant interactions with specific amino acids, such as His 45, which is crucial for zinc binding, highlighting the importance of these residues in the protein's functional conformation (Mugabo2021Docking).

While the primary structure, secondary structure, and post-translational modifications of ZMYND19 are not detailed in the available context, the presence of the MYND domain suggests a role in mediating interactions with other proteins, potentially influencing various cellular processes. The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or quaternary structure.

## Clinical Significance
ZMYND19 is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. Alterations in the expression of ZMYND19 have been associated with cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. The protein interacts with the Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH-R1), which is involved in energy balance and food intake. Overexpression of MCH can lead to obesity and cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that ZMYND19 may play a regulatory role in these conditions (Mugabo2021Docking).

In the context of cancer, ZMYND19 is involved in cell regeneration, and defects in its function may lead to cancer development. The study by Zhu et al. highlights the role of ZMYND19 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is upregulated as part of the FABP5P3/miR-589-5p/ZMYND19 axis. This axis contributes to HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating that alterations in ZMYND19 expression are linked to the progression of HCC (Zhu2018LncRNA).

Understanding the interactions between ZMYND19 and cofactors like S-Adenosyl homocysteine (AdoHcy) is crucial, as defects in methylation reactions, which ZMYND19 may regulate, can cause cancer. This interaction suggests potential pathways for drug development targeting cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases (Mugabo2021Docking).
