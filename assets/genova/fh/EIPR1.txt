# EIPR1

## Overview
EIPR1, or EARP complex and GARP complex interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to cellular trafficking processes, particularly in neurons and endocrine cells. The protein encoded by EIPR1 is involved in the regulation and distribution of dense-core vesicles (DCVs), playing a crucial role in the retention and proper localization of DCV cargos such as insulin. It interacts with the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, facilitating the recycling of cargos from endosomes to the plasma membrane, and is also implicated in the retrograde trafficking of certain toxins, indicating a role in a subset of Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) functions. EIPR1's interactions with various protein complexes, including the EARP and GARP complexes, are essential for its function in cellular processes such as endocytic recycling and vesicle cargo sorting. The evolutionary conservation of these interactions suggests an ancient origin for EIPR1's functional role (Cox2024Ancient; Topalidou2020EIPR1).

## Function
The EIPR1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the function of dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in neurons and endocrine cells, particularly in insulin-secreting cells. EIPR1 is essential for the retention and proper distribution of DCV cargos, such as insulin and carboxypeptidase E (CPE), ensuring these cargos are retained in mature DCVs at the cell periphery rather than accumulating near the trans-Golgi network (Topalidou2020EIPR1). EIPR1 interacts with the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, stabilizing and localizing it to membranes, which is crucial for recycling cargos from endosomes back to the plasma membrane (Topalidou2020EIPR1).

In insulin-secreting cells, EIPR1 is necessary for the proper secretion of insulin. Eipr1 knockout cells show reduced insulin secretion and mislocalization of insulin to a perinuclear region overlapping with the trans-Golgi network, which can be corrected by reintroducing the wild-type EIPR1 gene (Topalidou2020EIPR1). EIPR1 also plays a role in the endocytic recycling of transferrin, a process specific to EARP functions, and is involved in the retrograde traffic of certain toxins, indicating its involvement in a subset of GARP functions (Topalidou2020EIPR1).

## Clinical Significance
The EIPR1 gene, also known as TSSC1, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular trafficking processes. Alterations in EIPR1 have been associated with psychiatric disorders, as evidenced by allele-specific DNA methylation studies in monozygotic twins discordant for such conditions. These studies suggest that disease-associated changes at the EIPR1 regulatory loci can modulate neural function, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of disorders like schizophrenia (Li2021Allelespecific).

In the context of insulin secretion, EIPR1 is crucial for the proper function and localization of the EARP complex in insulin-secreting cells. Knockout studies have shown that the absence of EIPR1 leads to reduced insulin secretion and mislocalization of insulin, which could have implications for conditions such as diabetes (Topalidou2020EIPR1).

Additionally, genetic studies have identified an intergenic variant near EIPR1 associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality in coronary artery disease patients, although the precise biological relevance of EIPR1 in this context remains unclear (Dungan2021GenomeWide). Despite these associations, direct links between EIPR1 mutations and specific diseases are still under investigation.

## Interactions
EIPR1, also known as EARP complex and GARP complex interacting protein 1, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily with components of the EARP and GARP complexes. EIPR1 interacts with the EARP complex subunits VPS50, VPS51, VPS52, and VPS53, forming a stable complex that is crucial for the proper localization and function of these subunits in cellular processes such as dense-core vesicle cargo sorting and endocytic recycling (Topalidou2016The; Topalidou2020EIPR1). The interaction of EIPR1 with these subunits has been confirmed in various cell types, including human HEK293T and HeLa cells, as well as rat insulinoma cells (Topalidou2020EIPR1).

EIPR1 also interacts with SNAP29, a SNARE protein involved in late Golgi/endosomal trafficking, suggesting a role in SNARE complex formation (Topalidou2016The). Despite its interactions with the EARP complex, EIPR1 does not affect the physical interactions between GARP complex subunits, indicating a specific role in EARP-related functions (Topalidou2020EIPR1). The interactions of EIPR1 with these complexes are conserved across species, suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin (Cox2024Ancient). There is no evidence of EIPR1 interacting with nucleic acids (Topalidou2016The).
