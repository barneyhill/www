# HSPA4

## Overview
HSPA4 is a gene that encodes the protein heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 4, which is a molecular chaperone belonging to the Hsp70 family. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by assisting in the proper folding of nascent proteins and the refolding of misfolded proteins, thereby preventing protein aggregation. HSPA4 is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and protein quality control, and is active in both the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved ATP-binding domain and a substrate-binding domain, which are essential for its chaperone activity. HSPA4 also functions as a nucleotide exchange factor, forming heterodimers with other HSP70 proteins to enhance chaperoning efficiency. Its interactions with other proteins, such as Hsp90, further contribute to its functional versatility. Clinically, HSPA4 is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis (Brocchieri2008hsp70; Suo2024HSPA4; Mohamed2012Targeted).

## Structure
HSPA4, a member of the Hsp70 family, is characterized by its conserved ATP-binding domain (ABD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD). The ABD is crucial for its ATPase activity, which is essential for its function as a molecular chaperone (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The SBD consists of a beta-sheet region that binds tightly to substrates and an alpha-helix region that acts as a molecular lid, preventing substrate dissociation without nucleotide exchange (Marques2024The). 

HSPA4 functions as a nucleotide exchange factor, forming heterodimers with HSP70 proteins, which enhances its chaperoning efficiency and protein stability under stress conditions (Marques2024The). The protein also contains a TPR1 domain-binding motif, suggesting interactions with Hsp90, which may contribute to its functional versatility (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of HSPA4 are not provided, it is known that the protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which are common in the Hsp70 family (Brocchieri2008hsp70). The gene exhibits multiple mRNA variants and protein isoforms, indicating potential functional diversity (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

## Function
HSPA4, a member of the Hsp70 family, functions as a molecular chaperone involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a vital role in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins and the refolding of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins (Brocchieri2008hsp70; Mohamed2012Targeted). HSPA4 is active in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum, where it assists in cellular stress responses and contributes to organismal resilience to environmental stressors (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

In cardiac cells, HSPA4 is crucial for maintaining normal cardiac structure and function. It prevents pathological cardiac remodeling by ensuring proper protein folding and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis (Mohamed2012Targeted). HSPA4 interacts with other proteins, such as Hsp90, through conserved domains, indicating its involvement in protein stabilization and folding processes (Brocchieri2008hsp70).

The absence of HSPA4 in knockout models has shown to lead to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, highlighting its essential role in protein quality control mechanisms and its unique function in cardiac health (Mohamed2012Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
HSPA4, a member of the Hsp70 family, plays a significant role in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). In gastric cancer, HSPA4 is upregulated and associated with poor overall survival, immune evasion, and tumor progression. This upregulation is linked to the HSPA4/ALKBH5/CD58 axis, which decreases CD58 expression and impairs CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, contributing to immune escape. Despite its association with poor prognosis, high HSPA4 expression may predict better responses to PD1 checkpoint blockade therapy in GC patients (Suo2024HSPA4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, HSPA4 is overexpressed and correlates with higher tumor grades and advanced cancer stages. It is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, with higher expression levels linked to shorter survival. Interfering with HSPA4 expression inhibits tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021The).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, HSPA4 is significantly upregulated and associated with advanced tumor stages and poor overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic factor (Fan2020The).

## Interactions
HSPA4, a member of the Hsp70 family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular stress responses and protein quality control. It interacts with several proteins, including histone deacetylatase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2), STIP1 homology and U-Box containing protein 1 (STUB1), and apoptosis protease activating factor 1 (APAF1) (Park2015HSPA4). HSPA4 also forms part of a chaperone complex with HSP70, enhancing its chaperoning function, which is essential for protein folding and degradation (Marques2024The). This interaction is significant for maintaining cardiac function and preventing protein aggregation (Marques2024The).

HSPA4 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for HSP70, facilitating the exchange of ADP with ATP, which is crucial for the disaggregation and refolding of proteins (Marques2024The). It also interacts with co-chaperones and chaperone-associated factors such as DNAJ proteins and BAG3, which are involved in protein folding and cellular stress responses (Ryu2020Proteomewide). These interactions highlight HSPA4's role in managing protein aggregation and degradation, particularly under stress conditions (Dabbaghizadeh2020Structural).
