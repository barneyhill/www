# VTN

## Overview
The VTN gene encodes vitronectin, a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair. Vitronectin is categorized as an extracellular matrix protein and is involved in interactions with integrins and other cell surface receptors, influencing cellular behavior and signaling pathways (Preissner1998Role). It is present in both blood plasma and the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to the regulation of hemostasis, complement pathways, and vascular remodeling (Preissner1998Role). The protein's structural features, such as its somatomedin B domain and hemopexin-like domain, facilitate its diverse interactions and functions (Shin2019Structure; Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master). Alterations in VTN expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer progression and fibrosis, underscoring its clinical significance (Bera2020Functional; Shen2018The).

## Structure
Vitronectin (VTN) is a glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. The primary structure of vitronectin consists of a single polypeptide chain of 478 amino acids, which includes a 19-amino acid signal peptide (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master). The secondary structure features both beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure is stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its conformation (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master).

Vitronectin contains several important domains, including the somatomedin B (SMB) domain at the N-terminus, which retains biological activity even when cleaved (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master). The protein also has a hemopexin-like domain, which is involved in its interactions with other molecules (Shin2019Structure). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation on tyrosine residues are common, influencing its function and interactions (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master).

Vitronectin exists in both monomeric and multimeric forms, with its quaternary structure influenced by environmental conditions. In aqueous environments, it assumes a 'peanut-shaped' globular conformation, while in non-aqueous environments, it can denature and form multimeric complexes (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master). These structural features enable vitronectin to interact with a variety of cellular receptors and extracellular matrix components, playing a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair.

## Function
Vitronectin (VTN) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and tissue repair. It is involved in cellular adhesion and migration across different cell types by interacting with integrins, such as αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are essential for cell contact and motility, particularly in vascular and tumor cells (Preissner1998Role). Vitronectin acts as a cofactor in regulating pericellular proteolysis and serves as a scavenging factor for end products of the hemostasis and complement systems (Preissner1998Role).

In the context of hemostasis and vascular remodeling, vitronectin interacts with plasminogen activators and thrombin, influencing the transition from blood clotting to fibrinolysis, which is vital for maintaining vessel patency (Preissner1998Role). It also stabilizes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) at sites of vascular injury, aiding in the control of endothelial cell-derived plasminogen activators during early hemostatic plaque formation (Preissner1998Role).

Vitronectin is present in the extracellular matrix and blood plasma, where it influences cell signaling and structural integrity. It is involved in the formation of capillary-like structures during angiogenesis and is expressed on growing vessels, highlighting its role in vascular remodeling and wound healing (Preissner1998Role). Additionally, vitronectin reduces apoptosis in microvascular endothelial cells, providing a survival advantage that is crucial for angiogenesis and tissue repair (Isik1998Vitronectin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the VTN gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT), increased VTN expression is associated with exacerbated pulmonary fibrosis. Overexpression of VTN leads to up-regulation of fibrosis-related proteins such as collagen I, collagen III, and α-SMA, while knockdown of VTN reduces these effects, suggesting its role in promoting lung fibrosis through pathways like PI3K/AKT, ERK, and JNK (Shen2018The).

In breast cancer, VTN expression levels are linked to disease progression and prognosis. Amplification of the VTN gene is associated with decreased survival rates, and higher serum VTN levels are observed in recurrent breast cancer patients. This suggests that VTN could serve as a biomarker for breast cancer recurrence and prognosis (Bera2020Functional).

VTN also plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the blood-CNS barrier. In Vtn -/- mice, the absence of vitronectin leads to increased transcytosis and barrier leakage, highlighting its importance in barrier function. This suggests potential implications for diseases involving blood-CNS barrier dysfunction (Ayloo2021Pericytetoendothelial).

## Interactions
Vitronectin (VTN) is a glycoprotein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and signaling. VTN interacts with integrins, specifically αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are important for mediating its effects on cytokine expression in the brain, particularly the activation of LIF and IL-6 through integrin-FAK and uPAR signaling pathways (Keasey2018Blood). These interactions are significant in inflammatory processes and neural stem cell behavior (Keasey2018Blood).

VTN also binds to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). This binding is crucial for cell signaling and adhesion, and it can be disrupted by specific inhibitors (Liu2015A). The interaction between VTN and uPAR is involved in cell motility and invasion, as demonstrated in studies using cell lines such as HEK-293 and MDA-MB-231 (Liu2015A).

VTN's role extends to interactions with the complement system and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), contributing to its involvement in coagulation and inflammation (Leavesley2013Vitronectin—Master). These interactions highlight VTN's multifaceted role in physiological and pathological processes.
