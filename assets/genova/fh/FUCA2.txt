# FUCA2

## Overview
The FUCA2 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase 2, which is a lysosomal enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of fucose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a critical role in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, influencing various cellular processes such as cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and immune response (Duarte2016GenomeWide; Leal2022FUCA2). Structurally, alpha-L-fucosidase 2 features a two-domain fold with a catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain, although it lacks the typical β-sandwich structure found in other α-L-fucosidases (Intra2007Comparative). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown and recycling of biomolecules. Alterations in FUCA2 expression and function have been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker due to its association with tumor progression and immune response modulation (Zhong2021FUCA2).

## Structure
The FUCA2 gene encodes the alpha-L-fucosidase 2 enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of fucose-containing compounds. The molecular structure of FUCA2 includes a highly conserved gene structure across vertebrates, typically consisting of 7 or 8 exons, with an exception in Bos taurus, which has an additional intron (Intra2007Comparative). The enzyme features a two-domain fold, with an N-terminal (β/α)8-TIM barrel catalytic domain and a β-sandwich C-terminal domain, although the C-terminal region of FUCA2 does not present a β-sandwich structure similar to other α-L-fucosidases (Intra2007Comparative).

The catalytic mechanism of FUCA2 involves conserved amino acids, including aspartate (D)-224 as the catalytic nucleophile. However, the catalytic acid/base glutamate residue is absent in the sixth β-strand of the (β/α)8-barrel, suggesting potential differences in substrate specificity or catalytic mechanisms (Intra2007Comparative). The presence of conserved cysteine residues may play a functional role, as indicated by the inhibition of α-L-fucosidase activity by silver ions (Intra2007Comparative). The enzyme is generally lysosomal but can also be found extracellularly and associated with plasma membranes, possibly due to incomplete signal peptide cleavage, suggesting a potential membrane-anchoring role (Intra2007Comparative).

## Function
The FUCA2 gene encodes the enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase 2, which is involved in the hydrolysis of fucose-containing glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, impacting cellular processes such as cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and immune response (Duarte2016GenomeWide; Leal2022FUCA2). FUCA2 is active in the lysosome, where it contributes to the breakdown and recycling of biomolecules, facilitating the removal of terminal L-fucose residues linked via various linkages to the reducing end of N-acetyl glucosamine in oligosaccharide chains (Duarte2016GenomeWide).

The enzyme's activity is significant in various physiological processes, including immune response, early embryogenesis, development, apoptosis, and the adhesion of pathogens. Altered expression of fucosylated glycans, which are processed by alpha-L-fucosidases, has been observed in several pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis and cancer (Duarte2016GenomeWide). In healthy human cells, FUCA2's enzymatic function is essential for maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions by ensuring the proper degradation and recycling of glycoproteins and glycolipids, thus supporting cellular homeostasis and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The FUCA2 gene has been identified as having significant clinical implications in various cancers. Alterations in FUCA2, particularly genetic changes, have been observed in several cancer types. The highest frequency of alteration, primarily as 'deep deletion', occurs in ocular melanoma, affecting more than 8% of patients. In sarcoma, 'amplification' is the primary type of copy number alteration, with a frequency of about 5% (Zhong2021FUCA2). FUCA2 expression is generally positively correlated with copy number alterations across most tumor types, except for a few like cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) and acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) (Zhong2021FUCA2).

DNA methylation of FUCA2 shows a significant negative correlation with its expression in several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). Methylation levels of FUCA2 are prognostic factors for overall survival in cancers such as BRCA and LAML (Zhong2021FUCA2). High FUCA2 expression is linked to worse overall survival and disease-specific survival in various cancers, indicating its role as a prognostic biomarker (Zhong2021FUCA2). FUCA2 is also associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, as its expression correlates with immune-related genes and pathways, including those involved in immunosuppression (Zhong2021FUCA2).
