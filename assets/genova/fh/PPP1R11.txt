# PPP1R11

## Overview
PPP1R11 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 11, a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. This protein functions primarily as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major serine/threonine phosphatase, thereby playing a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. PPP1R11 is involved in the regulation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and cytokine expression, acting as a negative regulator of T cell activation-induced cytokine expression. Additionally, it is characterized as a RING finger E3 ligase, which contributes to its role in ubiquitination processes, particularly targeting Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) for degradation. This dual functionality underscores its importance in both adaptive and innate immunity, with implications for various immune-related conditions and bacterial infections (Joshi2019Phosphatase; McKelvey2016RING).

## Function
PPP1R11, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 11, functions as a potent inhibitor of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) enzyme complex. This inhibition plays a crucial role in modulating T cell responses, particularly in the context of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated suppression of cytokine expression. PPP1R11 is involved in the regulation of cytokine expression, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ, in T cells, acting as a negative regulator of T cell activation-induced cytokine expression (Joshi2019Phosphatase).

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular signaling pathways and maintains cellular homeostasis. PPP1R11's inhibition of PP1 affects the substrate specificity and activity of the PP1 catalytic subunit, leading to changes in subcellular localization and interaction with PP1 substrates (Joshi2019Phosphatase). This modulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating immune responses, as evidenced by its role in modulating the resistance of human T cells to Treg-mediated suppression (Joshi2019Phosphatase).

In addition to its role in T cell biology, PPP1R11 is also involved in regulating TLR2 signaling and innate immunity, acting as a negative regulator of TLR2-linked inflammatory signaling (McKelvey2016RING).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP1R11 gene have been implicated in various immune-related conditions. PPP1R11 acts as a negative regulator of T cell activation-induced cytokine expression. Silencing PPP1R11 in T cells leads to increased resistance to regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated suppression, resulting in elevated cytokine levels such as IL-2 and IFN-γ. This suggests potential therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases and cancer, where modulating T cell activation and Treg-mediated suppression could be beneficial (Joshi2019Phosphatase).

In the context of bacterial infections, PPP1R11 has been shown to regulate Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling. It acts as an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates TLR2, leading to its degradation and suppression of TLR2-mediated cytokine release. This regulation affects the body's response to bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Alterations in PPP1R11 expression can influence inflammation and bacterial clearance, with potential implications for conditions like nosocomial pneumonia, sepsis-associated acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (McKelvey2016RING).

The role of PPP1R11 in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation further suggests its involvement in immune response modulation during infections, such as those caused by Streptococcus suis in pigs (Liu2019Transcription).

## Interactions
PPP1R11, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 11, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. It is characterized as a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major serine/threonine phosphatase, and modulates PP1 activity by affecting its substrate specificity and activity through conformational changes in the holoenzyme (Joshi2019Phosphatase). PPP1R11 achieves this regulation by interacting with PP1 substrates for competitive inhibition, rather than through transcriptional regulation of PP1 (Joshi2019Phosphatase).

In addition to its role as a phosphatase inhibitor, PPP1R11 is also identified as a RING finger E3 ligase, which interacts with several E2 conjugating enzymes, such as UBE2R1 and UBE2D2. The interaction with UBE2D2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation, highlighting its role in ubiquitination processes (McKelvey2016RING). PPP1R11 specifically targets Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation and affecting TLR2 signaling pathways (McKelvey2016RING). This interaction is crucial for regulating innate immune responses, particularly in the context of bacterial infections (McKelvey2016RING).
