# RAD21

## Overview
RAD21 is a gene that encodes the RAD21 cohesin complex component, a crucial protein involved in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. As a core component of the cohesin complex, RAD21 plays a significant role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The protein is categorized as a structural component of the cohesin complex, which includes other subunits such as SMC1, SMC3, and STAG proteins. Beyond its role in chromatid cohesion, RAD21 is involved in DNA repair, regulation of gene expression, and chromatin architecture, contributing to the organization of topological domains and chromatin loops through interactions with CTCF. The gene's mutations and altered expression are linked to various genetic disorders, such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, and have implications in cancer prognosis and therapy resistance (Deb2014RAD21; Cheng2020Cohesin).

## Structure
RAD21 is a nuclear phospho-protein that is a key component of the cohesin complex, which includes SMC1, SMC3, and a SA protein (SA1 or SA2) (Cheng2020Cohesin). The primary structure of RAD21 consists of 631 amino acids in humans (Krab2020Delineation). The protein has specific domains, including an N-terminal domain that interacts with SMC3, a middle STAG domain that binds to SCC3, and a C-terminal domain that interacts with SMC1 (Cheng2020Cohesin).

The secondary structure of RAD21 includes alpha-helices and beta-strands. The N-terminal domain contains two alpha-helices that form a 4-helix bundle with the coiled-coil from the ATP head of Smc3, while the C-terminal domain contains three helices followed by two beta strands, forming a winged-helix domain (Cheng2020Cohesin).

RAD21's quaternary structure involves its interaction with other cohesin components, forming a tripartite ring-like structure with SMC1 and SMC3, and recruiting SCC3 to complete the cohesin complex (Cheng2020Cohesin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in RAD21's function, with phosphorylation occurring during the S phase (Tomonaga2000Characterization). RAD21 is also subject to cleavage by Separase during the metaphase to anaphase transition, which is crucial for sister chromatid segregation (Cheng2020Cohesin).

## Function
RAD21 is a critical component of the cohesin complex, which plays a vital role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. This cohesion is essential for proper chromosome segregation, ensuring genomic stability and preventing inappropriate recombination between repetitive regions (Cheng2020Cohesin). RAD21 is involved in DNA repair, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks, and contributes to the regulation of gene expression by binding to numerous genomic sites during interphase (Cheng2020Cohesin).

In addition to its role in chromatid cohesion, RAD21 is involved in the regulation of chromatin architecture. It facilitates long-range chromatin interactions and maintains the organization of topological domains, which are crucial for proper gene regulation (Zuin2013Cohesin). RAD21 interacts with CTCF to form chromatin loops, contributing to the positioning of cohesin at CTCF binding sites (Cheng2020Cohesin).

RAD21 is also implicated in various cellular processes beyond chromatid cohesion, including apoptosis, where it is cleaved by caspases, and hematopoiesis, where it regulates the expression of key hematopoietic genes (Panigrahi2012A; Cheng2020Cohesin). Its diverse functions highlight its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RAD21 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. RAD21 mutations can lead to cohesinopathies, a group of rare genetic disorders. One such disorder is Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), characterized by mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, and limb abnormalities. RAD21 variants account for a small percentage of CdLS cases, with various mutations including nonsense, splice site, frameshift, in-frame deletions, and missense mutations disrupting interactions within the cohesin complex (Krab2020Delineation; Cheng2020Cohesin).

RAD21 mutations are also linked to Mungan syndrome, characterized by chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to gastrointestinal hypomotility, and sclerocornea, a congenital disorder causing corneal opacification (Cheng2020Cohesin). In cancer, RAD21 overexpression is a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer, particularly in KRAS mutant cases, and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to chemoradiotherapy (Deb2014RAD21). In ovarian cancer, RAD21 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and reduced sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, contributing to therapy resistance and promoting tumor progression (Gou2022RAD21). RAD21 amplification also plays a role in immune evasion by suppressing interferon signaling in ovarian cancer (Deng2022RAD21).

## Interactions
RAD21 is a core component of the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and gene regulation. It interacts with other cohesin subunits, including SMC1, SMC3, and STAG1/2, forming a tripartite ring-like structure that is crucial for its function (Krab2020Delineation; Cheng2020Cohesin). RAD21 also associates with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as SNF2, and is part of a chromatin remodeling complex that includes components of the NURD complex (Cheng2020Cohesin).

The protein interacts with various other proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. For instance, it has been shown to interact with DDB1, p30/DBC1/KIAA1967, PPP1R15A/GADD34, and EWS1, which are involved in protein modification, degradation, and RNA processing (Panigrahi2012A). RAD21 also interacts with components of the human condensin I complex, such as SMC2 and NCAPG, which are important for chromosome dynamics (Panigrahi2012A).

RAD21's interaction with CTCF is significant for chromatin loop extrusion, playing a role in genome organization and the formation of topologically associating domains (Sun2023RAD21). These interactions highlight RAD21's involvement in a wide range of cellular processes beyond its traditional role in sister chromatid cohesion.
