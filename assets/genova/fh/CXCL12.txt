# CXCL12

## Overview
CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), is a gene that encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12, a member of the chemokine family. This chemokine is characterized by its conserved CXC motif and plays a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes. The CXCL12 protein is primarily involved in cell signaling, acting through its receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3, which are G protein-coupled receptors. It is crucial for directing cellular movement and relocalization, impacting embryonic development, immune responses, and tissue repair. Additionally, CXCL12 is implicated in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell trafficking and retention within the bone marrow. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is also significant in cancer biology, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis, as well as in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, where it influences immune cell infiltration and neuroinflammation (Karin2010The; Mousavi2020CXCL12/CXCR4; Janssens2017The).

## Structure
The CXCL12 protein, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), is a chemokine with a conserved CXC motif. Its primary structure includes a flexible N-terminal region, which is crucial for receptor binding and activation, particularly with the CXCR4 receptor (Crump1997Solution). The secondary structure of CXCL12 consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix, forming a typical chemokine fold (Veldkamp2005The; Kofuku2009Structural). 

The tertiary structure of CXCL12 is characterized by a chemokine-like fold, with an extended N-loop and a 3_10-helix (Crump1997Solution). The quaternary structure involves a monomer-dimer equilibrium, influenced by pH and the presence of anions such as phosphate and sulfate. At physiological pH, CXCL12 tends to form dimers, which are stabilized by interactions at the dimer interface, including a cluster of positively charged residues (Veldkamp2005The; Veldkamp2009Monomeric). 

CXCL12 can form different dimer types, including traditional CXC dimers and CC-like dimers, depending on environmental conditions (Murphy2010Heterologous). The monomeric form is active at nanomolar concentrations and is suggested to be responsible for cardioprotective effects, while dimerization can inhibit certain functions like chemotaxis (Veldkamp2009Monomeric).

## Function
CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), is a chemokine that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in directing cellular movement and relocalization, essential for embryonic development, neovascularization, angiogenesis, immune responses, wound healing, and organ repair (Karin2010The). CXCL12 is constitutively expressed in the bone marrow and other tissues, such as the skin, heart, bile ducts, and brain endothelium, where it regulates the trafficking and localization of immature and maturing leukocytes (Karin2010The). This regulation ensures a dynamic balance of cell number and type in these organs under diverse conditions.

CXCL12 functions by activating its receptors, CXCR4 and ACKR3, which are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell migration, adhesion, and survival (Janssens2017The). It is involved in the homeostatic basal migration of immune cells within and between lymphoid organs, blood, and peripheral tissues, establishing immune surveillance (Cambier2023The). CXCL12 also retains hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells in the bone marrow, where it controls cellular migration (Cambier2023The). The chemokine is crucial for maintaining neutrophil homeostasis, balancing their production, release from the bone marrow, and clearance from circulation (Karin2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CXCL12 gene, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), are implicated in various diseases. In cancer, the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis is crucial for tumor progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis. High expression levels of CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are associated with increased tumor cell invasion and metastasis in cancers such as breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancer (Mousavi2020CXCL12/CXCR4). The pathway also contributes to chemotherapy resistance and disease relapse, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Mousavi2020CXCL12/CXCR4).

In autoimmune diseases, CXCL12 plays a role in the infiltration of immune cells and the regulation of immune responses. In Type I Diabetes (T1D), CXCL12 is involved in the infiltration of immune cells into pancreatic β-islets, affecting T cell subpopulations (GarcíaCuesta2019The). In Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), upregulated CXCL12 and CXCR4 are linked to T cell recruitment and disease progression (GarcíaCuesta2019The).

In neurodegenerative disorders, an imbalance in the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis is associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, where it influences neuroinflammation and disease progression (Janssens2018Pathological).

## Interactions
CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), interacts primarily with the receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 (also known as CXCR7). These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell migration, survival, and adhesion. CXCL12 binds to CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor, initiating signal transduction pathways such as MAPK, phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which lead to cellular migration and activation of adhesion molecules (Janssens2017The). CXCL12 also interacts with ACKR3, which binds the chemokine with a higher affinity than CXCR4. This interaction is primarily mediated by β-arrestins rather than G proteins, playing a role in scavenging CXCL12 from the environment and influencing cell survival and tumor growth (Janssens2017The).

CXCL12 can form homo- and heterodimers with other molecules, such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and platelet chemokines like CCL5, CXCL4, and CXCL7, which modulate CXCR4 signaling (Janssens2017The). Additionally, CXCL12 interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are essential for its chemotactic activity and protection from inactivation. This interaction is facilitated by a cluster of positively charged amino acids in CXCL12, crucial for its binding and function (Janssens2017The).
