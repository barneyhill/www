# IDH3G

## Overview
The IDH3G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)) 3 enzyme, a non-catalytic component of the IDH3 complex. This enzyme is integral to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, facilitating the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate while reducing NAD+ to NADH, a critical step in cellular respiration and energy production (Findlay2018Mouse; Nanadikar2022IDH3γ). Although the IDH3G subunit does not directly participate in the catalytic activity, it is essential for the structural stability and regulatory function of the enzyme complex, acting as an allosteric modulator (Solomou2023Mutant; Findlay2018Mouse). The IDH3G protein is involved in redox regulation, with specific cysteine residues that can form disulfide bridges under oxidative stress, thereby influencing mitochondrial energy metabolism and contractility, particularly in cardiac tissues (Nanadikar2022IDH3γ).

## Structure
The IDH3G gene encodes the gamma subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) enzyme, which is a heterotetramer composed of two alpha, one beta, and one gamma subunit. This enzyme is involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, catalyzing the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate while reducing NAD+ to NADH (Findlay2018Mouse; Nanadikar2022IDH3γ). The gamma subunit, IDH3G, is non-catalytic but plays a crucial role in the structural stability of the enzyme complex (Findlay2018Mouse).

The molecular structure of IDH3G involves specific cysteine residues, Cys148 and Cys284, which are important for redox regulation. These residues can form a reversible disulfide bridge under oxidative stress, leading to conformational changes that affect the enzyme's activity and stability (Nanadikar2022IDH3γ). This redox modification is a key post-translational modification that allows IDH3G to function as a redox switch, regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism and contractility in the heart (Nanadikar2022IDH3γ).

The IDH3G subunit's interaction with the alpha subunit is critical for the enzyme's function, particularly at the tetramerization interface, which is essential for the enzyme's activity (Nanadikar2022IDH3γ).

## Function
IDH3G is a non-catalytic subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme complex is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to produce α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and NADH, a key step in cellular respiration and energy production in mitochondria (Solomou2023Mutant; Bergaggio2019WildType). IDH3G contributes to the structural stability and regulation of the IDH3 complex, which is composed of two catalytic α subunits, a β subunit for structural support, and a γ subunit that acts as an allosteric modulator (Solomou2023Mutant).

In healthy human cells, IDH3G is involved in maintaining mitochondrial energy metabolism and balancing energy production with antioxidant defense, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. It plays a role in regulating mitochondrial ATP production and the redox status of the cell by influencing the activity of the IDH3 complex (Nanadikar2022IDH3γ). The IDH3 complex, including IDH3G, is essential for the proper functioning of the TCA cycle, which is critical for ATP generation and overall cellular energy homeostasis (Bergaggio2019WildType).
