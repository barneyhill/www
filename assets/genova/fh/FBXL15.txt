# FBXL15

## Overview
FBXL15 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 15, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as part of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it plays a critical role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The F-box motif at the N-terminus of the protein facilitates its interaction with Skp1, while the leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) at the C-terminus are involved in substrate recognition and binding (Saritas-Yildirim2015Genome-Wide). FBXL15 is implicated in the regulation of protein stability and turnover, influencing various cellular processes by targeting proteins such as Smurf1 for degradation (Deng2013E3). Its role in protein degradation pathways highlights its potential significance in cellular homeostasis and disease mechanisms (Hermanns2024Proximitydependent).

## Structure
FBXL15 is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by the presence of an F-box motif, which is approximately 40 amino acids in length and is crucial for protein-protein interactions. This motif is located at the N-terminus of the protein and facilitates its interaction with Skp1, a component of the SCF (Skp1, Cullin1, F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Saritas-Yildirim2015Genome-Wide). The C-terminus of FBXL15 contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), which form a horseshoe-like structure that aids in binding target proteins (Saritas-Yildirim2015Genome-Wide). These structural features enable FBXL15 to confer specificity to the SCF complex by recruiting specific substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.

The protein's stability is influenced by its C-terminal degron, which has been identified as unstable. This instability was confirmed through experimental validation using the Promega HiBiT system, which demonstrated increased stability when a HiBiT tag was attached to the C-terminus, suggesting a role in proteasome-dependent degradation (szulc2024degronopedia). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FBXL15 are not provided, the presence of LRRs and the F-box motif are key structural elements. Information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is not detailed in the available context.

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
FBXL15 is an F-box protein that plays a role in protein degradation through its interactions within the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. It specifically interacts with Skp1, a component of the SCF complex, and this interaction is crucial for its function in protein turnover. The N-terminal domain of FBXL15 is necessary for binding to Skp1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses (Simanski2017A). This interaction is essential for FBXL15's ability to reduce N-cyclin B1-luciferase levels, indicating its role in the targeted degradation of specific proteins (Simanski2017A).

FBXL15 is also part of a complex that targets Smurf1, a Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligase, for ubiquitination, thereby influencing Smurf1's stability and activity (Deng2013E3). Additionally, FBXL15 has been identified as a ubiquitin ligase that destabilizes a wide range of substrates with different subcellular localizations, highlighting its potential as a targeted protein degradation (TPD) ligase (Hermanns2024Proximitydependent). These interactions underscore FBXL15's role in regulating protein degradation pathways, particularly through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
