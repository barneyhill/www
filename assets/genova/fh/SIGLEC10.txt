# SIGLEC10

## Overview
SIGLEC10 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 10 (Siglec-10), which is a type I transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. Siglec-10 is characterized by its structure, which includes five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (Whitney2001A; MUNDAY2001Identification). As a member of the Siglec family, Siglec-10 functions primarily as an inhibitory receptor, modulating immune responses by recognizing sialic acid-containing glycans on various immune cells, including dendritic cells and B cells (Forgione2020Unveiling; MUNDAY2001Identification). The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive immune activation, which is important in the context of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Lin2021Functions). Additionally, Siglec-10 is involved in tumor immune evasion by interacting with CD24 on tumor cells, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Yin2020Molecular).

## Structure
Siglec-10 is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by the SIGLEC10 gene, consisting of 697 amino acids. The protein structure includes a signal peptide, five immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Whitney2001A; MUNDAY2001Identification). The Ig-like domains are composed of one V-set domain followed by four C2-set domains, which are characteristic of proteins involved in immune responses (Whitney2001A). 

The cytoplasmic tail of Siglec-10 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are involved in intracellular signaling and suggest a role as an inhibitory receptor (Whitney2001A; MUNDAY2001Identification). These motifs interact with SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, similar to CD33, indicating potential signaling functions (Whitney2001A).

Post-translational modifications of Siglec-10 include glycosylation, which is typical for cell surface proteins. The protein carries both high mannose and complex type N-glycans, with few or no sialic acids (Xie2017Molecular). The presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a pattern of cysteines for disulfide bond formation further stabilizes its structure (MUNDAY2001Identification).

## Function
Siglec-10 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, which plays a crucial role in immune regulation by recognizing sialic acid-containing glycans. It is expressed on various immune cells, including dendritic cells, human leukocytes, B cells, eosinophils, monocytes, and a subset of natural killer-like cells (Forgione2020Unveiling; MUNDAY2001Identification). Siglec-10 functions as an inhibitory receptor, modulating immune responses by binding to sialoglycans and interacting with proteins like CD24, which is expressed on tumor cells. This interaction acts as an innate immune checkpoint, essential for mediating anti-tumor immunity and promoting immune evasion by tumors (Yin2020Molecular; Forgione2020Unveiling).

In healthy human cells, Siglec-10 contributes to maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing excessive immune activation, which is beneficial in preventing autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Lin2021Functions). It achieves this by recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2 to its cytoplasmic tail, which contains tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), thereby inhibiting cellular activation and inflammatory responses (Li2024Targeting). Siglec-10 is also involved in regulating B cell activity by inhibiting B cell receptor-mediated signal transduction, which is crucial for controlling B cell proliferation and immune response (Yin2020Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIGLEC10 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, SIGLEC10 is frequently mutated in certain types, such as cholangiocarcinoma and undifferentiated stomach adenocarcinoma, and shows high alteration frequencies in cancers like endometrial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, bladder urothelial carcinoma, and esophagogastric adenocarcinoma (Chen2020Tumor). SIGLEC10 is also expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in ovarian and breast cancer, where it interacts with CD24 on tumor cells to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis and promote tumor immune escape. Blocking this interaction can enhance macrophage phagocytosis and slow tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Barkal2019CD24; Jiang2022The).

In autoimmune conditions, rare variants of SIGLEC10, specifically R47Q and A108V, are associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). These variants impair the gene's ability to bind to sialylated ligands, such as gangliosides, which are abundant in the nervous system. This impaired binding is linked to the pathogenesis of GBS by failing to suppress the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies, predisposing individuals to the syndrome (Alborzian2021A).

## Interactions
SIGLEC10 is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation. It interacts with tyrosine kinases such as Lck, Jak3, and Emt, which phosphorylate specific tyrosines within its cytoplasmic domain, facilitating the binding of phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. SHP-1 preferentially binds to the tyrosine at position 667, while SHP-2 can bind to multiple tyrosines, including 667 (Whitney2001A). These interactions suggest that SIGLEC10 functions as an inhibitory receptor, similar to CD33, by recruiting SHP-1 and SHP-2 to its phosphorylated ITIM motifs (Whitney2001A).

SIGLEC10 also interacts with CD24, a glycosylated protein on tumor cells, to mediate immune escape by inhibiting immune cell activity. This interaction is sialylation-dependent and involves the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2, which are associated with the ITIM motifs of SIGLEC10, leading to immunosuppression (Yin2020Molecular). Additionally, SIGLEC10 binds to the CD52 glycan, which engages the receptor to suppress T cell function. This interaction involves the proinflammatory B box of HMGB1 and results in the phosphorylation of SIGLEC10, recruiting SHP1 phosphatase and interacting with the T cell receptor (Bandala-Sanchez2018CD52).
