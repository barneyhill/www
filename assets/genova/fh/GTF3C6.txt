# GTF3C6

## Overview
GTF3C6, or General Transcription Factor IIIC Subunit 6, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the TFIIIC complex, which is crucial for the transcription of tRNA and other small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. The protein encoded by GTF3C6 plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, thereby facilitating accurate transcription. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth (Llonch2020Single). Beyond its role in RNA polymerase III transcription, GTF3C6 is also implicated in pathways related to transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, indicating its broader involvement in cellular processes (Sala2024Impact). The protein's function extends to various biological contexts, including oocyte maturation and cancer prognosis, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Yang2021Bioinformatics; Reale2019A).

## Function
GTF3C6, or General Transcription Factor IIIC Subunit 6, is a component of the general transcription factor IIIC complex, which is essential for the transcription of tRNA and other small RNA genes by RNA polymerase III. This protein plays a critical role in the assembly and stabilization of the transcription pre-initiation complex, facilitating the accurate transcription of these genes. GTF3C6 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth (Llonch2020Single).

In the context of human oocytes, GTF3C6 has been identified as one of the top markers in germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes, indicating its involvement in the transcriptional regulation during oocyte maturation. The presence of GTF3C6 in these cells suggests its role in maintaining the transcriptional activity necessary for oocyte development and maturation (Llonch2020Single).

Additionally, GTF3C6 is involved in pathways related to transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, as evidenced by its inclusion in the Reactome pathway for gene expression (Transcription) with significant statistical support (Sala2024Impact). This highlights its broader role in transcriptional regulation beyond RNA polymerase III, impacting various cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
GTF3C6 has been implicated in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Studies have shown that GTF3C6 is one of the gene signatures associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Its expression levels are significantly correlated with overall survival outcomes, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.7271 and a p-value of 0.0022, suggesting that higher expression levels of GTF3C6 are linked to worse survival rates in HCC (Yang2021Bioinformatics). The gene is part of a prognostic model developed using LASSO regression, which includes 15 gene signatures that predict survival prognosis at 1, 3, and 5 years with high accuracy (Yang2021Bioinformatics).

In addition to its role in liver cancer, GTF3C6 has been identified in gene regulatory networks potentially involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. Its expression was analyzed in the thyroids of mice exposed to chlorpyrifos, a chemical known to induce hypothyroidism and inhibit thyroid-specific transcripts. This suggests that GTF3C6 may have controversial roles in cancer, particularly in organs derived from the endoderm, such as the liver and thyroid (Reale2019A). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of GTF3C6 in cancer prognosis and its involvement in gene regulatory networks associated with carcinogenesis.

## Interactions
GTF3C6, also known as general transcription factor IIIC subunit 6, is a component of the TFIIIC complex, which is involved in the transcription regulation of RNA polymerase III genes. This protein is part of a multiprotein complex that includes other subunits such as GTF3C1, GTF3C2, and GTF3C5. The TFIIIC complex plays a crucial role in recruiting RNA polymerase III to its target genes, facilitating the transcription of small RNA molecules, including tRNA and 5S rRNA. 

The Core&Peel method for predicting protein complexes has identified GTF3C6 as part of a predicted cluster that includes the TFIIIC complex, suggesting its involvement in transcription regulation (Pellegrini2016Protein). Although specific physical interactions of GTF3C6 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, its inclusion in the TFIIIC complex implies interactions with other TFIIIC subunits and possibly with DNA elements recognized by RNA polymerase III. The role of GTF3C6 in transcriptional processes is further supported by its involvement in pathways related to transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, as indicated by functional enrichment analysis (Sala2024Impact).
