# SEC24C

## Overview
SEC24C is a gene that encodes the protein SEC24 homolog C, a critical component of the COPII coat complex involved in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a pivotal role in the selection and packaging of cargo proteins into COPII vesicles, thereby influencing intracellular protein sorting and trafficking. Structurally, SEC24 homolog C is characterized by several domains, including a zinc finger domain, trunk domain, beta-sandwich domain, helical domain, and gelsolin domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and cargo molecules (Bhattarai2021Ebola; Chatterjee2021A). Functionally, SEC24 homolog C is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons, where its deficiency can lead to increased ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in apoptosis and conditions such as microcephaly (Wang2018The). Additionally, SEC24 homolog C interacts with various proteins, including claudin-1 and Ebola virus protein VP40, highlighting its role in viral infections and cellular transport processes (Bhattarai2021Ebola; Yin2017Sec24CDependent).

## Structure
The SEC24C protein is a component of the COPII coat complex involved in vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains. The protein structure used for docking studies includes residues 329-1094, as the first 328 residues are disordered and hypervariable (Bhattarai2021Ebola). Domain prediction analysis identifies five domains in chain A of SEC24C: a zinc finger domain (residues 94 to 132), a trunk domain (171 to 417), a beta-sandwich domain (420 to 503), a helical domain (516 to 615), and a gelsolin domain (634 to 706) (Bhattarai2021Ebola).

The trunk domain is particularly significant as it is responsible for binding with the Sec23 protein, an essential interaction for COPII transport (Bhattarai2021Ebola). The protein also contains multiple cargo-binding sites, allowing it to accommodate diverse cargo molecules (Chatterjee2021A). SEC24C is known to bind an IxM-packaging signal, which is shared with its paralog SEC24D, indicating some functional overlap (Wang2018The). The protein's structure is a trimer, and studies often focus on chain A for analysis (Bhattarai2021Ebola).

## Function
SEC24C is a critical component of the COPII vesicle coat complex, which is essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. SEC24C is involved in the selection and packaging of specific cargo proteins into COPII vesicles, influencing protein sorting and trafficking within the cell (Wang2018The; Yin2017Sec24CDependent).

In neurons, SEC24C plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by facilitating ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Its deficiency leads to increased ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), particularly the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway, which can result in reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis (Wang2018The). SEC24C is particularly important in postmitotic neurons, where its loss can lead to severe consequences such as microcephaly and neuronal cell death (Wang2018The).

SEC24C also interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic tail of claudin-1, a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, facilitating its transport to the cell surface. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of claudin-1, which is necessary for HCV entry and the formation of tight junctions (Yin2017Sec24CDependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SEC24C gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SEC24C expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poor progression-free and relapse-free survival, particularly in male patients with hepatitis virus infection. SEC24C plays a tumor-suppressive role by promoting apoptosis through the unfolded protein response (UPR), and its reduced expression contributes to increased tumor proliferation and chemoresistance (Tao2024SEC24C).

In the context of neuronal homeostasis, SEC24C deficiency leads to severe consequences, including perinatal lethality and microcephaly in mice. This deficiency results in the activation of the UPR and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to apoptotic neuronal death. The loss of SEC24C is particularly detrimental to postmitotic neurons, which are unable to compensate for its absence, potentially implicating SEC24C in neurodegenerative conditions (Wang2018The). The sensitivity of neurons to SEC24C loss may be due to insufficient compensation by its paralog SEC24D, highlighting the critical role of SEC24C in maintaining neuronal viability (Wang2018The).

## Interactions
SEC24C, a component of the COPII coat complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in vesicular transport. It interacts with the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and the binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This interaction is important for modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. SEC24C enhances the dissociation of Bip from PERK, facilitating the activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, which is associated with UPR-related apoptosis (Tao2024SEC24C).

SEC24C also interacts with nucleophosmin1 (NPM1), a protein that regulates its nuclear translocation. Under normal conditions, SEC24C is retained in the nucleus through its interaction with NPM1, but it translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) surface in response to ER stress (Tao2024SEC24C).

In the context of viral infections, SEC24C interacts with the Ebola virus protein VP40, facilitating its transport to the plasma membrane, a critical step in the viral replication cycle (Bhattarai2021Ebola). It also interacts with claudin-1, a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, through a specific C-terminal YV motif, which is essential for claudin-1's transport to the cell surface (Yin2017Sec24CDependent).
