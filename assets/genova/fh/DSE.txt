# DSE

## Overview
The DSE gene encodes the enzyme dermatan sulfate epimerase, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan involved in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. This enzyme is categorized as an epimerase, responsible for converting D-glucuronic acid to L-iduronic acid within the dermatan sulfate chain, thereby facilitating the formation of iduronic acid-rich regions in proteoglycans such as decorin and biglycan (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological; Mizumoto2023Histories). The protein's activity is essential for various cellular processes, including cell signaling and tissue repair, and is expressed in multiple tissues, contributing to the structural integrity of skin and bone (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological; Mizumoto2023Histories). Mutations in the DSE gene are associated with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in connective tissue disorders (Mizumoto2023Histories). Additionally, DSE has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with cell migration and invasion (Mizumoto2023Histories).

## Structure
The human dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DS-epi1) protein, encoded by the DSE gene, is composed of distinct structural domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of DS-epi1 includes a sequence of 775 amino acids, with the first 755 being essential for its catalytic activity (Hasan2021The). The secondary structure features an N-terminal (a/a)6-toroid domain spanning amino acids 65-373 and a C-terminal 4-sheet beta-supersandwich domain covering amino acids 391-725 (Hasan2021The). These domains are connected by an 18 amino acid linker loop, and the protein also has a C-terminal tail that extends back to the N-terminus (Hasan2021The).

The tertiary structure of DS-epi1 reveals a deeply buried active site between the alpha-toroid and beta-sandwich domains, which is highly conserved among eukaryotic orthologs (Hasan2021The). The protein's quaternary structure in vivo forms homodimers, although the truncated DS-epi1 23-775 protein is monomeric and monodispersed in vitro (Hasan2021The).

Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, which is crucial for the enzyme's stability and activity. Glycosylation sites have been identified at Asn183, Asn336, Asn642, and Asn648, with a novel site at Asn411 (Hasan2021The). These modifications include both oligomannose and complex/hybrid structures (Hasan2021The).

## Function
The DSE gene encodes the enzyme dermatan sulfate epimerase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) to L-iduronic acid (IdoUA) in the DS chain, a process essential for the formation of IdoUA-block structures in proteoglycans such as decorin and biglycan (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological; Mizumoto2023Histories). These proteoglycans are important for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix and are involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and tissue repair (Mizumoto2023Histories).

DSE is expressed in various tissues and plays a role in the structural integrity of tissues, as evidenced by studies on Dse-deficient mice, which showed reduced DSE activity, smaller body size, and defects in collagen fibrils (Mizumoto2023Histories). The enzyme's activity is also linked to the formation of longer IdoA-containing chains, which are essential for the structural properties of DS (Mizumoto2023Histories). In healthy human cells, DSE is crucial for the development of skin and bone and the maintenance of extracellular matrices (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSE gene are linked to musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mcEDS), a subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized by connective tissue fragility, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility. Specific mutations such as p.Ser268Leu and p.Arg267Gly have been identified in patients with this condition, leading to reduced enzymatic activity and decreased dermatan sulfate (DS) biosynthesis (Mizumoto2017Pathophysiological; Mizumoto2023Histories). The absence or significant reduction of DS is a critical cause of mcEDS symptoms, which include multiple congenital malformations and progressive connective tissue fragility-related manifestations (Yoshizawa2023Mouse).

Mouse models with Dse gene deletions exhibit phenotypes similar to human mcEDS, such as reduced body size, skin fragility, and altered connective tissue properties, underscoring the gene's role in normal physiological processes (Yoshizawa2023Mouse). Alterations in DSE expression have also been associated with cancer, particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where increased DSE levels correlate with enhanced cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Mizumoto2023Histories). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DSE in both genetic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
Dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE) is involved in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate and interacts with other proteins to fulfill its biological role. DSE forms a heterocomplex with dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST-1), which is essential for the synthesis of longer iduronic acid-containing chains in mature dermatan sulfate. This interaction is crucial for the formation of repeating disaccharides in dermatan sulfate, indicating that DSE does not function in isolation but in conjunction with other proteins (Mizumoto2023Histories).

In the context of gliomas, DSE is implicated in the regulation of the ErbB signaling pathway. It mediates heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)/ErbB signaling in glioma cells, influencing cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth. DSE knockdown in glioma cells suppresses HB-EGF-triggered downstream ERK and AKT activation and reduces HB-EGF-induced EGFR and ErbB2 activation. Conversely, overexpression of DSE enhances HB-EGF-induced EGFR and ErbB2 phosphorylation and increases the total protein level of ErbB2. These interactions suggest that DSE plays a role in regulating malignant phenotypes through the EGFR and ErbB2 pathways (Liao2018DSE).
