# MAD1L1

## Overview
The MAD1L1 gene encodes the mitotic arrest deficient 1 like 1 protein, a crucial component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that ensures accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis. This protein is integral to the mitotic checkpoint, where it forms a complex with MAD2L1 to inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until all chromosomes are properly aligned. By doing so, MAD1L1 prevents aneuploidy and maintains genomic stability, thereby playing a significant role in cancer prevention (Zhong2015MAD1L1; McKinney2022Schizophrenia-associated). The protein's interactions with nuclear pore complex components and other proteins underscore its importance in cell cycle regulation and its potential involvement in various diseases, including cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Allen2020GenomeWide; Garcia2021Mapping).

## Function
The MAD1L1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. In healthy human cells, MAD1L1 is essential for the mitotic checkpoint, which monitors the attachment of kinetochores on chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. This process delays the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned, preventing chromosome segregation errors and maintaining normal chromosome numbers in daughter cells (VillarroyaBeltri2022Bilallelic; Zhong2015MAD1L1).

MAD1L1 functions by forming a complex with MAD2L1, which is crucial for initiating the checkpoint signal. This complex inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) until proper chromosome alignment is achieved, thereby preventing aneuploidy, a condition characterized by an abnormal number of chromosomes (Zhong2015MAD1L1). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus during mitosis, contributing to genomic stability and preventing the development of cancer (McKinney2022Schizophrenia-associated).

Disruptions in MAD1L1 function, such as through genetic mutations, can lead to a malfunction of the SAC, resulting in chromosomal instability and potentially contributing to carcinogenesis (Zhong2015MAD1L1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAD1L1 gene are associated with a novel syndrome characterized by aneuploidy and high tumor susceptibility. Patients with biallelic germline mutations in MAD1L1 exhibit a range of neoplasias, including colorectal carcinoma, and display systemic inflammation and mitochondrial stress. These mutations lead to defective chromosome segregation, resulting in a high percentage of aneuploid cells and increased cancer risk (VillarroyaBeltri2022Bilallelic).

MAD1L1 is also implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where it may increase susceptibility through reduced telomerase activity. This connection suggests a broader impact of MAD1L1 beyond cancer, potentially affecting other diseases related to genomic stability (Allen2020GenomeWide).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the RARS-MAD1L1 fusion gene induces cancer stem cell-like properties and therapeutic resistance. This fusion gene activates the FUBP1/c-Myc axis, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Zhong2018The).

Additionally, polymorphisms in MAD1L1, such as rs1801368, are linked to fetal chromosomal abnormalities, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability during cell division and its potential impact on developmental disorders (Chan2023Maternal).

## Interactions
MAD1L1, a key component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), interacts with several proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation during cell division. It forms a complex with MAD2L1, which is crucial for inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and preventing premature progression to anaphase (Zhong2015MAD1L1; Garcia2021Mapping). MAD1L1 also associates with nuclear pore complex components such as TPR, NUP153, NUP50, and ELYS/AHCTF1, which are important for forming the MAD1L1-MAD2L1 complex during early mitosis (Garcia2021Mapping). 

The interaction between MAD1L1 and TPR is significant, as TPR helps anchor MAD1L1 and MAD2L1 to the nuclear pore complex during interphase, ensuring their proper localization and function (Lee2008Tpr). MAD1L1 also binds to ELYS, which may play a role in recruiting SAC proteins to the kinetochore or in checkpoint activation (Garcia2021Mapping). In glioma cells, MAD1L1 interacts with CHPF, suggesting a role in promoting glioma malignance through cell cycle regulation (Luo2023The). These interactions highlight MAD1L1's central role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential involvement in cancer progression.
