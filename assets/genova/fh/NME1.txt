# NME1

## Overview
NME1, also known as NM23-H1, is a gene that encodes the NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 1 protein, a multifunctional enzyme involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a kinase due to its nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular nucleotide homeostasis by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate groups. Beyond its enzymatic roles, NME1 is recognized for its involvement in metastasis suppression, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction pathways. The protein's structure, characterized by a hexameric assembly, is essential for its function and stability. NME1's interactions with other proteins and its post-translational modifications further regulate its activity, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer (Schlattner2021The; Marino2011Protein–protein; Adam2020The).

## Structure
The NME1 protein, also known as NM23-H1, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure of NME1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is involved in various cellular processes such as nucleotide metabolism and metastasis suppression (Schlattner2021The).

The secondary structure of NME1 includes an α/β domain with a central β-sheet composed of four anti-parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices. This configuration is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Tossounian2024A). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes a nucleotide-binding site located within a cleft formed by two helices (Tossounian2024A).

NME1 forms a hexameric quaternary structure, which is essential for its nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. This hexameric assembly is characterized by a central core of four strands of stacked antiparallel β-sheets surrounded by eight α-helices, exhibiting D3 symmetry (Lim2024Modelling). The protein's stability is influenced by specific residues, such as Arg27, which are critical for maintaining the hexameric assembly (Lim2024Modelling).

Post-translational modifications, including oxidative modifications like sulfonylation and CoAlation, regulate NME1's activity by affecting its nucleoside diphosphate kinase function (Tossounian2024A).

## Function
NME1, also known as NM23-H1, is a gene encoding the nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NDPK-A) protein, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular nucleotide homeostasis. This protein catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates, essential for the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP (Schlattner2021The; Adam2020The). NME1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and development, as well as signal transduction and G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis (Adam2020The).

NME1 exhibits multiple enzymatic activities, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity, serine-threonine kinase activity, and 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are linked to its roles in DNA repair and genomic stability (Kaetzel2014Dual; Adam2020The). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing DNA repair mechanisms and signal transduction pathways (Schlattner2021The). NME1's histidine kinase activity suggests a role in histidine-dependent signaling pathways, which are significant in cellular processes (Adam2020The). These functions highlight NME1's critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in disease pathogenesis when dysregulated (Adam2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the NME1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. NME1 is recognized as a metastasis suppressor gene, with its expression inversely correlated with metastatic potential in several cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, colon, and cervical carcinomas (Mátyási2020The). In melanoma, NME1 suppresses metastasis by inhibiting cell motility and enhancing cell adhesion through the modulation of integrin beta subunits (Leonard2019The). However, in neuroblastoma, high NME1 expression is associated with poor outcomes, particularly in cases with chromosome 17q amplification, suggesting an oncogenic role in this context (Adam2020The).

Mutations in NME1, such as H118, P96S, and S120G, can impair its enzyme activity and metastasis-suppressing functions (Ferrucci2024PRUNE1). The S120G mutation, in particular, is linked to aggressive tumor progression in neuroblastoma (Mátyási2020The). NME1 also interacts with proteins like PRUNE1, which can enhance cell motility and metastasis through PI3K-AKT signaling, indicating that disruptions in these interactions may contribute to cancer progression (Ferrucci2024PRUNE1).

Efforts to modulate NME1 expression for therapeutic purposes have been explored, but clinical trials with agents like medroxyprogesterone acetate have not been successful (Hsu2015Progress). New compounds are being investigated to enhance NME1's metastasis-suppressing activity (Ferrucci2024PRUNE1).

## Interactions
NME1, also known as NM23-H1, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes and metastasis suppression. NME1 interacts with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forming a complex that stabilizes its oligomeric state and activates its protein kinase function, which can phosphorylate phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) and influence tumor growth (Marino2011Protein–protein). It also interacts with ribosomal protein small subunit 3 (rpS3), affecting cellular invasion (Marino2011Protein–protein).

NME1 is known to interact with several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Tiam1 and Dbl-1, which regulate Rho family GTPases involved in cell migration. These interactions suggest a regulatory role in Rac-GTP levels and inhibition of GDP/GTP exchange activity, respectively (Marino2011Protein–protein). NME1 also interacts with ARF6, a small G-protein, promoting the disassembly of adherens junctions through endocytosis (Marino2011Protein–protein).

In the context of signaling pathways, NME1 interacts with Ksr1 in the MAP kinase pathway, affecting the Erk pathway, and with STRAP in the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing transcriptional responses (Marino2011Protein–protein). It also forms a complex with Prune, enhancing Prune's phosphodiesterase activity, which is associated with increased cell motility (Marino2011Protein–protein).
