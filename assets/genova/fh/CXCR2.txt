# CXCR2

## Overview
The CXCR2 gene encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in mediating immune responses and cellular signaling. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is primarily involved in the chemotaxis of neutrophils to sites of inflammation through its interaction with specific chemokines. CXCR2 is expressed on various cell types, including neutrophils, endothelial cells, and T-lymphocytes, and is integral to processes such as immune response, cancer progression, and tissue homeostasis. The receptor's function is modulated through complex interactions with proteins such as VASP and Rab11-FIP2, which are essential for its signaling and recycling. Clinically, CXCR2 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where it contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis, and hematological disorders, where mutations can lead to congenital neutropenia (Neel2009VASP; MarinEsteban2021Biallelic; Veenstra2012Chemokine).

## Structure
The CXCR2 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs. The primary structure of CXCR2 includes conserved cysteine residues, which are critical for its functional properties, such as receptor folding, ligand binding, and signaling. These cysteines form disulfide bonds that contribute to the receptor's dimerization and structural integrity (Limatola2005Cysteine).

The secondary structure of CXCR2 is modeled based on the structure of CXCR4, with a sequence identity of approximately 32.7% to 36% between the two receptors (Xu2015Exploring; Rajasekaran2012A). The tertiary structure includes electrostatic interactions that are crucial for dimer formation, with specific interactions between amino acids such as K279, R277, and D198 (Rajasekaran2012A).

In terms of quaternary structure, CXCR2 can form homodimers, which are ligand-independent, as supported by experimental studies (Rajasekaran2012A). The receptor also features an allosteric binding site located between transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6, which is important for ligand recognition and binding (de2011Identification).

## Function
The CXCR2 gene encodes a chemokine receptor that is integral to various physiological processes in healthy human cells. CXCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily mediates the migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation by binding to ELR+ CXC chemokines, such as CXCL1-3 and CXCL5-8, which are crucial for neutrophil attraction (Veenstra2012Chemokine). This receptor is expressed on multiple cell types, including neutrophils, oligodendrocytes, basophils, T-lymphocytes, and endothelial cells, and is involved in processes such as immunity, cancer growth, and central nervous system (CNS) development (Veenstra2012Chemokine).

In articular cartilage, CXCR2 signaling is essential for maintaining chondrocyte stability and cartilage integrity. It supports the expression of SOX9, a transcription factor crucial for chondrocyte differentiation, through the activation of the AKT pathway. This signaling pathway helps prevent chondrocyte apoptosis and cartilage degradation, particularly under stress conditions like osteoarthritis (Sherwood2014A). CXCR2's role in maintaining cartilage homeostasis highlights its importance in preserving tissue function and structure in healthy cells (Sherwood2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CXCR2 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, CXCR2 is implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Its overexpression is linked to the recruitment of leukocytes, contributing to a protumorigenic environment in inflammation-driven and spontaneous tumorigenesis, such as in intestinal adenomas and oral papillomas (Jamieson2012Inhibition). CXCR2 also mediates angiogenesis in tumors, with its ligands inducing endothelial cell chemotaxis, which is crucial for tumor progression in cancers like nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and melanoma (Addison2000The).

In hematological conditions, rare and low-frequency coding variants in CXCR2 are associated with reduced white blood cell counts and congenital neutropenia. Specific mutations, such as a frameshift mutation, abolish CXCR2 signal transduction, leading to impaired neutrophil mobilization (Auer2014Rare; MarinEsteban2021Biallelic). These mutations define a distinct congenital neutropenia entity characterized by chronic neutropenia and recurrent infections (MarinEsteban2021Biallelic).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated levels of CXCR2 ligands are observed, which may result from their production by AML cells and contribute to the disease's poor prognosis (Korbecki2023The). CXCR2 expression is notably higher in AML cells with certain genetic mutations, indicating its role in oncogenic processes (Korbecki2023The).

## Interactions
CXCR2, a chemokine receptor, engages in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling and chemotaxis. It interacts with the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which is essential for CXCR2-mediated polarization and chemotaxis. This interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of VASP, which modulates its binding to actin and is crucial for the chemotactic response (Neel2009VASP).

CXCR2 also interacts with Rab11-family interacting protein 2 (Rab11-FIP2) and myosin Vb, which are important for its recycling and resensitization. These interactions occur in Rab11a-positive vesicles and are necessary for receptor recycling, affecting CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis (Fan2004Rab11Family).

Additionally, CXCR2 forms complexes with G protein-coupled receptor kinase-6 (GRK6) and activator of G protein signaling-3 (AGS3), which regulate its signaling pathways. This interaction is specific to CXCR2 and involves the modulation of receptor functions through G protein activation (Singh2014G).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of CXCR2, involving multiple proteins that influence its role in chemotaxis and cellular signaling.
