# TMEM170A

## Overview
TMEM170A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 170A, which is characterized by its three transmembrane helices and is involved in cellular processes related to membrane dynamics. The protein is primarily associated with the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in maintaining nuclear envelope structure and facilitating protein synthesis through ER sheet formation (Kim2020Single-nucleus). Although the precise biological functions of TMEM170A remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in cardiovascular health, particularly in relation to carotid intima-media thickness and coronary artery disease risk (Gertow2012Identification). The gene's expression shows allele-specific differences in cardiovascular tissues, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular processes (Gertow2012Identification). Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of TMEM170A in human health.

## Structure
The TMEM170A protein is predicted to have a specific molecular structure characterized by an extracellular N-terminal part, three transmembrane helices, and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. This structural prediction was made using the MEMSAT-SVM tool, which is designed to analyze transmembrane proteins (Gertow2012Identification). The transmembrane helices suggest that TMEM170A spans the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, which is typical for proteins involved in cellular signaling or transport processes. The exact biological role of TMEM170A remains unknown, but its structure indicates potential involvement in membrane-related functions.

The study did not provide detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structures of TMEM170A, nor did it mention specific domains or prominent folds beyond the transmembrane helices. There is also no information available on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for TMEM170A in the provided context. The lack of detailed structural data highlights the need for further research to elucidate the complete molecular architecture and functional implications of TMEM170A in human biology (Gertow2012Identification).

## Function
TMEM170A is involved in the regulation of nuclear envelope dynamics and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure of the nuclear envelope and is implicated in processes such as nuclear pore complex assembly. TMEM170A is primarily active in the nuclear envelope and ER of cells, where it contributes to the structural organization necessary for efficient protein synthesis (Kim2020Single-nucleus).

In syncytial skeletal muscle cells, TMEM170A is part of a specialized myonuclear compartment that supports ER function and protein translation. This gene is associated with the formation of ER sheets, which are sites of active protein translation, indicating its role in facilitating protein synthesis processes (Kim2020Single-nucleus).

TMEM170A has also been linked to cardiovascular health. It is located near a genetic locus associated with carotid intima-media thickness and coronary artery disease risk. Although its specific function in healthy human cells remains unclear, TMEM170A shows significant allele-specific differences in expression levels in aortic intima-media and adventitia tissues, suggesting a potential role in cardiovascular processes (Gertow2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The TMEM170A gene has been implicated in cardiovascular health, particularly in relation to carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. A study identified a significant association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4888378, located near TMEM170A, and reduced risk for CAD and myocardial infarction (MI) (Gertow2012Identification). This SNP is associated with lower carotid plaque scores, suggesting a protective role against atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (Gertow2012Identification).

TMEM170A's expression levels have shown significant allele-specific differences in aortic intima-media and adventitia tissues, indicating its potential involvement in cardiovascular conditions (Gertow2012Identification). Although the biological function of TMEM170A is not fully understood, its association with the rs4888378 SNP suggests it may influence gene expression in the arterial wall, contributing to its protective effects against CAD (Gertow2012Identification).

The BCAR1-CFDP1-TMEM170A locus, where TMEM170A is located, has been identified as a novel genetic determinant of cIMT and CAD risk, highlighting the need for further research to clarify the gene's role in these conditions (Gertow2012Identification).
