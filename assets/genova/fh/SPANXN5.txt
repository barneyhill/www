# SPANXN5

## Overview
SPANXN5 is a gene that belongs to the SPANX-N subfamily, which is primarily associated with spermatogenesis. The gene is responsible for encoding the SPANX family member N5 protein, which is typically expressed in late spermatids and spermatozoa, localizing to the acrosome of sperm cells. This localization indicates a potential role in sperm development, particularly in chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture. However, SPANXN5 may function as a pseudogene in humans due to a frameshift mutation in exon 2 that introduces a premature stop codon, likely resulting in mRNA destabilization through nonsense-mediated decay. Consequently, SPANXN5 is not believed to produce a functional protein in normal tissues, despite its low-level expression in various adult tissues, with predominant expression in the testis (Kouprina2007Evolutionary).

## Function
The SPANXN5 gene is part of the SPANX-N subfamily, which is involved in spermatogenesis. SPANX-N proteins, including SPANXN5, are expressed post-meiotically in late spermatids and spermatozoa, localizing to the acrosome of sperm cells. This localization suggests a role in sperm development and maturation, potentially influencing chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture within sperm cells (Kouprina2007Evolutionary).

Despite its presence in the SPANX-N family, SPANXN5 may not be functional in healthy human cells. A frameshift mutation in exon 2 of SPANXN5 generates a premature stop codon, likely leading to mRNA destabilization through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This suggests that SPANXN5 might be a pseudogene, not translated into a functional protein in normal tissues (Kouprina2007Evolutionary).

While SPANXN5 is expressed at low levels in various normal adult tissues, such as the breast, cervix, prostate, lung, and ovary, its predominant expression is in the testis. However, due to the frameshift mutation, it is unlikely to contribute to any significant molecular processes in these tissues (Kouprina2007Evolutionary).
