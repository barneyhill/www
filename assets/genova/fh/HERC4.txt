# HERC4

## Overview
HERC4 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4, which is a member of the small HERC family of ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by the presence of a HECT domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and an RCC1-like domain (RLD) that facilitates protein-protein interactions. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, HERC4 plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, tagging proteins for degradation to regulate protein levels and maintain cellular homeostasis (Hochrainer2005The; Rodriguez2007Disruption). The protein is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the brain and testis, indicating its involvement in brain development and male fertility (SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC4 is also implicated in various cellular pathways, including the Hippo and Hedgehog signaling pathways, and has been associated with several diseases, such as cancer and reproductive disorders (Aerne2015Hippo; Jiang2019E3).

## Structure
HERC4 is a member of the small HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, characterized by the presence of a single RCC1-like domain (RLD) at the N-terminus and a HECT domain at the C-terminus (Hochrainer2005The). The HECT domain is involved in ubiquitin ligase activity, crucial for protein degradation and regulation, and adopts a typical bilobal structure common to HECT domains (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided; SánchezTena2016Functional). The RLD domain, characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller fold, functions in guanine nucleotide exchange and chromatin interaction (SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC4 is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 10q22 and consists of 29 exons, with 25 or 26 typically included in the mature mRNA (SánchezTena2016Functional). Alternative splicing results in various isoforms, some of which lack significant domains, potentially serving as negative regulators of active ubiquitin ligases (Hochrainer2005The). The protein is approximately 118 kDa in size and is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels in the brain and testis (SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC4 localizes to the cytosol and cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures (SánchezTena2016Functional).

## Function
HERC4 is a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is crucial for protein turnover, where HERC4 tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein levels and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Rodriguez2007Disruption). HERC4 contains a HECT domain, which is involved in the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, and RCC1-like domains (RLDs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Hochrainer2005The).

In healthy human cells, HERC4 is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the brain and testis, suggesting a role in brain development and male fertility (Hochrainer2005The; SánchezTena2016Functional). It is involved in spermatogenesis, particularly during spermiogenesis, where it is crucial for the maturation of spermatozoa (Rodriguez2007Disruption). Disruption of HERC4 in mice leads to defects in sperm maturation, indicating its importance in reproductive biology (Rodriguez2007Disruption).

HERC4 also plays a role in cell growth signaling by regulating the Salvador (Sav) protein, which is part of the Hippo pathway, a key growth control and tumor suppressor pathway (SánchezTena2016Functional). This regulation involves a feedback loop where the Hippo pathway stabilizes Sav, counteracting its degradation by HERC4.

## Clinical Significance
The HERC4 gene is implicated in various diseases, primarily through alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, HERC4 is notably overexpressed in several types, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In breast cancer, particularly invasive ductal carcinoma, HERC4 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation correlates with advanced clinical stages, positive lymph node metastasis, and higher histological grades, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene and diagnostic marker (Zhou2013The; SánchezTena2016Functional). In lung cancer, HERC4 is also overexpressed, indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC4 is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and tumor suppression. In breast cancer, decreased expression of miRNAs targeting HERC4 leads to enhanced degradation of LATS1, a tumor suppressor, contributing to cancer progression (Sala-Gaston2020HERC). In colorectal cancer, the circular RNA circHERC4 acts as an oncogenic driver, promoting metastasis through the miR-556-5p/CTBP2/E-cadherin axis (He2021Circular).

In the context of male fertility, disruption of the HERC4 gene in mice results in defects in sperm maturation, leading to reduced fertility due to impaired sperm motility and morphology (Rodriguez2007Disruption).

## Interactions
HERC4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing several cellular pathways. It interacts with the Smoothened (Smo) protein, a component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction occurs through both the HECT and RCC1-like domains of HERC4, with binding sites at the N- and C-terminus of Smo, particularly involving the SAID domain (Jiang2019E3). HERC4 also interacts with deubiquitinases USP8 and UCHL5, which can decrease Smo ubiquitination levels, suggesting competitive binding (Jiang2019E3).

In the Hippo signaling pathway, HERC4 interacts with the Salvador (Sav) protein, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation. This interaction is modulated by the Hippo (Hpo) protein, which stabilizes Sav by inhibiting its ubiquitylation (Aerne2015Hippo).

HERC4 also interacts with the STING protein, facilitated by the compound AK59, which induces a novel protein-protein interaction leading to STING's ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is specific to the presence of AK59 and highlights HERC4's role in the cGAS/STING pathway (Mutlu2023A).
