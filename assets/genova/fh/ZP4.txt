# ZP4

## Overview
ZP4, or zona pellucida glycoprotein 4, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein integral to the structure and function of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding mammalian oocytes. The ZP4 protein is characterized by its involvement in sperm-egg interactions, playing a pivotal role in the binding of sperm to the egg and the induction of the acrosome reaction, which is essential for fertilization (Gupta2009Human; Gupta2021Human). Structurally, ZP4 contains a ZP domain and a unique trefoil motif, which are critical for its polymerization and function within the zona pellucida matrix (Gupta2012Mammalian). The protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which contribute to its stability and function (IzquierdoRico2021ZP4; IzquierdoRico2009Hamster). Mutations in the ZP4 gene have been linked to reproductive disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in fertility and conditions such as ovarian endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (Zou2019Mutation; Zhou2022Can).

## Structure
The ZP4 protein is a component of the zona pellucida, characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains a signal peptide that directs the protein into the secretory pathway, which is cleaved off in the mature protein (Gupta2012Mammalian). The primary structure of ZP4 includes a ZP domain, approximately 260 amino acids long, with 8 conserved cysteine residues crucial for the polymerization and assembly of the zona pellucida matrix (Gupta2012Mammalian). This domain is known for its high β-strand content, contributing to the protein's structural integrity.

ZP4 also features a trefoil motif or P-domain, a 42-amino acid cysteine-rich region with 6 cysteine residues linked by 3 disulfide bonds, which is absent in ZP2 and ZP3 (Gupta2012Mammalian). The protein's tertiary structure is further stabilized by disulfide linkages, particularly in the ZP domain, which are conserved across species (Kanai2007Disulfide).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are prominent in ZP4. The protein has several potential N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation sites, which are conserved across species and contribute to its function and stability (IzquierdoRico2021ZP4; IzquierdoRico2009Hamster). These structural features are essential for ZP4's role in fertilization and sperm binding.

## Function
ZP4 (zona pellucida glycoprotein 4) is a crucial component of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte. It plays a significant role in sperm-egg interaction during fertilization. ZP4, along with ZP3, is involved in the binding of capacitated acrosome-intact spermatozoa to the egg and the induction of the acrosome reaction, a critical step for sperm penetration of the egg (Gupta2009Human; Gupta2021Human). The acrosome reaction involves the fusion of the sperm's outer acrosomal membrane with the plasma membrane, exposing acrosomal contents necessary for egg penetration. ZP4 induces this reaction through a G i independent pathway, involving an increase in intracellular calcium ions and activation of protein kinase A (Gupta2009Human).

ZP4 is expressed in the zona of mature oocytes and in oocytes of primordial, growing, and antral follicles, indicating its involvement throughout oocyte development (Gupta2021Human). The protein is characterized by significant N-linked glycosylation, which is important for its function in the zona pellucida matrix, although glycosylation is not essential for sperm binding (Gupta2009Human). ZP4's role in the zona pellucida is crucial for ensuring the integrity and function of this matrix, contributing to successful fertilization and early embryonic development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZP4 gene have been associated with several reproductive conditions. In the context of fertility, ZP4 mutations can lead to phenotypes such as ZP-thin oocytes (ZTO), which are characterized by a thinner zona pellucida, potentially affecting fertilization and embryo development. These mutations are typically missense and inherited in an autosomal dominant manner (Zhou2022Can). Despite these challenges, some patients with ZP4 mutations have achieved successful pregnancies, particularly through assisted reproductive technologies like intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (Zhou2022Can).

In ovarian endometriosis, ZP4 mutations have been identified in a small percentage of patients, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition. Specific mutations, such as p.M1? and p.A433 V, have been noted, with the latter affecting a highly conserved alanine, which may alter protein structure and function (Zou2019Mutation).

Alterations in ZP4 expression have also been studied in the context of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Variability in ZP4 expression levels among different PCOS phenotypes suggests a potential link between ZP4 and the disorder, although no direct clinical correlations have been established (Meczekalski2015Study).
