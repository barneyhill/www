# ATP9A

## Overview
ATP9A is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase phospholipid transporting 9A (putative), a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is integral to the maintenance of lipid asymmetry across cellular membranes and is involved in the recycling pathway from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Unlike other P4-ATPases, ATP9A does not require association with CDC50 proteins for its function, highlighting its unique role within the family (Andersen2016P4ATPases). The protein localizes to early/recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, where it plays a critical role in vesicle formation and membrane trafficking (Andersen2016P4ATPases). ATP9A is also implicated in the regulation of exosome release and maintaining the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell morphology and intercellular communication (Naik2019The). Mutations in ATP9A are linked to a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, underscoring its significance in neuronal function and development (Vogt2021Biallelic).

## Function
The ATP9A gene encodes a protein that is part of the P4-ATPase family, which are phospholipid flippases involved in maintaining lipid asymmetry in cellular membranes. This protein is crucial for the recycling pathway from endosomes to the plasma membrane, particularly in the recycling of transferrin receptor (TfnR) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) from endosomes back to the plasma membrane (Tanaka2016The). ATP9A is localized to early/recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, where it plays a role in the formation of plasma membrane-destined vesicles or tubules from endosomes (Tanaka2016The).

In healthy human cells, ATP9A is involved in the regulation of exosome release. It acts as a negative regulator, inhibiting exosome secretion, which is crucial for intercellular communication and various physiological processes (Naik2019The). The depletion of ATP9A leads to enhanced exosome release and changes in gene expression related to actin polymerization, suggesting its role in maintaining the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology (Naik2019The). ATP9A is also implicated in maintaining plasma membrane asymmetry, as its depletion results in increased exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface (Naik2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP9A gene are associated with a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by postnatal microcephaly, intellectual disability, and failure to thrive. Affected individuals often exhibit complex neurodevelopmental and behavioral disabilities, including poor fine motor skills, attention deficit, hyperactivity, and abnormal sleep patterns (Vogt2021Biallelic). The disorder is linked to biallelic truncating variants in ATP9A, which lead to a significant reduction in ATP9A mRNA expression and disrupt endosomal trafficking, crucial for brain development (Vogt2021Biallelic).

ATP9A deficiency is also associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and aberrant endosomal recycling. Pathogenic mutations in ATP9A result in altered intracellular distribution and disrupted endosomal recycling, affecting neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission (Meng2023ATP9A). In mouse models, ATP9A deficiency leads to symptoms such as decreased muscle strength, memory deficits, and hyperkinetic movement disorder, mirroring human conditions (Meng2023ATP9A).

The gene's role in endosomal recycling and interaction with small GTPases RAB5 and RAB11 is crucial for maintaining neuronal function, and its deficiency can lead to severe neurological disorders (Meng2023ATP9A).

## Interactions
ATP9A interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of a complex with MON2 and DOPEY2, which is involved in the SNX3-retromer-mediated sorting of Wntless (Wls) and Wnt secretion. This complex is evolutionarily conserved and plays a role in membrane remodeling, necessary for endosomal sorting (McGough2018SNX3retromer). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the association of ATP9A with MON2 and DOPEY2, as DOPEY2-GFP co-precipitates with ATP9A-HA and endogenous MON2, indicating a physical interaction among these proteins (McGough2018SNX3retromer).

ATP9A also interacts with the small GTPases RAB5 and RAB11, binding more strongly to their inactive GDP-bound forms than to their active GTP-bound forms. This interaction suggests that ATP9A plays a key role in the activation of these GTPases, which are critical for vesicle transport and endosomal recycling pathways (Meng2023ATP9A). These interactions are crucial for maintaining neuronal morphology and synaptic transmission, as ATP9A deficiency leads to aberrant endosomal recycling and neurological impairments (Meng2023ATP9A).
