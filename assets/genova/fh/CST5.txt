# CST5

## Overview
CST5 is a gene that encodes the protein cystatin D, a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions primarily as a cysteine protease inhibitor. Cystatin D is characterized by its ability to inhibit specific proteases, such as cathepsin S, H, and L, while not affecting cathepsin B, highlighting its selective inhibitory profile (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin; Zhang2023Type). The protein is predominantly found in human saliva and tears, where it plays a crucial role in protecting tissues from proteolytic damage, thus contributing to oral health and immune regulation (Freije1993Human; Nashida2013Antigenpresenting). Beyond its protective functions, cystatin D is implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and the expression of oncogenes, such as c-MYC, which underscores its potential antitumor activity (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin; Zhang2023Type). The CST5 gene's expression is modulated by factors such as vitamin D and the tumor suppressor protein p53, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Zhang2023Type).

## Structure
Cystatin D, encoded by the CST5 gene, is a member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors. The primary structure of cystatin D consists of 142 amino acid residues, with the first 20 residues forming a signal peptide, resulting in a mature protein of approximately 122 amino acids (Freije1993Human; Zhang2023Type). The protein is characterized by two intrachain disulfide bonds, which are typical of family II cystatins (Freije1993Human).

The secondary structure of cystatin D includes a combination of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The protein's tertiary structure is defined by a common cystatin fold, which consists of a single alpha-helix and a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (Zhang2023Type). This structure is crucial for its function as a protease inhibitor, allowing it to bind to the active sites of target enzymes.

Cystatin D does not form quaternary structures as it functions as a monomer. The protein is known to exist in two allelic forms, differing by a single amino acid at position 26, which can be either cysteine or arginine. These variants exhibit similar inhibitory activities (Zhang2023Type). Cystatin D is primarily found in human saliva and tears, suggesting a role in oral health and protection against proteolytic enzymes (Freije1993Human).

## Function
Cystatin D, encoded by the CST5 gene, is a member of the cystatin superfamily, which functions as a cysteine protease inhibitor. It is primarily active in extracellular spaces, particularly in human saliva, where it plays a protective role against proteolytic damage by inhibiting papain-like enzymes (Freije1993Human). Cystatin D exhibits a more restricted inhibitory spectrum compared to other cystatins, such as cystatin C, as it does not significantly inhibit cathepsin B (Freije1993Human).

The protein is synthesized in the acinar cells of the parotid glands and secreted into saliva, where it contributes to oral health by protecting tissues from proteolytic enzymes found in food (Nashida2013Antigenpresenting). Beyond its role in the oral cavity, cystatin D is involved in immune regulation, potentially influencing antigen-presenting cell activity and tissue remodeling (Dickinson2002Expression; Nashida2013Antigenpresenting). It is also detected in blood serum and renal tubular cells, suggesting a broader physiological role, possibly involving circulation throughout the body and uptake by various tissues (Nashida2013Antigenpresenting).

## Clinical Significance
CST5, encoding cystatin D, plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in colon, gastric, and prostate cancers. It acts as an antitumor gene by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and oncogenic c-MYC expression, which reduces the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of colorectal tumor cells. CST5 expression is induced by vitamin D, known for its antitumor properties, and is downregulated in human colon cancer cells. This gene is also suggested to be a downstream target of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which enhances CST5 expression by interacting with its promoter region. This interaction suggests a protective role of CST5 against tumor progression, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis (Zhang2023Type).

In hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CST5 shows increased expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. However, specific mutations or interaction changes of CST5 in HCC are not detailed. The study highlights the potential of CST genes, including CST5, as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in HCC, although CST5's specific role in this context is less clear (Zhou2019Investigation).

## Interactions
Cystatin D (CST5) is primarily known for its role as a cysteine protease inhibitor, interacting with members of the cathepsin family. It specifically inhibits cathepsin S, H, and L, but not cathepsin B, indicating selective protease interactions (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin; Zhang2023Type). These interactions are crucial for its function in regulating proteolytic activity within cells.

Cystatin D's interaction with cathepsin L is particularly significant, as cathepsin L is involved in the cleavage of E-cadherin and the modulation of transcription factors like CDP/Cux, which are important for cell proliferation and adhesion (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin). However, in human colon cancer cells, no cleaved fragments of E-cadherin or changes in CDP/Cux polypeptides were detected, suggesting that these interactions might be species- or cell type-specific (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin).

Cystatin D also plays a role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of the oncogene c-MYC, although the exact physical interactions involved in this process are not detailed (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin; Zhang2023Type). The protein's interactions extend to influencing the expression of E-cadherin and other adhesion proteins, contributing to its antitumor activity (ρlvarezDíaz2009Cystatin). 

While cystatin D's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its role as a protease inhibitor and its regulatory effects on signaling pathways highlight its importance in cellular processes related to cancer progression.
