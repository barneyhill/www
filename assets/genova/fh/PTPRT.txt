# PTPRT

## Overview
PTPRT, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and intracellular catalytic domains. The extracellular region is involved in interactions with cell adhesion molecules, such as neuroligin and neurexin, which are crucial for synapse formation and maintenance (Lim2009Synapse). The intracellular portion contains two catalytic domains, with the membrane-proximal domain being active and essential for its phosphatase activity (Lim2009Synapse). PTPRT is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and plays a significant role in synaptic connectivity and neuronal communication. It acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating cell adhesion and proliferation, and its mutations have been linked to various neurological disorders and cancers (Hendriks2023Hereditable; hay2021structure).

## Structure
PTPRT is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase with a complex molecular structure. It is characterized by an extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and intracellular catalytic domains. The extracellular region includes a Meprin/A5/PTPmu domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and several fibronectin-type III-like domains, which are crucial for its interactions with cell adhesion molecules such as neuroligin and neurexin (Lim2009Synapse). 

The intracellular portion of PTPRT contains two catalytic domains: the membrane-proximal domain is active, while the membrane-distal domain is inactive (Lim2009Synapse). The active domain features a PTP loop with a catalytic cysteine, essential for its phosphatase activity, and a WPD loop that plays a role in catalysis (hay2021structure). 

PTPRT undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 912 by Fyn protein tyrosine kinase decreases PTPRT's catalytic activity, impacting synapse formation (Lim2009Synapse). 

PTPRT is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and is involved in synaptic formation and maintenance, with mutations linked to neurological disorders and cancer (Lim2020Depressionlike; hay2021structure).

## Function
PTPRT (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a significant role in synapse formation and maintenance in the central nervous system. It is specifically expressed in the brain and is involved in regulating synaptic connectivity through interactions with cell adhesion molecules such as neuroligin and neurexin (Lim2009Synapse). PTPRT enhances synapse formation by increasing the density of dendritic spines and synaptic markers, which are crucial for proper neuronal function (Lim2009Synapse).

At the molecular level, PTPRT functions by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins, including phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) at the Y705 residue, which is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing hyperactivation that could lead to tumor growth (Liu2021ADAM10). PTPRT's phosphatase activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation through the action of Fyn protein tyrosine kinase, which modulates its ability to promote synapse formation (Lim2009Synapse).

In healthy human cells, PTPRT is involved in regulating cell adhesion and proliferation, acting as a tumor suppressor by maintaining normal cell adhesion and proliferation (Hendriks2023Hereditable). Its activity is crucial for neurodevelopment, synaptic formation, and neuronal communication, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper brain function (Liu2021ADAM10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRT gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In metastatic colorectal cancer, deleterious mutations in PTPRT are associated with resistance to bevacizumab, a therapeutic antibody. Patients with these mutations often exhibit a lack of response to treatment and shorter progression-free survival, suggesting that PTPRT mutations could serve as predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab resistance (Hsu2018PTPRT).

In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTPRT mutations are more frequent among African Americans compared to European Americans. These mutations are linked to the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, which is a known oncogenic driver in cancer (Mitchell2019Recurrent). Epigenetic silencing of PTPRT through promoter methylation also contributes to STAT3 activation, promoting tumor growth. This silencing is associated with increased expression of STAT3 target genes, such as Cyclin D1 and Bcl-X L, and may guide targeted therapies against STAT3 (Sen2019PTPRT).

PTPRT mutations have also been identified as potential predictive biomarkers for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) across multiple cancer types. These mutations are associated with better progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with ICIs, particularly in those with high tumor mutational burden (Shang2022PTPRDPTPRT; Wang2021Association).

## Interactions
PTPRT (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in synapse formation and function. PTPRT interacts with neuroligins and neurexins, which are cell adhesion molecules essential for synapse formation. These interactions occur through PTPRT's extracellular ecto-domain and are necessary for recruiting synaptic neuroligins, thereby enhancing synapse density (Lim2009Synapse). 

PTPRT also interacts with the Fyn protein tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates a specific tyrosine residue (Y912) within PTPRT, modulating its phosphatase activity and affecting its interactions with neuroligins and neurexins (Lim2009Synapse). This phosphorylation reduces PTPRT's catalytic activity, promoting homophilic interactions and inhibiting heterophilic interactions with neuroligins, thus influencing synapse formation (Lim2009Synapse).

In addition to its role in synaptic interactions, PTPRT is involved in the regulation of GABAergic synaptic functions. It interacts with the GABA transporter GAT3, regulating its function through tyrosine dephosphorylation, which is crucial for maintaining inhibitory synaptic transmission (Lim2020Depressionlike). These interactions highlight PTPRT's multifaceted role in neuronal signaling and synaptic regulation.
