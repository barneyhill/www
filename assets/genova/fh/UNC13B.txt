# UNC13B

## Overview
The UNC13B gene encodes the protein unc-13 homolog B, which is a crucial component in the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release in neurons. This protein is categorized as a synaptic vesicle-associated protein and is primarily active at the presynaptic terminal, where it facilitates the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, thereby playing a vital role in synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Pooryasin2021Unc13A). Beyond its synaptic functions, unc-13 homolog B is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and lysosomal regulation, influencing cellular homeostasis and drug sensitivity (Chen2024UNC13B; Wang2022UNC13B). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including schizophrenia and cancer, where it affects drug resistance and cell proliferation (Chen2024UNC13B; Egawa2016Rare).

## Function
The UNC13B gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle priming, which is essential for neurotransmitter release in neurons. This protein is primarily active at the presynaptic terminal, where it facilitates the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, a process crucial for efficient synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Pooryasin2021Unc13A). UNC13B is involved in the diacylglycerol second messenger pathway and is primarily located in vesicles, where it promotes exocytosis by facilitating vesicle maturation (Wang2022UNC13B).

In addition to its role in synaptic transmission, UNC13B is implicated in mitochondrial fusion regulation. Its downregulation affects the expression of several downstream genes, including PINK1, which is associated with mitochondrial fusion, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial dynamics (Wang2022UNC13B). The protein also plays a role in lysosomal function, as evidenced by its involvement in vesicle precursor formation and lysosome regulation, which can influence cellular homeostasis and drug sensitivity (Chen2024UNC13B).

Overall, UNC13B is integral to various cellular processes, including exocytosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and lysosomal function, contributing to its significant role in cell biology and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the UNC13B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In schizophrenia, rare missense variations in UNC13B were identified in a family study, but broader population studies did not confirm a significant association with the disease. The study suggested that while UNC13B was a promising candidate gene based on family data, it does not significantly contribute to schizophrenia risk in the general population (Egawa2016Rare).

In cancer research, UNC13B has been linked to drug resistance. In Wilms' tumor cells, elevated expression of UNC13B was associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin. Knockdown of UNC13B increased the sensitivity of these cells to the drug, suggesting its role in drug resistance through lysosomal regulation (Chen2024UNC13B). Similarly, in chronic myeloid leukemia, UNC13B was found to promote resistance to arsenic trioxide by influencing mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis pathways. Downregulation of UNC13B in resistant cells led to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022UNC13B).

## Interactions
UNC13B, also known as unc-13 homolog B, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in synaptic vesicle priming and neurotransmitter release. UNC13B interacts with proteins such as RIM1, Munc18, and syntaxin-1, forming part of the presynaptic active zone complex, which is essential for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. These interactions facilitate efficient synaptic transmission by ensuring the proper assembly and function of the SNARE complex, which is critical for vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.

In the context of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), UNC13B has been shown to interact with proteins involved in cell proliferation and mitochondrial quality control. Downregulation of UNC13B in CML cells leads to decreased levels of MAP3K7, CDK4, and PINK1, indicating its role in regulating these proteins. PINK1, in particular, is important for mitochondrial function, and its interaction with UNC13B suggests a role in mitochondrial quality control and resistance mechanisms in CML (Wang2022UNC13B).

UNC13B also interacts with genes such as NRAS and SRSF1, affecting downstream genes like PINK1, CDK4, and MAP3K7, which are involved in apoptosis and mitochondrial fusion, contributing to cell tolerance to arsenic trioxide (Wang2022UNC13B).
