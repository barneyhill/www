# DNAI2

## Overview
DNAI2 is a gene that encodes the dynein axonemal intermediate chain 2 protein, a critical component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) complex in motile cilia. This protein is integral to the assembly and function of the ODA, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella in human cells. The dynein axonemal intermediate chain 2 protein is categorized as a structural protein, playing a pivotal role in the sliding of microtubules that facilitates ciliary and flagellar movement. DNAI2 is involved in the assembly of both proximal and distal ODA types within the ciliary axoneme, underscoring its importance in respiratory health and other ciliary functions (Rocca2020A; AlMutairi2022Identification). Mutations in DNAI2 are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder that affects ciliary function, leading to various clinical manifestations (Rocca2020A; Mata2014Gene).

## Function
The DNAI2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) complex, which is essential for the function of motile cilia in human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the assembly of the ODA, a multimeric complex necessary for effective ciliary motility. The ODA is a crucial structure within the axoneme of motile cilia and sperm flagella, facilitating the sliding of microtubules that generates ciliary and flagellar movement (Rocca2020A; AlMutairi2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, DNAI2 is involved in the assembly of both ODA type 1 and ODA type 2, which are located in different parts of the ciliary axoneme. ODA type 1 is found in the proximal part of the axoneme, while ODA type 2 is located in the distal part. DNAI2 is present throughout the entire length of the ciliary axonemes, indicating its role in both ODA types (AlMutairi2022Identification). The proper assembly and function of these structures are vital for mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract, which is crucial for respiratory health (AlMutairi2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAI2 gene are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by defects in motile cilia. These defects lead to chronic respiratory infections, infertility, and situs anomalies due to impaired ciliary movement. DNAI2 is a component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) complex, essential for ciliary function. Mutations in DNAI2 account for 2-4% of PCD cases with ODA defects (Rocca2020A; Mata2014Gene).

A specific homozygous missense variant in DNAI2, c.740G>A; p.Arg247Gln, has been identified as a founder variant causing PCD in consanguineous families from a single tribe in the Arabian Peninsula. This variant results in the absence of ODA components in ciliary axonemes, leading to defective ciliary structure and function (AlMutairi2022Identification). The variant was classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance according to ACMG criteria, but functional evidence suggests its pathogenicity (AlMutairi2022Identification).

In some cases, DNAI2 mutations have also been linked to hydrocephalus, a less common clinical sign of PCD, suggesting a potential link between ciliary dysfunction and cerebrospinal fluid disorders (Rocca2020A).

## Interactions
DNAI2 is a component of the outer dynein arm (ODA) complexes in human cilia, playing a crucial role in the assembly and function of these structures. It interacts with other proteins such as DNAH5 and DNAH9, which are components of ODA type 1 and ODA type 2, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies have shown that DNAI2 is localized throughout the entire length of ciliary axonemes, indicating its involvement in the assembly of these complexes (AlMutairi2022Identification).

In vertebrates, DNAI2 has been co-immunoprecipitated with PIH domain-containing proteins such as DNAAF2 and PIH1D3, which are necessary for the assembly of both outer and inner dynein arms. This suggests that DNAI2 is part of intact ODA complexes and plays a role in stabilizing assembly intermediates (Desai2018Cytoplasmic).

In the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DNAI2 has been identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction network, indicating its significant interactions with other proteins involved in cilium movement and microtubule-based processes. However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies (Ye2019Bioinformatic).
