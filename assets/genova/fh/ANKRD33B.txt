# ANKRD33B

## Overview
ANKRD33B is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 33B protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 33B protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. While the specific biological functions of ANKRD33B and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, the gene has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including retinal diseases, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and acute renal allograft rejection. Its potential involvement in inflammatory bowel disease and as a biomarker for certain conditions highlights the need for further research to understand its functional roles and clinical significance (Lu2016Systematic; Zhao2016Integrative; Kiselev2022Novel; Xiang2022Pretransplant).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD33B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and potential mutations. In the context of retinal diseases, ANKRD33B was identified as one of the novel candidate genes potentially associated with these conditions, although it currently lacks substantial experimental evidence to confirm this association (Zhao2016Integrative). In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), ANKRD33B was found to have significant correlations between gene expression and DNA methylation levels, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. However, its specific function in HCM remains unclear, and it was not included in the validation steps of the study (Kiselev2022Novel).

ANKRD33B has also been identified as a potential biomarker for acute renal allograft rejection (AR), although the specific diseases or conditions associated with its mutations or alterations were not detailed in the study (Xiang2022Pretransplant). Additionally, ANKRD33B is mentioned as an inflammatory bowel disease risk gene, but its association with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's is not clearly defined (Lu2016Systematic). These findings suggest that ANKRD33B may play a role in various diseases, but further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance.
