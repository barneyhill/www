# DLG1

## Overview
DLG1 is a gene that encodes the protein discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including maintaining cell polarity, signal transduction, and the organization of cell junctions. DLG1 is characterized by several conserved domains, such as PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domains, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling (Lockwood2008Dynamic; Marziali2019Differential). The protein is involved in critical functions across different systems, including the nervous and immune systems, where it regulates synapse architecture and T-cell signaling, respectively (Humphries2012Characterization; Marziali2019Differential). Alterations in DLG1 expression and function are associated with various diseases, including neurological disorders, cancers, and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker for disease progression (Marziali2019Differential).

## Structure
DLG1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, is characterized by several conserved domains that facilitate its role in cellular processes. The protein includes multiple PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and cellular signaling (Marziali2019Differential). The L27 domain of DLG1 is essential for mediating interactions with AJM-1 and for DLG-1 multimerization, playing a significant role in the organization of cell junctions (Lockwood2008Dynamic).

The PDZ domains are involved in junctional association and are necessary for the efficient localization of DLG-1 at cellular junctions (Lockwood2008Dynamic). The SH3 domain is important for the lateral distribution of DLG-1, functioning through a LET-413/Scribble-dependent pathway (Lockwood2008Dynamic). The complete C-terminus, including the GUK and Hook domains, is required for full rescue of lethality in mutants, indicating its importance for DLG-1 function during embryonic development (Lockwood2008Dynamic).

DLG1 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, such as the 3b(+) variant, which lacks several key domains and is implicated in neurological conditions like early-onset schizophrenia (Uezato2015Reduced). This variant results from alternative splicing influenced by specific SNPs, affecting its expression and function (Uezato2015Reduced).

## Function
The DLG1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity and signal transduction. In epithelial cells, DLG1 is localized at adherens junctions, where it coordinates junction formation and stability, contributing to the maintenance of cell polarity (Marziali2019Differential; Humbert2003Dlg). It is involved in organizing signaling pathways by recruiting kinases to specific cell regions, which supports substrate availability near kinase active sites (Marziali2019Differential).

DLG1 is also active in the nervous system, where it regulates neuron receptor localization and synapse architecture, and in the immune system, where it mediates signal transduction in T-cells (Marziali2019Differential). In T cells, DLG1 is part of the Scribble polarity complex, regulating T cell morphology, migration, and cytokine production. It localizes at the immunological synapse and distal pole complex, facilitating T cell signal transduction and polarity (Humphries2012Characterization).

DLG1 interacts with various cellular signaling networks and is involved in processes such as asymmetric cell division and cell migration. Its expression and localization are altered in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Marziali2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the DLG1 gene are implicated in a variety of diseases, particularly in neurological, inflammatory, and cancer-related conditions. In neurological disorders, DLG1 is crucial for neuronal homeostasis, affecting synaptic transmission and plasticity. Schizophrenia is notably associated with DLG1, where a loss of expression in the prefrontal cortex and microdeletions in the 3q29 locus containing DLG1 have been observed. Changes in DNA methylation and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in DLG1 are also linked to schizophrenia. Similar genetic variations in DLG1 are found in autism-spectrum disorders and frontotemporal dementia (Marziali2019Differential).

In the context of cancer, DLG1 is primarily identified as a tumor suppressor. Altered expression and mutations in DLG1 have been observed in various epithelial cancers, including cervical, colon, lung, and breast cancers. Mislocalization and overexpression of DLG1 are linked to more aggressive disease forms and poorer prognosis in colorectal and endometrial cancers (Marziali2019Differential).

DLG1 is also associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It plays a role in Treg cell function, which is crucial for immune tolerance. Reduced recruitment of DLG1 at the immunological synapse is linked to diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (Marziali2019Differential).

## Interactions
DLG1, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell signaling and maintaining cell polarity. DLG1 interacts with the kinesin motor protein KIF13B through its guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain. This interaction is essential for the transport of MAGUK-containing vesicles on microtubules and is significant for LRP1-mediated lipoprotein endocytosis (Mills2019LDL). The I3 domain of DLG1 is critical for binding to the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1, forming a ternary complex with KIF13B, which is important for receptor-mediated endocytosis and cytoskeletal reorganization (Mills2019LDL).

DLG1 also interacts with the scaffolding protein CASK, which is necessary for its membrane localization. This interaction is crucial for proper mitotic spindle orientation in mammalian epithelial cells and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. The CASK-DLG1 interaction influences the localization of the LGN-NuMA complex, which is involved in spindle orientation (Porter2019The). DLG1's interaction with CASK is implicated in preventing multilumen formation, which is relevant to tumor development (Porter2019The).
