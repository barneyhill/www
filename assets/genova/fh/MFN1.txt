# MFN1

## Overview
Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) is a gene that encodes the mitofusin 1 protein, a dynamin-like GTPase integral to mitochondrial fusion processes. The MFN1 gene is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics, energy production, and cellular homeostasis. The mitofusin 1 protein facilitates the merging of mitochondrial membranes, a critical function for cellular energy metabolism and the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity (Santel2003Mitofusin1). As a GTPase, mitofusin 1 exhibits high activity, which is essential for the tethering and fusion of mitochondrial membranes, distinguishing it from its homolog, mitofusin 2 (Ishihara2004Mitofusin). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as OPA1, further underscore its role in promoting mitochondrial tubulation and elongation (Cipolat2004OPA1). Alterations in MFN1 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, where its downregulation is associated with increased mitochondrial fragmentation and cancer cell metastasis (Zhang2019MFN1-dependent).

## Structure
Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) is a dynamin-like GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, characterized by several structural features. The primary structure of MFN1 includes a GTPase domain and two coiled-coil heptad repeat regions, which are crucial for its function in membrane fusion (Koshiba2004Structural). The secondary structure predominantly consists of alpha-helices, forming a helix bundle (HB) that is integral to the protein's stability and function (Qi2016Structures).

The tertiary structure of MFN1 involves interactions between the GTPase domain and the helical bundles, with the GTPase domain featuring a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. This domain is responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, essential for MFN1's activity (Qi2016Structures). The GTPase domain lacks a 'guanine cap' motif, resulting in an exposed active site, which contributes to its unique nucleotide-binding properties (Qi2016Structures).

In terms of quaternary structure, MFN1 forms nucleotide-dependent dimers, a common feature among dynamin-like GTPases. This dimerization is critical for its role in mitochondrial outer membrane fusion (Qi2016Structures). Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation are common, influencing MFN1's function and regulation (Cao2017MFN1). These structural characteristics enable MFN1 to mediate mitochondrial tethering and fusion effectively.

## Function
Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) is a protein that plays a critical role in mitochondrial fusion, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity in healthy human cells. MFN1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, energy production, and apoptosis. It facilitates the merging of mitochondria, ensuring proper cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Santel2003Mitofusin1).

MFN1 functions as a GTPase, which is crucial for the formation of mitochondrial networks. Its GTPase activity is essential for mitochondrial membrane tethering, a key step in the fusion process. MFN1 exhibits higher GTPase activity compared to its counterpart, Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), making it more efficient in the GTP-dependent membrane tethering process (Ishihara2004Mitofusin). This activity is necessary for the formation of oligomeric complexes that tether mitochondrial membranes, facilitating fusion (Ishihara2004Mitofusin).

The protein's activity is dependent on the inner membrane potential, as demonstrated by experiments showing that disruption of this potential prevents the formation of elongated mitochondrial filaments (Legros2002Mitochondrial). MFN1's role in mitochondrial fusion is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, which are vital for cellular health and development (Chen2003Mitofusins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MFN1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Downregulation of MFN1 is observed in HCC cell lines with high metastatic potential, such as MHCC97-H and HCC-LM3, which are characterized by fragmented mitochondria. This downregulation is associated with a preference for mitochondrial fission over fusion, contributing to the metastatic behavior of these cancer cells (Zhang2019MFN1-dependent). In HCC patients, MFN1 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to peritumor tissues, and this decrease is negatively correlated with the TNM stage and the frequency of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), a condition linked to high recurrence and intrahepatic metastasis (Zhang2019MFN1-dependent).

The study also highlights that MFN1 plays a role in glucose metabolic reprogramming in HCC cells. Overexpression of MFN1 promotes mitochondrial fusion and shifts metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, inhibiting HCC proliferation and metastasis. Conversely, MFN1 knockdown leads to increased mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Zhang2019MFN1-dependent). These findings suggest that MFN1 could be a potential therapeutic target for HCC, as its expression levels significantly impact cancer progression through changes in mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism (Zhang2019MFN1-dependent).

## Interactions
Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) is involved in several key protein interactions that regulate mitochondrial fusion. MFN1 interacts with Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) to mediate the fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane, although the specific interaction dynamics between MFN1 and MFN2 are not fully established (Santel2003Mitofusin1). MFN1 also forms a functional partnership with OPA1, a protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for promoting mitochondrial fusion. OPA1 requires MFN1 to facilitate mitochondrial tubulation and elongation, indicating a specific interdependence between these two proteins (Cipolat2004OPA1).

MFN1 is regulated by ubiquitination through its interaction with Mahogunin Ring Finger-1 (MGRN1). MGRN1 ubiquitinates MFN1, stabilizing it and promoting the formation of higher oligomers necessary for mitochondrial fusion. This ubiquitination does not lead to proteasomal degradation but rather stabilizes MFN1, enhancing its function in mitochondrial dynamics (Mukherjee2016Regulation). Additionally, MFN1 interacts with the fission protein Drp1, and blocking Drp1 can prevent mitochondrial fragmentation in cells expressing mutant forms of MFN1, suggesting a regulatory balance between fusion and fission processes (Santel2003Mitofusin1).
