# ADGRG1

## Overview
ADGRG1, also known as GPR56, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G1, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its large extracellular region and seven-transmembrane domain, which are integral to its function in cellular adhesion and signaling. The protein plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including brain development, muscle cell differentiation, and immune regulation. It is particularly important in the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, essential for myelination in the central nervous system, and in maintaining the integrity of the pial basement membrane during cortical development. Mutations in ADGRG1 are associated with neurological disorders such as bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, and its expression levels have been implicated in cancer progression, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context (Ng2021Role; Salzman2020Specific; Huang2018The).

## Structure
The ADGRG1 protein, also known as GPR56, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, characterized by a large extracellular region (ECR) and a seven-transmembrane domain. The ECR of GPR56 includes two main domains: a PTX/LNS-like (PLL) domain at the N-terminus and a GAIN domain at the C-terminus. The PLL domain is a 133 amino acid, 12-stranded beta sandwich structure, distinct from known pentraxin (PTX) and laminin/neurexin/sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains, and is involved in adhesion-related functions (Salzman2016Structural). The GAIN domain is responsible for autoproteolysis, cleaving the receptor into an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF), which remain associated to form the mature receptor (Salzman2016Structural; Salzman2017Stachelindependent).

Alternative splicing of ADGRG1 results in several isoforms, including splice variant 4 (S4), which lacks the N-terminal 175 residues, including the PLL domain, due to a frameshift and a new translation start site (Salzman2016Structural; Salzman2017Stachelindependent). This splicing can modulate the receptor's function and expression, impacting its role in brain development and signaling (Salzman2016Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its interactions, as seen with tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) binding (Salzman2020Specific).

## Function
The human gene ADGRG1, also known as GPR56, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family and plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, GPR56 is crucial for brain development, particularly in the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which is essential for myelination in the central nervous system (Salzman2020Specific). The interaction between GPR56 and its ligand, tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), is vital for these functions, with a specific histidine residue on GPR56 being critical for its role in myelination (Salzman2020Specific).

GPR56 is also involved in the development of the frontal cortex, where it maintains the integrity of the pial basement membrane during cortical development. Mutations in GPR56 can lead to bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, a severe brain cortical malformation (Huang2018The). Beyond the central nervous system, GPR56 is implicated in muscle cell differentiation and immune regulation, functioning as an inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells (Huang2018The). In the immune system, it regulates cytotoxic effector functions, such as the production of inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic enzymes (Hsiao2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADGRG1 gene, also known as GPR56, are linked to several neurological disorders, most notably bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP). BFPP is characterized by severe brain malformations, including changes in the cortex and white matter, leading to cognitive impairment, motor delays, and seizures (Folts2019Adhesion; El2024ADGRG1related). Specific mutations, such as p.Gln296Ter and c.308T > C (p.Leu103Pro), have been identified in affected individuals, resulting in early protein truncation and functional impairment (Cauley2019Overlap; El2024ADGRG1related).

Alterations in ADGRG1 expression are also implicated in cancer progression. In melanoma, GPR56 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis through mechanisms involving TG2 internalization and degradation (Ng2021Role). Conversely, in other cancers such as breast, pancreatic, and colorectal, upregulated GPR56 expression is associated with enhanced cell growth, adhesion, and drug resistance (Ng2021Role). In glioblastoma, GPR56 inhibits cell adhesion and migration, impacting mesenchymal differentiation and radioresistance (Ng2021Role). These findings highlight the dual role of ADGRG1 in different cancer types, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context.

## Interactions
ADGRG1, also known as GPR56, is involved in various interactions with proteins that influence its signaling and functional roles. It interacts with microglia-derived tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and the extracellular matrix protein laminin, which are crucial for oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and remyelination. This interaction is part of a signaling module that promotes myelin formation and repair (Morgan2019The).

GPR56 also interacts with G proteins, specifically Gα12 and Gα13, which are involved in its signaling pathways. The receptor can be activated by different ligands, such as the antibody 10C7 and the small molecule 3-α-acetoxydihydrodeoxygedunin (3αDOG), leading to differential G protein selectivity. The 10C7 antibody favors G13 activation and promotes the recruitment of β-arrestin-2, although GPR56 internalization is β-arrestin independent (Jallouli2024G).

The GAIN domain of ADGRG1, which includes a tethered peptide agonist, is involved in mechanical stability and signaling. This domain undergoes structural changes under mechanical stress, which can lead to different activation mechanisms, such as GAIN shedding and Stachel dissociation (Dumas2023Uncovering). These interactions and structural features highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of ADGRG1 in cellular processes.
