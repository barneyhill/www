# ALDH7A1

## Overview
The ALDH7A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 family member A1, a critical component of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, thereby playing a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. ALDH7A1 is categorized as a dehydrogenase enzyme and is active in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it contributes to lysine metabolism and cellular energy regulation. The enzyme's structure includes distinct domains for NAD+ binding, catalysis, and oligomerization, which are essential for its function and stability (Korasick2021Impact; Luo2015Structural). Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene are linked to pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance in neurological health (Coughlin2019The; Kozhanova2019Mutation).

## Structure
The ALDH7A1 protein is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and exhibits a characteristic fold and oligomeric structure. It consists of three main domains: the NAD+ binding domain, the catalytic domain, and the oligomerization domain. The NAD+ binding domain adopts a Rossmann fold, which is a common motif for nucleotide binding, featuring a parallel 5-stranded β-sheet (Korasick2021Impact; Luo2015Structural). The catalytic domain has an α/β structure and contains a nucleophilic cysteine residue, Cys302, which is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Luo2015Structural). The oligomerization domain is a β-substructure that facilitates domain-swapped dimerization and tetramerization, which are essential for the enzyme's function (Korasick2017Importance).

The quaternary structure of ALDH7A1 is predominantly a tetramer, which is the active form of the enzyme. This tetrameric assembly is stabilized by the presence of NAD+, which promotes the formation of the active tetrameric structure (Korasick2018NAD+). The C-terminus of ALDH7A1 is flexible and plays a significant role in oligomerization and catalytic activity, with specific residues such as Ala505 and Gln506 being crucial for these functions (Korasick2017Importance). Mutations affecting these residues can lead to significant catalytic defects and impact the enzyme's oligomeric state (Korasick2017Importance).

## Function
The ALDH7A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 7A1, which plays a crucial role in cellular defense mechanisms and metabolic processes. In healthy human cells, ALDH7A1 is involved in the detoxification of aldehydes, protecting cells from oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. It metabolizes reactive aldehydes such as hexanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), which are byproducts of lipid peroxidation, thereby reducing cellular damage (Brocker2011Aldehyde).

ALDH7A1 also contributes to lysine metabolism by converting α-aminoadipic semialdehyde to α-aminoadipic acid, which is important for maintaining cellular nitrogen pools and synthesizing glutamate and ketone bodies (Brocker2010Aldehyde; Brocker2011Aldehyde). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, with its mitochondrial variant providing more protection against oxidative stress than the cytosolic form (Brocker2011Aldehyde).

In addition to its role in oxidative stress defense, ALDH7A1 is involved in cellular energy homeostasis. It inhibits intracellular transport pathways during hypoxia and starvation by targeting the BARS protein, which helps maintain ATP levels and cell viability under energy stress conditions (Yang2019ALDH7A1). This multifaceted enzyme is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival under various stress conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene are primarily associated with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE), a rare form of epileptic encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by seizures that are resistant to standard antiepileptic drugs but respond to pharmacological doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) (Coughlin2019The; Kozhanova2019Mutation). The deficiency of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, encoded by ALDH7A1, leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as α-aminoadipic semialdehyde and piperideine-6-carboxylic acid, which inactivate pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6 (Coci2017Novel; Scharer2010The).

PDE is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with most patients having biallelic pathogenic variants in the ALDH7A1 gene (Coughlin2020Consensus). The most common pathogenic variant is c.1279G>C, p.Glu427Gln, particularly in individuals of European ancestry (Coughlin2019The). Despite treatment with pyridoxine, many individuals with PDE experience intellectual disability and developmental delays (Coughlin2019The; Scharer2010The).

Management of PDE may include a lysine-restricted diet and pharmacologic doses of arginine to improve biochemical parameters and cognitive development (Coughlin2020Consensus). Early diagnosis and treatment with pyridoxine are crucial for better neurodevelopmental outcomes, although complete normalization of development is not always achieved (Jiao2021Analysis).

## Interactions
ALDH7A1, also known as antiquitin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and stability. In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PADC), ALDH7A1 interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8). This interaction inhibits the proteasomal degradation of ALDH7A1 by preventing BMI1-mediated polyubiquitination, thereby supporting the growth of PADC cells (Tan2021EPS8). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between ALDH7A1 and EPS8 in PADC cell lines, such as MIA PaCa-2 and AsPANC-1 (Tan2021EPS8).

ALDH7A1 also interacts with the E3 ligase BMI1, which is responsible for its polyubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ALDH7A1 stability, as BMI1 knockdown reduces ALDH7A1 polyubiquitination and degradation (Tan2021EPS8). The binding of ALDH7A1 to BMI1 is mutually exclusive with its binding to EPS8, indicating distinct regulatory pathways (Tan2021EPS8).

These interactions highlight the role of ALDH7A1 in cellular processes related to cancer progression and its regulation through protein-protein interactions.
