# LILRB1

## Overview
LILRB1, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane receptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The LILRB1 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is primarily expressed on immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. It functions as an inhibitory receptor by interacting with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and viral proteins, such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded UL18. These interactions play a critical role in modulating immune cell activity, particularly by inhibiting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The receptor's structure includes four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains and a cytoplasmic tail with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are essential for its signaling function (Nam2013Crystal; Hu2024MHC1LILRB1). Variations in the LILRB1 gene have been associated with several diseases, including glioma, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease pathogenesis (Zou2023Elevated; Sinthuwiwat2022A; Jan2023Rare).

## Structure
The LILRB1 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. It contains four extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D4), which are crucial for its function as an immune inhibitory receptor. The D1 and D2 domains are primarily responsible for binding to MHC class I molecules, including HLA-A2 and the HCMV-encoded MHC-I homolog UL18, with the D1D2 domains forming a conserved docking orientation with the α3 and β2m domains of MHC-I (Nam2013Crystal; yu2020investigation). The D3 and D4 domains, while not directly involved in ligand binding, serve as a structural scaffold and are arranged at an acute angle (~60°), forming a bent structure similar to natural killer inhibitory receptors (Nam2013Crystal).

The intracellular portion of LILRB1 includes a cytoplasmic tail with four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are essential for its inhibitory signaling function (Hu2024MHC1LILRB1). Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, may influence the protein's binding interactions and stability (yu2020investigation). The structural features of LILRB1, including its domain organization and post-translational modifications, are critical for its role in immune regulation.

## Function
LILRB1, or leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1, is a receptor that plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. LILRB1 interacts with various ligands, including classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules, as well as viral proteins like UL18 from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (brown2004lilr).

The interaction between LILRB1 and its ligands inhibits the activity of NK cells, which are responsible for lysing cells deficient in MHC class I expression. This inhibition occurs because LILRB1 recognition of MHC class I on target cells prevents CD16-dependent lysis by NK cells, complementing the inhibitory effects of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cell activity. LILRB1 may also inhibit the adhesion of NK cells to their targets during the initial recognition process (brown2004lilr).

LILRB1's broad specificity for class I proteins suggests it might bind at conserved sites, although there are subtle differences in how LILRB1 and other receptors like LILRB2 engage MHC class I. The interaction involves specific contact residues, such as residue 184, which is crucial for binding with beta-2 microglobulin (b2m) (brown2004lilr).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LILRB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, LILRB1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with tumor immune infiltration and is linked to pathways such as JAK/STAT and chemokine signaling, which promote tumor growth and metastasis (Zou2023Elevated). Hypomethylation of LILRB1 is associated with increased expression and worse outcomes in glioma patients (Zou2023Elevated).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rare variants in LILRB1, including missense and frameshift mutations, have been identified. These variants may destabilize the protein, affecting immune regulation and contributing to IBD pathogenesis (Jan2023Rare).

LILRB1 is also linked to autoimmune diseases. A specific variant, p.G160E, decreases the phosphorylation of SHP-1, leading to immune dysregulation and conditions such as Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (Sinthuwiwat2022A). This variant affects the balance of macrophage phenotypes, promoting a pro-inflammatory state (Sinthuwiwat2022A).

In Alzheimer's disease, LILRB1 variants are associated with altered immune responses, suggesting that its activation may increase disease risk (Reddy2022Polygenic).

## Interactions
LILRB1, a leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor, engages in various interactions with proteins, primarily involving major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. It binds to classical MHC-I molecules and the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded MHC-I homolog UL18, with UL18 exhibiting the highest binding affinity due to extensive contact residues and a larger buried surface area (yu2020investigation). LILRB1's interaction with UL18 is significant in the immune response of natural killer (NK) cells to HCMV, primarily serving an inhibitory role, although it can enhance NK cell killing in certain contexts (yu2020investigation).

LILRB1 also interacts with non-MHC-I ligands such as S100A8 and S100A9, and directly with pathogens like the dengue virus, malaria, and bacteria, although the specific molecules involved are not fully understood (yu2020investigation). The receptor can bind in cis with MHC-I molecules on the same cell surface, potentially transducing inhibitory signals (yu2020investigation).

Polymorphisms in LILRB1 influence its binding to various ligands, including HLA-Cw15, HLA-G, and UL18, affecting immune responses and potentially influencing post-transplant HCMV susceptibility (Yu2018LILRB1). The receptor's interaction with HLA-G is particularly noted for inhibiting NK cell cytotoxicity and contributing to fetal tolerance (yu2020investigation).
