# PDE7B

## Overview
PDE7B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphodiesterase 7B, which is a member of the phosphodiesterase enzyme family. This enzyme is specifically involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a critical second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. As a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE7B plays a vital role in modulating intracellular cAMP levels, thereby influencing various physiological processes, including neural activity, immune responses, and cellular homeostasis (Hetman2000Cloning; Gardner2000Cloning). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, heart, and liver, suggesting its involvement in neural and metabolic functions (Sasaki2000Identification; Gardner2000Cloning). PDE7B's activity is characterized by a high affinity for cAMP, making it an efficient regulator of cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Sasaki2000Identification; Gardner2000Cloning). Alterations in PDE7B expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and leukemia, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Identification; Zhang2008Cyclic; Cao2019The; Sun2020&lt).

## Structure
PDE7B is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase enzyme encoded by the PDE7B gene. The primary structure of PDE7B consists of 446 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 50.1 kDa (Hetman2000Cloning). The enzyme has a catalytic domain that shares 70% identity with PDE7A, indicating a close relationship within the PDE7 family (Hetman2000Cloning). This catalytic domain is responsible for the hydrolysis of cAMP, a crucial function in cellular signaling (Hetman2000Cloning).

PDE7B exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including PDE7B1, PDE7B2, and PDE7B3, which differ in their amino acid lengths and phosphorylation sites. PDE7B1 and PDE7B3 contain two PKA phosphorylation sites, while PDE7B2 has one (SASAKI2002Novel; Chen2021Phosphodiesterase). These variants exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting distinct physiological roles (SASAKI2002Novel).

The secondary and tertiary structures of PDE7B have not been crystallized, but a theoretical model exists, highlighting the need for further structural studies (Redondo2013Unraveling). The enzyme's structure is conserved across species, with high sequence identity between human and mouse PDE7B (Chen2021Phosphodiesterase).

## Function
PDE7B is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a key second messenger involved in various cellular signaling pathways. By hydrolyzing cAMP, PDE7B modulates signal transduction processes that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Hetman2000Cloning; Gardner2000Cloning).

In healthy human cells, PDE7B is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, and occipital lobe, as well as in the heart and liver (Sasaki2000Identification; Gardner2000Cloning). This expression pattern suggests that PDE7B is involved in neural activity and cAMP metabolism in the brain, potentially influencing processes like learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity (ReyesIrisarri2005Neuronal; Sasaki2000Identification).

PDE7B's activity is characterized by a high affinity for cAMP, with kinetic studies showing low Km values, indicating its efficiency in cAMP hydrolysis (Sasaki2000Identification; Gardner2000Cloning). The enzyme's function is critical for modulating cAMP-mediated signaling pathways, which can impact various physiological outcomes, including neuronal signaling and immune responses (ReyesIrisarri2005Neuronal; Szczypka2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PDE7B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), low expression of PDE7B is associated with poor overall survival and disease-specific survival, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. The gene's expression is negatively correlated with advanced TNM stage and histologic grade, indicating its potential as a biomarker for ccRCC progression (Identification; p&gt; Sun2020&lt).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), PDE7B is overexpressed, and its inhibition has been shown to promote apoptosis in CLL cells. This suggests that PDE7B could be a therapeutic target in CLL, as its increased expression is linked to defective apoptosis in these cells (Zhang2008Cyclic).

In cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), high PDE7B expression is associated with shorter survival times and is considered an independent prognostic predictor. This high expression is linked to poor prognosis, potentially due to its role in regulating cAMP levels, which affects leukemia cell differentiation and maturation (Cao2019The).
