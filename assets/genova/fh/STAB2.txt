# STAB2

## Overview
STAB2 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilin-2, a large transmembrane receptor involved in various physiological processes. Stabilin-2 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple fasciclin-like adhesion domains and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, facilitating its role in cellular adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix (POLITZ2002Stabilin1). This multifunctional receptor is primarily expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and is crucial for the systemic clearance of hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans, contributing to the regulation of blood viscosity and extracellular matrix composition (Harris2020Role). Additionally, stabilin-2 plays a significant role in the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, myoblast fusion, and various signaling pathways, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis (Harris2020Role; Park2016Stabilin2). Variants in the STAB2 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as venous thromboembolic disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis (Du2020Prognostic; Desch2020Wholeexome).

## Structure
Stabilin-2 (STAB2) is a large transmembrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It contains multiple fasciclin-like adhesion domains, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, and laminin-type EGF-like domains (POLITZ2002Stabilin1). The protein features seven fasciclin domains and 18-20 EGF-like domains, which include both standard and atypical types. The atypical EGF-like domains have extra cysteine residues forming additional disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining protein conformation and facilitating phosphatidylserine recognition (Park2008Epidermal).

Stabilin-2 also includes a single X-link domain, which is important for hyaluronan binding and endocytosis, particularly in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (POLITZ2002Stabilin1; Harris2019Ligand). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which affects ligand-receptor interactions and signal propagation (Harris2019Ligand).

Alternative splicing of STAB2 results in different isoforms, including a truncated form lacking the C-terminal fasciclin domain and transmembrane region, suggesting a secreted variant (POLITZ2002Stabilin1). The presence of multiple domain modules in stabilin-2 suggests its role in mediating cellular adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix (POLITZ2002Stabilin1).

## Function
Stabilin-2 (STAB2) is a multifunctional receptor involved in various molecular processes essential for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis. It is primarily expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and plays a critical role in the systemic clearance of hyaluronan (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix, as well as other glycosaminoglycans (POLITZ2002Stabilin1; Harris2020Role). Stabilin-2 facilitates the endocytosis of HA and other ligands, such as heparin and advanced glycation end-products, contributing to the regulation of blood viscosity and extracellular matrix composition (POLITZ2002Stabilin1; Harris2020Role).

In addition to its role in HA clearance, Stabilin-2 is involved in the recognition and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by binding to phosphatidylserine on their surfaces, thus aiding in immune response and tissue integrity (Harris2020Role). It also participates in myoblast fusion during muscle formation and regeneration, a process crucial for muscle development and repair (Park2016Stabilin2). The receptor's involvement in signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, underscores its role in cellular responses and changes (Harris2020Role). Overall, Stabilin-2 is essential for maintaining homeostasis by clearing various molecules and facilitating cellular processes across different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STAB2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. Variants in STAB2 are associated with changes in plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels, which can increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). Studies have identified rare STAB2 variants that result in reduced stabilin-2 function, leading to elevated VWF levels and a higher risk of VTE (Desch2020Wholeexome). Stabilin-2 deficiency has also been shown to increase thrombotic burden and alter thrombus composition in mouse models, suggesting a significant role in thrombotic disorders (Michels2021Stabilin‐2).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high STAB2 expression is associated with better prognosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The gene's role in clearing hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer involved in tumor processes, may contribute to this protective effect (Du2020Prognostic). Alterations in STAB2 expression levels have been linked to various clinical features in HCC, such as early TNM stages and low alpha-fetoprotein levels, which correlate with improved patient outcomes (Du2020Prognostic).

## Interactions
Stabilin-2 (STAB2) is a multifunctional scavenger receptor that participates in various interactions with proteins and other molecules. It is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine on their surfaces, facilitating their engulfment by macrophages through interactions with integrins such as αMβ2 and αvβ5 (Harris2020Role; Weigel2020Systemic). Stabilin-2 also interacts with hyaluronic acid (HA) and heparin, serving as a clearance receptor for these glycosaminoglycans. The receptor's Link domain is crucial for HA binding, although it binds with relatively weak affinity compared to other hyalectins (Harris2020Role; Weigel2019Discovery).

Stabilin-2 is involved in the endocytosis of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) complex, influencing their clearance and immunogenicity. This interaction is modulated by genetic variability and N-linked glycans on VWF, which affect its uptake by stabilin-2-expressing cells (Swystun2018The). Stabilin-2 also interacts with other receptors, such as the asialoglycoprotein receptor, SIGLEC5, SR-A1, and LDL receptor family members, which may play roles in the immune response to FVIII (Swystun2018The). These interactions highlight stabilin-2's role in both cellular clearance processes and immune regulation.
