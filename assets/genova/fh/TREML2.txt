# TREML2

## Overview
TREML2 is a gene that encodes the protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells like 2, which is a member of the TREM family of receptors. This protein is primarily expressed in myeloid and lymphoid cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and microglia, and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses. TREML2 is characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are typical features of immunoglobulin-like receptors (Kober2020Functional). The protein is involved in various immune processes, such as the clearance of apoptotic cells and debris, and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. A specific missense variant of the TREML2 gene, rs3747742, has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Song2019TREML2; Kühn2022TREML2).

## Structure
The TREML2 protein is a member of the TREM family, characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The structure of TREML2 is predicted to have an immunoglobulin fold ectodomain with a basic isoelectric point (pI), similar to TREM2, although it exhibits different binding characteristics (Kober2020Functional). The protein's ectodomain is involved in interactions with other molecules, although specific binding sites differ from those of TREM2, particularly in its interaction with apolipoprotein E (apoE) (Kober2020Functional).

Post-translational modifications of TREML2 may include glycosylation, which is common among immunoglobulin-like receptors, potentially affecting its stability and function. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can lead to variations in its structure and function. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TREML2 are not provided in the available context. The lack of detailed structural information suggests that further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular architecture of TREML2 and its functional implications in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Function
The TREML2 gene encodes a protein that is primarily expressed in myeloid and lymphoid cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and B cells. In neutrophils, TREML2 expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory signals, particularly bacterial products, enhancing the response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists. This leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species, degranulation, and chemotaxis, suggesting a role in regulating the antimicrobial immune response (Kühn2022TREML2).

In macrophages, TREML2 is upregulated by toll-like receptor activation and mediates the ingestion of apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine, a process crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Kühn2022TREML2). In the brain, TREML2 is mainly expressed by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. It is involved in the clearance of debris, such as amyloid-beta, which is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (Kühn2022TREML2).

The TREML2 protein's activity in these cells highlights its role in modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining immune system function. Its expression increases with age and is responsive to inflammatory stimuli, indicating its involvement in both normal immune processes and age-related changes in immune function (Kühn2022TREML2).

## Clinical Significance
The TREML2 gene has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through its missense variant rs3747742, which is associated with a reduced risk of AD. This variant is linked to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau proteins, which are biomarkers of AD, and increased hippocampal volume, suggesting a protective effect against neurodegeneration (Wang2020A; Kühn2022TREML2). The rs3747742 variant may influence mRNA folding, stability, and translational efficiency, potentially affecting AD risk through endophenotypes (Kühn2022TREML2).

TREML2 expression in whole blood is associated with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, a condition linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, although no direct association with AD-related brain atrophy was found (Kühn2022TREML2). The gene's expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory mediators, indicating its role in immune response regulation (Kühn2022TREML2).

In microglia, TREML2 expression is increased in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, suggesting a role in modulating inflammatory responses. TREML2 downregulation reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, indicating its involvement in immune response modulation, which may be relevant to AD pathogenesis (Zheng2016Opposing).

## Interactions
TREML2, a member of the TREM family, is involved in immune response regulation. It is expressed on lymphoid and myeloid cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, and is primarily expressed by microglia in the brain (Kühn2022TREML2). TREML2 expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory signals and is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells and debris, such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) (Kühn2022TREML2).

Despite its role in immune regulation, TREML2 does not interact with the B7-H3 protein, as studies have shown no binding between TREML2 and B7-H3 in both human and mouse models (Leitner2009B7‐H3). Additionally, TREML2 does not share apolipoprotein E (apoE) as a ligand with TREM2, another member of the TREM family, indicating distinct roles in microglial function and inflammatory response (Kober2020Functional).

The TREML2 gene has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk modification. A missense variant, rs3747742, is linked to reduced AD risk and is associated with lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau proteins and increased hippocampal volume, suggesting a protective effect against neurodegeneration (Song2019TREML2; Kühn2022TREML2).
