# CEACAM18

## Overview
Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 18 (CEACAM18) is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 18, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family. This protein is categorized as a cell adhesion molecule, which plays a crucial role in mediating cell-cell interactions. CEACAM18 is involved in various biological processes, including cellular signaling and immune response modulation. The protein's structure and function are integral to its role in maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating communication between cells. Understanding the interactions and pathways involving CEACAM18 is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
