# PPP2R5C

## Overview
The PPP2R5C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'gamma, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and signal transduction. The B'gamma subunit, encoded by PPP2R5C, plays a pivotal role in determining the substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the PP2A holoenzyme, thereby influencing its functional outcomes. This regulatory subunit is involved in key metabolic pathways, such as glucose and lipid metabolism, and interacts with significant cellular regulators like p53 and NF-κB, highlighting its importance in cellular stress responses and immune function. Alterations in PPP2R5C expression or mutations have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and overgrowth syndromes, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Cheng2015PPP2R5C; Clark2019Protein; Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

## Structure
The PPP2R5C gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically the B'gamma subunit. This subunit is part of the PP2A holoenzyme, which is a heterotrimeric complex composed of a scaffolding A-subunit, a catalytic C-subunit, and a regulatory B-subunit. The B-subunits, including PPP2R5C, are crucial for determining the substrate specificity and subcellular localization of PP2A (Clark2019Protein).

Structurally, the PPP2R5C protein contains conserved domains such as the acidic loop (AL) and the SLIM-binding domain (SBD), which are important for substrate recognition and binding (Vaneynde2022The). The central region of the PP2A-B' genes, to which PPP2R5C belongs, is conserved and likely involved in association with the scaffold and catalytic subunits, while the C and N terminals may regulate substrate diversity (Cheng2015PPP2R5C).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of the B subunits, including PPP2R5C. These modifications may influence the interaction with other proteins and the overall activity of the PP2A holoenzyme (Clark2019Protein). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of PPP2R5C are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PPP2R5C encodes a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including metabolism regulation and cell cycle control. In healthy human cells, PPP2R5C plays a significant role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism. It acts as a negative regulator of glycolysis and lipogenesis, influencing glucose uptake and lipid storage in hepatocytes (Cheng2015PPP2R5C). The protein is involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, with its expression levels being responsive to nutritional status (Cheng2015PPP2R5C).

PPP2R5C interacts with several key metabolic regulators, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), which are involved in energy homeostasis and glycolytic flux (Cheng2015PPP2R5C). The protein's activity is linked to the regulation of p53 tumor suppressor activity and NF-κB signaling, indicating its broader role in cellular stress responses and immune function (Cheng2015PPP2R5C). In the liver, PPP2R5C is implicated in balancing glucose uptake and lipid secretion, which may have implications for conditions like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Cheng2015PPP2R5C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PPP2R5C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and overgrowth syndromes. In leukemia, overexpression of PPP2R5C is associated with malignant transformation and poor prognosis. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), suppression of PPP2R5C expression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target, especially in imatinib-resistant cases (Shen2013Proliferation; Liu2015Alteration). Similarly, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high PPP2R5C expression correlates with unfavorable responses to chemotherapy and reduced survival rates (El2019Prognostic).

In addition to its role in leukemia, PPP2R5C mutations have been linked to human overgrowth syndromes. Specific mutations in the gene can lead to excessive growth and intellectual disabilities, as these mutations affect the protein's substrate specificity and phosphatase activity (Loveday2019Corrigendum:). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in growth regulation pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT cascade, which are crucial for normal development and cellular homeostasis (Loveday2019Corrigendum:). The gene's dysregulation in these pathways underscores its clinical significance in both oncological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
PPP2R5C, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. The B56γ3 regulatory subunit of PPP2R5C is crucial for controlling nuclear PP2A activity, which contributes to its tumor-suppressing functions. A mutation in PPP2R5C, specifically F395C, disrupts the interaction between B56γ and p53, underscoring the importance of this interaction in cancer contexts (Zheng2011Expression).

PPP2R5C also interacts with proteins involved in various signaling pathways. For instance, its downregulation affects genes in the TCR signaling pathway, such as PAK1, MAP3K8, and GSK-3b, which are also part of the MAPK signaling pathway. This suggests that PPP2R5C may influence cell proliferation through these pathways (Chen2013Differential). Additionally, PPP2R5C is involved in the dephosphorylation of p53, playing a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation (Shen2013Proliferation).

These interactions highlight PPP2R5C's role in regulating key signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in various malignancies, including leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (Shen2013Proliferation).
