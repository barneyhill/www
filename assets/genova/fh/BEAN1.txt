# BEAN1

## Overview
The BEAN1 gene encodes the protein known as brain expressed associated with NEDD4 1, which is primarily expressed in neural tissues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation and signaling pathways. As a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, the protein encoded by BEAN1 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by targeting specific substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The precise mechanisms by which BEAN1 influences neural function and development are still under investigation, but its interactions with other proteins suggest a significant role in neural signaling and plasticity. Understanding the function and regulation of BEAN1 is essential for elucidating its potential implications in neurological disorders and diseases.
