# EPOR

## Overview
The EPOR gene encodes the erythropoietin receptor, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production. This receptor is part of the cytokine receptor family and is primarily expressed on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Upon binding with erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced by the kidneys, the erythropoietin receptor undergoes dimerization, which is crucial for activating the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling pathway. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, facilitating downstream signaling that promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells into mature red blood cells (Watowich2011The; Elliott2013Progress). Mutations in the EPOR gene can lead to conditions such as familial erythrocytosis and primary familial and congenital polycythemia, characterized by an increased red blood cell mass due to hypersensitivity to EPO (Sokol1995Primary; Percy2008Familial).

## Structure
The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a single-span transmembrane protein with 507 amino acids in humans, belonging to the cytokine receptor family. Its extracellular region consists of two fibronectin type III domains, D1 and D2, each comprising approximately 100 residues forming antiparallel β strands. D1 has a topology similar to fibronectin type III domains and contains a short α-helix, while D2 resembles fibronectin type III but lacks disulfide bridges (Li2017Erythropoietin; Livnah1996Functional). The D1 domain contains four conserved cysteine residues forming two intramolecular disulfide bridges, crucial for protein folding and ligand binding (Watowich2011The; Kubatzky2005Structural).

The EPOR forms a homodimer upon erythropoietin binding, with a 2:1 receptor-ligand assembly. This dimerization is essential for its activation and subsequent signaling through the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway (Wilson1999The). The transmembrane domain, comprising 21 residues, is crucial for receptor dimerization and activation, transferring conformational changes from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic domain (Li2017Erythropoietin). The cytoplasmic region contains phosphorylatable tyrosine residues that interact with SH2 domain-containing proteins, facilitating downstream signaling pathways (Li2017Erythropoietin). The receptor's structure allows for flexibility in ligand binding, accommodating erythropoietin mimetic peptides and other molecules (Wilson1999The).

## Function
The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is a critical component in the regulation of erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production. EPOR is primarily expressed on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, where it is activated by erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced by the kidneys in response to hypoxia or anemia (Watowich2011The; Elliott2013Progress). Upon EPO binding, EPOR undergoes dimerization, which is essential for initiating a signal transduction cascade primarily through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (Watowich2011The). This signaling cascade promotes the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells into mature red blood cells (Watowich2011The; Elliott2013Progress).

EPOR is a transmembrane protein that requires accessory factors like Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) for activation. The activation of JAK2 leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on EPOR, creating docking sites for signaling molecules such as STAT5, which then translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression (Watowich2011The; Elliott2013Progress). This process is crucial for maintaining normal red blood cell levels and is vital during fetal development and in response to erythropoietic stress (Watowich2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPOR gene are associated with several conditions, primarily familial erythrocytosis and primary familial and congenital polycythemia (PFCP). These conditions are characterized by an increased red blood cell mass due to hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to erythropoietin (EPO). This hypersensitivity is often caused by truncating mutations in the EPOR gene, which lead to a loss of the C-terminal negative regulatory domain of the receptor, resulting in prolonged activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Pasquier2017New; Sokol1995Primary; Percy2008Familial).

Familial erythrocytosis, also known as erythrocytosis type 1, is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is associated with low to normal serum EPO levels. Mutations such as frameshift and nonsense mutations in exon 8 of the EPOR gene are common in this condition, leading to a gain-of-function effect (Bento2013Genetic; AlSheikh2008A).

In PFCP, mutations in the EPOR gene result in increased sensitivity to EPO, causing erythroid progenitors to proliferate excessively. These mutations often involve frameshift or nonsense changes that truncate the receptor, affecting its normal interactions and signaling (de1993Truncated; Sokol1995Primary).

## Interactions
The erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions essential for its signaling functions. Upon binding erythropoietin (EPO), EPOR undergoes a conformational change that activates the associated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), leading to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on EPOR. This phosphorylation creates docking sites for various signaling molecules, including signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5), which bind to phosphorylated tyrosine motifs such as pY344 and pY402. Once phosphorylated, STAT5 translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes (Montoye2005A).

EPOR also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), which associates directly with the distal tyrosine Y480 and indirectly via adaptors like Gab and IRS-2, contributing to cell proliferation pathways (Montoye2005A). Phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) interacts with EPOR through adaptor molecules like Gab-2 and Shc, playing a role in secondary messenger generation (Montoye2005A).

Negative regulation of EPOR signaling involves proteins such as hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP), which associates with phosphorylated EPOR and is hypothesized to dephosphorylate JAK2 or its substrates, modulating the response to EPO (Yi1995Hematopoietic). Additionally, proteins like CIS and SOCS2 bind to several phosphotyrosines in EPOR, with the Y402 motif being a prominent interaction site (Montoye2005A).
