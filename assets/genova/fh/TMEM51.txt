# TMEM51

## Overview
TMEM51 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 51, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions remain to be fully elucidated. TMEM51 has garnered attention in the field of oncology due to its differential expression in certain cancer types, such as breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In breast cancer, TMEM51 expression levels have been associated with specific tumor subtypes, suggesting a potential role in tumor classification and stratification (Terkelsen2021High‐throughput). Additionally, in PDAC, TMEM51 expression has been observed in myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment, indicating a possible influence on tumor biology (Ye2023The). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of TMEM51 remain an active area of research.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM51 has been studied in the context of various cancers, including breast cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In breast cancer, TMEM51 was identified as one of the proteins evaluated for its potential as a biomarker for breast cancer subtype classification. It was found to be significantly up-regulated in luminal subtype samples, suggesting its potential role in tumor subtype stratification. However, its expression did not show significant p-values in association with the Her2 subtype, indicating it may not be a strong discriminator of breast cancer subtypes (Terkelsen2021High‐throughput). 

In PDAC, TMEM51 was characterized in myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the heterogeneity in TMEM gene expression across different cell types. This suggests a potential role in influencing the tumor microenvironment, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with TMEM51 gene mutations or expression alterations in PDAC were not detailed (Ye2023The).

Overall, while TMEM51 has been implicated in cancer, its precise role and clinical significance require further investigation to determine its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.
