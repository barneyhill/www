# CXCL16

## Overview
CXCL16 is a gene that encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16, a multifunctional protein involved in immune responses. The CXCL16 protein is categorized as a transmembrane chemokine, characterized by its ability to exist in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The membrane-bound form functions as an adhesion molecule, facilitating interactions between cells, while the soluble form acts as a chemoattractant, guiding immune cells to sites of inflammation. This dual functionality is mediated through interactions with the CXCR6 receptor, playing a crucial role in immune cell adhesion and migration. CXCL16 is also involved in lipid metabolism, acting as a scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL), and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer (Abel2004The; Izquierdo2014CXCL16; Heydtmann2005CXC).

## Structure
The CXCL16 protein is a transmembrane CXC chemokine characterized by a distinct molecular structure. It consists of an N-terminal chemokine domain, a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Abel2004The; Schulte2007Sequential). The chemokine domain is unique for containing six cysteines, a feature typically seen in a subfamily of CC chemokines (Matloubian2000A). The mucin-like stalk is highly O-glycosylated, which is crucial for the presentation of the chemokine domain (Korbecki2021The; Abel2004The).

CXCL16 exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. The soluble form is generated through proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteinases, primarily ADAM10 and possibly ADAM17, which release the chemokine domain from the transmembrane form (Korbecki2021The; Abel2004The). This cleavage is similar to the processing of the amyloid precursor protein, involving both alpha- and gamma-secretases (Schulte2007Sequential).

Alternative splicing of the CXCL16 gene results in isoforms such as CXCL16v1 and CXCL16v2, which lack the mucin-like stalk, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail, making them secreted proteins (van2010An). These isoforms act as chemoattractants for CXCR6+ cells (van2010An).

## Function
CXCL16 is a chemokine that plays a significant role in immune responses by existing in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. In its membrane-bound form, CXCL16 functions as an adhesion molecule, facilitating the binding of lymphocytes, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) particles, and bacteria to cells. This form is particularly important for cell adhesion and immune cell interactions, as seen in liver tissues where CXCL16 promotes the adhesion of CXCR6-positive lymphocytes to cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, aiding in immune surveillance and response (Heydtmann2005CXC).

The soluble form of CXCL16 acts as a chemoattractant, guiding the migration of activated T cells and other immune cells to sites of inflammation. This chemotactic activity is crucial for recruiting immune cells to areas where they are needed, such as in the lungs, where CXCL16 is highly expressed by bronchial epithelial cells to recruit T cells (Day2009THE).

The conversion of CXCL16 from its membrane-bound to soluble form is mediated by the metalloproteinase ADAM10, which cleaves the transmembrane protein, regulating its availability and function in immune responses (Abel2004The; Gough2004A). This process is essential for maintaining the balance between cell adhesion and migration, contributing to the organism's ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli effectively.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL16 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving the kidneys and cardiovascular system. In kidney diseases, CXCL16 expression is elevated in conditions such as acute kidney injury (AKI), lupus nephritis, membranous nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and renal carcinoma. Increased urinary CXCL16 levels are associated with renal allografts experiencing AKI and lupus nephritis, correlating with disease activity and proteinuria (Izquierdo2014CXCL16). In renal cancer, higher CXCL16 expression is linked to longer survival and inversely related to tumor progression (Gutwein2009Tumoural).

In cardiovascular diseases, CXCL16 is involved in atherosclerosis, with higher expression in atherosclerotic-prone areas. It plays a role in lipid uptake in macrophages, influencing foam cell formation and plaque development (Aslanian2006Targeted). CXCL16 expression is also increased in heart failure models and is associated with inflammatory markers in chronic kidney disease patients with cardiovascular complications (Izquierdo2014CXCL16).

Genetic variations in CXCL16, such as the T123V181 haplotype, have been linked to increased risk of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in trauma patients, affecting immune cell chemotaxis and adhesion (Sun2021A). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in disease pathogenesis through its impact on immune responses and inflammation.

## Interactions
CXCL16 interacts with the CXCR6 receptor, playing a significant role in integrin-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes. This interaction is crucial for the adhesion of liver-infiltrating lymphocytes to cholangiocytes and hepatocytes in inflamed liver tissue. CXCL16 activates the VLA-4 integrin, enhancing its binding to VCAM-1, a process that can be inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating the involvement of CXCR6 in this pathway (Heydtmann2005CXC).

CXCL16 is also involved in the shedding process mediated by ADAM10, a metalloproteinase responsible for its cleavage from the cell surface. This shedding regulates the expression of CXCL16 as a membrane-anchored chemokine, allowing it to function in both membrane-bound and soluble forms (Gough2004A).

In the context of carcinoma cell lines, CXCL16 interacts with CXCR6 to inhibit cell proliferation. The transmembrane form of CXCL16, when bound to CXCR6, reduces proliferation, while the soluble form enhances it. This interaction suggests a role in early tumorigenesis stages, potentially influenced by inflammation mediators (Meijer2008The).

CXCL16 also acts as a scavenger receptor, binding phosphatidylserine and oxidized LDL, facilitating their uptake by podocytes and macrophages (Izquierdo2014CXCL16).
