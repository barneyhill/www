# MB21D2

## Overview
MB21D2 is a gene that encodes the protein Mab-21 domain containing 2, which is a member of the cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune response by modulating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, particularly in myeloid cells. The protein enhances the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a critical sensor for cytoplasmic DNA, thereby facilitating antiviral and antitumor immune responses. MB21D2 achieves this by binding to the N-terminal of cGAS, promoting its liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, which leads to increased production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and subsequent type I interferon (IFN-β) production (Liu2023CDNTase). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing transcriptional regulation and potentially affecting cell differentiation and proliferation (Gracilla2020Overexpression). MB21D2's specific interaction with cGAS underscores its unique role in enhancing the immune response, distinguishing it from other proteins in the IFN-β signaling pathway (Liu2023CDNTase).

## Function
MB21D2, a member of the cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family, plays a crucial role in modulating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway in myeloid cells. It enhances the activation of cGAS, a key sensor for cytoplasmic DNA, which is essential for initiating antiviral and antitumor immune responses. MB21D2 binds to the N-terminal of cGAS, facilitating its liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, leading to increased production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and subsequent type I interferon (IFN-β) production. This process is vital for the host's antiviral and antitumor immunity (Liu2023CDNTase).

MB21D2 specifically enhances the cGAS pathway by promoting the phosphorylation of STING, TBK1, and IRF3 upon DNA stimulation or HSV-1 infection. This interaction is specific to cGAS, as MB21D2 does not interact with other proteins in the IFN-β signaling pathway (Liu2023CDNTase). MB21D2 also plays a role in antitumor immunity by promoting the maturation of tumor-draining lymph node dendritic cells and the activation of CD8+ T cells (Liu2023CDNTase). The protein is active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing transcriptional regulation and possibly affecting cell differentiation and proliferation (Gracilla2020Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MB21D2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinomas (LuADs) and lung squamous cell carcinomas (LuSCCs), a heterozygous mutation, p.Gln311Glu, in MB21D2 was identified, affecting a conserved amino acid within the Mab-21 domain. This mutation appears in approximately 1% of these cancers and is also present in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and bladder urothelial carcinomas (Pros2020Genomewide). MB21D2 is frequently mutated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its expression is notably higher in certain tumor samples, correlating with a higher tumor mutation burden and poor clinical outcomes (Zhang2022Novel).

In lung adenocarcinoma, MB21D2 is involved in significant chromatin structural variations, particularly on chromosome 3, which may contribute to cancer development (Zhang2020Integrative). Despite its association with certain conditions, no significant mutations in MB21D2 were linked to Lundehund syndrome in dogs, suggesting its role may be more specific to certain human cancers (Metzger2016Variant). The gene is also mentioned in the context of uterine fibroids, although specific mutations or expression alterations in MB21D2 related to this condition are not detailed (Kuznetsova2023Novel).

## Interactions
MB21D2 interacts directly with cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a key DNA sensor in the immune response. This interaction enhances cGAS's liquid phase condensation and DNA-binding activity, leading to increased production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) and subsequent type I interferon (IFN-β) production. The interaction between MB21D2 and cGAS is crucial for the host's antiviral and antitumor responses (Liu2023CDNTase). MB21D2 binds to the N-terminal region of cGAS, enhancing its DNA-binding efficiency and enzymatic activation upon stimulation by interferon-stimulating DNA (ISD) or HSV-1 infection (Liu2023CDNTase). This binding is not mediated by DNA, as shown by DNase I treatment, indicating a direct protein-protein interaction (Liu2023CDNTase).

MB21D2 does not interact with other proteins in the IFN-β signaling pathway, such as STING, MAVS, RIG-I, TBK1, or IRF3, highlighting its specific interaction with cGAS (Liu2023CDNTase). The presence of MB21D2 lowers the concentration threshold for cGAS and DNA to form liquid droplets, indicating that MB21D2 enhances the phase separation process, which is crucial for cGAS function (Liu2023CDNTase).
