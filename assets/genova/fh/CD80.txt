# CD80

## Overview
CD80 is a gene that encodes the CD80 protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein, also known as B7-1, is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, where it plays a pivotal role in the immune response. The CD80 protein functions as a costimulatory molecule by interacting with T cell receptors CD28 and CTLA-4, thereby modulating T cell activation and proliferation. Through its binding to CD28, CD80 promotes T cell activation, while its interaction with CTLA-4 serves as an inhibitory signal, contributing to immune regulation and homeostasis (Kakoulidou2007Human; Kennedy2022Differences). Additionally, CD80 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and bone health, highlighting its significance in both immune activation and regulation (Panach2017A; Scarpa2021CD80).

## Structure
The CD80 protein, also known as B7-1, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on antigen-presenting cells. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and consists of an extracellular region with two immunoglobulin-like domains: an N-terminal variable-like (IgV) domain and a membrane-proximal constant-like (IgC) domain (Vasu2003CD80; Fargeas1995Identification). The IgV domain is primarily responsible for direct interactions with T cell receptors CD28 and CTLA-4, while the IgC domain influences binding affinities and co-stimulatory properties (Vasu2003CD80).

The CD80 protein can form homodimers, which are stabilized by the IgC domain, playing a crucial role in its quaternary structure (Girard2014CD80). The IgC domain also prevents higher-order multimerization, thus regulating coreceptor binding and co-signaling properties (Girard2014CD80). Specific residues within the IgV domain, such as hydrophobic residues, are critical for binding to CD28 and CTLA-4 (Fargeas1995Identification).

Post-translational modifications of CD80 include glycosylation, which, although present, does not significantly affect receptor binding (Peach1995Both). The structural integrity and receptor binding capabilities of CD80 are maintained through these domains and modifications, contributing to its role in T cell activation.

## Function
The CD80 molecule, also known as B7-1, is a crucial costimulatory protein primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages. It plays a significant role in T-cell activation by interacting with the costimulatory receptors CD28 and CTLA-4 on T cells. CD80 binds to CD28 to promote T-cell activation and proliferation, which is essential for initiating an immune response (Kakoulidou2007Human). Conversely, its interaction with CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation, contributing to immune regulation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Kennedy2022Differences).

CD80 is also expressed on a subset of activated regulatory T cells (Tregs), where it serves as a marker of recent activation. Its expression is associated with the Treg transcription factor FOXP3, indicating a role in Treg differentiation and function (Trzupek2020Discovery). In addition to its membrane-bound form, CD80 can exist in soluble forms generated by alternative splicing. These soluble forms can bind to CD28 and CTLA-4, influencing T-cell activation and potentially serving as immunoregulatory agents (Kakoulidou2007Human).

The interaction of CD80 with CTLA-4 involves ubiquitylation, which directs CTLA-4 towards lysosomal degradation, thereby modulating its availability and function in immune regulation (Kennedy2022Differences). This regulatory mechanism highlights CD80's role in fine-tuning immune responses and preventing autoimmunity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD80 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of bone health, CD80 is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) phenotypes in postmenopausal women. Variants in the CD80 gene, such as SNP rs867234, show significant associations with lumbar spine BMD and osteoporosis risk, suggesting that genetic variations in CD80 may influence bone density and the risk of osteoporosis (Panach2017A).

In autoimmune diseases, CD80 plays a role in immune regulation through its interactions with CTLA-4 and CD28. Alterations in CD80 expression or function can contribute to conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, primary biliary cholangitis, and multiple sclerosis. CD80's interaction with CTLA-4 is crucial for regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis, and deficiencies in CD80 can lead to more aggressive immune responses, as seen in graft-versus-host disease (Soskic2021CD80).

In cancer, CD80 expression is regulated by the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Activation of TP53 can upregulate CD80 expression, enhancing immune responses against tumors. Low CD80 expression is associated with immune escape in colon carcinoma, while its upregulation correlates with better prognosis in colorectal cancers (Scarpa2021CD80).

## Interactions
CD80, also known as B7-1, is a protein that plays a significant role in immune response regulation through its interactions with T cell surface molecules. It primarily interacts with CD28 and CTLA-4, both of which are receptors on T cells. The interaction between CD80 and CD28 provides a costimulatory signal essential for T cell activation, leading to increased cytokine production and T cell proliferation (Fargeas1995Identification). CD80 binds to CD28 with a dissociation constant (K_d) of approximately 4 µM, indicating a lower affinity compared to its interaction with CTLA-4, which has a K_d of approximately 0.42 µM (van1997CD80).

CD80 also forms a cis-heterodimer with PD-L1, which affects immune signaling pathways by inhibiting the PD-L1:PD-1 interaction and repressing the inhibitory pathways of PD-1 and CTLA-4. This interaction does not significantly alter CD80's ability to bind CD28, thus maintaining its costimulatory function (Zhao2019PDL1:CD80). The presence of PD-L1 can inhibit CD80:CD80 cis-homodimerization, which is reversed by the therapeutic antibody atezolizumab (Zhao2019PDL1:CD80). These interactions highlight CD80's role in modulating immune responses by balancing stimulatory and inhibitory signals.
