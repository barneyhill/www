# SAMD9L

## Overview
SAMD9L is a gene that encodes the protein sterile alpha motif domain containing 9 like, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and genomic stability. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and an OB-fold domain, which is associated with DNA/RNA binding. SAMD9L functions as a tumor suppressor and is implicated in the regulation of immune responses, particularly through its inducibility by type I interferons. It plays a significant role in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis, interacting with various components of the translation machinery. Mutations in the SAMD9L gene are linked to several hematological and neurological disorders, such as ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome and familial myelodysplastic syndromes, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease (Thomas2021Pediatric; CorralJuan2022New; Davidsson2018SAMD9).

## Structure
The SAMD9L protein is characterized by a complex domain architecture that includes a Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain near the N-terminal region, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and RNA binding (Davidsson2018SAMD9; Li2007Human). The SAM domain is known to oligomerize with both SAM-containing and non-SAM-containing proteins (Davidsson2018SAMD9). SAMD9L also contains an OB-fold domain associated with DNA/RNA binding, which plays a role in regulating cell cycle and translation (Thomas2021Pediatric). 

The protein's primary structure is composed of over 1500 amino acids, sharing about 60% identity with its paralogue, SAMD9 (Thomas2021Pediatric). The tertiary structure includes critical domains that influence cellular functions, such as the APAF-1-like domain, which contains the core functional NTPase domain (Thomas2021Pediatric). 

SAMD9L undergoes alternative splicing, which can lead to different isoforms that may affect its function and localization (Li2007Human). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is involved in various cellular processes, including antiviral and antitumor responses (Mekhedov2017The; Davidsson2018SAMD9).

## Function
The SAMD9L gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in hematopoietic cells. It is involved in several molecular processes, including ribosome assembly, protein synthesis, and DNA repair. SAMD9L interacts with ribosomal subunits during polysome formation, indicating its role in the early stages of ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (Thomas2021Pediatric). The protein is also involved in the degradation of cytokine receptors through the homotypic fusion of endosomes, which is essential for maintaining normal cell growth and preventing uncontrolled proliferation (Davidsson2018SAMD9).

SAMD9L functions as a tumor suppressor in various cancers, including breast, hepatocellular, and squamous cell carcinoma, and its tumor-suppressing activity is repressed by the p53 pathway (Davidsson2018SAMD9). The gene is inducible by type I interferons, such as IFNα and β, and is associated with inhibitory effects on cell migration in activated human T cells, suggesting a role in immune response regulation (Lemos2013Evolution). SAMD9L is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in inhibiting cell proliferation, contributing to its role in maintaining genomic stability and antiviral defense mechanisms (Li2007Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SAMD9L gene are associated with a range of hematological and neurological disorders. Germline mutations in SAMD9L are linked to ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (ATXPC), which is characterized by neurological symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia and hematological issues like cytopenia and myeloid malignancies (Davidsson2018SAMD9). These mutations often have a gain-of-function effect, leading to antiproliferative outcomes that can result in conditions like pancytopenia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Davidsson2018SAMD9).

SAMD9L mutations are also implicated in familial MDS, where they can cause transient monosomy 7 and lead to varying clinical outcomes, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and spontaneous hematologic recovery (Pastor2017Constitutional). The gene's mutations can result in clonal expansion of cells with reduced antiproliferative effects, often through somatic changes like chromosome 7 loss (Davidsson2018SAMD9).

Neurologically, SAMD9L mutations have been linked to a new subtype of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA49), characterized by mitochondrial dysregulation and early diffuse cerebral demyelination (CorralJuan2022New). These mutations can also lead to cerebellar atrophy and loss of Purkinje cells, contributing to the neurological phenotype of ATXPC syndrome (Davidsson2018SAMD9).

## Interactions
SAMD9L is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with components of the ribosome assembly and translation machinery, such as EIF3A and DHX9, indicating its role in protein synthesis regulation (Thomas2021Pediatric). SAMD9L also associates with ribosomal components, co-eluting with ribosomal proteins RPS6 and RPL11, which suggests its involvement in ribosome assembly during polysome formation (Thomas2021Pediatric).

The protein interacts with factors involved in DNA repair and RNA splicing, including PRDKC, DDX1, and SF3B1, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating RNA processing (Thomas2021Pediatric). SAMD9L's interactions with these proteins are crucial for its function in DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation.

Mutations in SAMD9L can disrupt these interactions, leading to impaired protein synthesis and increased apoptosis in hematopoietic cells, contributing to conditions like myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and bone marrow failure (Thomas2021Pediatric). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact when mutated.
