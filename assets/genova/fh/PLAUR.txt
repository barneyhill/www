# PLAUR

## Overview
The PLAUR gene encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a critical cell surface receptor involved in various physiological and pathological processes. As a glycoprotein, uPAR is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety, classifying it as a transmembrane receptor. It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of plasminogen activation, which is essential for extracellular matrix degradation, tissue remodeling, and cell migration. uPAR's structure is characterized by three homologous LU domains that form a hydrophobic binding cavity, facilitating high-affinity interactions with ligands such as the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (Jacobsen2011PLAUR; Kjaergaard2008Structure). The receptor is implicated in various cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, and signal transduction, and is associated with several disease states, particularly in cancer, where its expression correlates with tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis (Madunić2018The; Mahmood2018Multifaceted).

## Structure
The PLAUR gene encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. uPAR is composed of three homologous LU domains (DI, DII, and DIII), each approximately 90 amino acids long, adopting a 'three-fingered' folding topology characterized by a large antiparallel beta-sheet (Jacobsen2011PLAUR; Kjaergaard2008Structure). These domains are connected by extensive beta-strand interactions, forming a continuous 13-stranded bent beta-sheet with a croissant-like topology (Kjaergaard2008Structure).

The structure of uPAR includes a hydrophobic binding cavity formed by the interdomain assembly of the three LU domains, which is crucial for high-affinity ligand interactions, such as with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (Jacobsen2011PLAUR; Kjaergaard2008Structure). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at multiple sites, which influences its interaction with ligands (Ploug2003StructureFunction). The GPI-anchor allows uPAR to be tethered to the cell membrane, providing flexibility and enabling interactions with other proteins on the cell surface (Ploug2003StructureFunction; Kjaergaard2008Structure).

## Function
The PLAUR gene encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a key regulatory protein involved in cell surface plasminogen activation. This process is crucial for the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, which facilitates tissue remodeling, cell migration, and wound healing (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). uPAR is expressed in various cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages, and is upregulated upon cytokine stimulation (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). In healthy human cells, uPAR expression is typically low and associated with quiescent endothelial cells in organs such as the lung, kidney, thymus, liver, and heart (Jacobsen2011PLAUR).

uPAR interacts with several ligands, including the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), vitronectin, integrins, and the G-protein coupled receptor FPRL1, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). It is attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, allowing participation in lipid raft microdomains, and can be internalized and recycled back to the membrane (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). The receptor also exists in a soluble form (suPAR), which is associated with various disease conditions (Loughner2016Organization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLAUR gene, which encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), are linked to various diseases and conditions. In cancer, elevated PLAUR expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased invasiveness in several types, including colorectal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, and breast cancers (Jacobsen2011PLAUR; Madunić2018The; Mahmood2018Multifaceted). In colorectal cancer, PLAUR overexpression correlates with advanced disease stages and poor survival outcomes (Li2013The). In pancreatic cancer, high uPAR levels are linked to metastasis and reduced survival, with suppression of uPAR shown to decrease metastatic capacity (Madunić2018The).

In cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), PLAUR is identified as a biomarker of metastasis, with its expression linked to extracellular matrix remodeling and cell motility, contributing to the tumor's invasive characteristics (Minaei2022Cancer). Beyond cancer, polymorphisms in the PLAUR gene are associated with neurological disorders such as epilepsy and autism, as well as conditions like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (Rysenkova2022Identification). These associations highlight the clinical significance of PLAUR in both oncological and neurological contexts.

## Interactions
The PLAUR gene encodes the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for physiological and pathological processes. uPAR forms high-affinity complexes with the serine protease urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), facilitating plasminogen activation and contributing to processes such as cancer invasion and metastasis (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). This interaction occurs in a hydrophobic ligand-binding cavity formed by the cooperation of uPAR's three LU domains (Jacobsen2011PLAUR).

uPAR also interacts with integrins and other co-receptors, mediating signaling pathways that involve focal adhesion kinase (FAK), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and small GTPases of the Rho family, which are important for cell migration and cancer progression (Narayanaswamy2017Transcriptomic). Additionally, uPAR binds to the matrix component vitronectin and the G-protein coupled receptor FPRL1, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction (Jacobsen2011PLAUR).

The receptor is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, allowing it to partition into lipid rafts and be internalized in complex with uPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, before being recycled back to the membrane (Jacobsen2011PLAUR). These interactions highlight uPAR's role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and cancer metastasis.
