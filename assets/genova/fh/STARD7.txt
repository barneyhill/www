# STARD7

## Overview
STARD7 is a gene that encodes the StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 7 protein, which is a lipid transfer protein involved in the transport of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to mitochondria. This protein is characterized by the presence of a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, which facilitates lipid binding and transfer. The STARD7 protein exists in two isoforms: StarD7-I, which contains a mitochondrial-targeting sequence and a transmembrane domain, and StarD7-II, which lacks the mitochondrial-targeting sequence and is localized in the cytosol. StarD7-I is crucial for mitochondrial function, as it integrates into the outer mitochondrial membrane to mediate the nonvesicular transfer of PC from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria, thereby maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Horibata2017Identification). The protein's role extends to influencing mitochondrial dynamics, epithelial cell homeostasis, and myogenic differentiation, with implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Yang2017The; Horibata2020The).

## Structure
The STARD7 protein is characterized by the presence of a StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, which is involved in lipid binding and transfer. It exists in two isoforms: StarD7-I and StarD7-II. StarD7-I contains a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (MTS) at the N-terminus and a transmembrane (TM) domain, which is crucial for its localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM) (Horibata2017Identification). The TM domain is located between amino acids Arg 60 and Gln 96, and the MTS spans from Met 1 to Gly 59 (Horibata2017Identification). 

The mature form of StarD7 is anchored to the OMM through the N-terminal TM domain, while the C-terminal START domain extends into the cytoplasm, facilitating phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (Horibata2017Identification). The precursor form of StarD7 undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce the mature form, involving specific amino acids around the cleavage sites (Horibata2017Identification). 

StarD7-II, lacking the MTS, is localized in the cytosol and does not contribute to mitochondrial function restoration, despite retaining PC transfer activity in vitro (Horibata2017Identification). The TM domain's conservation across species underscores its evolutionary importance (Horibata2017Identification).

## Function
STARD7 is a lipid transfer protein that plays a critical role in the transport of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to mitochondria, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and function. The protein contains a mitochondria-targeting sequence at the N-terminus and a START domain at the C-terminus, facilitating its integration into the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (Horibata2017Identification). STARD7 is involved in the nonvesicular transfer of PC from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, a process vital for mitochondrial membrane integrity and function, as mitochondria lack the enzymes to synthesize PC (FloresMartin2013The; Horibata2017Identification).

In healthy cells, STARD7 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial respiration and morphogenesis. Its deficiency leads to reduced mitochondrial PC content, impaired respiration, and altered cell proliferation (Horibata2017Identification). STARD7 also plays a role in epithelial cell homeostasis, influencing mitochondrial dynamics and epithelial barrier integrity. In STARD7-deficient cells, mitochondrial abnormalities such as reduced cristae and increased oxidative stress are observed, which can be partially mitigated by mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (Yang2017The). The protein is also implicated in myogenic differentiation, as its absence impairs myotube formation and mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal myoblasts (Horibata2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the STARD7 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. STARD7 is differentially expressed in multiple tumor types, with high expression linked to poor prognosis in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), thymoma (THYM), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (Hu2024STARD7). Conversely, high STARD7 expression is associated with better survival outcomes in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), bladder cancer (BLCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) (Hu2024STARD7).

STARD7 mutations, particularly the R232W mutation, are prevalent in several cancers and are associated with poorer outcomes, especially in LIHC (Hu2024STARD7). The gene's expression is also linked to the tumor immune microenvironment, influencing immune infiltration scores and correlating with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in various cancers (Hu2024STARD7).

Beyond cancer, STARD7 plays a role in mitochondrial dynamics and lipid transport. Altered expression can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders (Rojas2021Role). STARD7's involvement in coenzyme Q (CoQ) transport and ferroptotic resistance further underscores its clinical significance, as disruptions in these processes can increase susceptibility to ferroptosis and related degenerative disorders (Deshwal2023Mitochondria).

## Interactions
STARD7 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a crucial role in phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, facilitated by its localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane through its N-terminal transmembrane domain. This interaction is essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane homeostasis and function (Horibata2017Identification).

STARD7 also interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics, such as Dynamin Related Protein 1 (Drp1) and Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), which are crucial for mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. Alterations in STARD7 expression can lead to changes in mitochondrial morphology, indicating its role in regulating these dynamics (Rojas2021Role).

In breast cancer cells, STARD7 deficiency affects signaling pathways, including ERα and EGFR signaling, by altering protein levels and trafficking. This deficiency leads to impaired estrogen-dependent gene induction and affects hormone-dependent cell proliferation (Chariot2024Loss). Additionally, STARD7 interacts with proteins involved in cell motility, such as connexin 43 (Cx43) and integrin β1, through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and migration (Cruz2022StarD7).
