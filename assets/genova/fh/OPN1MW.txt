# OPN1MW

## Overview
The OPN1MW gene encodes the medium-wavelength sensitive opsin, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in human color vision by detecting green light. This opsin is expressed in the cone cells of the retina, specifically in the M cones, and is integral to the phototransduction cascade, where it converts light into electrical signals for visual processing (HaerWigman2022Diagnostic; Neitz2011The). The gene is located on the X-chromosome and is closely related to the OPN1LW gene, which encodes the long-wavelength sensitive opsin. Together, these genes are essential for trichromatic vision, allowing for the differentiation of colors, particularly red and green hues (Neitz2011The; Neitz2021Intermixing). Mutations in OPN1MW can lead to various vision disorders, including color vision deficiencies and more severe conditions like blue cone monochromacy and X-linked cone dystrophy (HaerWigman2022Diagnostic; BuenaAtienza2018A).

## Function
The OPN1MW gene encodes the medium-wavelength sensitive opsin, a photopigment crucial for color vision, particularly in detecting green light. This protein is expressed in the cone cells of the human retina, specifically in the M cones, which are responsible for perceiving medium-wavelength light (HaerWigman2022Diagnostic; Neitz2011The). The opsin protein functions by absorbing light and initiating a phototransduction cascade, converting light signals into electrical signals that are processed by the brain to form visual images (Neitz2011The).

In healthy human cells, the OPN1MW gene contributes to normal trichromatic color vision, which involves the differentiation of short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones. This differentiation is essential for distinguishing between different colors, particularly red and green hues (Neitz2011The; Neitz2021Intermixing). The gene is located on the X-chromosome and is part of a tandem array with the OPN1LW gene, which encodes the long-wavelength opsin. These genes share a high degree of sequence identity and are regulated by a locus control region that ensures proper expression in cone photoreceptors (HaerWigman2022Diagnostic; Neitz2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OPN1MW gene, which encodes the medium-wavelength sensitive opsin, are associated with a variety of vision disorders. These include red-green color vision deficiencies such as deuteranopia and deuteranomaly, which affect green color perception (HaerWigman2022Diagnostic). More severe conditions linked to OPN1MW mutations include blue cone monochromacy (BCM) and X-linked cone dystrophy (XLCOD). BCM is characterized by the loss of L- and M-cone function, leading to symptoms such as photophobia, nystagmus, and severely reduced visual acuity (Deng2019Rescue; BuenaAtienza2018A). XLCOD involves progressive visual loss due to cone cell degeneration, with some rod cell involvement, and is associated with mutations like the c.529T > C; p.W177R variant (Gardner2011A).

Mutations can also lead to aberrant splicing patterns, such as exon 3 skipping, which is linked to disorders like Bornholm Eye Disease and X-linked cone dysfunction (Neitz2021Intermixing; Gardner2014Three). The 'LIAVA' haplotype is one example that causes exon 3 skipping, contributing to severe cone disorders (BuenaAtienza2016De). These genetic alterations highlight the complexity and variability of phenotypes associated with OPN1MW mutations.

## Interactions
The OPN1MW gene encodes the medium wave-sensitive opsin, which is involved in forming photopigments crucial for color vision. This opsin interacts with G proteins, specifically the Gi protein, as part of the phototransduction cascade. The interaction is mediated by the C-terminal α5 helix of Gαi, which inserts into the open cytoplasmic end of the opsin receptor. Key interactions include hydrogen bonds and π-cation interactions that stabilize the active state of the receptor (Peng2024CryoEM). 

The OPN1MW protein forms a complex with all-trans retinal and Gi proteins, where all-trans retinal acts as an agonist, inducing conformational changes that facilitate G protein accommodation. Specific mutations in the retinal binding pocket can affect these interactions, leading to shifts in the absorption spectrum and potential color vision deficiencies (Peng2024CryoEM). 

Additionally, OPN1MW is involved in dimerization and oligomerization processes. While red cone opsins show a higher propensity for dimerization, green cone opsins, including OPN1MW, are predominantly monomeric (Jastrzebska2016A). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the opsin in light sensing and signal transduction.
