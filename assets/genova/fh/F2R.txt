# F2R

## Overview
The F2R gene encodes the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in thrombin signaling. This receptor is primarily involved in mediating cellular responses to thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. PAR1 is activated through a unique mechanism involving proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, which reveals a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to initiate signal transduction (Coughlin2000Thrombin). The receptor's activation leads to various physiological processes, including platelet aggregation, inflammation, and tissue repair, making it essential for maintaining vascular integrity and hemostasis (Patel2014A). Additionally, PAR1's interactions with other receptors, such as CXCR4, highlight its complex regulatory roles in cellular signaling networks (Gao2020Regulation). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, particularly in conditions like acute myeloid leukemia and stomach adenocarcinoma, where its dysregulation is associated with disease progression and prognosis (Maiga2016Transcriptome; Wu2024Bioinformatics).

## Structure
F2R, also known as the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in thrombin signaling. The primary structure of F2R consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the receptor protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of F2R is characterized by the typical GPCR seven-transmembrane domain architecture, which is crucial for its role in signal transduction.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are common in F2R, influencing its activity and interactions. These modifications can affect the receptor's function and localization, playing a significant role in its regulatory mechanisms. F2R may also have splice variant isoforms, which can lead to differences in its function and cellular localization. These isoforms can result in variations in the receptor's response to thrombin and other ligands, potentially impacting physiological and pathological processes. The structural features and modifications of F2R are essential for its role in mediating thrombin signaling and its involvement in various cellular responses.

## Function
The F2R gene encodes the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily activated by thrombin. In healthy human cells, PAR-1 plays a crucial role in hemostasis by mediating platelet aggregation, which is essential for blood clotting and wound healing (Patel2014A). This receptor is involved in cellular signaling pathways that regulate inflammation, endothelial function, and tissue repair, contributing to vascular development and maintaining vascular integrity (Patel2014A).

PAR-1 is activated through proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, which exposes a new N-terminus that acts as a tethered ligand, binding intramolecularly to the receptor to initiate signaling. This activation leads to various downstream effects, including changes in cell shape, secretion, and gene expression, which are critical for the physiological processes mentioned above (Patel2014A).

The receptor is predominantly active on the cell surface, where it interacts with other components of the coagulation cascade and cellular signaling networks. Its activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive clot formation, which could lead to thrombosis, while ensuring adequate response to vascular injury (Patel2014A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the F2R gene, also known as the coagulation factor II thrombin receptor or PAR1, have been implicated in various diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), F2R expression is notably downregulated compared to normal cells. This downregulation contrasts with its upregulation in most solid tumors, where it is associated with promoting growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The reduced expression of F2R in AML aligns with findings that Par1 homozygous null mutant mice develop leukemia more quickly, suggesting a potential role in leukemia progression (Maiga2016Transcriptome).

In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), F2R is significantly upregulated, correlating with poorer survival outcomes and advanced clinical stages. High F2R expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, positioning it as a potential oncogene in gastric cancer. It is also linked to immune regulation, influencing immune cell infiltration and response to immunotherapy (Wu2024Bioinformatics).

Genetic variations in F2R have been associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Specific polymorphisms, such as the minor alleles of F2R rs253061 and rs153311, are linked to a lower risk of VTE, indicating a protective effect against thrombosis (Bafunno2010Genetic).

## Interactions
F2R, also known as protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), is a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with various proteins to mediate intracellular signaling. One significant interaction is with thrombin, which activates PAR1 by cleaving its N-terminal extracellular domain, unmasking a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the receptor to initiate signaling (Coughlin2000Thrombin). This interaction is crucial for thrombin-induced signaling pathways, including those involving G protein families such as G12/13, Gq, and Gi, which affect cellular responses like cytoskeletal changes, calcium mobilization, and platelet activation (Coughlin2000Thrombin).

PAR1 also forms heteromeric complexes with other receptors, such as the chemokine receptor CXCR4. This interaction modulates thrombin-induced signaling, enhancing G protein signaling and affecting endothelial barrier function (Gao2020Regulation). The presence of CXCR4 reduces the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to PAR1, altering the signaling dynamics (Gao2020Regulation). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving PAR1 and its role in various physiological processes, including coagulation and inflammation. The heteromerization with CXCR4 and its impact on signaling pathways suggest potential therapeutic targets for modulating PAR1 activity in disease contexts (Gao2020Regulation).
