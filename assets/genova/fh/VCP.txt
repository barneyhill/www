# VCP

## Overview
The VCP gene encodes the valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97, which is a type II AAA ATPase. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, membrane fusion, DNA repair, and stress response. VCP functions as a molecular chaperone within the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the extraction and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, and plays a critical role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and autophagy. Structurally, VCP forms a hexameric double-ring complex, with each monomer comprising distinct domains responsible for substrate selection and ATP hydrolysis. The protein's activity is modulated by interactions with numerous cofactors and adaptor proteins, which enable its involvement in diverse cellular pathways. Mutations in the VCP gene are linked to multisystem proteinopathy, including conditions such as inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia, underscoring its clinical significance (Chu2023Valosin; Pfeffer2022Multisystem; Ju2009Valosincontaining).

## Structure
The valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97, is a type II ATPase that forms a hexameric double-ring structure, crucial for its function in various cellular processes. Each monomer of VCP consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD), two ATPase domains (D1 and D2), and a C-terminal domain (C-domain) (Chu2023Valosin; Pontifex2024ValosinContaining). The NTD is involved in substrate selection and cofactor interactions, often binding ubiquitin-tagged proteins (Pontifex2024ValosinContaining). The D1 and D2 domains are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, with the D2 domain providing the primary ATPase activity necessary for protein unfolding and segregation (Chu2023Valosin).

The hexameric structure of VCP is characterized by a barrel-shaped arrangement with six-fold radial symmetry, allowing it to interact with a variety of cofactors and binding partners (Chu2023Valosin). The N-terminal domain can adopt two conformations: an inactive closed coplanar conformation and an active open flexible conformation (Pontifex2024ValosinContaining). VCP is subject to several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and SUMOylation, which regulate its ATPase activity and interactions with cofactors (Chu2023Valosin; Pontifex2024ValosinContaining). These structural features and modifications are integral to VCP's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a drug target for neurodegenerative diseases (Chu2023Valosin).

## Function
Valosin-containing protein (VCP), also known as p97, is a type-II AAA ATPase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. VCP is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), where it acts as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the extraction and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This function is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating processes such as cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Wójcik2004RNA; Meyer2014The).

VCP is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting processes like membrane fusion, DNA repair, and stress response. It is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it helps extract ubiquitinated substrates from the ER for cytoplasmic degradation (Wang2004Molecular). VCP also plays a role in autophagy, particularly in the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of damaged proteins and organelles (Ju2009Valosincontaining).

VCP's functional diversity is largely determined by its interaction with various cofactors and adaptor proteins, which modulate its activities across different cellular pathways (Yamanaka2012Recent). These interactions enable VCP to participate in numerous cellular functions, including the regulation of transcription factors and the prevention of protein aggregation (Wang2004Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VCP gene are associated with a range of multisystem disorders, collectively referred to as multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). These include inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), which are characterized by muscle weakness, bone deformities, and cognitive decline, respectively (Nalbandian2011The; Ju2009Valosincontaining). Approximately 90% of individuals with VCP mutations experience myopathy, while Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia occur in about 50% and 30% of cases, respectively (Pfeffer2022Multisystem).

VCP mutations are also linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with about 10% of patients with VCP mutations developing this condition (Pfeffer2022Multisystem). Other associated conditions include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and parkinsonism (Schiava2022Genotype–phenotype). These mutations disrupt cellular processes such as protein degradation, autophagy, and mitochondrial function, leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates and cellular dysfunction (Chu2023Valosin; Ju2009Valosincontaining).

Alterations in VCP expression or interactions can exacerbate neurodegenerative diseases by impairing protein homeostasis and cellular stress responses, highlighting VCP as a potential drug target for these conditions (Chu2023Valosin).

## Interactions
Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its diverse cellular functions. VCP interacts with the Werner helicase (WRNp) in the nucleolus of mammalian cells, a relationship that is disrupted by the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin, indicating a role in DNA damage response (Partridge2003DNA). VCP also forms complexes with BRCA1, suggesting its involvement in DNA repair processes (Partridge2003DNA).

VCP specifically interacts with the SVIP protein, with the N-terminal region of SVIP responsible for this interaction. The binding site on VCP for SVIP is the ND1 domain (Nagahama2003SVIP). In poliovirus replication, VCP interacts with viral proteins 2BC and 3AB, with its ATPase activity being essential for the replication process (Arita2012ValosinContaining).

VCP is a key player in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, interacting with the Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer to facilitate ER-associated degradation (Wójcik2004RNA). It also interacts with ataxin-3 (Atx-3) through an arginine/lysine-rich motif, modulating Atx-3 fibrillogenesis, which is relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (Boeddrich2006An). These interactions highlight VCP's multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and stress responses.
