# ECM1

## Overview
The ECM1 gene encodes extracellular matrix protein 1, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional integrity of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, which are essential for tissue formation and organization (Oyama2022Lichen). ECM1 is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several distinct domains and is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms (Smits1997The). As a multifunctional binding core protein, ECM1 interacts with numerous extracellular and structural proteins, contributing to the organization and function of the basement membrane and surrounding interstitials (Oyama2013The). It is also implicated in angiogenesis, bone and cartilage development, and immune response regulation (Oyama2013The). Clinically, mutations in the ECM1 gene are associated with lipoid proteinosis and have been linked to conditions such as lichen sclerosus and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Kowalewski2005Threedimensional; Zhu2021Identification; Chan2004Rapid).

## Structure
The ECM1 protein is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 60.7 kDa and consists of 540 amino acids (Smits1997The). It is characterized by a complex structure comprising several distinct domains: a signal peptide, a cysteine-free N-terminal domain, two tandemly duplicated domains, and a C-terminal domain (Smits1997The). The protein's structure is influenced by alternative splicing, particularly involving exon 7, which is alternatively spliced in human primary keratinocytes (Smits1997The). This splicing results in different isoforms, including a smaller isoform of 415 amino acids (Smits1997The).

The ECM1 protein contains three potential N-glycosylation sites and several phosphorylation sites, including those for protein kinase C and casein kinase II (Smits1997The). The protein's cysteine residues follow a specific arrangement typical for the serum albumin family, suggesting structural constraints necessary for its biological function (Smits1997The). The cysteine pattern is conserved between human and mouse proteins, with a nearly identical number of cysteines and a conserved CC(X7-10)C arrangement (Smits1997The). The ECM1 protein's structure and post-translational modifications are crucial for its role in the extracellular matrix and its interactions with other proteins.

## Function
The ECM1 gene encodes the extracellular matrix protein 1, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural and homeostatic integrity of the skin. ECM1 is involved in various molecular processes, including the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, which are essential for tissue formation and organization (Oyama2022Lichen). It acts as a multifunctional binding core or scaffolding protein, interacting with a variety of extracellular and structural proteins, such as laminin 332, fibulin-1, type IV collagen, fibronectin, and chondroitin sulfate A, thereby contributing to the structural organization and function of the basement membrane and surrounding interstitials in the skin (Oyama2013The).

ECM1 also plays a role in angiogenesis, bone and cartilage development, and immune response regulation, including the acquisition of immune tolerance and allergic responses via specific T cell subsets (Oyama2013The). It is expressed in various skin components, including the epidermal basal layer, dermal blood vessels, and hair follicles, and is secreted by keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Sercu2009Importance; Oyama2013The). The protein's interactions with matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) help regulate enzymatic activity, which is important for maintaining skin integrity and function (Oyama2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ECM1 gene are primarily associated with lipoid proteinosis (LP), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. LP is characterized by skin and mucous membrane abnormalities, including thickening and scarring of the skin, beaded eyelid papules, and a hoarse voice. These symptoms result from the deposition of hyaline-like material in the skin and other organs (Kowalewski2005Threedimensional; Chan2004Rapid). Mutations in ECM1, particularly in exons 6 and 7, lead to varying clinical manifestations, with exon 6 mutations often resulting in more severe symptoms due to reduced expression of all three ECM1 isoforms (Swain2017A; Chan2004Rapid).

The ECM1 gene is also implicated in lichen sclerosus, an acquired condition where autoantibodies target ECM1, suggesting an immune response involvement (Kowalewski2005Threedimensional). Alterations in ECM1 expression have been linked to several cancers, including breast and thyroid cancer, affecting tumor progression and metastasis (Zhu2021Identification). The interaction between ECM1 and perlecan is crucial for maintaining structural integrity, and disruptions in this interaction may contribute to the pathology of LP (Swain2017A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ECM1 in various diseases and conditions.

## Interactions
Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. ECM1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER3, enhancing their stability and signaling, which is crucial in cell proliferation and trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells (Lee2014Extracellular). This interaction is facilitated through ECM1's association with galectin-3 and mucin 1 (MUC1), forming a complex that stabilizes EGFR and HER3 proteins (Lee2014Extracellular).

ECM1 also interacts with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), particularly binding to the EGF-like domain of COMP. This interaction is significant in endochondral bone growth, where ECM1 and COMP regulate chondrocyte proliferation and matrix mineralization (Kong2010Interaction). The C-terminal region of ECM1 is necessary for binding to COMP, and this interaction is crucial for modulating bone development processes (Kong2010Interaction).

These interactions highlight ECM1's role in modulating signaling pathways and structural integrity within the extracellular matrix, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, bone growth, and cancer resistance mechanisms.
