# NOP2

## Overview
NOP2 is a gene that encodes the NOP2 nucleolar protein, a member of the RNA methyltransferase family, which plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular proliferation. The protein is characterized by a conserved S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase domain, essential for its function in RNA methylation, particularly in the methylation of rRNA. This activity is crucial for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes, thereby supporting efficient protein synthesis and cell growth (Sharma2013Yeast; Kong2020Nucleolar). NOP2 is predominantly active in the nucleolus and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and neural development. It also plays a significant role in HIV-1 transcription and latency by interacting with viral and host cellular components (Kong2020Nucleolar). Clinically, alterations in NOP2 expression have been linked to several cancers, where it is often associated with poor prognosis and may influence tumor progression and response to therapy (Sun2020Long; Liu2022Molecular).

## Structure
The NOP2 nucleolar protein is characterized by a conserved S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase domain, which is crucial for its function in RNA methylation. This domain is part of the RNA methyltransferase catalytic domain (MTD), spanning amino acids 201 to 620, and is responsible for binding RNA, including the HIV-1 TAR RNA (Kong2020Nucleolar). The MTD domain is further divided into smaller domains, with MTD-5 containing two complete RNA methyltransferase catalytic motifs, essential for competitive binding with the HIV-1 Tat protein (Kong2020Nucleolar).

The primary structure of NOP2 includes conserved cysteine residues, such as Cys424 and Cys478, which are critical for its function. Mutations in these residues affect the protein's ability to methylate 25S rRNA, highlighting their importance in the protein's activity (Sharma2013Yeast). The secondary structure of NOP2 likely includes a Rossmann-like fold, typical of methyltransferases, which supports its role in RNA methylation (Sharma2013Yeast).

Post-translational modifications of NOP2 may include methylation and phosphorylation, which are common in proteins involved in nucleolar functions and ribosome biogenesis (de1994Yeast). These modifications could play a role in regulating NOP2's activity and interactions within the cell.

## Function
The NOP2 gene encodes a nucleolar protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in the methylation of rRNA, which is essential for the proper assembly and function of ribosomes. This protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the synthesis and maturation of ribosomal subunits, a process crucial for efficient protein synthesis and cell proliferation (de1994Yeast; Wang2019The).

In healthy human cells, NOP2 is involved in cell cycle regulation and is a marker of cell proliferation. Its expression is linked to the proliferation of neural stem cells and is also observed in mature neurons, suggesting a unique role in the central nervous system (Kosi2015Nop2). The protein's presence in mature neurons, despite its absence in other postmitotic cells, indicates a specialized function in neural tissue, potentially related to neurogenesis and brain regeneration (Kosi2015Nop2).

NOP2's activity is not limited to neural cells; it is also essential for early embryonic development, where it supports nucleolar maturation and ribosome biogenesis, processes vital for cell growth and division (Wang2019The). The protein's role in these fundamental cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NOP2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), NOP2 is overexpressed and associated with poor overall survival. It promotes metastasis by activating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, and its expression is regulated by the long noncoding RNA LINC00963, which sponges the tumor suppressor miR-542-3p (Sun2020Long). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high NOP2 expression correlates with worse overall survival and is linked to clinicopathologic factors such as age, stage, and grade. It is considered an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in ccRCC (Wang2021Nucleolar).

NOP2 is also upregulated in several other cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, leukemia, and breast-invasive carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis. Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint molecules, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment and potential implications for immunotherapy (Liu2022Molecular). The gene's expression is also associated with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), indicating its potential role in cancer progression and response to immunotherapy (Liu2022Molecular).

## Interactions
NOP2, also known as NSUN1, is a nucleolar protein that plays a significant role in HIV-1 transcription and latency by interacting with both proteins and nucleic acids. NOP2 competes with the HIV-1 Tat protein for binding to the TAR RNA element, a critical component in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription. This competition affects the methylation of TAR, which is crucial for HIV-1 transcriptional activation (Kong2020Nucleolar). The RNA methyltransferase catalytic domain (MTD) of NOP2, particularly the MTD-5 region, is responsible for binding to TAR RNA and competing with Tat, thereby suppressing HIV-1 transcription and promoting viral latency (Kong2020Nucleolar).

NOP2 also interacts with the 5' LTR region of HIV-1, leading to m5C methylation, which is essential for maintaining HIV-1 latency (Kong2020Nucleolar). This interaction prevents Tat from recruiting the host positive transcription elongation complex P-TEFb, necessary for activating RNA polymerase II and promoting HIV-1 transcription (Kong2020Nucleolar). These interactions highlight NOP2's role as a host restriction factor that suppresses HIV-1 replication and promotes viral latency (Kong2020Nucleolar).
