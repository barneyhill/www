# MAPT

## Overview
The MAPT gene, located on chromosome 17, encodes the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is predominantly expressed in neurons. Tau is a critical component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, primarily involved in the stabilization and assembly of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining neuronal structure and facilitating axonal transport (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau). As an intrinsically disordered protein, tau lacks a stable native structure, allowing it to interact with a variety of proteins and non-protein molecules, thereby playing a multifaceted role in cellular processes (Avila2016Intracellular). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with six main isoforms present in the adult human brain, differing in their microtubule-binding domains (Ghetti2015Invited). Tau's function and interactions are modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its binding affinity to microtubules and its propensity to form aggregates, a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau; Maccioni1995Role).

## Structure
The MAPT gene encodes the tau protein, which is primarily expressed in neurons and plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules. Tau protein is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), lacking a stable native structure, which allows it to interact with various proteins and non-protein molecules (Avila2016Intracellular). The primary structure of tau includes multiple isoforms generated through alternative splicing, resulting in six main isoforms in the adult human brain. These isoforms differ in the number of microtubule-binding repeats and the presence of 29 or 58 amino acid inserts in the amino-terminus, leading to 1N, 2N, or 0N forms of each 3R and 4R tau (Ghetti2015Invited).

Tau's secondary structure includes regions of β-sheets and α-helices, although it remains largely unstructured in solution. The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by its flexible, unfolded state, which facilitates its interaction with microtubules (Bodakuntla2019MicrotubuleAssociated). Tau can form aggregates, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases (Ghetti2015Invited). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, significantly affect tau's function and its propensity to aggregate, with phosphorylation by kinases like GSK3 being particularly important (Maccioni1995Role; Avila2016Intracellular).

## Function
The MAPT gene encodes the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein primarily expressed in neurons. Tau plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for maintaining neuronal structure and facilitating axonal transport. This transport is vital for distributing proteins, signaling molecules, and organelles throughout the neuron, ensuring proper synaptic connections and neuronal function (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau).

Tau is most abundant in axons but is also found in other cellular compartments. It is intrinsically disordered, with a flexible polypeptide chain and three major domains: an acidic N-terminal part, a proline-rich region, and a basic C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain binds to microtubules, promoting their assembly, while the N-terminal part interacts with other cellular structures (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau). Tau's interaction with microtubules is regulated by phosphorylation, which can alter its binding affinity (RuizGabarre2022What’s).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics, tau acts as a scaffold protein modulating the activity of kinases such as Src and Fyn, and it interacts with other cytoskeletal elements like spectrin and actin (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the cytoskeleton's integrity and supporting processes like axonal transport and synaptic signaling (RuizGabarre2022What’s).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAPT gene are linked to a range of neurodegenerative diseases, collectively known as tauopathies. These include frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) (Zhang2015The; Strang2019MAPT). Over 50 pathogenic mutations have been identified, affecting the microtubule-binding domains of tau, leading to impaired stabilization of microtubules and disrupted axonal transport (Zhang2015The). These mutations can also alter the ratio of tau isoforms, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Strang2019MAPT).

MAPT mutations are associated with abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, resulting in neurofibrillary tangles and contributing to neurodegeneration (Zhang2015The). Specific mutations, such as V363I and N410H, are linked to clinical symptoms like progressive speech difficulties and parkinsonism (Zhang2015The). The H1 haplotype of MAPT is overrepresented in PSP and CBD, suggesting a genetic susceptibility linked to this haplotype (Rademakers2004The).

The clinical manifestations of MAPT mutations can vary even within the same family, indicating a complex genotype-phenotype relationship (Zhang2015The). Some mutations, like A152T, may act as risk modifiers in certain tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (Strang2019MAPT).

## Interactions
The MAPT gene encodes the Tau protein, which is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. Tau interacts with microtubules, stabilizing them through its microtubule binding domains, which are crucial for its aggregation and function (Stancu2019Tau). It also binds to motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, influencing axonal transport by potentially interfering with their binding to microtubules (Stancu2019Tau). Tau's interaction with actin affects actin polymerization and stability, which is important for synaptic function (Stancu2019Tau).

In the nucleus, Tau interacts with DNA and RNA, playing a role in preserving DNA integrity and protecting RNA. It also interacts with TIA1, a protein linked to RNA metabolism, and Nup98, part of the nuclear pore complex, which can impair nuclear import/export and accelerate Tau aggregation (Stancu2019Tau; Vanderweyde2016Interaction). Tau's phosphorylation, influenced by kinases such as GSK-3β and CDK5, affects its interaction with microtubules and its aggregation (MietelskaPorowska2014Tau; Stancu2019Tau).

Tau also interacts with synaptic proteins, affecting synaptic function. It binds to presynaptic proteins involved in vesicle recycling, such as dynamin, amphiphysin, and clathrin, and its interaction with synaptogyrin-3 is crucial for synaptic dysfunction (Stancu2019Tau).
