# ZNF589

## Overview
ZNF589 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 589, a member of the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) family, which are known for their role as transcriptional repressors. The protein is characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain and multiple C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its DNA-binding capabilities and interaction with other proteins. ZNF589 is primarily expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, where it plays a critical role in regulating gene expression related to hematopoiesis and maintaining cell viability. The protein's function is modulated through various post-translational modifications and interactions with corepressors such as TRIM28, which aid in chromatin modification and gene silencing. ZNF589 has been implicated in several clinical contexts, including its potential role as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and its involvement in intellectual disability due to genetic variants (Fan2021Bioinformatic; Venturini2016The; Agha2014Exome).

## Structure
ZNF589 is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which are small peptide domains stabilized by a zinc ion bound to cysteine and histidine residues (Fan2021Bioinformatic). These motifs facilitate DNA binding and are part of the largest family of transcriptional regulators in eukaryotes. ZNF589 also contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylase complexes, histone methylases, and heterochromatin proteins (Fan2021Bioinformatic; Venturini2016The).

The primary structure of ZNF589 includes a conserved KRAB domain at the N-terminus and four C2H2-type zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus (Venturini2016The). The KRAB domain interacts with the corepressor KAP1, facilitating nuclear localization through a 'piggy-back' mechanism (Wang2013Novel). The tertiary structure of the KRAB domain is crucial for its function, with a stable two-helix structure being essential for maintaining a hydrophobic environment necessary for its activity (Wang2013Novel).

ZNF589 has two isoforms, differing in the C-terminus at the level of the fourth zinc finger domain. The SZF1-2 isoform is expressed ubiquitously, while SZF1-1 is specific to CD34+ hematopoietic precursor cells (Venturini2016The). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can affect its function and stability.

## Function
The ZNF589 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs), which function as transcription repressors. In healthy human cells, ZNF589 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression involved in hematopoiesis. It is specifically expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and contains a KRAB domain along with four C2H2-type zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its DNA-binding capability (Venturini2016The).

ZNF589 is essential for maintaining cell viability and preventing apoptosis in the hematopoietic system. Knock-down experiments in hematopoietic cell lines, such as MV4-11 and K562, have shown that silencing ZNF589 leads to increased apoptosis, characterized by reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 and increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes like BAD, BIK, and BMF (Venturini2016The). The gene is also involved in the hypoxia response pathway, as its expression is modulated by hypoxic conditions in a cytokine-dependent manner, suggesting regulation by the HIF1α transcription factor (Venturini2016The). This regulation under hypoxic conditions indicates a role in cellular responses to low oxygen levels, crucial for maintaining cell viability in the hematopoietic system (Venturini2016The).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF589 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and mutations. In breast cancer, ZNF589 is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, particularly in aggressive subtypes such as HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer. This downregulation is associated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients, suggesting that ZNF589 could serve as an independent prognostic biomarker. The reduced expression of ZNF589 in breast cancer is linked to promoter hypermethylation, which may contribute to its silencing in tumors (Fan2021Bioinformatic).

In the context of intellectual disability, a novel variant in the ZNF589 gene, c.956T.A (p.(Leu319His)), has been identified in a Pakistani family with non-syndromic intellectual disability. This variant is located in the zinc finger C2H2 domain and is predicted to disrupt the protein's function, supporting its potential role in the condition (Agha2014Exome).

Additionally, ZNF589 is involved in the regulation of cell viability in the hematopoietic system. Knockdown studies in hematopoietic cell lines have shown that reduced ZNF589 expression leads to increased apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cell survival (Venturini2016The).

## Interactions
ZNF589, a member of the zinc finger protein family, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that contribute to its function as a transcriptional repressor. It interacts with TRIM28, a nuclear corepressor, to recruit chromatin modifiers, leading to H3K9 trimethylation and heterochromatization, which represses gene expression (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). This interaction is facilitated by the KRAB domain of ZNF589, which is known to mediate transcriptional repression through the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes and histone methylases (Venturini2016The).

In breast cancer, ZNF589 is suggested to act as a tumor suppressor, with its expression negatively correlated with cell cycle progression and malignancy. It may regulate the cell cycle through interactions with TRIM28, potentially arresting the cell cycle by transcriptionally repressing downstream genes (Fan2021Bioinformatic). Protein-protein interaction analysis identified additional partners of ZNF589, including CLVS1, ZNF618, N4BP2L1, and TMEM92, which are involved in cell cycle regulation (Fan2021Bioinformatic).

ZNF589 also binds frequently near transcription start sites and the 3' end of gene bodies, suggesting its role in gene regulation through direct DNA interactions. A specific DNA-binding motif for ZNF589, AATGGAAT, has been identified, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).
