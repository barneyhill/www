# GMDS

## Overview
The GMDS gene encodes the enzyme GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, which is a crucial component of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, a sugar nucleotide that plays a significant role in the fucosylation of proteins and lipids. Fucosylation is a critical post-translational modification that affects various biological processes, including cell signaling, immune response, and protein stability. The GMDS enzyme catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-mannose, a key step in the production of GDP-fucose. The gene's expression and function are essential for maintaining normal cellular activities, and its dysregulation has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and glaucoma (Gharahkhani2014Common; Nakayama2013Mutation; Allen2016Facile).

## Structure
The GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) enzyme is a homodimeric protein involved in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose. Each monomer of GMDS consists of two domains: a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain binds the NADP(H) cofactor and features a classical Rossmann fold, characterized by a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet interwoven with seven α-helices, forming a deep groove at the domain interface where catalysis occurs (Somoza2000Structural). The C-terminal domain is important for binding the sugar-nucleotide substrate and is predominantly composed of a four-strand sheet cupping three parallel helices (Somoza2000Structural).

The enzyme's active site includes a catalytic triad with residues such as Tyr157, Thr133, and Glu135, which are crucial for its catalytic mechanism (Somoza2000Structural). GMDS is regulated by feedback inhibition through GDP-fucose, which acts as a competitive inhibitor by binding to the same site as GDP-mannose (Somoza2000Structural).

The quaternary structure of GMDS involves dimerization, a common feature among short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) enzymes, forming a four-helix bundle at the dimer interface (Somoza2000Structural). This structural arrangement is conserved among GMDs from different organisms, indicating a common evolutionary origin (Somoza2000Structural).

## Function
GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMDS) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, a sugar nucleotide essential for the fucosylation of proteins and lipids. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-mannose, which is subsequently converted to GDP-fucose. This process is crucial for the proper glycosylation of proteins, impacting cell signaling and immune responses (Körner1999Decreased; Allen2016Facile).

In healthy human cells, GMDS activity occurs in the cytosol, where it influences various cellular functions. The enzyme's activity is necessary for the fucosylation of glycoconjugates, which affects the function and stability of cell surface molecules and secreted proteins. This modification is important for processes such as cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and immune recognition (ImaiNishiya2007Double; Allen2016Facile).

The enzyme's function is not redundant with other enzymes in the fucosylation pathway, as demonstrated by studies showing that its inhibition or knockdown can significantly alter fucosylation levels, affecting the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies (ImaiNishiya2007Double). GMDS is thus a key regulator of fucose metabolism and protein glycosylation in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GMDS gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer, mutations in GMDS lead to a complete loss of fucosylation, which allows cancer cells to evade immune surveillance, promoting tumor progression and metastasis. These mutations are more frequently observed in metastatic lesions compared to original cancer tissues, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Nakayama2013Mutation).

In lung adenocarcinoma, GMDS expression is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. Knockdown of GMDS in lung adenocarcinoma cells impairs cell proliferation, induces cell cycle arrest, and increases apoptosis, indicating its role in tumor growth and survival (Wei2018GMDS).

Hypermethylation of the GMDS gene has been associated with chronic arsenic exposure and arsenic-induced cancer. This epigenetic modification may lead to transcriptional changes affecting GMDS enzyme levels, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to apoptosis (Chanda2013Human).

Additionally, genetic variants in GMDS have been linked to an increased risk of primary open-angle glaucoma, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of this condition (Gharahkhani2014Common).
