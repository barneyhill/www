# ZNF391

## Overview
ZNF391 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 391, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating the transcription of various target genes. Zinc finger protein 391 is involved in critical cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development, primarily through its influence on the transcriptional landscape within the nucleus. The gene has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as with rheumatoid arthritis and certain cancers, indicating its broad significance in human health and disease (Lamas2021Prognostic; Orozco2011HLADPB1COL11A2; Ren2019Spatial).

## Function
ZNF391 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor in human cells. It is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences. This binding capability allows ZNF391 to regulate gene expression by modulating the transcription of target genes. The protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, by influencing the transcriptional landscape within the cell. ZNF391 is typically active in the nucleus, where it exerts its effects on gene expression. Through its regulatory functions, ZNF391 contributes to the proper functioning and maintenance of cellular activities, ensuring that cells develop and differentiate appropriately. Its activity is essential for maintaining the balance of gene expression necessary for healthy cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF391 has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Research suggests that variations in the expression of ZNF391 across different brain regions may influence predisposition to these disorders. The gene's expression patterns have been linked to differences in working memory performance and gray matter volume in the right inferior frontal orbital gyrus, indicating a potential role in the cognitive aspects of these conditions (Ren2019Spatial).

In rheumatoid arthritis, ZNF391 has been identified as a locus with significant genetic associations. Multiple SNPs within this gene show a reduced minor allele frequency in RA cases compared to controls, suggesting a protective effect. This association is independent of the well-known HLA-DRB1 alleles, highlighting ZNF391's potential role in the genetic architecture of RA (Orozco2011HLADPB1COL11A2).

ZNF391 is also part of a gene signature used to predict overall survival and recurrence-free survival in uveal melanoma patients, although the specific clinical significance of its mutations in this context is not detailed (Lamas2021Prognostic). Additionally, ZNF391 has been identified as a potential early marker in epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes in lung adenocarcinoma (Song2019Epithelialmesenchymal).
