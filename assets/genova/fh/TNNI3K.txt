# TNNI3K

## Overview
TNNI3K is a gene that encodes the TNNI3 interacting kinase, a cardiac-specific protein kinase primarily expressed in the heart. This kinase is a member of the mixed lineage kinase family and is characterized by its dual-specific kinase activity, targeting both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. The TNNI3K protein plays a crucial role in cardiac muscle function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin I, which is essential for regulating cardiac muscle contraction. It is involved in various cardiac processes, including modulating mitochondrial functions and influencing cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the TNNI3K gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, such as conduction system disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health and disease (Lal2014Troponin; Theis2014TNNI3K; Pham2021The).

## Structure
The TNNI3K protein, encoded by the TNNI3K gene, is primarily expressed in the heart and has a molecular mass of approximately 93 kDa. It consists of 835 amino acids and is structured into four distinct domains: a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminal, a central kinase domain, an ankyrin repeat domain, and a serine-rich domain at the C-terminal (Lal2014Troponin; Pham2021The). The central kinase domain exhibits dual-specific kinase activity, targeting both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, and is classified within the mixed lineage kinase family (Lal2014Troponin). The ankyrin repeat domain is essential for (auto-)phosphorylation and likely plays a role in protein interactions (Pham2021The). The C-terminal serine-rich domain negatively regulates the kinase activity (Pham2021The).

TNNI3K interacts with cardiac troponin I and peroxiredoxin 3, with the latter downregulating its kinase activity through interactions at the ankyrin motif and the protein kinase domain (Lal2014Troponin). The protein's structure allows for potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity. Conjoined transcripts of TNNI3K with the neighboring gene FPGT have been identified, potentially resulting in a fusion protein, although this has not been observed in large datasets (Pham2021The).

## Function
TNNI3K (TNNI3 interacting kinase) is a cardiac-specific kinase that plays a significant role in cardiac muscle function. It is primarily active in the heart, particularly in the interventricular septum and apex, and is localized to perinuclear or nuclear regions of cardiac myocytes (Lal2014Troponin). TNNI3K is involved in the phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a critical component of the troponin complex that regulates cardiac muscle contraction. This phosphorylation occurs at specific sites, Ser43 and Thr143, which are crucial for myofilament function and cardiomyocyte contractility (Wang2013TNNI3K).

The kinase activity of TNNI3K influences mitochondrial functions, including reactive oxygen species production, membrane potential, and calcium flux, which are essential for maintaining cardiac cell health and function (Lal2014Troponin). TNNI3K's role extends to modulating cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic cardiomyopathy, where its expression levels can impact cardiac outcomes, such as infarct size and ventricular performance (Pham2021The). The kinase is part of the mixed lineage kinase family and contains domains such as N-terminal ankyrin repeats, a protein kinase domain, and a C-terminal serine-rich domain, which contribute to its functional capabilities (Wang2013TNNI3K).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNNI3K gene are associated with several cardiac conditions, including conduction system disease (CSD), atrial tachyarrhythmia, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). A specific mutation, TNNI3K-G526D, has been linked to a familial syndrome involving these conditions. This mutation leads to protein aggregation and reduced bioavailability in cardiomyocytes, suggesting a dominant-negative effect (Theis2014TNNI3K). Histopathological analysis of individuals with this mutation shows mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and patchy interstitial fibrosis, along with unique intranuclear and intrasarcoplasmic inclusions (Theis2014TNNI3K).

Other variants, such as TNNI3K-p.Gly526Asp, TNNI3K-p.Thr539Ala, and TNNI3K-p.Glu768Lys, have been associated with conduction disease, supraventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. These variants affect the kinase activity of TNNI3K, either reducing or enhancing auto-phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function (Pham2021The). Additionally, a novel variant, c.1538T > C, resulting in a leucine to proline substitution at position 513 (L513P), has been identified in a case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), characterized by decreased mRNA and protein expression levels (Xie2022WholeExome).

Alterations in TNNI3K expression levels are also linked to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Overexpression of TNNI3K has been observed in heart failure, with both beneficial and deleterious effects depending on the context (Pham2021The).

## Interactions
The TNNI3K gene encodes a cardiac-specific kinase that interacts with several proteins, primarily in the heart. One of its key interactions is with cardiac troponin I (cTnI), where TNNI3K binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of cTnI and phosphorylates it at specific sites, such as Ser22/Ser23 and Ser43/Thr143. This phosphorylation is significant for cardiac contractility and myofilament function (Wang2013TNNI3Ka; Wang2013TNNI3K). 

TNNI3K also interacts with antioxidant protein 1 (AOP-1), which binds to the ankyrin domain and downregulates TNNI3K's kinase activity (Pham2021The). Another confirmed interactor is peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), which binds to both the ankyrin motif and the protein kinase domain of TNNI3K, leading to downregulation of its kinase activity (Lal2014Troponin).

Potential interactions have been suggested with proteins such as myosin-binding protein C (MyBPC) and alpha-actin, although these have not been confirmed as phosphorylation targets (Gu2023Expression; Wheeler2009Tnni3k). TNNI3K's interactions are crucial for its role in cardiac function and disease, influencing processes like cardiac hypertrophy and contractility.
