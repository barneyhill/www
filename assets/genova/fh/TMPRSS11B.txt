# TMPRSS11B

## Overview
TMPRSS11B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane serine protease 11B, a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family. This protein is characterized by its serine protease domain and is primarily involved in proteolytic processes on the cell surface, particularly within epithelial tissues. TMPRSS11B plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier function and mucosal defense, especially in the respiratory tract (Escalante2021Structural; Sales2011Expression). The protein's structure includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural). TMPRSS11B is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue remodeling and immune response, and has been associated with cancer metabolism, particularly in lung cancer, where it interacts with proteins such as Basigin to promote glycolytic metabolism (ZHU2021microR12945p; Updegraff2018Transmembrane).

## Structure
TMPRSS11B is a member of the transmembrane serine protease family, characterized by a serine protease domain. The primary structure of TMPRSS11B includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain. The secondary structure is composed of alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common features in the TMPRSS family (Escalante2021Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional protease, with a conserved catalytic triad consisting of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its stability and function. TMPRSS11B, like other members of its family, may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details about these isoforms are not provided in the context. The structural modeling of TMPRSS11B has revealed potential ligand-binding pockets, which are important for its function as a protease (Escalante2021Structural). These structural features are essential for understanding the role of TMPRSS11B in physiological and pathological processes.

## Function
TMPRSS11B is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, which is involved in various proteolytic processes on the cell surface. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as tissue remodeling, immune response, and maintaining epithelial barrier function. TMPRSS11B is primarily active in the respiratory tract, where it contributes to mucosal defense and homeostasis (Escalante2021Structural; Sales2011Expression).

The HAT/DESC subfamily, to which TMPRSS11B belongs, is known for its involvement in mediating cell surface proteolytic events, particularly in epithelial tissues. These proteases are implicated in processes such as fibrinogenolysis and the activation of protease-activated receptors, which are crucial for maintaining epithelial integrity and function (Sales2011Expression). Although the specific physiological functions of TMPRSS11B in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, it is part of a gene cluster that suggests functional redundancy among its family members, indicating that it may share similar roles with other proteases in the subfamily (Menou2017Human).

The structural modeling of TMPRSS11B and related proteases highlights the presence of a conserved catalytic triad, essential for their enzymatic activity, which underscores their role in proteolytic cascades and homeostasis (Escalante2021Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMPRSS11B gene have been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TMPRSS11B is overexpressed in NSCLC tumors compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with enhanced glycolytic metabolism and increased lactate export, which are critical for cancer cell proliferation and survival (ZHU2021microR12945p). The gene is targeted by miR-1294-5p, a microRNA that is downregulated in NSCLC. When miR-1294-5p is overexpressed, it binds to the 3'-untranslated region of TMPRSS11B, leading to decreased expression of TMPRSS11B at both mRNA and protein levels. This interaction results in the inhibition of glycolysis and cell proliferation in NSCLC cells, suggesting that miR-1294-5p acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating TMPRSS11B expression (ZHU2021microR12945p). The negative correlation between miR-1294-5p and TMPRSS11B expression highlights the potential of targeting this pathway as a therapeutic strategy in NSCLC. Understanding the role of TMPRSS11B in cancer metabolism provides insights into its clinical significance and potential as a target for cancer treatment.

## Interactions
TMPRSS11B is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in lung cancer growth and metabolism. One of its primary interactions is with Basigin (CD147), a transmembrane protein. TMPRSS11B enhances the solubilization of Basigin, which is crucial for its role in promoting lactate export and glycolytic metabolism in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells (Updegraff2018Transmembrane). This interaction is facilitated by the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS11B, which promotes the trafficking of Basigin to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing the efficiency of lactate transport through the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 (Updegraff2018Transmembrane).

TMPRSS11B also interacts with MCT4, forming a complex that is essential for lactate export and the regulation of glycolytic flux in cancer cells (Updegraff2018Transmembrane). These interactions are critical for the metabolic adaptations observed in cancer cells, contributing to tumor growth and progression (Updegraff2018Transmembrane).

Additionally, TMPRSS11B is identified as a target of miR-1294-5p, a microRNA that downregulates TMPRSS11B expression, thereby inhibiting glycolytic metabolism in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (ZHU2021microR12945p). This interaction highlights the regulatory role of miRNAs in modulating TMPRSS11B activity and its associated metabolic pathways.
