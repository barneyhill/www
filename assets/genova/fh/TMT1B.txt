# TMT1B

## Overview
TMT1B is a gene that encodes the protein thiol methyltransferase 1B, a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of thiol groups, a critical process for cellular detoxification and redox regulation. Thiol methyltransferase 1B is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, particularly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, indicating a potential role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. The enzyme's activity is dependent on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and has been observed to methylate various substrates in vitro, although its specific in vivo targets remain unidentified. TMT1B has been implicated in protein and possibly RNA methylation, with its expression linked to m6A modifications in certain transcripts. The gene's expression is notably altered in various cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and drug resistance, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenic processes (Denford2023Defining).

## Function
The TMT1B gene encodes a thiol methyltransferase enzyme involved in methylation processes crucial for cellular function. This enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in the methylation of thiol groups, a process essential for detoxifying xenobiotics and regulating cellular redox status. TMT1B's activity is dependent on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and it has been shown to methylate substrates such as dithiothreitol, 7a-thiospironolactone, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in vitro, although its in vivo substrates remain unidentified (Denford2023Defining).

TMT1B is localized to the perinuclear face of the endoplasmic reticulum and the surface of lipid droplets, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Denford2023Defining). It has been linked to protein methylation, with studies indicating it can methylate proteins like RTN3, RTN4, LRP1, and APP, particularly in lipid-rich environments (Denford2023Defining). The enzyme may also be involved in RNA methylation, as its expression correlates with m6A modifications in certain transcripts, although this function is not definitively proven (Denford2023Defining). Despite these findings, the specific function of TMT1B in healthy human cells remains elusive, necessitating further research to elucidate its precise biological role.

## Clinical Significance
TMT1B, also known as METTL7B, has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is upregulated in several cancer types, including lung cancer, gliomas, and leukemia, and its expression is associated with advanced tumor stages, poor patient survival, risk of recurrence, and drug resistance (Denford2023Defining). In cancer cells, TMT1B influences cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion. Loss of TMT1B expression leads to decreased cell proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, along with reduced motility and invasion capabilities in cancer cells (Denford2023Defining).

TMT1B's role in drug resistance is particularly notable in the context of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Its expression is higher in TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells, correlating with increased m6A modification in certain ROS scavenging genes. Downregulation of TMT1B reduces drug resistance, suggesting a link between TMT1B expression, mRNA methylation, and TKI sensitivity (Denford2023Defining).

Despite these associations, the exact substrates and mechanistic roles of TMT1B in cancer remain undefined, posing challenges in predicting its methyltransferase substrates due to sequence variation and the complexity of protein structures (Denford2023Defining). Further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical implications.

## Interactions
TMT1B, also known as METTL7B, is a methyltransferase that participates in various protein interactions. Proteomic studies have identified several interaction partners for TMT1B, including RTN3, RTN4, LRP1, and APP. These proteins exhibit increased methylation when incubated with purified TMT1B and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), indicating that they can serve as substrates for TMT1B's methyltransferase activity (Denford2023Defining). TMT1B's activity and localization are influenced by lipid concentrations, as it relocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to lipid droplets in high lipid environments, suggesting that the lipid microenvironment may modulate its interactions and activity (Denford2023Defining).

TMT1B is also linked to the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum, with potential interactions involving lipid droplets and the transmembrane mitochondrial protein TMEM126A. These interactions suggest a role in lipid metabolism and transport between organelles, which could be significant in understanding TMT1B's oncogenic role (Denford2023Defining). Despite these findings, detailed studies on TMT1B's interactions in normal versus cancerous cells are still lacking, and the exact substrates and protein interactions remain poorly defined (Denford2023Defining).
