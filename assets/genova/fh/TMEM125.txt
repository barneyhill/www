# TMEM125

## Overview
TMEM125 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 125, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not fully elucidated. TMEM125 has garnered attention due to its altered expression in several pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders. In particular, its expression levels have been linked to prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma and its potential role in the pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Fan2022Transmembrane; Liu2019Key). Additionally, environmental factors such as prenatal exposure to DEHP can influence the methylation and expression of the TMEM125 gene, suggesting a role in developmental processes (Prados2015Prenatal). The gene's involvement in these diverse conditions highlights its potential significance in both health and disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM125 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TMEM125 is part of a transmembrane protein-based risk model that predicts patient prognosis. High expression levels of TMEM125, along with TMEM273 and TMEM164, are associated with poor prognosis due to their role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immunosuppression, which are linked to decreased overall survival and disease-free survival in LUAD patients (Fan2022Transmembrane).

TMEM125 is also mentioned in the context of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), where it is upregulated, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathophysiology, although specific mechanisms remain unclear (Liu2019Key). Additionally, TMEM125 has been identified as a gene with significant expression differences in multiple cancer types, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (Sehovic2019Detection).

Prenatal exposure to DEHP has been shown to affect the methylation of the TMEM125 gene, which may influence its expression and contribute to developmental changes, although the specific health implications of these alterations are not fully understood (Prados2015Prenatal).
