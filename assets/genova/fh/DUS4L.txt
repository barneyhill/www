# DUS4L

## Overview
The DUS4L gene encodes the dihydrouridine synthase 4-like protein, which is a crucial enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules. This protein functions as a synthase, specifically catalyzing the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine, a modification essential for the proper folding and stability of tRNA. The activity of DUS4L is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of tRNA, thereby influencing protein synthesis. Beyond its fundamental role in tRNA modification, DUS4L is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA processing, cell cycle regulation, and pathways related to the spliceosome and ribosome. Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cell proliferation and survival, with studies indicating that DUS4L promotes cell growth and division while its knockdown leads to increased apoptosis and altered cell cycle phases (Li2020&lt; DUS4L; p&gt).

## Function
The DUS4L gene encodes the dihydrouridine synthase 4-like protein, which is involved in the modification of tRNA molecules by catalyzing the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine. This modification is crucial for the proper folding and stability of tRNA, which in turn influences protein synthesis. The DUS4L protein is active in the cytoplasm, where tRNA processing occurs, playing a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of tRNA (Li2020&lt; DUS4L; p&gt).

In healthy human cells, DUS4L is implicated in various cellular processes, including RNA processing and cell cycle regulation. It has been shown to promote cell proliferation and colony formation, indicating its involvement in cell growth and division. The knockdown of DUS4L in studies has led to increased apoptosis and changes in cell cycle phases, suggesting its role in regulating these processes (Li2020&lt; DUS4L; p&gt). Additionally, DUS4L is associated with pathways related to the spliceosome, ribosome, RNA catabolic process, ncRNA processing, and p53 signaling, highlighting its involvement in critical cellular functions necessary for cell proliferation and survival (Li2020&lt; DUS4L; p&gt).
