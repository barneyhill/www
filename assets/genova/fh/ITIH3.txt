# ITIH3

## Overview
The ITIH3 gene encodes the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 3, a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the stabilization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by forming covalent links with hyaluronic acid, a key ECM component. The ITIH3 protein is categorized as an extracellular matrix stabilizer and is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to tissue integrity and modulates inflammatory responses. It is predominantly expressed in the liver, with notable expression in ovarian and pancreatic tissues. The protein's involvement in ECM stabilization and inflammation underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological processes, including tumor invasion, metastasis, and inflammatory diseases (Chong2010ITIH3; Hamm2008Frequent; Ebana2007A).

## Structure


## Function
The ITIH3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix (ECM) by covalently linking to hyaluronic acid (HA), a major ECM component. This linkage is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and is involved in processes such as cell attachment and migration (Chong2010ITIH3; Hamm2008Frequent). The ITIH3 protein is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to ECM stability and modulates inflammation by forming complexes with locally synthesized HA and interacting with inflammatory cells (Ebana2007A).

In healthy human cells, ITIH3 is primarily expressed in the liver, with significant expression also observed in ovarian and pancreatic tissues (Hamm2008Frequent). The protein's role in ECM stabilization is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity, which may also influence processes like tumor invasion and metastasis (Hamm2008Frequent). ITIH3's involvement in inflammation is highlighted by its interaction with proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role in inflammatory diseases (Ebana2007A). The protein's activity in the ECM and its interactions with other cellular components underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The ITIH3 gene is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or genetic variations. In ovarian cancer, downregulation of ITIH3 is associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This resistance is linked to the Bcl-2 mediated anti-apoptosis signaling pathway, where ITIH3 acts as an upstream regulator. Lower ITIH3 expression correlates with increased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, contributing to chemotherapy resistance and poorer prognosis in ovarian cancer patients (Liu2022Downregulation).

ITIH3 is also associated with autoimmune diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, particularly the secondary form in rheumatoid arthritis, ITIH3 is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is linked to the presence of specific autoantibodies against citrullinated ITIH3 peptides, which are diagnostically useful in these conditions (Liao2016Comparative).

In myasthenia gravis, ITIH3 is elevated at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease activity. This elevation is specific to anti-AChR-Ab-positive myasthenia gravis, indicating its role in disease pathogenesis (Schroeter2024Interalphatrypsin).

Additionally, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ITIH3 is associated with increased susceptibility to myocardial infarction, highlighting its role in inflammation and atherosclerosis (Ebana2007A).

## Interactions
The ITIH3 gene encodes a polypeptide chain that is part of the Pre-α-Inhibitor, a plasma protease inhibitor involved in stabilizing extracellular matrices by binding to hyaluronan and inhibiting hyaluronidase. This interaction is crucial in pathological conditions such as tumor invasion and metastasis (Ruminy2003An). ITIH3 is part of the Inter-α-Inhibitor (IaI) family, which includes protease inhibitors that interact with other plasma proteins like TSG-6 to enhance plasmin inhibitory capacity and neutralize extracellular granzyme K activity during inflammation (Ruminy2003An).

The transcriptional regulation of the ITIH3 gene involves a complex interplay of transcription factors, including Sp1, GKLF, and CREB-2. These factors form various protein-DNA complexes that regulate ITIH3 transcription. For instance, a tripartite complex involving GKLF and CREB-2 proteins forms when all three complexes [GKLF/GKLF-1], [CREB-2/CREB#Q2], and [GKLF/GKLF-2] are present, indicating cooperative interactions between these proteins (Ruminy2003An). The binding of these transcription factors to specific sites on the ITIH3 promoter, such as bs#6 for GKLF and bs#8 for CREB-2, is crucial for the regulation of ITIH3 transcription (Ruminy2003An).
