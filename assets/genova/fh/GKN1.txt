# GKN1

## Overview
Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is a gene that encodes the gastrokine 1 protein, which is predominantly expressed in the gastric mucosa. This protein is characterized by its BRICHOS domain, which is associated with protein folding and stability, and plays a crucial role in maintaining gastric epithelial integrity (Pavone2013Structural). As a secreted protein, gastrokine 1 is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to mucosal homeostasis and repair processes (Kim2015Gastrokine). It functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, and it modulates key signaling pathways such as NF-κB and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (Yoon2018Gastrokine; Yoon2020Uptake). The clinical significance of GKN1 is underscored by its frequent downregulation in gastric cancer tissues, which is associated with poor prognosis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target (Mao2012Downregulation; Yoon2014The).

## Structure
Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is a protein characterized by its structural features, including a primary structure that consists of 185 amino acids. The protein contains a 20 amino acid extracellular signal peptide at the N-terminal region and a conserved BRICHOS domain of about 100 amino acids, which is crucial for its stability and function (Pavone2013Structural). The BRICHOS domain is associated with protein folding and stability, although its specific role in GKN1 is not fully elucidated (Pavone2013Structural).

The secondary structure of GKN1 is predominantly beta-structured, with 33.3% beta-sheet and 14.5% alpha-helix content, as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Pavone2013Structural). The protein's tertiary structure is globular, with aromatic residues exposed on the surface, supporting its predicted 3D structure (Pavone2013Structural). GKN1 exhibits high thermal stability, with denaturation occurring above 80°C, and its unfolding process is complex, indicating multiple temperature-sensing regions (Pavone2013Structural).

A disulfide bond between Cys61 and one of the other cysteines (Cys122, Cys145, or Cys159) enhances the protein's stability (Pavone2013Structural). The protein is moderately resistant to proteases, with specific cleavage sites identified through limited proteolysis experiments (Pavone2013Structural). GKN1 does not have reported splice variant isoforms or common post-translational modifications in the provided context.

## Function
Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is a protein primarily expressed in the gastric mucosa, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the gastric epithelium. It is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to mucosal homeostasis and repair processes after injury (Kim2015Gastrokine; Pavone2013Structural). GKN1 is secreted by gastric mucus-secreting cells and is internalized in the gastric epithelium through exosome-driven transfer, which is essential for inhibiting gastric tumorigenesis (Yoon2018Gastrokine).

The protein acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (Yoon2018Gastrokine). It also plays a role in modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for inflammatory responses and cell survival, by inactivating NF-κB through the activation of IκB (Yoon2013Gastrokine). GKN1's presence in the cytoplasm and extracellular space allows it to interact with various cellular components, contributing to its protective functions in the gastric mucosa (Mao2012Downregulation).

GKN1 also inhibits gastrin-induced cell proliferation by modulating cell-cycle progression and downregulating gastrin-specific receptors and growth factor receptors, such as CCKBR, EGFR, and c-Met (Kim2015Gastrokine). This regulatory activity is vital for maintaining gastric epithelial homeostasis and preventing gastric carcinogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GKN1 gene are significantly associated with gastric cancer. GKN1 is highly expressed in normal gastric mucosa but is frequently downregulated or absent in gastric cancer tissues, including adenomas and adenocarcinomas (Mao2012Downregulation; Yoon2014The). This downregulation is not linked to tumor differentiation or clinical stage, suggesting it may be an early event in gastric tumorigenesis (Yoon2014The). The loss of GKN1 expression is associated with shorter survival in intestinal-type gastric cancer (Yoon2014The).

GKN1 plays a role in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer cell invasion and metastasis, by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and suppressing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Yoon2014The). It also enhances the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU, indicating potential therapeutic implications (Mao2012Downregulation).

H. pylori infection, particularly the CagA protein, can downregulate GKN1 expression, potentially leading to gastric cancer (Yoon2014The). GKN1 can counteract CagA-induced genetic alterations by inhibiting ROS production and binding to CagA (Yoon2014The). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GKN1 in gastric cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in gastric epithelial cells. GKN1 interacts with HRas, inhibiting its binding to b-Raf and c-Raf, which leads to the downregulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in reducing the viability and proliferation of gastric cancer cells (Yoon2020Uptake). The BRICHOS domain of GKN1 is particularly effective in binding to HRas, highlighting its importance in this inhibitory process (Yoon2020Uptake).

In addition to its interaction with HRas, GKN1 has been shown to bind to 27 exosomal proteins, including COMT and YWHAZ, as verified by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Yoon2018Gastrokine). These interactions suggest a role for GKN1 in modulating exosomal pathways and influencing cellular processes such as cell viability and proliferation (Yoon2018Gastrokine).

GKN1 also affects the expression of ENO1, a significant hub in the protein-protein interaction network. Downregulation of ENO1 by GKN1 is associated with growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells (Yan2011Proteomics). These interactions underscore GKN1's role as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.
