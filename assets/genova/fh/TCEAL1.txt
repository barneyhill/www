# TCEAL1

## Overview
TCEAL1 (transcription elongation factor A like 1) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The protein, also referred to as TCEAL1, is a member of the TCEA/TFIIS-like protein family and plays a critical role in stabilizing RNAPII during the early stages of transcription. It forms a trimeric complex with USP11 and USP7, which is essential for maintaining RNAPII in a functionally active state, thereby preventing excessive transcript cleavage and disassembly. TCEAL1 is recruited to core promoters when transcription elongation is blocked, suggesting a potential role in modulating transcriptional responses under stress conditions. The gene's function is significant in both normal cellular processes and disease contexts, including early-onset neurological disorders and cancer, where it influences transcriptional regulation and chemotherapy resistance (Rushworth2020In; Dehmer2024A).

## Function
TCEAL1 (transcription elongation factor A like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). In healthy human cells, TCEAL1 plays a crucial role in stabilizing RNAPII during the early stages of transcription. It forms a trimeric complex with USP11 and USP7, which helps maintain RNAPII in a functionally active state by protecting its essential subunit, RPB8, from degradation. This stabilization is important for preventing excessive transcript cleavage and RNAPII disassembly, thereby ensuring normal transcription processes (Dehmer2024A).

TCEAL1 is part of the TCEA/TFIIS-like protein family and shares sequence homology with the RNAPII interaction domain of the TCEA/TFIIS elongation factor. It is recruited to core promoters when transcription elongation is blocked, enhancing the chromatin association of RNAPII. This suggests that TCEAL1 may act in a dominant-negative manner to buffer TFIIS function, competing with TFIIS for binding to core promoters (Dehmer2024A).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it globally binds to active promoters via its TFIIS-homology domain, which is necessary for its chromatin association and interaction with RNAPII (Dehmer2024A). Loss-of-function mutations in TCEAL1 are associated with early-onset neurological disease traits, indicating its importance in normal development and neurological function (Dehmer2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TCEAL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in TCEAL1 can lead to an early-onset neurological disease characterized by hypotonia, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic facial features (Dehmer2024A). In the context of cancer, TCEAL1 plays a significant role in tumor biology. It is involved in stabilizing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during early transcription, which is crucial for sustaining oncogenic gene expression, particularly in mesenchymal and invasive tumor cell types (Dehmer2024A). 

In prostate cancer, silencing TCEAL1 enhances the efficacy of docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug, suggesting that TCEAL1 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. This effect is linked to changes in cell cycle regulation and increased sensitivity to microtubule depolymerizing drugs (Rushworth2020In). TCEAL1's role in transcription regulation and its interaction with RNAPII and TFIIS suggest that it may modulate transcription both positively and negatively, depending on the context, which can impact cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Rushworth2020In). These findings highlight TCEAL1 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
TCEAL1 is known to form a trimeric complex with USP11 and USP7, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during early transcription. This complex is essential for sustaining oncogenic gene expression by maintaining RNAPII in a state poised for elongation, particularly for genes involved in a TGF beta-dependent mesenchymal gene expression program (Dehmer2024A). TCEAL1 interacts with RNAPII through a short helix that shares sequence homology with a region in the TFIIS elongation factor, competing with TFIIS for binding to RNAPII and chromatin. This competition is significant as it prevents excessive TFIIS-mediated transcript cleavage and RNAPII disassembly, thereby stabilizing RNAPII on chromatin (Dehmer2024A).

In prostate cancer, TCEAL1 has been identified as a key gene that, when silenced, enhances the efficacy of docetaxel treatment. This interaction suggests that TCEAL1 may modulate transcription in a context-dependent manner, influencing cell cycle and DNA replication pathways (Rushworth2020In). The silencing of TCEAL1 in prostate cancer cells leads to increased sensitivity to docetaxel, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Rushworth2020In).
