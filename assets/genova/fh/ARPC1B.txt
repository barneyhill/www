# ARPC1B

## Overview
The ARPC1B gene encodes the actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1B, a critical component of the ARP2/3 complex involved in actin filament nucleation and branching. This protein is categorized as a β-propeller protein, characterized by its seven-bladed structure, which facilitates interactions with actin filaments and other proteins within the complex (Kahr2017Loss; Brigida2018Tcell). ARPC1B is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it plays a vital role in regulating immune cell function and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and immune responses (Kahr2017Loss; Brigida2018Tcell). Mutations in the ARPC1B gene are linked to a syndrome characterized by immunodeficiency, allergy, and autoimmunity, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining immune homeostasis and cellular integrity (Kopitar2019Flow; Papadatou2021Case).

## Structure
The ARPC1B protein is a component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin filament nucleation and branching. It contains six WD40 repeat domains that form a beta-propeller structure, essential for its function within the complex (Kahr2017Loss). These WD40 domains are critical for the protein's interaction with actin filaments, and mutations affecting these domains can lead to functional deficiencies (Kahr2017Loss). The ARPC1B protein is described as a β-propeller protein with seven blades, suggesting a specific tertiary structure that allows it to potentially contact actin subunits in either the mother or daughter filament (Brigida2018Tcell).

ARPC1B is one of two isoforms of the ARPC1 subunit in humans, with ARPC1A being the other. These isoforms share 68% sequence identity and are located in tandem on human chromosome 7 (Kahr2017Loss). The expression of ARPC1B is restricted to hematopoietic cells, where it plays a regulatory role in immune cell function and cytoskeletal dynamics (Brigida2018Tcell). The protein's structure and function are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell migration and cytokinesis (Kahr2017Loss).

## Function
The ARPC1B gene encodes a protein that is a component of the ARP2/3 complex, which is crucial for actin filament nucleation and branching in cells. This complex plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including cell motility, shape maintenance, and intracellular trafficking by facilitating the formation of branched actin networks (Kahr2017Loss). In healthy human cells, ARPC1B is prominently expressed in blood cells and is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for processes such as cell migration, endocytosis, vesicular trafficking, and cytokinesis (Kahr2017Loss).

ARPC1B interacts with nucleation-promoting factors like WASP to promote actin filament branching, which is vital for the proper functioning of platelets and immune cells (Kahr2017Loss). In T cells, ARPC1B is involved in the assembly and structure of the immunological synapse, contributing to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for effective immune responses (Brigida2018Tcell). In B cells, ARPC1B regulates the cortical actin cytoskeleton, influencing B cell activation thresholds by controlling the lateral diffusion of the B cell receptor and other membrane-associated proteins (Leung2021ARPC1B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARPC1B gene are associated with a novel syndrome characterized by combined immunodeficiency, allergy, and autoimmunity. This condition is marked by a range of clinical manifestations, including recurrent infections, eczema, asthma, and autoimmunity, such as vasculitis and inflammatory bowel disease (Kopitar2019Flow; Papadatou2021Case). Patients with ARPC1B mutations often experience increased bleeding tendencies due to thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, resembling symptoms of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (Kopitar2019Flow; Somech2017Disruption).

The ARPC1B gene is crucial for actin polymerization, and its deficiency leads to impaired cytoskeletal dynamics, affecting immune cell function. This results in defective T-cell migration and proliferation, contributing to immune dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infections (Papadatou2021Case; Brigida2018Tcell). Mutations in ARPC1B can also lead to platelet abnormalities, such as microthrombocytopenia, and are linked to inflammatory diseases (Kahr2017Loss).

The clinical presentation of ARPC1B deficiency varies, with some patients exhibiting severe systemic inflammation and lymphoproliferation, while others may have milder symptoms. This variability may be due to different mutations or additional genetic and environmental factors influencing the disease's expression (Papadatou2021Case; Somech2017Disruption).

## Interactions
ARPC1B is a subunit of the ARP2/3 complex, which is essential for actin filament branching and polymerization. It interacts with several proteins within this complex, including ARP2, ARP3, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, and ARPC5, facilitating the nucleation of actin filaments (Kahr2017Loss). ARPC1B has a specific interaction with the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP), which is crucial for actin polymerization. WASP binds preferentially to ARPC1B over ARPC1A, enhancing the activation of the ARP2/3 complex and promoting actin nucleation (Leung2021ARPC1B). This interaction is significant for the formation of branched actin networks, which are vital for various cellular processes, including the formation of podosome-like structures in megakaryocytes and the regulation of B cell cortical actin cytoskeleton (Leung2021ARPC1B).

In macrophages, ARPC1B interacts with integrin-associated proteins such as Vinculin and Talin, as well as the ARP2/3-associated protein HS-1, which are important for podosome formation and function (Leung2021ARPC1B). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting processes like cell motility and immune cell signaling.
