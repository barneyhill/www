# NECAB2

## Overview
NECAB2 is a gene that encodes the N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 2, a protein primarily involved in calcium signaling within the nervous system. This protein is characterized by its EF-hand domain, which facilitates calcium binding, and plays a crucial role in presynaptic calcium dynamics, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. NECAB2 is predominantly expressed in CB1/CCK-positive GABAergic interneurons and is associated with presynaptic regions, suggesting its involvement in regulating vesicular exocytosis. The protein interacts with various receptors, including the adenosine A2A receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5, modulating their function and impacting neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity. NECAB2's activity is significant in cognitive functions and neural development, and alterations in the NECAB2 gene have been linked to neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Canela2007The; Miczán2020NECAB1; Chen2022AutismRisk).

## Structure
The NECAB2 protein is characterized by three main domains: an N-terminal EF-hand domain, a NECAB homology region (NHR) in the middle, and an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) motif at the C-terminus (Chen2022AutismRisk). The EF-hand domain is responsible for calcium binding and is a helix-loop-helix structural motif, which is typical for proteins involved in calcium signaling (Canela2007The). The NHR domain contains a coiled-coil secondary structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Canela2007The). The ABM motif, located at the C-terminus, is a domain of unknown function but is conserved across the NECAB family (Chen2022AutismRisk).

NECAB2 can exist in two isoforms, NECAB2 and NECAB2S, which differ by 37 amino acids at the N-terminal due to alternative translation initiation codons (Canela2007The). These isoforms are generated from the NECAB2 cDNA and have been shown to interact with other proteins, such as the adenosine A2A receptor, in a calcium-dependent manner (Canela2007The). The protein's interaction with other molecules is modulated by calcium ions, which can inhibit binding in a dose-dependent fashion (Canela2007The).

## Function
NECAB2 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 2) is a calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways within the nervous system. It is primarily involved in presynaptic calcium dynamics, influencing neurotransmitter release and synaptic function. NECAB2 is predominantly found in CB1/CCK-positive GABAergic interneurons, where it is associated with presynaptic regions, suggesting its involvement in regulating vesicular exocytosis and neurotransmitter release (Miczán2020NECAB1).

NECAB2 interacts with various receptors, including the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) and metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), modulating their function and influencing receptor-mediated signaling pathways. This interaction affects the cell surface expression and coupling efficiency of these receptors, thereby impacting neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity (Canela2007The; Canela2009The).

In the spinal cord, NECAB2 is associated with excitatory synaptic boutons, indicating its role in excitatory neuronal circuits and synaptic neurotransmission. Its presence in excitatory nerve endings suggests a conserved function in maintaining synaptic fidelity and responsiveness across species (Zhang2016Comparative). NECAB2's activity in these molecular processes contributes to cognitive functions and neural development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NECAB2 gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions, most notably autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). NECAB2 is identified as a potential risk gene for ASDs, with segmental deletions reported in individuals with idiopathic ASD. These genetic alterations can lead to ASD-like behaviors, such as impaired social interactions and decreased locomotor activity, as observed in zebrafish models (Chen2022AutismRisk). NECAB2's interaction with metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) is crucial for modulating psychomotor and social behaviors, and disruptions in this interaction may contribute to ASD pathogenesis (Chen2022AutismRisk).

In addition to its role in ASDs, NECAB2 is involved in mitochondrial stress responses at striatal synapses. Deficiency in NECAB2 can lead to increased mitochondrial respiration and superoxide production, resulting in synaptic loss and behavioral changes. This dysfunction is associated with conditions like ALS and Parkinson's disease, where NECAB2 expression is altered, potentially as a compensatory mechanism (Bueno2021NECAB2). These findings highlight NECAB2's significance in maintaining neuronal function and its potential involvement in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
NECAB2 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with the adenosine A2A receptor (A2A R) in the rat striatum, where it modulates the receptor's cell surface expression and function. NECAB2 decreases the surface expression of A2A R by up to 25% when co-expressed and prevents agonist-dependent internalization, leading to increased receptor levels on the cell surface after stimulation. This interaction also enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating a potentiation of the MAPK pathway (Canela2007The).

NECAB2 also interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), particularly in the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This interaction occurs through the NHR domain and is crucial for promoting mGluR1 signaling, which involves the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and subsequent intracellular signaling events. NECAB2 enhances mGluR1 signaling without affecting its expression or localization, as evidenced by increased PIP2 hydrolysis in NECAB2-expressing cells (Chen2022AutismRisk).

In the context of pain signaling, NECAB2 interacts with synaptotagmin 1 at its C2A domain, which is involved in neurotransmitter release regulation, particularly glutamate, in the nervous system (Zhang2018Ca2+binding).
