# CREBBP

## Overview
The CREBBP gene encodes the CREB-binding protein, a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and is involved in chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones, thereby facilitating access of the transcriptional machinery to DNA. CREB-binding protein acts as a molecular scaffold, connecting various transcription factors to the core transcriptional machinery, and is essential for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Blobel2000CREB-binding; Kung2000Gene). The CREBBP gene is located on chromosome 16p13.3 and is implicated in several genetic disorders and malignancies, including Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome and various hematological cancers, due to its role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification (Wincent2015CREBBP; Zhu2023The).

## Structure
The CREBBP (CREB binding protein) is a transcriptional coactivator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. Its primary structure includes several domains: the KIX domain, bromodomain, HAT domain, RING finger, and plant homeodomain (PHD) finger (Zhang2021Human; Chen2022Histone). The catalytic core of CREBBP spans residues 1096-1751, with the RING domain covering residues 1205-1279 and the PHD domain from 1280-1321 (Zhang2021Human).

The secondary structure of CREBBP features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the folding and stability of its domains. The tertiary structure involves the spatial arrangement of these domains, allowing for interactions with other proteins and DNA. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, facilitating its role as a transcriptional coactivator.

CREBBP undergoes common post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Zhang2021Human). The bromodomain of CREBBP has two adjacent binding pockets, the KAc binding pocket and the induced-fit pocket, which are crucial for its function in protein-protein interactions (Catalano2020Selective). These structural features enable CREBBP to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression effectively.

## Function
CREBBP, also known as CREB-binding protein, is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression through its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. This activity facilitates chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones, thereby altering chromatin structure to allow transcriptional machinery access to DNA (Blobel2000CREB-binding; Kung2000Gene). CREBBP acts as a molecular scaffold, connecting various transcription factors to the core transcriptional machinery, and is involved in the transcriptional activation of genes critical for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Kung2000Gene; Torres2013Disruption).

In healthy human cells, CREBBP interacts with numerous transcription factors, including p53, GATA-1, and c-Myb, influencing processes such as hematopoiesis, cell cycle regulation, and the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (Goodman2000CBPp300; Zhu2023The). It also plays a role in mRNA stability by acetylating the exoribonuclease CAF1, promoting deadenylation and degradation of poly(A) RNA (Zhu2023The). CREBBP is active in the nucleus, where it integrates transcriptional signals and mediates interactions between transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery, facilitating the formation of a preinitiation complex (Blobel2000CREB-binding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CREBBP gene are primarily associated with Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome (RTS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, broad thumbs and halluces, growth retardation, and cognitive impairment (Wincent2015CREBBP; Bartsch2005DNA). These mutations include nonsense, frameshift, missense, and splice-site mutations, as well as large deletions, most of which are de novo (Wincent2015CREBBP). The CREBBP gene mutations lead to a truncated protein, contributing to the syndrome's clinical manifestations (Bartsch2005DNA).

In addition to RTS, CREBBP mutations are implicated in various hematological malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). These mutations disrupt transcriptional regulation, affecting genes involved in hematopoiesis and cell cycle regulation, and can lead to altered enhancer activity and downregulation of oncogenes (Zhu2023The). CREBBP acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss can contribute to cancer susceptibility and progression (Zhu2023The). The mutations are linked to poor prognosis in lymphomas and are associated with chemoresistance, making them significant targets for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2023The).

## Interactions
CREBBP (CREB-binding protein) is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. One of its primary interactions is with the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), where CREBBP binds to CREB when it is phosphorylated at Serine 133. This interaction is mediated by the KIX domain of CREBBP, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to phospho-Ser-133 CREB, and involves hydrophobic interactions and a critical arginine residue (Arg-600) in the KIX domain (Parker1996Phosphorylation).

CREBBP also interacts with other transcription factors such as the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein. The MLL activation domain binds to the KIX domain of CREBBP, and this interaction is crucial for transcriptional activation. MLL and CREB can bind cooperatively to CREBBP, enhancing the formation of the phospho-CREB-CBP complex (Ernst2001MLL).

In addition to these interactions, CREBBP is involved in the formation of high molecular weight transcription factor complexes, or enhanceosomes, with factors like NF-E2 and EKLF, which are important for hematopoietic transcription (Blobel2000CREB-binding). CREBBP's interactions are not limited to transcription factors; it also interacts with components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, such as RNA helicase A, and basal transcription factors like TFIID and TFIIB, stabilizing the preinitiation complex (Cardinaux2000Recruitment).
