# CLEC4A

## Overview
CLEC4A, or C-type lectin domain family 4 member A, is a gene that encodes a type II C-type lectin receptor known as the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR). This receptor is predominantly expressed on antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and monocytes, and plays a critical role in modulating immune responses. The protein features a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that facilitates the binding of specific sugar moieties, which is essential for its function in immune regulation. Additionally, CLEC4A contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, which is pivotal for delivering inhibitory signals that regulate immune cell activation. The receptor's ability to form homodimers and interact with phosphatases like SHP-1 and SHP-2 further underscores its role in immune modulation. CLEC4A is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including antigen presentation, viral infections, and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Uto2016Clec4A4; Ma2024CLEC4A; Nasu2020Pivotal).

## Structure
CLEC4A, also known as the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), is a type II C-type lectin receptor characterized by its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion. This domain is crucial for its function, allowing the protein to recognize fucose, mannose, and other sugar moieties on glycans (Nasu2020Pivotal). The CRD includes a unique EPS motif, which is essential for homotypic interactions and inhibitory signaling (Nasu2020Pivotal). The protein also features a predicted N-glycosylation site at N185 within the CRD, which plays a role in its self-interaction and inhibitory function (Nasu2020Pivotal).

CLEC4A contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic portion, which is critical for its inhibitory function in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (Nasu2020Pivotal). The protein's structure includes a transmembrane region, and it can form homodimers, which are important for its ligand binding and signaling (Furukawa2016Structural). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided, the CRD typically includes two α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, with conserved cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds that contribute to structural integrity (Furukawa2016Structural). The presence of calcium ion-binding sites is also noted, which are essential for Ca2+-mediated sugar-binding (Furukawa2016Structural).

## Function
CLEC4A, also known as dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), is a classical type II C-type lectin receptor primarily expressed on human antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and monocytes. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic portion, which plays a crucial role in delivering inhibitory signals to regulate immune responses (Nasu2020Pivotal).

The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of CLEC4A, featuring an EPS motif and an N-glycosylation site, is essential for its self-interaction, which is necessary for its ITIM-mediated suppressive function. This self-interaction helps control cellular activation and modulates the function of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) by inhibiting the production of cytokines such as interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha upon stimulation with toll-like receptor ligands (Nasu2020Pivotal).

CLEC4A is involved in the internalization and trafficking of antigens for presentation to T cells, influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. It can also act as an attachment factor for viruses like HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus, potentially leading to productive infection and cellular dysfunction (Nasu2020Pivotal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLEC4A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiovascular conditions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CLEC4A expression is significantly reduced, which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. This reduction correlates with the expansion of the primary tumor, distant metastases, and decreased survival outcomes. High CLEC4A expression is linked to increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. These findings indicate that CLEC4A could serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in LUAD (Ma2024CLEC4A).

In the context of atherosclerosis, CLEC4A2, a gene closely related to CLEC4A, plays a protective role by promoting the differentiation of monocytes into resident macrophages, which are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Deficiency in CLEC4A2 leads to a shift towards pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes, resulting in increased inflammatory myeloid cells and larger necrotic cores in atherosclerotic lesions. This suggests that alterations in CLEC4A2 expression or function could exacerbate atherosclerosis by promoting inflammatory macrophage phenotypes (Park2022Ctype).

## Interactions
CLEC4A, also known as the dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR), is involved in various protein interactions that modulate immune responses. It contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, which is crucial for its inhibitory signaling functions. CLEC4A interacts with SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which are recruited upon crosslinking of CLEC4A, enhancing tyrosine-specific phosphatase activity and leading to the suppression of signaling pathways such as those mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Uto2016Clec4A4).

CLEC4A also demonstrates self-interaction through its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which involves the binding of the EPS motif with an N-glycosylation site. This self-interaction is essential for its ITIM-mediated inhibitory function in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) (Nasu2020Pivotal). The self-interaction of CLEC4A is suggested to occur in cis and/or trans on the cell surface, potentially interacting with itself as a glycosylated ligand (Nasu2020Pivotal).

In the context of antitumor immunity, CLEC4A acts as a negative immune checkpoint regulator. Blocking CLEC4A can enhance the activation of dendritic cells and T cells, suggesting its role in modulating immune cell activation and function within the tumor microenvironment (Uto2023Clec4A4).
