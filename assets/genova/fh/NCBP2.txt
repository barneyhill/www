# NCBP2

## Overview
NCBP2, or nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), which is crucial for RNA processing in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by NCBP2, also known as CBP20, is a key player in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. It functions as an RNA-binding protein, specifically interacting with the 5' cap structure of RNA polymerase II transcripts. This interaction is essential for various RNA processing events, including splicing, export, and degradation, thereby influencing RNA stability and translation (Dou2020Affinity; Dou2020NCBP3). NCBP2 forms a heterodimer with NCBP1, enhancing its binding affinity and functional capacity. The protein's role extends to transcription elongation and mRNA export, where it is involved in the recruitment of processing factors and the transport of capped RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Dou2020Affinity; GonatopoulosPournatzis2013Capbinding). NCBP2 is also implicated in cellular growth and proliferation, with its dysregulation linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Arora2023NCBP2; Xie2023The).

## Function
NCBP2, also known as CBP20, is a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), which plays a critical role in RNA processing in human cells. The CBC, composed of NCBP1 and NCBP2, binds to the 5' cap of RNA polymerase II transcripts, facilitating various RNA processing events such as splicing, export, and degradation (Dou2020NCBP3). NCBP2 directly interacts with the 5' cap through its RNA Recognition Motif (RRM), and its binding affinity is enhanced when it forms a heterodimer with NCBP1 (Dou2020Affinity).

In the nucleus, NCBP2 is involved in promoting transcription elongation and pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the fate of RNA by interacting with different protein complexes (Dou2020Affinity). It is also associated with the recruitment of factors to 7-methylguanosine-modified transcripts, impacting gene-specific processing events (GonatopoulosPournatzis2013Capbinding). NCBP2's role extends to mRNA export, where it is part of the CBC-importin-α complex, facilitating the transport of capped RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Dou2020Affinity).

NCBP2's function is essential for maintaining normal cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation, as its depletion can lead to significant changes in gene expression and reduced cell proliferation (GonatopoulosPournatzis2013Capbinding).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NCBP2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In PDAC, NCBP2 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer progression by enhancing the translation of c-JUN, which activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, suggesting its role as an oncogene. Targeting the MEK/ERK pathway in patients with high NCBP2 expression is proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy (Xie2023The).

In OSCC, NCBP2 is identified as a novel prognostic biomarker, particularly in HPV-negative patients. High expression levels correlate with worse overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals. NCBP2 is overexpressed in tumor cells compared to normal tissues, and its depletion in cell lines reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in tumor progression. The gene is located on the frequently amplified chromosomal segment 3q22-3q29, and its expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, making it a potential therapeutic target (Arora2023NCBP2).

## Interactions
NCBP2, a component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and export. NCBP2 forms a stable interaction with NCBP1, with which it heterodimerizes to bind the 5'-end m7G-cap structure of RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Dou2020Affinity). This interaction is essential for the CBC's function in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA export (Izaurralde1994A).

NCBP2 also interacts with NCBP3, which can substitute for NCBP2 in the CBC, forming an alternative complex with NCBP1. This alternative CBC is involved in mRNA export and can compensate for the loss of NCBP2, highlighting a redundancy in the cap-binding complexes (Gebhardt2015mRNA). NCBP2's interaction with NCBP3 is dependent on NCBP1, as the NCBP1-NCBP3 interaction is lost upon NCBP2 depletion (Dou2020NCBP3).

NCBP2 is also associated with various protein complexes, such as the WRN-Ku70-Ku80-PARP1 complex, and shows preferential association with DNA-related complexes compared to NCBP1 (Dou2020Affinity). It interacts with proteins like SRRT and PHAX, which are involved in RNA transport and processing (Dou2020Affinity). These interactions underscore NCBP2's role in the dynamic regulation of RNA fate and processing.
