# SLC10A6

## Overview
The SLC10A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), a member of the solute carrier family 10. This gene is responsible for producing a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the transport of sulfoconjugated steroid hormones and bile acids across cell membranes. SOAT is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain topology, which is typical of the SLC10 family, and it functions as a sodium-coupled cotransporter. The protein is predominantly expressed in steroid-responsive tissues, where it facilitates the uptake of sulfated steroid hormones, which are precursors for active estrogens and androgens. These hormones are vital for regulating steroid levels in various peripheral tissues. The clinical significance of SLC10A6 is underscored by its involvement in several diseases, including various cancers and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Geyer2007Cloning; Wannowius2023Role).

## Structure
The SLC10A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), a protein involved in the transport of sulfoconjugated steroid hormones and bile acids. The primary structure of SOAT consists of 377 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 41.2 kDa (Geyer2007Cloning). The protein features a seven-transmembrane domain topology, which is characteristic of the SLC10 family, suggesting a similar membrane topology to other family members like ASBT and NTCP (Geyer2007Cloning).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, typical of transmembrane proteins, facilitating its integration into the cell membrane. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices within the membrane, contributing to its functional conformation. SOAT is glycosylated, with N-linked glycosylation sites identified at residues Asn 4, Asn 14, and Asn 157, which are important for its function and localization (Geyer2007Cloning). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, increase the apparent molecular mass of the protein from 41.2 kDa to 46 kDa, which decreases to 42 kDa after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Geyer2007Cloning).

SOAT forms homodimers, a feature that may be relevant for its regulatory functions and transport activities (Noppes2019Homo). The protein's N terminus is extracellular, while the C terminus is cytosolic, as confirmed by immunofluorescence studies (Geyer2007Cloning).

## Function
The SLC10A6 gene encodes the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), a transmembrane protein primarily involved in the transport of sulfated steroid hormones in human cells. SOAT specifically transports 3- and 17-monosulfated steroid hormones, such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, into target cells. These hormones are biologically inactive in their sulfated form and serve as precursors for the intracrine formation of active estrogens and androgens, which are crucial for regulating steroid levels in various peripheral tissues (Wannowius2023Role).

SOAT operates as a sodium-coupled cotransporter, with its transport activity dependent on the presence of sodium ions. It has a specific substrate-binding site that accommodates the planar structure of its substrates, which include sulfated steroid hormones but not non-sulfated, glucuronidated, or disulfated steroids (Geyer2007Cloning; Wannowius2023Role). The transporter is expressed in steroid-responsive tissues such as the testis, skin, vagina, breast, and adipose tissue, where it facilitates the uptake of these negatively charged molecules for subsequent intracellular processing by steroid sulfatase (Wannowius2023Role).

SOAT's role in transporting sulfoconjugated compounds is significant for maintaining physiological processes in healthy human cells, particularly in tissues that express SOAT, steroid sulfatase, and estrogen/androgen receptors (Geyer2007Cloning; Wannowius2023Role).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC10A6 gene, encoding the sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in transporting sulfated steroid hormones. Alterations in SOAT expression are associated with several cancer types, including breast, pancreatic, cervical, head and neck, lung, skin, and urothelial cancers. High SOAT expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and is linked to a lower probability of overall survival in patients with glioma, breast cancer, renal cancer, urothelial cancer, and endometrial cancer (Wannowius2023Role). In breast cancer, SOAT facilitates the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate, promoting the proliferation of hormone-dependent cancer cells. This suggests that SOAT could be a potential target for anti-proliferative therapies in breast cancer (Karakus2018Estrone3Sulfate).

SOAT expression is also linked to metabolic and inflammatory processes. In obesity, increased SOAT expression in adipose tissue is associated with lipid accumulation and inflammation (Wannowius2023Role). Genetic variants in SLC10A6 can lead to transporter dysfunction, potentially impacting steroid regulation and contributing to conditions like cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and insulin resistance (Karakus2022Role). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC10A6 in both cancer and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT), encoded by the SLC10A6 gene, participates in several protein-protein interactions, particularly within the SLC10 family of transporters. SOAT is known to form homodimers, a common feature among SLC10 carriers, which include NTCP (SLC10A1) and ASBT (SLC10A2) (Wannowius2023Role). It also engages in heterodimerization with other SLC10 family members, such as NTCP and ASBT, suggesting the presence of conserved dimerization domains across these proteins (Zhang2019Proteinprotein; Wannowius2023Role).

The interaction between SOAT and NTCP has been shown to reduce NTCP-mediated taurocholate uptake, although the physiological significance of this interaction remains unclear due to the specific expression patterns of these proteins (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight the potential regulatory roles that SOAT may play in modulating the function of other transporters within the SLC10 family. Despite these findings, the exact mechanisms and functional outcomes of these interactions require further investigation to fully understand their implications in physiological and pathological contexts.
