# NIBAN3

## Overview
NIBAN3 is a gene that encodes the protein niban apoptosis regulator 3, which plays a crucial role in cellular apoptosis regulation. The protein is categorized as an apoptosis regulator, involved in modulating cell death pathways, although its precise mechanisms and interactions remain under investigation. NIBAN3 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including stress response and survival, and is of particular interest in cancer research due to its potential role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Understanding the function and regulation of niban apoptosis regulator 3 could provide insights into novel therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (Qiu2020aarFDC).
