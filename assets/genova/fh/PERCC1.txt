# PERCC1

## Overview
PERCC1 is a gene that encodes the protein proline and glutamate rich with coiled coil 1, which is characterized by its proline and glutamate-rich regions and a coiled-coil domain. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular integrity and communication, particularly within enteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastrointestinal system. The protein is involved in the regulation of hormone levels, such as gastrin and somatostatin, and is crucial for normal digestive processes. PERCC1's structural homology to transcriptional regulators suggests its potential involvement in transcriptional regulation through interactions with TEAD transcription factors. Mutations in the PERCC1 gene have been linked to congenital disorders affecting the gastrointestinal system, including infantile-onset malabsorptive diarrhea and congenital diarrhea and enteropathy (MarekYagel2022Nonsense; Sandal2024A; Babcock2022The).

## Function
The PERCC1 gene encodes a protein characterized by its proline and glutamate-rich regions and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining cellular integrity and communication. In healthy human cells, PERCC1 plays a crucial role in the function of enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are part of the largest endocrine organ in the body and are essential for gastrointestinal function (Babcock2022The; MarekYagel2022Nonsense).

PERCC1 is implicated in the regulation of hormone levels, such as gastrin and somatostatin, which are important for normal digestive processes. In PERCC1 knockout mouse models, there is a significant downregulation of these hormones, indicating the gene's role in hormonal regulation (Babcock2022The). The protein is also involved in the later stages of enteroendocrine development, as evidenced by studies on human intestinal organoids, which show a decrease in enteroendocrine cells over time when PERCC1 is affected (Babcock2022The).

The structural homology of PERCC1 to transcriptional regulators like YAP, TAZ, and FAM181 suggests its involvement in transcriptional regulation through interactions with TEAD transcription factors, providing insight into its molecular mechanisms (Babcock2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PERCC1 gene have been linked to several congenital disorders, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal system. PERCC1 is associated with infantile-onset malabsorptive diarrhea and failure to thrive, particularly in cases involving a homozygous deletion of the intestine-critical region (ICR) on chromosome 16p13.3, which regulates PERCC1 expression. This deletion has been observed in patients of Jewish Iraqi origin, leading to severe congenital malabsorptive diarrhea (Babcock2022The).

In addition to deletions, a novel nonsense mutation in PERCC1, specifically a homozygous c.390C > G (p.Y130X) stop gain variant, has been identified in Irish patients with congenital diarrhea and enteropathy (CODE). This mutation results in early-onset watery diarrhea and hypernatremic dehydration, managed with home parenteral nutrition (MarekYagel2022Nonsense).

The absence of PERCC1 affects enteroendocrine cell development and hormone regulation, leading to downregulation of hormones like gastrin and somatostatin, and upregulation of proinflammatory genes. This disruption in enteroendocrine function is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of congenital diarrhea (Babcock2022The). Additionally, PERCC1 mutations have been implicated in cases of osteopetrosis and congenital diarrhea due to a 37-kb deletion involving both the CLCN7 and PERCC1 genes (Sandal2024A).
