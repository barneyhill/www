# P2RX3

## Overview
The P2RX3 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2X3, a ligand-gated ion channel that is part of the purinergic receptor family. This receptor is primarily expressed in sensory neurons and plays a crucial role in purinergic neurotransmission by facilitating the influx of cations, particularly calcium ions, upon activation by ATP (Burnstock2007Physiology). The P2X3 receptor is a trimeric ion channel with each subunit comprising two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular loop, which is essential for ATP binding and channel gating (Spinaci2021P2X3). It is involved in various physiological processes, including nociceptive and proprioceptive signal transmission, and is implicated in several clinical conditions related to pain and sensory disorders (Burnstock2007Physiology; Fabbretti2019P2X3). The receptor's activity is modulated by interactions with other proteins and intracellular signaling pathways, highlighting its complex regulatory mechanisms in sensory signal transduction (Lin2024Finely; Fabbretti2019P2X3).

## Structure
The P2RX3 gene encodes the P2X3 receptor, a trimeric ion channel that is part of the purinergic receptor family. Each subunit of the P2X3 receptor consists of two transmembrane domains connected by a large extracellular loop, which contains the ATP binding site and is glycosylated (Spinaci2021P2X3). The receptor's transmembrane domain is composed of six α-helices, which form the ion channel pore (Mansoor2016Xray). The extracellular domain is hydrophilic and large, contributing to the receptor's ability to bind ATP and undergo conformational changes necessary for channel gating (Mansoor2016Xray).

The P2X3 receptor features a 'cytoplasmic cap' formed by domain-swapped β strands, which stabilizes the open state of the channel (Mansoor2016Xray). This cap is flexible in the apo state but becomes structured upon ATP binding, indicating its role in receptor gating (Mansoor2016Xray). The intracellular domain (ICD) of the P2X3 receptor is involved in allosteric modulation and is suggested to have a similar conformation in both the apo and open states, with specific sites for potential allosteric regulation (Lin2024Finely).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in the P2X3 receptor, contributing to its structural and functional properties (Spinaci2021P2X3). The receptor can form both homotrimers and heterotrimers with P2X2 subunits, indicating its quaternary structure flexibility (Spinaci2021P2X3).

## Function
The P2RX3 gene encodes the P2X3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel primarily expressed in sensory neurons. This receptor is activated by ATP and plays a significant role in purinergic neurotransmission. Upon activation, the P2X3 receptor facilitates the influx of cations, particularly calcium ions, which contributes to neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release (Burnstock2007Physiology). The receptor is predominantly found in sensory neurons, including those in the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia, where it is involved in nociceptive, mechanical, and proprioceptive signal transmission (Burnstock2007Physiology).

In healthy human cells, the P2X3 receptor is crucial for sensory signal processing, including pain perception. It is involved in the rapid desensitizing response to ATP, a key neurotransmitter in purinergic signaling, and is co-expressed with other receptors like P2Y1, influencing calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release (Burnstock2007Physiology). The receptor's activity is modulated by various factors, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and other signaling molecules, which can affect its role in sensory information processing and receptor sensitization under different physiological conditions (Burnstock2007Physiology).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the P2RX3 gene, which encodes the P2X3 receptor, are implicated in several clinical conditions. Increased expression of the P2X3 receptor is associated with heightened pain responses, particularly in chronic pain conditions. This is due to its role in sensory signal transduction and its interaction with inflammatory mediators like prostaglandin E2, which enhances P2X3 receptor responses in dorsal root ganglion neurons, contributing to nociceptive pathways (Bernier2017P2X; Fabbretti2019P2X3).

In the context of migraine, the neuro-vascular theory suggests that the vasodilator CGRP, released during migraine attacks, upregulates P2X3 receptor function, contributing to persistent trigeminal pain (Fabbretti2019P2X3). The receptor's involvement in bladder function is also noted, where its underexpression is linked to bladder hyporeflexia and may contribute to the pathophysiology of urge incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB) (Isali2023A).

The P2X3 receptor is also a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, as antagonists have been shown to reduce pain responses, highlighting its role in pain management strategies (Gong2020Regulatory). These findings underscore the clinical significance of P2RX3 in various pain-related and sensory disorders.

## Interactions
The P2RX3 gene encodes the P2X3 receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions that modulate its function. P2X3 receptors can form homomeric channels or heteromeric channels with P2X2 receptors, known as P2X2/3R, which are significant in sensory neuron function (Illes2020Update). The receptor's activity is modulated by interactions with scaffold proteins such as CASK, which stabilizes P2X3 receptors at the membrane and regulates their turnover. This interaction is dynamic and can be disrupted under certain conditions, such as sustained activation by α,β-meATP, leading to ATP efflux from Pannexin1 hemichannels (Fabbretti2019P2X3).

P2X3 receptors are also influenced by intracellular signaling pathways. For instance, the receptor's function is modulated by PKG-mediated Akt signaling and serine phosphorylation, which affect its translocation to lipid raft domains (Fabbretti2019P2X3). Additionally, the intracellular domain (ICD) of P2X3 receptors plays a crucial role in its activation and interaction with transmembrane domains, with specific amino acid residues being critical for ATP response (Lin2024Finely). The receptor's interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways highlight its complex regulatory mechanisms in sensory signal transduction.
