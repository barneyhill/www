# SERTM2

## Overview
SERTM2 is a gene that encodes the protein serine rich and transmembrane domain containing 2, which is characterized by its serine-rich regions and transmembrane domains. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes due to its structural features, which suggest a role in cell signaling or membrane-associated functions. The expression of SERTM2 is notably altered in several cancer types, indicating its potential involvement in oncogenic pathways and tumor microenvironment interactions. Research has highlighted its differential expression in conditions such as hepatocellular neoplasm and prostate cancer, suggesting that SERTM2 may serve as a biomarker for these diseases and a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Choi2024Change; Zhou2022Potential; Heimdörfer2024Unraveling; Watanabe2023Spatial).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
SERTM2 has been identified as a gene with altered expression in various cancer types. In hepatocellular neoplasm, not otherwise specified (HCN-NOS), SERTM2 is one of the most down-regulated genes, suggesting its potential role in the disease's molecular mechanisms (Zhou2022Potential). In the context of prostate cancer, SERTM2 expression varies between different cancer types. It is more highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment of androgen receptor pathway prostate cancer (ARPC) compared to de novo neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), indicating a possible involvement in the distinct pathogenesis of these cancer types (Watanabe2023Spatial). 

In the Medical Therapy for Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, SERTM2 was the only gene differentially expressed between clinically drug-resistant and responsive groups following finasteride or doxazosin administration, highlighting its potential role in treatment resistance (Choi2024Change). Additionally, SERTM2 is among the genes with lower expression in NEPC compared to adenocarcinoma, which may reflect differences in the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the unique characteristics of NEPC (Heimdörfer2024Unraveling). These findings suggest that SERTM2 may serve as a biomarker for certain cancers and could be a target for future therapeutic interventions.
