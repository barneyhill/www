# NOPCHAP1

## Overview
NOPCHAP1 is a gene that encodes the protein NOP protein chaperone 1, which is a crucial component in the biogenesis of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). This protein functions as a chaperone, facilitating the assembly and stabilization of snoRNP complexes by interacting with key components such as NOP58 and RUVBL1/2 ATPases. NOP protein chaperone 1 is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which allows it to interact flexibly with multiple partners, enhancing its role in complex assembly. The gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its evolutionary importance in ribosomal RNA processing and modification, although it is notably absent in yeast S. cerevisiae (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

## Structure
NOPCHAP1 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), as revealed by solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of NOPCHAP1 shows characteristics typical of IDPs, with tightly centered 1H resonances and a spread of 15N resonances, indicating a lack of stable 3D structure. This suggests that almost all residues of NOPCHAP1 contribute to the observed signals, confirming its disordered nature (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

NOPCHAP1 interacts with the CC-NOP domain of NOP58 and domain II of RUVBL1/2 AAA+ ATPases, playing a crucial role in the biogenesis of C/D snoRNPs by stabilizing NOP58. The interaction with RUVBL1/2 is ATP-dependent, with a strong interaction observed when ATP is not bound (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOPCHAP1 acts as a tether, facilitating the formation of a complex between NOP58 and RUVBL1/2, which is essential for snoRNP assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

The protein is highly conserved across species, except in yeast S. cerevisiae, indicating its evolutionary importance in snoRNP assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). However, specific details about its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variants, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
NOPCHAP1, also known as C12ORF45, is a cofactor involved in the biogenesis of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), which are essential for the modification and processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in human cells. It specifically aids in the loading of NOP58, a core component of C/D snoRNPs, onto the RUVBL1/2 ATPases, facilitating the proper assembly of these complexes (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOPCHAP1 forms a stable complex with NOP58 and RUVBL1/2, enhancing the specificity of RNP assembly by directing NOP58 to a dedicated pathway and preventing premature or non-specific assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

The interaction between NOPCHAP1 and RUVBL1/2 is ATP-dependent, with NOPCHAP1 binding to the RUVBL1/2 domain II in an ATP-depleted state (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOPCHAP1 is an intrinsically disordered protein, which may contribute to its ability to interact with multiple partners and facilitate the assembly of protein complexes (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). Although NOPCHAP1 is not essential in all cell types, its high conservation across species suggests it provides a selective advantage in snoRNP biogenesis (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

## Interactions
NOPCHAP1, also known as C12ORF45, is a chaperone protein involved in the biogenesis of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). It plays a critical role in stabilizing and loading NOP58 onto the RUVBL1/2 ATPases, forming a stable complex essential for snoRNP assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOPCHAP1 interacts specifically with the coiled-coil (CC) and NOP domains of NOP58, distinguishing it from related proteins like NOP56 and PRPF31 (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). 

The interaction between NOPCHAP1 and RUVBL1/2 is ATP-dependent, with NOPCHAP1 binding in an ATP-free state. This interaction is crucial for the proper assembly of snoRNPs, as demonstrated by LUMIER immunoprecipitation and SPR assays (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). NOPCHAP1 acts as a bridge between NOP58 and RUVBL1/2, enhancing their interaction and facilitating the formation of a quaternary complex, which is vital for snoRNP biogenesis (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).

NOPCHAP1 also interacts with other PAQosome components, such as RPAP3 and PIH1D1, and is involved in the assembly of multi-subunit complexes, including RNA polymerase subunits and U5 snRNP proteins (Abel2020NOPCHAP1). These interactions are not RNA-dependent, indicating a specific role for NOPCHAP1 in protein complex assembly (Abel2020NOPCHAP1).
