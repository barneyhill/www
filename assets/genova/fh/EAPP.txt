# EAPP

## Overview
EAPP (E2F-associated phosphoprotein) is a gene that encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. The protein product of EAPP interacts with members of the E2F transcription factor family, particularly E2F1-3, and plays a significant role in modulating E2F-dependent transcription. As a nuclear phosphoprotein, EAPP is crucial for the regulation of the cell cycle by promoting the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, thereby facilitating cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This regulatory function is independent of the tumor suppressor protein p53, highlighting EAPP's unique role in cell cycle control. Additionally, EAPP provides protection against DNA damage-induced apoptosis, primarily through its interaction with p21, and is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and association with poor prognosis (Andorfer2011EAPP:; Yan2023Elevated).

## Structure


## Function
EAPP (E2F-associated phosphoprotein) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in healthy human cells. It interacts with the E2F transcription factor family, particularly E2F1-3, and is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle by increasing the fraction of cells in the G1 phase. EAPP upregulates the expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, by binding to the p21 promoter independently of p53. This upregulation leads to growth arrest by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and sequestering proliferating cell nuclear antigen from DNA polymerase, thereby preventing tumor development (Andorfer2011EAPP:).

EAPP also plays a protective role against DNA damage-induced apoptosis by providing resistance in a p21-dependent manner. It is essential for the efficient assembly of the transcription initiation complex at the p21 promoter, which includes the binding of transcription factors such as TAF1, TAF4, Pol II, and CDK9 (Andorfer2011EAPP:). EAPP's antiapoptotic activity is largely mediated by p21, as its knockdown can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and apoptosis (Andorfer2011EAPP:).

## Clinical Significance
EAPP (E2F-associated phosphoprotein) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), EAPP is overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates. This overexpression is linked to advanced clinicopathological features such as higher histological grade, FIGO stage, and metastasis. EAPP acts as an independent prognostic risk factor, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Yan2023Elevated).

In transformed human cells, EAPP overexpression leads to increased resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, mediated by p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This resistance is observed in both p53-positive and p53-negative cells, suggesting a p53-independent mechanism. EAPP's antiapoptotic properties and its role in cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G1 phase, contribute to its potential in promoting oncogenesis (Andorfer2011EAPP:).

EAPP's interaction with E2F transcription factors and its regulation of p21 expression are crucial for its involvement in cancer progression. Alterations in EAPP expression or its interactions can disrupt normal cell cycle control, leading to tumorigenesis (Andorfer2011EAPP:).

## Interactions
EAPP (E2F associated phosphoprotein) is known to interact with several key proteins and nucleic acids involved in cell cycle regulation and transcription. EAPP interacts with activating members of the E2F transcription factor family, specifically E2F1-3, modulating E2F-dependent transcription (Andorfer2011EAPP:; Yan2023Elevated). It is involved in the regulation of the p21 promoter, a critical component for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. EAPP binds to the p21 promoter near the TATA box, influencing transcription initiation (Andorfer2011EAPP:). This interaction is confirmed through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, which demonstrate EAPP's role in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at the p21 promoter (Andorfer2011EAPP:).

EAPP also competes with the transcription factor Sp1 for binding to the p21 promoter, affecting the transcriptional regulation of p21 (Andorfer2011EAPP:). The presence of EAPP is necessary for the efficient binding of transcription machinery components such as TAF1, TAF4, Pol II, and CDK9, which are essential for transcription initiation and elongation (Andorfer2011EAPP:). These interactions highlight EAPP's role in modulating transcription and cell cycle progression.
