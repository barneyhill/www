# FASTKD1

## Overview
FASTKD1 is a gene that encodes the protein FAST kinase domains 1, which is a member of the FASTK family involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and regulation. The protein is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial function by participating in processes such as mRNA processing, maturation, ribosome assembly, and translation. FAST kinase domains 1 is characterized by an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a C-terminal region containing three conserved domains: FAST1, FAST2, and RAP, which are crucial for its function. The protein also acts as a protective factor against oxidative stress and is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy/mitophagy, and caspase-3 activation, contributing to cellular homeostasis and survival (Yang2023FASTKD1; Yang2024FASTKD1).

## Function
FASTKD1 is a member of the FASTK family, which is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and regulation. This protein is expressed exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix and plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function. It is involved in various mitochondrial processes, including mRNA processing, maturation, ribosome assembly, and translation (Yang2023FASTKD1; Yang2024FASTKD1). FASTKD1 specifically regulates the ND3 domain within mitochondria and is thought to contribute to RNA stability (Yang2023FASTKD1; Yang2024FASTKD1).

The protein features an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a C-terminal region with three conserved domains: FAST1, FAST2, and RAP. These domains are essential for its function in the mitochondrial matrix (Yang2023FASTKD1). FASTKD1 also acts as a protective factor against reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress and cell death, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Yang2023FASTKD1; Yang2024FASTKD1).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, FASTKD1 influences mitochondrial dynamics in a CypD-independent manner and impacts processes such as autophagy/mitophagy and caspase-3 activation, which are critical for cellular homeostasis and survival (Yang2023FASTKD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FASTKD1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), FASTKD1 mutations occur with frequencies of 6.6% and 3.8%, respectively. These mutations often co-occur with other gene mutations, such as PIK3CA, PTEN, and BRAF, which are known oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). FASTKD1 is also identified as a highly sensitive RNA-based biomarker for endometrial carcinoma in uterine aspirate samples and is associated with poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in both children and adults (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), FASTKD1 is significantly upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with clinical stage and survival, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. FASTKD1 expression is negatively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and macrophages, indicating its role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (Yang2024FASTKD1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FASTKD1 in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FASTKD1, a member of the FASTK family, is involved in various interactions within the mitochondrial matrix. It is known to interact with proteins such as MRPL58 and UBC, which are part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes 185 nodes and 278 edges. This network analysis identified three clusters of highly connected proteins, with FASTKD1 being part of cluster 3 (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). 

FASTKD1 is also associated with the regulation of mitochondrial RNA processing and stability. It has been linked to the ND3 domain within mitochondria, suggesting a role in RNA stability and mitochondrial dynamics (Yang2023FASTKD1). The protein is involved in processes such as autophagy/mitophagy and caspase-3 activation, indicating its participation in cellular stress responses and mitochondrial function (Yang2023FASTKD1).

While specific physical interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, FASTKD1's involvement in RNA metabolism and mitochondrial function suggests it may form complexes with RNA molecules, influencing gene expression and mitochondrial physiology (Yang2024FASTKD1). The exact nature of these interactions, particularly with other proteins or nucleic acids, requires further investigation.
