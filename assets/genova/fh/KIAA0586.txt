# KIAA0586

## Overview
KIAA0586 is a gene that encodes the TALPID3 protein, which plays a pivotal role in ciliogenesis and centrosomal function. The TALPID3 protein is integral to the formation and maintenance of primary cilia, cellular organelles that are crucial for various signaling pathways and cellular processes. It is involved in the initial steps of ciliary vesicle formation and is essential for the recruitment and activation of Rab8a, a small GTPase critical for ciliary vesicle formation (Kobayashi2014The). The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that is vital for its localization to the centrosome and its function in cilia assembly (Yin2009TheTalpid3gene). Mutations in the KIAA0586 gene are linked to several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (BachmannGagescu2015KIAA0586is).

## Structure
The KIAA0586 gene encodes a protein known as TALPID3, which is crucial for ciliogenesis and centrosomal function. The protein contains a highly conserved region between amino acids 498-585, which includes a coiled-coil domain from amino acids 498-529. This region is essential for centrosomal localization and primary cilia formation (Yin2009TheTalpid3gene). In humans, the coiled-coil domain is located between residues 531-571, and its presence is critical for the protein's function (Stephen2015TALPID3).

Mutations in KIAA0586 can lead to frameshifts and early terminations, affecting the protein's structure and function. These mutations often result in the loss of the coiled-coil domain, which is necessary for proper centrosomal localization (Stephen2015TALPID3; Malicdan2015Mutations). The protein is part of a CP110-containing complex that assembles a ring-like structure at the distal end of centrioles, playing a role in cilia assembly (Kobayashi2014The).

KIAA0586 has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the longest isoform consisting of 1644 amino acids encoded by 34 exons (Malicdan2015Mutations). These isoforms may vary in expression across different tissues, potentially influencing the protein's structural and functional properties.

## Function
The KIAA0586 gene, also known as TALPID3, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, and is essential for the proper function of primary cilia in human cells. This protein is involved in the initial steps of ciliary vesicle formation and is necessary for the recruitment and activation of Rab8a, a small GTPase critical for ciliary vesicle formation (Kobayashi2014The). TALPID3 localizes to the centrosome, particularly at the distal end of centrioles, and is involved in the dispersal of centriolar satellites, which are important for protein trafficking to centrosomes and cilia assembly (Stephen2015TALPID3; Kobayashi2014The).

In healthy human cells, TALPID3 is essential for maintaining cell and tissue polarity, influencing processes such as centriole migration, orientation, and maturation, which are critical for the docking of the basal body and the formation of cilia (Stephen2015TALPID3). The protein also plays a role in intracellular trafficking and the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which are vital for cellular structure and polarity (Stephen2015TALPID3). Through its interactions with proteins like CP110 and Cep290, TALPID3 ensures proper centrosome organization and function, supporting normal cellular processes (Stephen2015TALPID3; Kobayashi2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIAA0586 gene, also known as TALPID3, are associated with several ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JS) and lethal conditions such as hydrolethalus syndrome and short-rib polydactyly syndrome. Joubert syndrome is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a distinctive mid-hindbrain malformation and is part of a group of disorders linked to primary cilium dysfunction. Mutations in KIAA0586 have been identified in individuals with JS, suggesting its role in the disorder. These mutations are associated with milder JS phenotypes, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome (Stephen2015TALPID3; BachmannGagescu2015KIAA0586is).

In more severe ciliopathies, homozygous nonsense and splicing mutations in KIAA0586 lead to defective ciliogenesis and abnormal Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, particularly affecting GLI3 processing. This disruption results in severe phenotypes, including polydactyly, hydrocephaly, and skeletal abnormalities (Alby2015Mutations). The gene's mutations can also lead to defects in centrosome and cell polarity, contributing to the pathogenesis of Joubert syndrome (Stephen2015TALPID3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KIAA0586 mutations in ciliopathies and their associated phenotypes.

## Interactions
KIAA0586, also known as TALPID3, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for ciliogenesis and centrosome function. It is a component of a CP110-containing protein complex, interacting strongly with CP110 and more weakly with Cep97, Cep290, and Kif24, which are essential for centrosome and cilia function (Kobayashi2014The). TALPID3 also interacts with PCM1, a protein that tethers centriolar satellites, and this interaction is important for modulating the localization of centriolar satellites (Kobayashi2014The).

TALPID3 is implicated in the recruitment and activation of Rab8a, a small GTPase essential for ciliary vesicle formation, and it interacts directly with Rab8a, as demonstrated by co-precipitation assays (Kobayashi2014The). The protein also forms a complex with Cep290, with both proteins playing overlapping roles in ciliary vesicle formation and centriolar satellite dynamics (Kobayashi2014The).

In zebrafish, TALPID3 acts upstream of Rab8a activation, potentially helping to localize Rab8 activators like Rabin8 or RPGR to the basal body, although no direct interaction with Rabin8 has been identified (Ojeda2018The). Additionally, TALPID3 interacts with the E3 ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1), which promotes its poly-ubiquitylation, affecting its stability and function in ciliogenesis (Wang2016Tethering).
