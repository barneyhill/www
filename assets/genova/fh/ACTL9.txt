# ACTL9

## Overview
ACTL9 is a gene that encodes the protein actin-like 9, which is a member of the actin family of proteins. Actin-like 9 is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. The protein plays a crucial role in the proper formation and function of the sperm acrosome, a cap-like structure essential for fertilization. Mutations in the ACTL9 gene have been linked to fertilization failure, especially in assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These mutations can lead to structural abnormalities in sperm, affecting their ability to fertilize an oocyte (Zhang2023Advances; Xue2022Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTL9 gene are associated with fertilization failure, particularly in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) attempts. These mutations, which include two missense and one nonsense mutation, have been identified in individuals experiencing total fertilization failure or poor fertilization outcomes. The mutations in ACTL9 lead to a weakened or lost interaction with ACTL7A, resulting in structural defects in sperm, such as a higher proportion of tapered-head sperm and abnormal ultrastructure of the sperm acrosome. This disruption causes the detachment of the inner acrosomal membrane from the nuclear membrane and a loosened perinuclear theca structure, contributing to fertilization failure (Xue2022Gene).

Additionally, these mutations affect the localization of PLCζ, a protein crucial for stimulating calcium oscillations necessary for oocyte activation. The abnormal localization or absence of PLCζ in mutant sperm leads to oocyte activation deficiency (OAD) and total fertilization failure (TFF). Assisted oocyte activation (AOA) has been used successfully to achieve live births in couples with these mutations, highlighting the potential for targeted clinical interventions (Zhang2023Advances). Understanding the genetic etiology of fertilization failure emphasizes the importance of sperm-related genetic factors, including mutations in ACTL9, in contributing to these conditions (Zhang2023Advances).
