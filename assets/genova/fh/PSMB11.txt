# PSMB11

## Overview
PSMB11 is a gene that encodes the proteasome subunit beta 11, also known as β5t, which is a critical component of the thymoproteasome. The thymoproteasome is a specialized form of the proteasome complex, predominantly found in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) within the thymus. This subunit plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating the positive selection of CD8+ T cells, a process essential for developing a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire (Murata2018The; Ohigashi2021Specific). The β5t subunit is integral to the thymoproteasome's unique ability to generate specific self-peptides that are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, thereby influencing the selection and maturation of CD8+ T cells (Ohigashi2021Specific). The absence of PSMB11 disrupts this process, leading to significant alterations in thymocyte development and immune function (Apavaloaei2019PSMB11).

## Function
The PSMB11 gene encodes the β5t subunit, a component of the thymoproteasome, which is a specialized form of the proteasome complex found in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) in the thymus. This subunit is crucial for the positive selection of CD8+ T cells, a process essential for developing a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire in the immune system (Murata2018The; Ohigashi2021Specific). The β5t subunit influences the production of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-associated self-peptides, which are necessary for the positive selection of CD8+ T cells in the thymic cortex (Ohigashi2021Specific). 

The presence of β5t in the thymoproteasome alters the proteasome's substrate specificity, allowing it to generate distinct self-peptides that are crucial for the positive selection process (Murata2018The). This unique substrate-binding pocket in the β5t structure provides specific endopeptidase activity, leading to the production of a distinct set of peptides (Ohigashi2021Specific). The β5t subunit's role in the thymoproteasome is vital for the proper development and function of CD8+ T cells, highlighting its importance in adaptive immunity (Murata2018The).

## Interactions
PSMB11, also known as proteasome subunit beta 11, is a component of the thymoproteasome, a specialized form of the proteasome found in cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). It interacts with other proteasome subunits to form the 20S core particle, specifically replacing the β5i subunit found in immunoproteasomes (Watanabe2022The). This unique incorporation of PSMB11 into the proteasome complex is facilitated by its structural properties, which allow it to be more readily incorporated into proteasome intermediates than β5i in cTECs (Watanabe2022The).

PSMB11's role in the thymoproteasome is crucial for the production of a distinct set of peptide fragments that are presented by MHC class I molecules, essential for the positive selection of CD8+ T cells (Murata2018The). The absence of PSMB11 leads to the replacement of thymoproteasomes with immunoproteasomes, which affects the unique peptide repertoire and alters the functional identity of cTECs (Apavaloaei2019PSMB11). This shift impacts thymocyte development, particularly affecting CD8 thymocytes, which experience oxidative stress and apoptosis in the absence of PSMB11 (Apavaloaei2019PSMB11).
