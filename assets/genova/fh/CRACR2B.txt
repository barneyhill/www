# CRACR2B

## Overview
CRACR2B, or calcium release-activated calcium channel regulator 2B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of calcium signaling pathways, particularly in the context of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The protein encoded by CRACR2B is a cytoplasmic and plasma membrane-associated regulator that modulates the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1, two key components of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel complex. This protein is characterized by structural features such as EF-hand motifs and a coiled-coil domain, which are crucial for its function in calcium homeostasis and signaling, especially in immune cells (Srikanth2010A; Wu2018Here). CRACR2B is particularly significant in HEK293 cells, where it has a more pronounced effect on SOCE compared to its homologue CRACR2A, highlighting its specific role in modulating calcium dynamics in different cellular contexts (Pacheco2017STIMTRP).

## Structure


## Function
CRACR2B, or calcium release-activated calcium channel regulator 2B, is involved in the regulation of calcium signaling pathways in human cells. It plays a crucial role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), a process essential for various cellular functions such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and immune responses. CRACR2B interacts with key components of the SOCE mechanism, including the Orai1 channel and the STIM1 protein. Upon depletion of calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, STIM1 oligomerizes and translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact sites, where it binds and activates Orai1. This interaction facilitates the influx of extracellular calcium into the cell, which is critical for maintaining calcium homeostasis and signaling in immune cells (Wu2018Here).

CRACR2B is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it influences calcium dynamics by modulating the STIM1-Orai1 complex. Although CRACR2B shares structural similarities with CRACR2A, including EF-hand motifs and a coiled-coil domain, it has distinct roles in different cell types. In HEK293 cells, CRACR2B has a more pronounced effect on SOCE compared to CRACR2A, indicating its specific function in modulating calcium signaling in these cells (Srikanth2010A).

## Clinical Significance
CRACR2B (calcium release-activated calcium channel regulator 2B) plays a significant role in calcium signaling pathways, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases. Alterations in CRACR2B expression or mutations can impact immune responses, contributing to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. These conditions are characterized by the immune system attacking the body's own tissues, and the dysregulation of CRACR2B may affect T-cell function, exacerbating these autoimmune responses.

In addition to autoimmune diseases, changes in CRACR2B expression have been linked to certain cancers. The precise mechanisms by which CRACR2B contributes to cancer development are not fully understood, but it is believed that its role in calcium signaling pathways may influence cell proliferation and survival, processes that are often dysregulated in cancerous cells.

Overall, the clinical significance of CRACR2B lies in its involvement in critical immune and cellular processes. Understanding the gene's role in these pathways may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating autoimmune diseases and cancers associated with its dysregulation.

## Interactions
CRACR2B, a homologue of CRACR2A, is involved in the regulation of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by interacting with key proteins in the SOCE pathway. It shares functional similarities with CRACR2A, which is known to bind directly to both ORAI1 and STIM1, two critical components of the calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel complex. These interactions are enhanced under low calcium conditions, suggesting a role in stabilizing the STIM1-ORAI1 complex at the endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions. Silencing of CRACR2B has been shown to reduce SOCE and disrupt the clustering of STIM1 and ORAI1 at these membrane contact sites (Wang2021Proteins; Pacheco2017STIMTRP).

CRACR2B is more abundant in HEK293 cells and has a pronounced effect on SOCE in these cells. It can restore SOCE when expressed in HEK293 cells depleted of CRACR2B, indicating a potential interaction with components of the SOCE pathway. However, specific details on physical interactions of CRACR2B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, suggesting that further investigation is required to fully elucidate its interaction network (Srikanth2010A).
