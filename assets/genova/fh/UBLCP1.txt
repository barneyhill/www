# UBLCP1

## Overview
UBLCP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin-like domain containing CTD phosphatase 1, which is a phosphatase involved in the regulation of proteasome activity within the nucleus of human cells. The protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a C-terminal phosphatase domain, which together facilitate its interaction with the proteasome, specifically binding to the Rpn1 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle. This interaction is crucial for its role in dephosphorylating proteasome subunits, thereby modulating proteasome activity and maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBLCP1's activity is significant in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and transcription. Mutations in the UBLCP1 gene have been linked to autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Soueid2023A; He2015A; Guo2011UBLCP1).

## Structure
The UBLCP1 protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N-terminal and a C-terminal phosphatase domain, connected by a flexible linker region (Guo2011UBLCP1). The UBL domain adopts a typical β-grasp fold, similar to ubiquitin and other UBL domains, and contains conserved residues that form a hydrophobic patch involved in Ub/UBL recognition (Guo2011UBLCP1). This domain is crucial for binding to the proteasome, specifically interacting with the Rpn1 subunit, which acts as a UBL receptor (Sun2017Phosphatase; Guo2011UBLCP1).

The phosphatase domain of UBLCP1 includes a catalytic motif, DXDX(T/V), essential for its activity, and is similar to those found in FCP1 and SCP1 (Zheng2005Cloning). The protein lacks a β-hairpin-like 'insertion domain' found in SCP1 and FCP1, suggesting unique substrate specificity (Guo2011UBLCP1).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are implied by its role in dephosphorylating proteasome subunits and RNA polymerase II (Zheng2005Cloning; Guo2011UBLCP1). The protein is predominantly located in the nucleus, where it colocalizes with nuclear proteasomes, indicating its role in regulating nuclear proteasome activity (Guo2011UBLCP1).

## Function
UBLCP1 is a phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating proteasome activity within the nucleus of healthy human cells. It functions by dephosphorylating the 26S proteasome, which leads to the inhibition of proteasome activity. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, DNA repair, transcription, and inflammation (He2015A; Guo2011UBLCP1).

UBLCP1 interacts with the proteasome through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, specifically binding to the Rpn1 subunit of the 19S regulatory particle. This interaction is crucial for its role in dephosphorylating the proteasome, which is important for its function (Guo2011UBLCP1). The UBL domain is necessary for UBLCP1's nuclear localization and its interaction with nuclear proteasomes (Guo2011UBLCP1).

In healthy cells, UBLCP1 modulates proteasome activity through reversible phosphorylation, ensuring proper protein degradation and cellular homeostasis (Soueid2023A). Its activity is significant in regulating proteasome-mediated cellular processes, and its inhibition can lead to increased nuclear proteasome activity (He2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBLCP1 gene have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a novel homozygous frameshift deletion in the UBLCP1 gene in a Lebanese family, which leads to a premature termination codon and truncates the phosphatase domain of the UBLCP1 protein. This mutation results in increased proteasome activity due to impaired dephosphorylation, contributing to altered development and function of the central nervous system, which is linked to ASD pathogenesis (Soueid2023A).

The mutation causes a significant reduction in UBLCP1 mRNA levels and protein expression in fibroblasts from affected individuals, leading to enhanced proteasome activity and decreased polyubiquitination. This dysregulation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of ASD by affecting proteasome regulation and activity (Soueid2023A).

The overactivation of the proteasome due to the UBLCP1 mutation can lead to early degradation of proteins, increasing neuroinflammation and exacerbating endoplasmic reticulum stress, which are implicated in ASD pathophysiology. Potential therapeutic approaches, such as using gentamicin or Ataluren, have been explored to correct the effects of the UBLCP1 mutation (Soueid2023A).

## Interactions
UBLCP1 interacts with the 26S proteasome, primarily through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain. This interaction is crucial for its role as a phosphatase that regulates proteasome activity. UBLCP1 specifically binds to the regulatory particle (RP) subunit Rpn1, which acts as a receptor for the UBL domain. This interaction is essential for UBLCP1's function in dephosphorylating proteasome subunits, such as Rpt1, a proteasome ATPase subunit, thereby affecting ATPase activity and proteasome assembly (Sun2017Phosphatase; Guo2011UBLCP1).

The UBL domain of UBLCP1 is necessary and sufficient for its interaction with Rpn1, with specific lysine residues, including Lys 44, Lys 49, and Lys 51, playing critical roles in this binding. Mutations at these sites disrupt the interaction, highlighting their importance (Sun2017Phosphatase). UBLCP1 also interacts with other RP subunits, such as Rpt1, Rpt2, Rpt3, and Rpt6, but not with core particle (CP) subunits, indicating a selective binding to RP subunits (Sun2017Phosphatase).

UBLCP1's interaction with Rpn1 is crucial for its regulatory function, as Rpn1 serves as a platform for UBLCP1 to target other substrates like Rpt1, influencing proteasome assembly and activity (Sun2017Phosphatase).
