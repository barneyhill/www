# GEMIN5

## Overview
GEMIN5 is a gene that encodes the gem nuclear organelle associated protein 5, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism and translation regulation. The protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain and a C-terminal region rich in α-helices, which facilitate its role in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) assembly and mRNA translation. GEMIN5 is a crucial component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, where it recognizes and binds specific RNA sequences, aiding in the assembly of snRNPs essential for pre-mRNA splicing. Additionally, GEMIN5 influences global protein synthesis by interacting with ribosomes and modulating translation elongation. The protein's interactions extend to viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, affecting selective translation processes. Mutations in the GEMIN5 gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Kour2021Loss; FranciscoVelilla2016The; Francisco‐Velilla2019Impact).

## Structure
GEMIN5 is a multifunctional protein characterized by distinct structural domains that contribute to its role in RNA processing and snRNP assembly. The protein contains an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which consists of 14 WD40 motifs forming two seven-bladed β-propellers. These propellers create a contiguous RNA-binding surface, crucial for recognizing the Sm site of snRNAs and the m7G cap, with specific interactions involving residues such as Tyr474, Lys641, and Arg684 (Jin2016Structural; Tang2016Structural; Xu2016Structural).

The C-terminal region of GEMIN5, known as G5C, is rich in α-helices and forms a homodecamer structure composed of a dimer of pentamers. This configuration is essential for RNA binding and mRNA translation regulation. The G5C region includes a TPR-like domain that facilitates dimerization and pentamerization, with a highly hydrophobic pentamer interface critical for its function (Guo2022Structural; MorenoMorcillo2019Structural).

GEMIN5 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, and it may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The structural integrity and RNA-binding capabilities of GEMIN5 are vital for its role in RNA-related biological processes.

## Function
GEMIN5 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein primarily involved in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It is a component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex and plays a crucial role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. GEMIN5 recognizes and binds to specific RNA sequences, including the Sm site of snRNAs, facilitating their delivery to the SMN complex for snRNP assembly (Francisco‐Velilla2019Impact; Xu2016Structural).

In addition to its role in snRNP assembly, GEMIN5 is involved in translation regulation. It interacts with ribosomes and affects the polysome/80S ratio, thereby modulating global protein synthesis. The N-terminal region of GEMIN5 binds to ribosomes and influences translation elongation, while the C-terminal region contains noncanonical RNA-binding sites that regulate selective translation (FranciscoVelilla2016The).

GEMIN5 also plays a role in the selective translation of specific mRNAs, such as those encoding ribosomal and histone proteins. It enhances the association of these mRNAs with polysomes, enabling their efficient translation (EmbarcBuh2022Gemin5dependent). The protein is predominantly cytoplasmic, where it performs its functions in RNA metabolism and translation control (MartinezSalas2020Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GEMIN5 gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations can lead to conditions characterized by cerebellar atrophy, intellectual disability, and motor dysfunction, collectively known as NEDCAM syndrome (Ibrahim2023A). GEMIN5 is crucial for the assembly of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein complex and the formation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for spliceosome function. Pathogenic variants in GEMIN5 disrupt these processes, leading to developmental delay, hypotonia, and cerebellar ataxia (Kour2021Loss).

Loss-of-function mutations in GEMIN5 result in a unique transcriptomic profile distinct from spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), despite both conditions involving disruptions in the SMN complex. These mutations lead to reduced snRNP assembly, potentially due to destabilization of RNA-binding sites and improper protein folding, resulting in protein degradation (Kour2021Loss). Specific mutations, such as R1016C and D1019E, impair GEMIN5's ability to dimerize, affecting its interactions with protein networks involved in translation and RNA-driven pathways (FranciscoVelilla2022Functional).

The clinical symptoms associated with GEMIN5 mutations may include cerebellar hypoplasia, ataxia, tremor, and hypotonia, with some patients exhibiting an SMA-like motor neuronopathy (Kour2021Loss). These findings underscore the importance of GEMIN5 in maintaining normal neuronal development and function.

## Interactions
GEMIN5 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is a component of the SMN complex, interacting with proteins such as SMN, GEMIN2, GEMIN3, and GEMIN4, which are crucial for spliceosome assembly and snRNP biogenesis (FranciscoVelilla2016The; Francisco-Velilla2024Oligomerization). GEMIN5 binds directly to the Sm site of snRNAs, facilitating their assembly into spliceosomal snRNPs (Francisco‐Velilla2019Impact). Its N-terminal domain, containing WD40 repeats, is responsible for delivering snRNAs to the SMN complex and interacting with ribosomal proteins L3 and L4, which impacts global mRNA translation (FranciscoVelilla2016The).

GEMIN5 also interacts with viral IRES elements through its C-terminal domain, affecting selective translation by competing with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) for binding sites on the IRES (Piñeiro2012Gemin5). The protein's oligomerization, mediated by its TPR domain, influences its interaction with various proteins involved in RNA-dependent processes, including those in the SMN complex and the translation machinery (Francisco-Velilla2024Oligomerization). GEMIN5's interactions are often mediated by RNA bridges, as indicated by the loss of association with certain proteins after RNase treatment (FranciscoVelilla2016The).
