# KIFC2

## Overview
KIFC2 is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member C2, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin superfamily, specifically classified as a C-terminal motor kinesin. This protein is characterized by its C-terminal motor domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis and interaction with microtubules, enabling it to function as a minus-end-directed motor. KIFC2 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, where it plays a crucial role in axonal and dendritic transport, particularly in the movement of multivesicular body-like organelles and synaptic vesicles. Despite its specific localization and function, studies have shown that KIFC2 is not essential for normal neural development and behavior in mice, suggesting functional redundancy with other kinesin proteins (Yang2001Functional; Hirokawa2011From; Hanlon1997Characterization).

## Structure
The KIFC2 protein is a member of the kinesin superfamily, specifically related to the KAR3 family of kinesin-related proteins. It features a conserved C-terminal motor domain, spanning amino acids 409-792, which is crucial for its function as a motor protein (Hanlon1997Characterization). The primary structure of KIFC2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form this motor domain, which is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and interaction with microtubules (Yang2001Functional). The protein is predicted to have a high α-helical content and a significant probability of forming a coiled-coil secondary structure within its central stalk domain, suggesting the potential for dimerization through interactions in this region (Hanlon1997Characterization).

KIFC2 is classified as a C-terminal motor kinesin, with its catalytic motor domain located at the C terminus and variable tail domains at the N terminus. It functions as a minus-end-directed motor, primarily involved in axonal and dendritic transport within neural tissues (Yang2001Functional; Hirokawa2011From). The protein is associated with synaptic vesicles and is involved in the transport of multivesicular body-like organelles (Hirokawa2011From; Hanlon1997Characterization). The molecular weight of KIFC2 is approximately 85,625, consistent with the observed 96 kDa band in Western blots of mouse brain extract (Hanlon1997Characterization).

## Function
KIFC2 is a member of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins, which are involved in intracellular transport along microtubules. It is classified as a C-type kinesin, characterized by its motor domain located at the C-terminal, which facilitates movement towards the minus-end of microtubules, indicating a role in retrograde transport (Hirokawa2004Kinesin; Seog2004Molecular). KIFC2 is specifically expressed in neural tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve, and is primarily located in neural cell bodies, dendrites, and axons (Yang2001Functional). This localization suggests its involvement in dendritic and axonal transport, particularly in the movement of multivesicular body-like organelles within these structures (Yang2001Functional; Hirokawa2004Kinesin).

Despite its specific roles in neural transport, studies using KifC2 knockout mice have shown that the absence of this protein does not affect normal neural development and behavior, indicating that KIFC2 is not essential for the overall development and function of the nervous system in mice (Yang2001Functional). This suggests potential redundancy in the transport roles of kinesin superfamily proteins, where other kinesins may compensate for the loss of KIFC2 function.
