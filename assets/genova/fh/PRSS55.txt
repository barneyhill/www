# PRSS55

## Overview
PRSS55 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 55, which is a member of the serine protease family. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a critical role in male fertility. As a serine protease, it is involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, including sperm motility and structure, through its interactions with proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and structural differentiation of sperm (Ge2024PRSS55; Zhu2021PRSS55). PRSS55 has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis in sperm by influencing branched-chain amino acid metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Ge2024PRSS55). Mutations or alterations in the expression of PRSS55 have been associated with male infertility, highlighting its importance in sperm migration and sperm-egg binding (Shang2018Serine; Kobayashi2020Prss55).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PRSS55 gene have been linked to male infertility. Studies in mice have shown that PRSS55 is crucial for sperm function, particularly in sperm migration and sperm-egg binding. Knockout mice lacking PRSS55 exhibit male infertility due to impaired sperm migration from the uterus to the oviduct and defective sperm-egg binding, although in vitro fertilization rates remain unaffected (Shang2018Serine; Kobayashi2020Prss55). This suggests that PRSS55 plays a significant role in in vivo sperm migration and sperm-zona recognition/binding (Shang2018Serine).

PRSS55 is also involved in energy metabolism within sperm, and its deficiency leads to impaired mitochondrial function, reduced ATP production, and altered NAD+/NADH ratios, which can contribute to decreased sperm motility and structural abnormalities (Ge2024PRSS55; Zhu2021PRSS55). These energy deficits and metabolic imbalances are linked to the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and downregulation of proteins involved in energy metabolism pathways (Ge2024PRSS55). The interaction of PRSS55 with mitochondrial proteins suggests its role in maintaining mitochondrial function, which is essential for male fertility (Ge2024PRSS55).

## Interactions
PRSS55, a serine protease, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in male fertility. Studies have shown that PRSS55 interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. In particular, it has been found to interact with branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK), a key regulator in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism pathway. This interaction suggests a role for PRSS55 in regulating energy homeostasis in sperm by influencing BCAA metabolism (Ge2024PRSS55).

PRSS55 has also been implicated in the structural differentiation of sperm. It interacts with type II muscle myosin family members, including MYL6, MYH9, and MYH10, which are expressed in sperm. These interactions are thought to be important for maintaining sperm structure and motility, as PRSS55 knockout mice exhibit significant sperm malformations and reduced motility (Zhu2021PRSS55).

Despite these findings, there is no evidence of a direct interaction between PRSS55 and ADAM3, a protein crucial for sperm-egg binding, although PRSS55 deficiency affects the maturation of ADAM3, indicating an indirect regulatory role (Shang2018Serine). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRSS55 in sperm function and male fertility.
