# TUBE1

## Overview
TUBE1 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin epsilon 1, which is a member of the tubulin family involved in microtubule dynamics. Tubulin epsilon 1 plays a pivotal role in the formation and stabilization of centrioles and cilia, structures essential for cell division and signaling pathways. This protein is crucial for organizing microtubules during centriole duplication, thereby maintaining the microtubule cytoskeleton and ensuring proper cell division (Wang2017Centriole; Pitsava2021Exome). TUBE1's interactions with other proteins, such as katanin and delta-tubulin, underscore its importance in microtubule severing and centriole stability (Stathatos2023Epsilon; Wang2017Centriole). Mutations in the TUBE1 gene have been linked to congenital conditions such as bladder exstrophy, highlighting its clinical significance (Pitsava2021Exome).

## Function
TUBE1 (tubulin epsilon 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of centrioles and cilia in human cells. It is involved in the organization of microtubules during centriole duplication, which is essential for maintaining the microtubule cytoskeleton and ensuring proper cell division (Pitsava2021Exome). TUBE1 is particularly important for the stability of centriolar microtubules, as it helps form or stabilize the triplet microtubules that define centrioles. This stabilization is critical for centriole inheritance during cell division (Wang2017Centriole).

In TUBE1-deficient cells, centrioles are formed but are unstable and disintegrate during the cell cycle, leading to defects in centriole maturation and function (Wang2017Centriole). The absence of TUBE1 results in centrioles that lack normal triplet microtubules, which are essential for their stability and persistence through the cell cycle (Wang2017Centriole). TUBE1 is also implicated in cilia formation and Sonic Hedgehog signaling, which is localized to the ciliary compartment, highlighting its role in cellular functions such as environmental sensing and embryonic patterning (Stathatos2021Delta).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBE1 gene have been associated with bladder exstrophy (BE), a rare congenital defect characterized by the protrusion of internal organs through a defective ventral body wall. The gene is crucial for microtubule organization during centriole duplication, and disruptions in its function may lead to a loss of cell polarity, potentially contributing to the failure of ventral body wall closure, a proposed mechanism for BE. The study identified heterozygous predicted loss-of-function variants in TUBE1, including a stop-gain mutation and a frameshift mutation, in two children with BE. These variants are predicted to lead to the absence of the protein product due to nonsense-mediated decay (Pitsava2021Exome).

The gnomAD loss-of-function observed/expected constraint score for TUBE1 was below 1, indicating fewer than expected loss-of-function variants, which suggests potential haploinsufficiency. However, the probability of loss of function intolerance (pLI) was low, indicating some tolerance to loss-of-function variation. Despite these findings, no pathogenic deletions or duplications of TUBE1 for BE were found in major genetic databases, and functional follow-up is needed to establish a causal relationship (Pitsava2021Exome). The study suggests a potential oligogenic model of inheritance for BE, with multiple variants contributing to the condition (Pitsava2021Exome).

## Interactions
TUBE1 (tubulin epsilon 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in microtubule dynamics and stability. TUBE1 interacts with katanin proteins, particularly KATNAL1 and KATNAL2, which are involved in microtubule severing. These interactions are crucial for the proper function of the manchette and sperm head shaping during spermatogenesis (Stathatos2023Epsilon). TUBE1 is also a target of katanin severing complexes, although it lacks the traditional acidic C-terminal tail typically targeted by these enzymes, suggesting a unique interaction mechanism (Stathatos2023Epsilon).

TUBE1 forms complexes with delta-tubulin (TUBD1) to stabilize centriole structures, particularly the triplet microtubules, which are essential for centriole stability and inheritance (Wang2017Centriole). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated a direct interaction between TUBE1 and TUBD1, supporting their collaborative role in maintaining centriole integrity (Wang2017Centriole).

Additionally, TUBE1 interacts with C16orf59 and C14orf80, forming a heterodimeric complex that associates with delta- and epsilon-tubulins, indicating a role in centrosome-related functions (Pan2018Interrogation). These interactions highlight TUBE1's involvement in complex protein networks essential for cellular processes such as cell division and motility.
