# SEMA3F

## Overview
SEMA3F is a gene that encodes the protein semaphorin 3F, a member of the class 3 semaphorins, which are secreted proteins known for their roles in axonal guidance and angiogenesis inhibition. Semaphorin 3F is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including a sema domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a basic domain, which are crucial for its interactions with receptors such as Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins; Guo2013Mechanistic). Functionally, semaphorin 3F is involved in regulating cell migration, cytoskeletal dynamics, and signaling pathways such as mTOR, impacting processes like cell proliferation and migration (MendesdaCruz2014Semaphorin; Nakayama2015Regulation). In the nervous system, it plays a critical role in axonal guidance by modulating neurotrophin-induced signaling pathways (Atwal2003Semaphorin). Additionally, semaphorin 3F has significant implications in cancer biology, where its expression and interactions can influence tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lou2021ncRNAsmediated; Ye2020SEMA3F).

## Structure
SEMA3F, a member of the class 3 semaphorins, is a secreted protein involved in axonal guidance and angiogenesis inhibition. Its molecular structure includes several key domains: a sema domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, and a basic domain. The sema domain is highly conserved and features a β propeller topology, similar to integrins and LDL receptors, with conserved cysteine residues forming intrasubunit disulfide bonds (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). 

The C-terminal basic domain of SEMA3F, particularly the C-furSema variant, is crucial for its function. This domain includes a C-terminal arginine and an upstream helical motif, both essential for high-affinity binding to Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) (Guo2013Mechanistic). The C-furSema is a dimeric protein due to a conserved intermolecular disulfide bond, enhancing its potency in inhibiting VEGF-A binding to Nrp1 (Guo2013Mechanistic). 

Post-translational modifications such as proteolytic processing and oligomerization are important for SEMA3F's function, influencing its role in processes like axon guidance and angiogenesis (Yazdani2006Thesemaphorins). The protein's structure and modifications enable it to effectively compete with VEGF for NRP binding, contributing to its anti-angiogenic and tumor-suppressive activities (Nakayama2018Semaphorin).

## Function
SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) is a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics in healthy human cells. It functions primarily through its interaction with the receptor Neuropilin-2 (NRP2), influencing various cellular processes. In the thymus, SEMA3F acts as a chemorepulsive agent, inhibiting the migration of thymocyte precursors by preventing actin polymerization, which is essential for cell movement. This regulation is critical for proper T-cell development and positioning within the thymus (MendesdaCruz2014Semaphorin).

SEMA3F also modulates mTOR signaling pathways, particularly by inhibiting mTORC2 activity. This interaction affects cytoskeletal stability and cellular activation responses, impacting processes such as cell proliferation and migration. SEMA3F's ability to inhibit PI-3K and Akt activity further underscores its role in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Nakayama2015Regulation).

In the nervous system, SEMA3F is involved in axonal guidance by antagonizing neurotrophin-induced signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and MEK-ERK, leading to growth cone collapse. This function is vital for the proper development of neuronal networks by balancing growth-promoting and inhibitory signals (Atwal2003Semaphorin).

## Clinical Significance
SEMA3F (semaphorin 3F) has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SEMA3F is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis and tumor immune infiltration. It is linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms, potentially contributing to carcinogenesis (Lou2021ncRNAsmediated). In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), SEMA3F is also upregulated and associated with higher pathological stages, metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. It may promote metastasis through the activation of the focal adhesion pathway, contrary to its tumor-suppressing role in other cancers (Ye2020SEMA3F).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), SEMA3F is downregulated, acting as a tumor suppressor. Its reduced expression is linked to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2017The). In colorectal cancer (CRC), SEMA3F inhibits metastasis by down-regulating the ASCL2-CXCR4 axis via the PI3K-AKT pathway, with low expression associated with higher metastasis and shorter survival (Zhou2015SEMA3F). These findings underscore the complex role of SEMA3F in cancer, where its expression and interactions can either suppress or promote tumor progression depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
SEMA3F interacts with neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and forms a complex with Plexin A1, which plays a crucial role in its function as a regulator of mTOR signaling. This interaction leads to the inhibition of PI-3K activity and affects the assembly of mTOR/rictor and mTOR/raptor complexes, thereby inhibiting mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathways (Nakayama2015Regulation). SEMA3F also recruits ABL2 tyrosine kinase, which activates p190RhoGAP, resulting in the inactivation of RhoA and subsequent cytoskeletal changes (Nakayama2015Regulation).

In the context of tumor biology, SEMA3F interacts with NRP2 to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis by reducing the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and S6K, which are key components of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Nakayama2015Regulation). SEMA3F's interaction with NRP2 also leads to the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, contributing to its anti-angiogenic effects (Nakayama2015Regulation).

SEMA3F competes with VEGF for binding to NRP1, a process that is crucial for its potent anti-angiogenic activity. This competitive binding involves a hetero-bivalent interaction with two distinct sites in the SEMA3F C-terminal domain (Guo2013Mechanistic).
