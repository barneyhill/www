# TINAGL1

## Overview
TINAGL1 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen like 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and interactions with the extracellular matrix. The TINAGL1 protein is characterized by its structural domains, such as the somatomedin B domain, lipocalin motif, and an inactive cathepsin B-like domain, which suggest its roles in binding and signaling (Neiswender2020Acute). Functionally, TINAGL1 is active in the extracellular space, contributing to tissue remodeling and repair, particularly in the kidneys and other organs (Shan2020Upregulation). It interacts with integrins and other proteins, modulating cell-matrix interactions and influencing pathways like TGF-β and Wnt, which are crucial for both developmental and pathological processes (Sun2019TINAGL1; Neiswender2020Acute). Clinically, alterations in TINAGL1 expression are associated with various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, where it can act as either a promoter or suppressor of tumor progression, respectively (Shen2019Tinagl1; Sun2019TINAGL1).

## Structure
The TINAGL1 protein is characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains a somatomedin B domain, a lipocalin motif, and an inactive cathepsin B-like domain, where a catalytic cysteine is replaced by a serine residue (Neiswender2020Acute). These domains suggest potential roles in binding and signaling processes. The protein is known to interact with structural matrix proteins and cell surface receptors, indicating its involvement in cell-matrix interactions (TAKAHASHI2016Impaired).

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TINAGL1 are not provided, its interactions with key proteins such as EGFR and integrin subunits (a5b1 and avb1) have been documented. These interactions are crucial for its role in inhibiting signaling pathways like integrin/FAK and EGFR, which are important in cancer progression (Shen2019Tinagl1). The protein's expression is upregulated in certain conditions, such as during implantation in the decidual endometrium, and it is linked to integrins α5 and β1 (TAKAHASHI2016Impaired). Despite the lack of detailed structural information, TINAGL1's functional domains and interactions highlight its significance in cellular processes and disease contexts.

## Function
TINAGL1 (tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen like 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and interactions with the extracellular matrix. It is involved in maintaining tissue integrity and function, particularly in the kidneys and other organs. TINAGL1 is active in the extracellular space, where it contributes to tissue remodeling and repair (Shan2020Upregulation).

In healthy human cells, TINAGL1 is implicated in promoting integrin-mediated cell adhesion, which is crucial for maintaining the structural stability of tissues. This function is essential for the proper organization and function of cells within the extracellular matrix, facilitating communication and signaling between cells and their environment (Kato2022Low). TINAGL1's role in cell adhesion and migration is vital for processes such as wound healing and tissue regeneration, where it helps coordinate the movement and organization of cells to repair damaged tissues.

The protein's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and tissue functions, contributing to overall organismal health by ensuring that tissues remain structurally sound and capable of responding to physiological changes and injuries (Shan2020Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TINAGL1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In HCC, TINAGL1 is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, as patients with higher TINAGL1 levels exhibit shorter overall and progression-free survival. TINAGL1 acts as an independent risk factor for overall survival in HCC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Sun2019TINAGL1).

Conversely, in TNBC, TINAGL1 expression is typically lower in advanced tumor stages. It functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting integrin/FAK and EGFR signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer progression. High TINAGL1 expression correlates with better clinical outcomes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for TNBC. The gene's suppression of these pathways suggests a role in reducing tumor growth and metastasis (Shen2019Tinagl1).

TINAGL1 is also involved in developmental processes, as evidenced by its role in zebrafish embryonic development. Knockdown of TINAGL1 disrupts cilia formation, leading to defects in heart laterality and renal function, highlighting its importance in normal embryonic development (Neiswender2020Acute).

## Interactions
TINAGL1, a protein involved in various cellular processes, interacts with several key proteins and signaling pathways. It is known to interact with integrins such as α1β1, α2β1, and α5β1, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. These interactions suggest a role for TINAGL1 in modulating cell-matrix interactions, which are important in tissue remodeling and cancer metastasis (Sun2019TINAGL1).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TINAGL1 has been shown to activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. This activation leads to increased secretion of VEGF, promoting carcinogenesis and metastasis through the TGF-β/Smad3/VEGF axis (Sun2019TINAGL1). The interaction with the TGF-β pathway highlights TINAGL1's role in enhancing tumor progression.

In zebrafish embryonic development, TINAGL1 interacts with Wnt family proteins, particularly Wnt3a, and is involved in stabilizing and promoting the diffusion of Wnt proteins. This interaction is crucial for proper ciliogenesis and embryonic development, as evidenced by the disruption of cilia formation upon TINAGL1 knockdown (Neiswender2020Acute). These interactions underscore TINAGL1's involvement in both developmental and pathological processes.
