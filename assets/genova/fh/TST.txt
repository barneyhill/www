# TST

## Overview
The TST gene encodes the enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, commonly referred to as rhodanese, which is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in critical biochemical processes, including cyanide detoxification and sulfur metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a transferase due to its role in transferring sulfur atoms between molecules. Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase facilitates the conversion of toxic cyanide into the less harmful thiocyanate, thereby playing a vital role in cellular detoxification pathways (BillautLaden2006Evidence). Additionally, it participates in the maintenance of iron-sulfur clusters and the reduction of antioxidants, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative stress (Kruithof2020Unraveling). The enzyme's activity is crucial for mitochondrial function, influencing respiratory capacity and antioxidant systems, which are important for metabolic health (Kruithof2020Unraveling). Mutations in the TST gene have been associated with various metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

## Structure
The human thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) protein, also known as rhodanese, is characterized by a tandem-domain structure consisting of two similar globular domains connected by a flexible tether region (Kruithof2020Unraveling). The primary structure of human TST comprises 297 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 33.4 kDa (Kruithof2020Unraveling). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming an alpha-beta topology where alpha-helices surround a central five-stranded beta-sheet core (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide).

The tertiary structure of TST features a cleft between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, where the active site is located. This site includes a catalytic cysteine residue, Cys-248, which is crucial for the enzyme's activity (Kruithof2020Unraveling). The enzyme undergoes significant conformational changes during catalysis, attributed to the structural flexibility of the tether region (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide).

In terms of quaternary structure, TST functions as a monomer, although it can form different structural conformations influenced by substrate interactions (Kruithof2020Unraveling). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can induce conformational changes that affect the enzyme's activity and interaction with other cellular components (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

## Function
Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST), also known as rhodanese, is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in several molecular pathways in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in cyanide detoxification, converting cyanide to the less toxic thiocyanate by transferring a sulfur atom from thiosulfate (BillautLaden2006Evidence). TST is also integral to sulfur metabolism, participating in the modification of iron-sulfur clusters and the reduction of antioxidants such as glutathione and thioredoxin, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

The enzyme's activity involves a double displacement mechanism where a reactive cysteine in the active site accepts a sulfane sulfur from a donor, forming a persulfide intermediate, which is then transferred to a nucleophilic acceptor (Kruithof2020Unraveling). TST is involved in the antioxidant defense system by participating in thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, specifically the glutathione and thioredoxin systems, which are crucial for scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (Kruithof2020Unraveling). TST's activity is linked to mitochondrial function, influencing respiratory capacity and antioxidant systems, which are vital for managing metabolic health and preventing diseases such as diabetes and obesity (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TST gene, which encodes thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, have been linked to various diseases and conditions. Genetic polymorphisms in the TST gene, such as the P285A and E102D missense mutations, can significantly impact the enzyme's activity, potentially affecting its detoxification capacity for cyanide and hydrogen sulfide. These mutations can lead to reduced intrinsic clearance and decreased promoter activity, which may impair the body's ability to detoxify harmful substances (BillautLaden2006Evidence).

TST deficiency has been associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Alterations in TST expression and function are linked to insulin resistance and adiposity, with TST expression negatively correlating with body mass index and positively with insulin sensitivity markers like GLUT4 and IRS1 (Kruithof2020Unraveling). In colonic diseases, reduced TST expression is observed in conditions such as ulcerative colitis and colon cancer, correlating with disease progression (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

TST's role in redox regulation and mitochondrial function suggests that disruptions in its activity could contribute to oxidative stress-related conditions. Alterations in TST phosphorylation can affect mitochondrial energy metabolism, potentially impacting conditions characterized by impaired mitochondrial function (Kruithof2020Unraveling).

## Interactions
Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. TST interacts with enzymes of oxidative metabolism, such as succinate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase, xanthine oxidase, and NADH nitrate reductase, suggesting its role in controlling mitochondrial respiratory activity (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide). It is also involved in the restoration of iron-sulfur clusters in Fe-S proteins like aconitase and mitochondrial respiratory complexes, indicating its participation in maintaining mitochondrial function (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide).

TST's interactions extend to the thioredoxin system, where it is involved in the degradation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell-free systems, highlighting its role in redox homeostasis (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its ability to metabolize sulfane sulfur donors and influences the rate of electron transport and ATP production (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide).

TST also interacts with the mitochondrial import of 5S rRNA, indicating a role in nucleic acid interactions (Buonvino2022ThiosulfateCyanide). These interactions underscore TST's importance in various biochemical pathways, including sulfur and selenium transport, redox system maintenance, and mitochondrial function.
