# CDK5

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 5, a serine/threonine kinase with pivotal roles in the central nervous system. Unlike other cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK5 is not involved in cell cycle regulation but is essential for neuronal development and function. The protein is activated by binding to neuron-specific activators such as p35 and p39, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Dhariwala2008An; Dhavan2001A). CDK5 is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal dynamics, by phosphorylating a range of substrates (Ohshima1996Targeted; Dhavan2001A). Its activity is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms, and its dysregulation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers (Dhavan2001A; Gao2021Posttranslational).

## Structure
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a serine/threonine kinase with a unique structure compared to other CDKs. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure of CDK5 includes an N-terminal lobe rich in β-strands and a C-terminal lobe primarily composed of α-helices (Chou1999A; de2002Molecular). The N-terminal domain features a β-sheet and a single helix, known as the C helix, which is crucial for catalysis (Zhang2007The). The C-terminal domain is larger and consists mostly of R-helices (Zhang2007The).

The tertiary structure of CDK5 involves a bilobal configuration, with ATP binding in a cleft between the two lobes, which contains catalytic residues (Chou1999A; de2002Molecular). The quaternary structure of CDK5 is defined by its interaction with regulatory subunits such as p35, p25, and p39, which are necessary for its activation, as CDK5 does not bind cyclins like other CDKs (Amin2002Cyclin‐dependent; Arif2012Extraneuronal).

CDK5 also features a glycine-rich loop (G-loop) that forms the 'ceiling' of the ATP-binding site, crucial for its kinase activity (Zhang2007The). Phosphorylation of conserved residues in the G-loop, such as Thr14 and Tyr15, regulates CDK5 activity, with Tyr15 phosphorylation being stimulatory (Zhang2007The).

## Function
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the central nervous system, particularly in neuronal migration, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Unlike other cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK5 is not involved in cell cycle regulation but is essential for brain development and function. It is activated by binding to non-cyclin proteins p35 and p39, which are necessary for its enzymatic activity (Dhariwala2008An; Dhavan2001A).

In healthy human cells, CDK5 is involved in regulating the cytoskeleton, axon guidance, and membrane transport. It phosphorylates a variety of substrates, including microtubule-associated proteins and neurofilament proteins, which are crucial for maintaining neuronal structure and function (Ohshima1996Targeted; Dhavan2001A). CDK5 also plays a role in synaptic function by modulating neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Dhavan2001A).

CDK5's activity is tightly regulated through transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons, where it influences processes such as synaptogenesis, learning, and memory (Dhariwala2008An; Shah2014Cdk5). Its proper function is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of neurons, and its dysregulation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Dhavan2001A).

## Clinical Significance
CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) is implicated in various diseases due to its dysregulation. In cancer, CDK5 is often overexpressed and hyperactivated, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. It is involved in several cancer-related processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and DNA repair. CDK5 phosphorylates proteins such as Rb and STAT3, promoting cancer cell proliferation and survival (Pozo2016The; Gao2021Posttranslational). In prostate cancer, CDK5 stabilizes the androgen receptor, enhancing cancer growth (Pozo2016The; Oner2019Future). 

CDK5 also plays a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis, by modulating proteins like FAK and interacting with TGF-β in breast cancer (Liang2013CDK5). Its involvement in DNA repair mechanisms can lead to resistance against DNA-damaging therapies (Pozo2016The; Do2020The).

In the context of non-syndromic intellectual disability (NS-ID), mutations in CDK5 and its activator CDK5R1 have been linked to the condition, affecting neuronal migration and synaptic function (Moncini2015Functional). These mutations can alter post-transcriptional regulation and protein interactions, impacting neural development.

## Interactions
CDK5 interacts with a variety of proteins, forming complexes that are crucial for its function. Unlike other cyclin-dependent kinases, CDK5 is activated by binding to p35 and p39, which are neuron-specific activators. These activators, despite lacking sequence similarity to cyclins, may adopt a cyclin-like structure, facilitating CDK5 activation (Lim2003ProteinProtein). CDK5 forms high-affinity complexes with p35 and p39, which mediate its functions in the nervous system (Lim2003ProteinProtein).

In non-neuronal cells, CDK5 forms a novel complex with KIAA0528 and fibroblast growth factor intracellular binding protein (FIBP). This complex is important for cell growth and migration, particularly in breast cancer cells. The stability of this complex relies on the interactions between KIAA0528 and FIBP, with FIBP acting as a bridging protein (Xu2014Proteomic).

CDK5 also interacts with various proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic functions. It phosphorylates neurofilament proteins and interacts with microtubule-associated proteins like tau, affecting microtubule stability and axonal transport (Lim2003ProteinProtein). Additionally, CDK5 is involved in transcriptional regulation through interactions with proteins such as p53 and MEF2, influencing cell cycle progression and neuronal survival (Lim2003ProteinProtein).
