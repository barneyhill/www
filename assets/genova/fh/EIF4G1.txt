# EIF4G1

## Overview
The EIF4G1 gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 1 (eIF4G1), a critical scaffold protein involved in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. As a component of the eIF4F complex, eIF4G1 plays a pivotal role in recruiting the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5' end of mRNA, facilitating the formation of the preinitiation complex necessary for translation initiation. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an intrinsically disordered region and specific domains that enable interactions with other translation factors and mRNA. eIF4G1 is essential for both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation, influencing cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and stress response. Mutations in the EIF4G1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Howard2014Role; Nishioka2014EIF4G1; ChavesArquero2022eIF4G1).

## Structure
The eIF4G1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) spanning residues 1-249. This region acts as a multi-docking station for RNA, Pab1, Pub1, and self-assembly, with specific interactions facilitated by cation-π and π-π interactions involving residues such as Arg, Tyr, Phe, and Trp (ChavesArquero2022eIF4G1). The IDR contains conserved short linear interaction motifs (SLiMs) that enable both intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, contributing to the protein's conformational flexibility and compactness (ChavesArquero2022eIF4G1).

The eIF4G1 protein also includes specific domains such as the HEAT domain, which is involved in interactions with eIF4A, enhancing its helicase activity (Oberer2005Structural). The middle region of eIF4G1 contains RNA-binding sequences, crucial for stabilizing interactions with the mRNA cap structure (Yanagiya2009Requirement). The protein's structure is further supported by SAXS and NMR data, which reveal a conformational ensemble dominated by monomers (ChavesArquero2022eIF4G1).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and play a role in regulating eIF4G1's activity. The presence of splice variant isoforms contributes to the functional diversity of the protein, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
EIF4G1, encoded by the EIF4G1 gene, is a pivotal component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, playing a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in human cells. It functions as a scaffold protein within the eIF4F complex, which includes eIF4E and eIF4A, facilitating the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5' end of mRNA. This process is essential for the formation of the preinitiation complex and the subsequent scanning of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) to locate the start codon (Howard2014Role; Prévôt2003Conducting).

EIF4G1 interacts with several other proteins, including eIF3 and the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), and is involved in unwinding secondary structures in mRNA through its interaction with eIF4A. This activity is crucial for both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation, allowing for efficient ribosome binding and initiation of translation (Howard2014Role; Prévôt2003Conducting).

In healthy human cells, EIF4G1 is involved in regulating mRNA translation, which is necessary for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to various physiological conditions. It influences cell survival and proliferation by affecting the translation of specific mRNAs crucial for these processes (Howard2014Role). EIF4G1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it coordinates the assembly of the translation initiation complex, impacting cell growth, proliferation, and response to cellular stress (Howard2014Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EIF4G1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably various forms of cancer and Parkinson's disease (PD). In cancer, EIF4G1 is frequently overexpressed, with high levels of its protein and mRNA observed in multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, cervical, and lung cancers. Genetic alterations such as mutations, fusions, amplifications, and deletions in EIF4G1 have been identified across different cancers, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Jaiswal2019Eukaryotic).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, several studies have explored the role of EIF4G1 mutations. Specific mutations, such as p.R1205H and p.A502V, have been associated with autosomal dominant parkinsonism, although their pathogenicity remains debated. These mutations can disrupt protein interactions crucial for translation initiation, potentially leading to impaired nutrient sensing and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are linked to neuronal damage in PD (Nishioka2014EIF4G1; Liu2024Eukaryotic). However, the prevalence and impact of these mutations vary across populations, with some studies suggesting that EIF4G1 mutations are not a common cause of PD in certain groups (Huttenlocher2014EIF4G1is; Li2013Analysis). The gene's role in PD is further complicated by findings of rare variants with uncertain significance, indicating a need for more research to clarify its contribution to the disease (Nuytemans2013Whole; Schulte2012Variants).

## Interactions
EIF4G1, a key component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate translation initiation. It forms a complex with eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, and eIF4A, an RNA helicase, to recruit the small ribosomal subunit to the mRNA 5' end (Schütz2008Crystal). The interaction between eIF4G1 and eIF4E is crucial for linking mRNA to the ribosome, with eIF4G1 enhancing eIF4E's affinity for the mRNA cap structure (Hershey1999The). A specific 98-amino acid fragment of eIF4G1 undergoes a structural transition upon binding to eIF4E, which is important for high-affinity interaction (Hershey1999The).

EIF4G1 also interacts with eIF1, with these interactions being mutually exclusive with eIF4E binding due to overlapping binding sites (Haimov2018Dynamic). The eIF4G1-eIF1 interaction is important for ribosomal scanning and leaky scanning, a mechanism of translation initiation (Haimov2018Dynamic). Additionally, eIF4G1 interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1, which is involved in mRNA circularization and stress granule formation (ChavesArquero2020Multivalent). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of eIF4G1 in translation regulation and stress response.
