# LCOR

## Overview
The LCOR gene encodes the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor, a protein that functions as a transcriptional coregulator involved in the repression of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain and nuclear receptor (NR) box, which facilitate interactions with nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors, enabling it to recruit histone deacetylases and other corepressors to modulate chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Jalaguier2017Complex; Gurevich2007Corepressors). LCOR plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, and development, by forming complexes with proteins such as RIP140 and KLF6 (Calderon2012Liganddependent; Jalaguier2017Complex). Its expression and activity are implicated in several cancers, where it can influence tumor progression and response to therapies, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (PérezNúñez2022LCOR; FLINDRIS2021The).

## Structure
The LCOR protein is characterized by several distinct structural features that contribute to its function as a transcriptional corepressor. It contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, which is crucial for its corepressive activity and interaction with other proteins, such as RIP140 and nuclear receptors (Jafari2022Nuclear; Jalaguier2017Complex). The HTH domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein, specifically between amino acids 337 and 400 (Jalaguier2017Complex).

LCOR also possesses a nuclear receptor (NR) box, which includes the LXXLL motif essential for its interaction with ligand-bound nuclear receptors (Gurevich2007Corepressors). This motif facilitates the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are involved in the repression of transcription (Gurevich2007Corepressors).

The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with two main isoforms being LCoR and LCoR2. These isoforms differ at specific amino acid positions, with LCoR having RS and LCoR2 having SG at positions 405 and 406 (Jalaguier2017Complex). The presence of these isoforms suggests that LCOR may have diverse functional roles depending on the cellular context.

## Function
The Ligand-dependent Corepressor (LCoR) is a transcriptional coregulator that plays a significant role in gene expression regulation in healthy human cells. LCoR functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with nuclear hormone receptors and other transcription factors. It recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) and C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) to its N-terminal and central domains, respectively, facilitating chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Calderon2012Liganddependent). 

LCoR is involved in the repression of genes such as CDKN1A, which encodes the cell cycle regulator p21, through its interaction with Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation (Calderon2012Liganddependent). LCoR also forms complexes with other transcription factors, such as ZBRK1, and corepressors like KAP-1, to regulate gene expression through epigenetic modifications, including histone methylation (Calderon2014Liganddependent).

In the cellular context, LCoR is active in the nucleus, where it localizes to nuclear foci and influences processes like cell differentiation and development by modulating the transcription of target genes (Jalaguier2017Complex). Its expression is widespread in adults, indicating its potential role in various regulatory functions across different tissues (Calderon2014Liganddependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LCOR gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in various types of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low LCOR expression is associated with reduced antigen processing and presentation, contributing to immune evasion and resistance to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This downregulation of antigen-presenting machinery (APM) genes, including immunoproteasome factors and MHC-I genes, is observed in both human and mouse models, highlighting LCOR's role in tumor immunogenicity and responsiveness to ICB (PérezNúñez2022LCOR).

In breast cancer, LCOR acts as a transcriptional repressor interacting with estrogen receptors and other transcription factors. Its interaction with RIP140 is crucial for inhibiting cell proliferation. Disruption of this interaction can switch LCOR's effect from inhibiting to promoting cell proliferation, indicating its dual role in cancer progression (Jalaguier2017Complex).

In endometrioid endometrial cancer, high cytoplasmic LCOR expression is linked to longer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a positive prognostic biomarker. Alterations in LCOR expression are associated with tumor grade and progression, indicating its role in tumor aggressiveness (FLINDRIS2021The).

## Interactions
LCOR (ligand-dependent nuclear receptor corepressor) is involved in various protein interactions that modulate gene expression. It interacts with the corepressor KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP-1) and the C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor ZBRK1 to form a complex that binds to intronic sites in genes such as GADD45A and FGF2. This complex is associated with repressive epigenetic marks, including histone methyltransferase SETDB1 and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation, which contribute to transcriptional repression (Calderon2014Liganddependent).

LCOR also interacts with Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), where it is recruited to the CDKN1A promoter, influencing gene expression through a repressive complex that includes CtBP1 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Calderon2012Liganddependent). The interaction with KLF6 is mediated by the C-terminal region of LCOR, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif crucial for its corepressor function (Calderon2012Liganddependent).

In breast cancer cells, LCOR interacts with receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140), forming a nuclear protein complex that regulates estrogen receptor activity and cell proliferation. This interaction is significant for LCOR's repressive activity and is dependent on the helix-turn-helix domain of LCOR (Jalaguier2017Complex).
