# ANKS6

## Overview
ANKS6 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 6, which is integral to the function and signaling of primary cilia. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins within the nephronophthisis (NPH) protein complex. ANKS6 plays a pivotal role in renal and cardiovascular development by interacting with proteins such as NEK8, INVS, and NPHP3, and is involved in the activation of NEK8 kinase, which is crucial for embryonic situs determination and organ patterning (Hoff2013ANKS6; Czarnecki2015ANKS6). Mutations in the ANKS6 gene are associated with various renal and systemic conditions, including cystic kidney diseases and nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Kulkarni2019Clinical; Hoff2013ANKS6).

## Structure
ANKS6 is a protein composed of 871 amino acids, featuring 11 ankyrin repeats at its N-terminus and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain near its C-terminus (Leettola2014Characterization; Kan2016Influence). The ankyrin repeats are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, while the SAM domain is involved in signaling and typically consists of approximately 70 amino acids forming a globular structure with a core of five α-helices (Leettola2014Characterization). 

The SAM domain of ANKS6 interacts with the SAM domain of ANKS3, forming a complex where ANKS3-SAM polymerizes and ANKS6-SAM binds to one end of the polymer (Leettola2014Characterization). This interaction is crucial for the protein's function, and mutations such as R823W in the SAM domain can disrupt this interaction by destabilizing the protein's tertiary structure, leading to a loss of helical structure and an increase in random coil formation (Leettola2014Characterization; Kan2016Influence). 

ANKS6 is involved in a protein-protein interaction network with NEK8, INVS, NPHP3, and HIF1AN, suggesting its role in forming a complex as part of its quaternary structure (Hoff2013ANKS6). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as hydroxylation by HIF1AN, which is important for its protein binding capacities (Hoff2013ANKS6).

## Function
ANKS6 is a protein that plays a critical role in the function and signaling of primary cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and sensory functions. It is a central component of the nephronophthisis (NPH) protein complex, interacting with proteins such as NEK8, INVS, and NPHP3, which are crucial for renal and cardiovascular development (Hoff2013ANKS6). ANKS6 is involved in the activation of the NEK8 kinase, enhancing its phosphorylation activity, which is important for embryonic situs determination and organ patterning (Czarnecki2015ANKS6). 

The protein localizes to the proximal cilium and is necessary for NEK8's localization to the ciliary inversin compartment, facilitating proper left-right patterning and renal morphogenesis (Czarnecki2015ANKS6). ANKS6 also acts as a substrate and functional activator of NEK8, suggesting its role in signal transduction within cilia (Nakajima2018The). 

In healthy cells, ANKS6 maintains the integrity of the ciliary complex, which is essential for normal kidney function and development (Hoff2013ANKS6). Its interactions with mitochondrial proteins and involvement in amino acid metabolism indicate a role in maintaining normal metabolic and cellular functions, particularly in the kidneys (Schlimpert2019Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANKS6 gene are associated with several renal and systemic conditions, primarily involving cystic kidney diseases. ANKS6 mutations have been linked to nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies, which are characterized by severe renal and cardiac failure, as well as cystic renal dysplasia and cardiac dysfunction in newborns (Kulkarni2019Clinical). Specific mutations, such as the R823W mutation in the SAM domain of ANKS6, are known to cause autosomal polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in rat models, highlighting the gene's role in cystogenesis (Delestré2015ANKS3; Neudecker2010Transgenic).

ANKS6 is also implicated in human cystic kidney disease, presenting with a nephronophthisis-like syndrome. Missense mutations in ANKS6 are associated with normal-sized cystic kidney disease, while splice site and truncating mutations can lead to severe extrarenal defects, including structural heart defects and liver fibrosis (Hoff2013ANKS6). The gene's interaction with NEK8 kinase is crucial for embryonic situs determination and organ patterning, and mutations can result in laterality defects and complex congenital heart defects (Czarnecki2015ANKS6). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ANKS6 in renal and systemic pathologies.

## Interactions
ANKS6 is a central component of the nephronophthisis (NPH) module, interacting with several key proteins involved in renal and ciliary function. It forms a complex with NEK8, INVS, and NPHP3, linking these proteins within the NPH module. ANKS6 interacts with NEK8 through its kinase domain and a specific region between amino acids 259 and 312, enhancing the immobilization of INVS when NEK8 is precipitated (Hoff2013ANKS6). ANKS6 also interacts with the asparaginylhydroxylase HIF1AN, which hydroxylates ANKS6 and INVS, facilitating the formation of the ANKS6/INVS/NPHP3 module (Hoff2013ANKS6).

ANKS6 contains ankyrin repeats and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which are crucial for its interaction with ANKS3. The SAM domain of ANKS6 binds directly to the SAM domain of ANKS3, and this interaction is disrupted by the R823W mutation in ANKS6, which destabilizes the domain (Leettola2014Characterization). ANKS6 also interacts with BICC1, a protein involved in RNA processing, and is recruited to stress granules in response to stress conditions, suggesting a role in RNA processing and stress response (Estrada2020Nephronophthisis).
