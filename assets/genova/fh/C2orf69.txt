# C2orf69

## Overview
C2orf69 is a gene located on chromosome 2q33.1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 2 open reading frame 69. This protein is a member of the hydrolase fold family and is predicted to function as an esterase or lipase, characterized by a conserved serine residue at position 264, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Wong2021Loss). The C2orf69 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, particularly associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a significant role in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation (Lausberg2021C2orf69; Wong2021Loss). It is involved in maintaining the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and influences glycogen metabolism, linking it to broader metabolic pathways (Lausberg2021C2orf69). Mutations in the C2orf69 gene are associated with a severe multisystem disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, autoinflammation, and glycogen storage issues, highlighting its clinical significance (Lausberg2021A; Wong2021Loss).

## Structure
The C2orf69 protein is encoded by two exons on chromosome 2q33.1 and is predicted to be 385 amino acids long (Wong2021Loss). It includes an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) rich in arginine, followed by a UPF0565 domain of unknown function (Wong2021Loss). The protein is highly conserved among vertebrates and Drosophila, indicating its evolutionary importance (Lausberg2021C2orf69).

The C2orf69 protein is suggested to belong to the hydrolase fold family, potentially functioning as an esterase or lipase. Remote structure prediction and modeling highlight a hydrophobic core and a predicted catalytic site, with serine 264 being invariant across all analyzed sequences (Wong2021Loss). The protein's low complexity region between residues 200 and 250 is likely not part of the globular fold (Wong2021Loss).

Post-translational modifications of C2orf69 include phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and NEDDylation (Lausberg2021C2orf69). These modifications suggest a regulatory role in cellular processes. The protein is primarily cytoplasmic, with a small fraction associated with mitochondria, particularly the outer mitochondrial membrane (Wong2021Loss). The exact details of its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures remain unspecified in the available literature.

## Function
The C2orf69 gene encodes a highly conserved 385-amino acid polypeptide that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Lausberg2021C2orf69). The protein is primarily localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it is involved in maintaining the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, especially complexes I, II, and V (Lausberg2021A). C2orf69 is essential for proper mitochondrial function, as its loss leads to respiratory chain defects, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and impaired oxidative respiration (Lausberg2021C2orf69; Wong2021Lossa).

C2orf69 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including SDHB, BOLA3, and ETFA, which are components of the respiratory chain and other mitochondrial processes (Lausberg2021C2orf69). The protein's mitochondrial targeting is facilitated by an N-terminal signal peptide, which is crucial for its localization to the mitochondria (Lausberg2021C2orf69). In addition to its role in mitochondrial function, C2orf69 influences glycogen metabolism by regulating glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE1) activity, linking it to broader metabolic pathways (Lausberg2021C2orf69). The gene's dysfunction is associated with a multisystem disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and glycogen storage issues (Lausberg2021C2orf69).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C2orf69 gene are linked to a severe multisystem disorder characterized by autoinflammation, leukoencephalopathy, and hepatopathy. This condition is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly affecting oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial complexes I, II, and V, leading to symptoms similar to those seen in Leigh syndrome (Lausberg2021C2orf69; Lausberg2021A). Patients with C2orf69 mutations often present with muscular weakness, eye abnormalities, liver dysfunction, epilepsy, and cardiomyopathy. There is also a clinical overlap with glycogen storage disorders, notably glycogen storage disease type IV, due to glycogen pathology observed in some patients (Lausberg2021A; Wong2021Loss).

The gene's deficiency is associated with a fatal autoinflammatory syndrome in both humans and zebrafish, characterized by severe neurological symptoms, including spontaneous epileptic seizures and progressive neurodegeneration (Wong2021Lossa; Wong2021Loss). The disorder also involves immune system dysregulation, with recurrent inflammatory events and elevated inflammatory markers (Lausberg2021C2orf69; Wong2021Lossa). The C2orf69 gene's role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential link to glycogen metabolism disruptions underscore its clinical significance in these complex disorders (Lausberg2021C2orf69; Wong2021Loss).

## Interactions
The C2orf69 protein is involved in several interactions that highlight its role in mitochondrial function. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified 35 interaction partners of C2orf69, supporting its involvement in mitochondrial processes. Notable interacting proteins include SDHB, a major subunit of complex II of the respiratory chain, and BOLA3, which is involved in Fe-S cluster synthesis and respiratory chain complex assembly (Lausberg2021A; Lausberg2021C2orf69). ETFA, which participates in electron transfers from mitochondrial β-oxidation, and CMPK2, essential for mitochondrial nucleotide synthesis, are also among the identified partners (Lausberg2021C2orf69).

The study also found interactions with proteins related to ubiquitination and SUMOylation, indicating that C2orf69 may undergo post-translational modifications (Lausberg2021C2orf69). Despite predictions of C2orf69 being secreted, secretion assays did not detect it in cell supernatants, suggesting its primary function is within the mitochondria (Lausberg2021C2orf69). The protein's role in mitochondrial integrity is further supported by reduced activity in mitochondrial complexes I, II, and V in a C2orf69 knockout model (Lausberg2021A). These interactions and functional studies underscore the importance of C2orf69 in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity.
