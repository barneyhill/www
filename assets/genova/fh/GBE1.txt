# GBE1

## Overview
The GBE1 gene encodes the enzyme 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 1, which is a crucial component of glycogen metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for introducing alpha-1,6-glycosidic branches into glycogen molecules, a process that enhances glycogen solubility and facilitates its storage and mobilization as an energy source within human cells (Magoulas2012Diffuse; Lamperti2009Neuropathological). As a cytoplasmic enzyme, it plays a significant role in maintaining glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (Bao1996Hepatic). Mutations or deficiencies in the GBE1 gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type IV, characterized by the accumulation of abnormally structured glycogen, which can cause tissue damage and dysfunction (Said2016A). The enzyme's interactions with other proteins, such as iron regulatory protein 1, further underscore its importance in cellular processes beyond glycogen metabolism, including iron homeostasis (Huynh2019Glycogen).

## Structure


## Function
The GBE1 gene encodes the 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 1, which plays a crucial role in glycogen metabolism by catalyzing the formation of alpha-1,6-glycosidic branches in glycogen molecules. This branching process is essential for increasing the solubility of glycogen, allowing it to be efficiently stored and mobilized as an energy source in human cells (Magoulas2012Diffuse; Lamperti2009Neuropathological). The enzyme facilitates the transfer of alpha-1,4-linked glucosyl units from the outer end of a glycogen chain to an alpha-1,6 position on the same or a neighboring glycogen chain, which is vital for maintaining the proper structure and function of glycogen (Said2016A).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of the GBE1 gene ensures the formation of normally branched glycogen, preventing the accumulation of abnormally structured glycogen that can lead to tissue injury and dysfunction (Magoulas2012Diffuse). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a key role in maintaining normal glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis (Bao1996Hepatic). Deficiency or mutations in the GBE1 gene can lead to glycogen storage disease type IV, characterized by the accumulation of amylopectin-like polysaccharides in various tissues (Said2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GBE1 gene, which encodes the glycogen branching enzyme, are associated with Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV (GSD IV), also known as Andersen's disease. This rare autosomal recessive disorder results from a deficiency in the glycogen branching enzyme, leading to the accumulation of abnormally structured glycogen with long branches and low solubility. The disease manifests in various clinical forms, including a fatal perinatal neuromuscular subtype, congenital neuromuscular subtype, classic progressive hepatic subtype, non-progressive hepatic subtype, and childhood neuromuscular subtype (Szymańska2018Variable; Nolte2008Congenital).

Clinical symptoms of GSD IV can include hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, and in severe cases, death due to liver failure or cardiac issues (Szymańska2018Variable). The severity of the disease correlates with the type of GBE1 mutations, which can include missense, nonsense, splice-site, frameshift, and large deletions/insertions (Szymańska2018Variable). Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) is another condition linked to GBE1 mutations, characterized by late-onset neurological symptoms such as progressive pyramidal paraparesis and neurogenic bladder (Akman2015Deep). The genetic heterogeneity and variable clinical presentations of these conditions highlight the complex role of GBE1 in glycogen metabolism and disease (Magoulas2012Diffuse).

## Interactions
GBE1, or 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in glycogen metabolism and cellular iron homeostasis. GBE1 physically interacts with iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), which is involved in iron regulation through its aconitase function and its role as a nuclear protein that downregulates iron-dependent processes (Huynh2019Glycogen). This interaction is significant for maintaining functional holo-IRP1A, which is essential for cellular iron homeostasis (Huynh2019Glycogen).

In Drosophila, the equivalent of GBE1, known as AGBE, interacts with IRP1A and Cisd2, a homolog of vertebrate mitoNEET. These interactions are crucial for the repair of oxidatively damaged IRP1A, facilitating its nuclear entry and function (Huynh2019Glycogen). The interaction between AGBE and Cisd2 is essential for maintaining functional IRP1A, as the loss of either protein results in the accumulation of damaged IRP1A, impairing its nuclear translocation and activity (Huynh2019Glycogen).

The study also highlights that GBE1 is transcriptionally upregulated in response to hypoxia and nickel exposure, linking it to iron metabolism. The transcription factor Nrf2, which controls mitochondrial biogenesis and iron metabolism genes, binds to the GBE1 promoter, suggesting coordinated regulation with other iron-related genes (Huynh2019Glycogen).
