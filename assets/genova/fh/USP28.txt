# USP28

## Overview
USP28, or ubiquitin specific peptidase 28, is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein stability and cellular stress responses. The protein, ubiquitin specific peptidase 28, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes distinct domains that facilitate its function in the nucleus. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP28 plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response by stabilizing key proteins such as 53BP1, Claspin, and Chk2, which are essential for DNA repair and apoptosis (Zhang2006A). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligases FBXW7 and DTX3L, which influence its role in cellular processes (Ashok2023DTX3L; Knobel2014USP28). USP28's involvement in these pathways underscores its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein, depending on the cellular context, making it a significant factor in cancer biology (Sauer2019Differential; Prieto-Garcia2021USP28:).

## Structure
USP28 is a ubiquitin-specific protease characterized by a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. The protein consists of 1,077 amino acids and is divided into three main domains: the N-terminal domain, the catalytic 'conserved' USP domain, and the C-terminal extension domain (Ren2023Ubiquitinspecific; Gersch2019Distinct). The N-terminal domain includes a ubiquitin-binding region with a ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) and a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), as well as a SUMO-interaction motif (SIM) (Wen2015The; Zhen2014Regulation). This region is largely disordered but contains a structured three-helix bundle in the UBA domain and an isolated α-helix in the UIM domain (Wen2015The; Zhen2014Regulation).

The catalytic domain of USP28 is composed of four subdomains: the thumb, palm, finger, and the USP28 catalytic domain inserted domain (UCID), which is crucial for dimerization (Ren2023Ubiquitinspecific; Sauer2019Differential). The UCID forms a rigid anti-parallel α-helical stalk that stabilizes the dimer interface through hydrophobic interactions (Gersch2019Distinct). USP28 typically exists as a dimer, with its catalytic domains separated by 56 Å, allowing for simultaneous catalysis by both monomers (Sauer2019Differential; Gersch2019Distinct).

Post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, occur at specific lysine residues within the N-terminal domain, influencing the protein's activity (Zhen2014Regulation). USP28 is more catalytically active than its homolog USP25, with distinct structural features contributing to its enzymatic efficiency (Ren2023Ubiquitinspecific; Sauer2019Differential).

## Function
USP28 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 28) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response by stabilizing key proteins involved in this process. It is crucial for maintaining the stability of DNA-damage-signaling proteins such as 53BP1, Claspin, and Chk2, which are essential for effective DNA repair and apoptosis (Zhang2006A). USP28 operates within the ATM-53BP1-Chk2-p53-PUMA pathway, where it helps regulate p53's apoptotic function by stabilizing Chk2 and 53BP1, thereby promoting DNA-damage-induced apoptosis (Zhang2006A).

USP28 is active primarily in the nucleus, where it interacts with and stabilizes proteins like c-MYC, LSD1, and 53BP1, influencing transcription and cell cycle regulation (Gersch2019Distinct). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation in response to DNA damage, indicating its role as an effector in the ATM pathway (Zhang2006A). USP28's function in stabilizing proteins is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing apoptosis, which are important in preventing tumorigenesis (Zhang2006A). Its involvement in these molecular processes underscores its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncoprotein, depending on the cellular context (Sauer2019Differential).

## Clinical Significance
USP28 plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in protein stability and cellular regulation. In melanoma, USP28 mutations, particularly deletions, are found in 9% of patients, and its down-regulation is associated with poor survival outcomes. Low USP28 expression is linked to resistance to BRAF inhibitors, a common treatment for melanoma patients with BRAF mutations (Saei2018Loss).

In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), USP28 is implicated in chemotherapy resistance. High levels of USP28 are associated with resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapeutic agent. Targeting USP28 can potentially overcome this resistance by affecting the Fanconi anemia pathway, which is crucial for DNA repair (PrietoGarcia2021Inhibition).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), USP28 overexpression correlates with increased tumor growth and reduced patient survival. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene in this context (Zhang2015Overexpression).

USP28 also has dual roles in cancer, acting as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on the context. It stabilizes oncogenic factors like c-MYC and tumor suppressors such as p53, influencing cancer progression in a context-dependent manner (Ren2023Ubiquitinspecific; Prieto-Garcia2021USP28:).

## Interactions
USP28, a deubiquitinating enzyme, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with 53BP1, a key protein in the DNA damage response, through its tandem BRCT domains. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of USP28 to sites of DNA damage, although USP28 plays a minor role in double-strand break metabolism (Knobel2014USP28; Zhang2006A). USP28 also stabilizes 53BP1, Claspin, and Chk2 by preventing their degradation via the 26S proteasome, which is essential for maintaining the stability of these proteins in the DNA damage response (Zhang2006A).

USP28 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, which targets c-Myc for degradation. This interaction is important for regulating c-Myc protein levels and stability, impacting cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis (Ren2023Ubiquitinspecific; Knobel2014USP28). Additionally, USP28 interacts with DTX3L, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, in a mutual regulatory relationship that affects DNA double-strand break repair pathways, including non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination (Ashok2023DTX3L). These interactions highlight USP28's role in modulating protein stability and cellular stress responses through its deubiquitinating activity.
