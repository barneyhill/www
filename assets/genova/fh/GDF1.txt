# GDF1

## Overview
GDF1 (Growth Differentiation Factor 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which is known for its role in regulating cellular growth and differentiation. The GDF1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein that functions primarily in the extracellular space, where it influences key developmental processes such as left-right patterning and neural development during embryogenesis (Lee1990Identification). As a member of the TGF-β superfamily, GDF1 is characterized by a cysteine knot motif and is believed to function as a dimer, potentially forming heterodimers with related proteins to enhance its signaling capabilities (Lee1990Identification). The protein plays a crucial role in embryonic development by interacting with Nodal signaling pathways, thereby contributing to the regulation of mesoderm formation and the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis (Andersson2007Distinct). Mutations in the GDF1 gene have been linked to various congenital heart defects, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Karkera2007LossofFunction).

## Structure
GDF1 (Growth Differentiation Factor 1) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily, characterized by a polypeptide chain that includes a cysteine knot motif, typical of this family. The primary structure of GDF1 consists of 357 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 38.6 kDa (Lee1990Identification). The sequence includes seven cysteine residues with characteristic spacing, which are crucial for forming disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's tertiary structure (Lee1990Identification).

The secondary structure likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. GDF1 is suggested to function as a dimer, similar to other members of the TGF-β superfamily, indicating a quaternary structure involving dimerization (Lee1990Identification).

Post-translational modifications of GDF1 include glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of a potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid 191. In vitro translation experiments confirmed glycosylation, as the protein was converted to a 38K form by endoglycosidase-H treatment (Lee1990Identification). The protein is also suggested to be a secreted glycoprotein, supported by its resistance to trypsin cleavage unless detergent is present, indicating protection within microsomes (Lee1990Identification).

## Function
GDF1 (Growth Differentiation Factor 1) is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a significant role in embryonic development and cell differentiation. GDF1 is involved in the regulation of left-right patterning and neural development, crucial processes during embryogenesis. It is suggested that GDF1 functions as an extracellular factor, mediating developmental decisions related to cell differentiation (Lee1990Identification).

GDF1 is believed to act synergistically with Nodal signaling, influencing the efficiency of Nodal signaling in the epiblast, which is essential for proper embryonic development (Andersson2007Distinct). It is also implicated in mesoderm formation and the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis, working in conjunction with GDF3 to regulate these processes (Andersson2007Distinct). GDF1's role in left-right patterning is particularly significant, as it is involved in the regulation of asymmetric cues during development (Zhang2015Association).

The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it influences signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. GDF1 is hypothesized to be active as a dimer, potentially forming heterodimers with related proteins, similar to other members of the TGF-β superfamily (Lee1990Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GDF1 gene are associated with a range of congenital heart defects (CHDs), which are among the most common birth defects in humans. These mutations can lead to conditions such as transposition of the great arteries (TGA), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and atrioventricular canal defects. The GDF1 gene is crucial for proper left-right patterning during embryonic development, and disturbances in this process can result in complex cardiovascular malformations often seen in heterotaxy, a condition characterized by abnormal arrangement of internal organs (Karkera2007LossofFunction).

Specific mutations, such as G9S, C14Y, S56P, P59T, and A69T, have been identified as hypomorphic or loss-of-function alleles, leading to decreased activity of the GDF1 protein (Karkera2007LossofFunction). Additionally, a truncating variant, c.608G > A (p.W203*), has been linked to autosomal-recessive right isomerism and associated congenital heart defects in certain populations (Marek‐Yagel2020A).

Polymorphisms in GDF1, such as the rs4808863 SNP, have also been associated with an increased risk of CHDs, particularly atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) (Zhang2015Association). These findings underscore the gene's role in cardiac development and its contribution to the genetic susceptibility of CHDs.

## Interactions
GDF1 interacts with Nodal, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, to enhance Nodal signaling through the formation of a heterodimer. This interaction significantly increases Nodal's specific activity, enhancing its signaling range and effectiveness in processes such as left-right patterning in vertebrate embryogenesis (Tanaka2007Longrange). GDF1 alone is not an effective ligand but acts as a coligand with Nodal, facilitating the initiation and expansion of asymmetric Nodal expression in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of mouse embryos (Tanaka2007Longrange).

GDF1 also requires EGF-CFC proteins, such as Cryptic, to bind to the ActRIIB/Alk4 receptor complexes, similar to Nodal. This indicates that GDF1 relies on EGF-CFC coreceptors for its signaling, forming a complex with Cryptic to activate specific gene expression (Cheng2003EGFCFC). The interaction between GDF1 and Nodal is crucial for the long-range action of Nodal, as demonstrated by the necessity of GDF1 for Nodal's function over long distances in both frog and mouse embryos (Tanaka2007Longrange).
