# PEX16

## Overview
PEX16 is a gene that encodes the protein peroxisomal biogenesis factor 16, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes, essential organelles involved in various metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism and detoxification. The PEX16 protein is an integral membrane protein characterized by two transmembrane domains that facilitate its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it acts as a scaffold for recruiting peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) (Hua2015Multiple). This recruitment is crucial for the assembly and maturation of peroxisomes, particularly in cells lacking preexisting peroxisomes (Kim2006The). PEX16 is also involved in lipid metabolism and is highly expressed in adipose tissues, where it is upregulated during adipogenesis, underscoring its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Hofer2017Critical). Mutations in the PEX16 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome spectrum disorders, which manifest in developmental and neurological abnormalities (Kumar2018Expanding).

## Structure
PEX16 is a protein involved in peroxisome biogenesis, characterized by specific structural features essential for its function. The primary structure of PEX16 includes two transmembrane (TM) domains, TM1 and TM2, which are crucial for its localization and function. TM1 acts as a signal-anchor sequence necessary for initial targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while TM2 likely serves as an internal stop-transfer sequence (Hua2015Multiple).

The N-terminal region of PEX16, particularly residues 66-103, is critical for recruiting peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) to the ER. Within this region, residues 71-81 are identified as essential for peroxisomal targeting, functioning as a unique peroxisomal targeting signal (Hua2015Multiple).

PEX16's tertiary structure involves its orientation in membranes with both N and C termini facing the cytosol, facilitated by its TM domains (Hua2015Multiple). The protein does not rely on a cluster of positively charged residues for targeting, distinguishing its mechanism from other PMPs (Hua2015Multiple).

There is no specific information on the quaternary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms of PEX16 in the provided context.

## Function
PEX16 is a crucial protein involved in the biogenesis of peroxisomes in human cells. It is an integral membrane protein that is initially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a cotranslational manner, where it plays a key role in recruiting peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) to the ER. This recruitment is essential for the formation of new peroxisomes, particularly in cells lacking preexisting peroxisomes (Kim2006The; Hua2015Multiple). PEX16 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly and maturation of peroxisomes from the ER. It recruits other peroxisomal components, such as PEX3 and PMP34, to the ER membranes, leading to the formation of a 'peroxisome-like' domain that eventually detaches and matures into a nascent peroxisome (Kim2006The; Hua2015Multiple).

PEX16 is also involved in lipid metabolism and adipocyte development. It is highly expressed in adipose tissues and is upregulated during adipogenesis. Silencing PEX16 results in a reduced number of peroxisomes and impaired adipocyte differentiation, highlighting its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Hofer2017Critical). The protein's activity is crucial for the proper localization and function of peroxisomes, impacting cellular processes such as fatty acid oxidation and detoxification.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX16 gene are associated with a spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome spectrum disorders. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, neurological abnormalities, and liver dysfunction. Specific mutations in PEX16 can lead to a range of neurological conditions such as leukodystrophy, spastic paraplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and craniocervical dystonia (Kumar2018Expanding). A case study identified biallelic variants in PEX16 in a patient with progressive neurological symptoms, including toe-walking, frequent falls, and speech disturbances, suggesting a link between these mutations and the observed phenotype (Kumar2018Expanding).

In Drosophila models, mutations in the pex16 gene result in phenotypes similar to Zellweger syndrome, including reduced lifespan, locomotion defects, and abnormal neuronal development. These models also exhibit male-specific sterility due to arrested spermatocyte maturation, highlighting the gene's role in peroxisome biogenesis and its impact on development and metabolism (Nakayama2011Drosophila).

Alterations in PEX16 expression can impair peroxisome function, affecting lipid metabolism and increasing oxidative stress. In mammalian cells, silencing PEX16 reduces peroxisome numbers, impairs fatty acid oxidation, and disrupts adipocyte differentiation, indicating its critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Hofer2017Critical).

## Interactions
PEX16 is a key player in peroxisome biogenesis, interacting with several other proteins to facilitate the import and assembly of peroxisomal membrane proteins. It interacts with PEX3 and PEX19, which are crucial for peroxisomal membrane protein insertion and the budding of pre-peroxisomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Burkhart2019PEX16). PEX16 recruits PEX3 to the ER and can also directly recruit select peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) to the ER membrane independently of PEX3 and PEX19 (Burkhart2019PEX16).

PEX16 is involved in the trafficking of PMPs via the ER, interacting with PEX3 and PMP34 to influence their import pathways to peroxisomes (Aranovich2014PEX16). It plays a role in the group I pathway, where PMPs are initially targeted to the ER before being routed to peroxisomes (Aranovich2014PEX16). PEX16 also interacts with PEX19, which is involved in the assembly of the PTS receptor complex, suggesting a specific role in the structural organization of peroxisomal protein complexes (Klümper2018Using).

In mammalian cells, PEX16 is exported from the ER with the help of Sec16B, which is necessary for its proper localization and function in peroxisome biogenesis (Yonekawa2011Sec16B). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PEX16 in peroxisome maintenance and biogenesis.
