# UPF2

## Overview
UPF2 is a gene that encodes the UPF2 regulator of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a pivotal protein in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This pathway is essential for the surveillance and degradation of mRNAs containing premature termination codons, thereby preventing the synthesis of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. The UPF2 protein is characterized by its three conserved MIF4G domains, which facilitate its role as a scaffold in the NMD pathway by coordinating interactions with other NMD components, such as UPF1 and UPF3b (Clerici2013Structural; LópezPerrote2016Human). Functionally, UPF2 is involved in the assembly of the SURF complex and enhances the helicase activity of UPF1, which is crucial for initiating mRNA decay (Nicholson2009Nonsensemediated; LópezPerrote2016Human). The gene's significance extends to clinical implications, as mutations and copy number variants in UPF2 are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression (Domingo2020A; Nguyen2013Contribution).

## Structure
The UPF2 protein is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. UPF2 is a 140 kDa protein composed of three conserved MIF4G (middle portion of eIF4G) domains and a C-terminal region that interacts with UPF1 (Clerici2013Structural; LópezPerrote2016Human). The MIF4G domains are essential for UPF2's function, with MIF4G-3 interacting with UPF3b and serving as a substrate for SMG1 kinase phosphorylation (Clerici2013Structural).

The MIF4G-1 and MIF4G-2 domains exhibit a canonical 10-helix fold, stabilized by N-terminal extensions, and are involved in forming a rigid assembly with MIF4G-3 (Clerici2013Structural). The MIF4G-2/MIF4G-3 domains are oriented perpendicularly, contributing to the structural integrity of UPF2 (Clerici2013Structural). The protein forms an open ring structure, facilitating interactions with other NMD factors such as eRF3 and UPF3b (LópezPerrote2016Human).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues within the MIF4G-3 domain, although these modifications do not significantly impact NMD (Clerici2013Structural). The structural arrangement of UPF2 allows it to act as a scaffold, coordinating interactions within the NMD pathway (Clerici2013Structural).

## Function
UPF2 is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, a cellular mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs) to prevent the production of truncated and potentially harmful proteins. In healthy human cells, UPF2 plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the SURF complex (SMG1-UPF1-eRF1-eRF3) at the ribosome, which is essential for initiating NMD. It interacts directly with eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and associates with the SURF complex and ribosomes in an UPF3-independent manner (LópezPerrote2016Human).

UPF2 acts as a platform for transient interactions with several NMD factors, including components of the SURF complex. Its interaction with UPF1 stimulates UPF1's helicase activity, which is crucial for triggering the NMD response. UPF2 is also involved in the phosphorylation of UPF1 by the SMG1 kinase, a key step in recruiting mRNA decay machinery (Nicholson2009Nonsensemediated; LópezPerrote2016Human). UPF2 contains three conserved MIF4G domains, important for its interactions with other NMD components, such as UPF3b and SMG1 (LópezPerrote2016Human). Predominantly residing in the cytoplasm, UPF2 ensures mRNA quality control, influencing gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Nicholson2009Nonsensemediated; Serin2001Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UPF2 gene are significantly associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders. Copy number variants (CNVs) involving UPF2, such as deletions and duplications, have been linked to conditions like intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech and language problems, and hearing impairments. These CNVs are often de novo and not found in control populations, indicating a strong association with disease pathology (Nguyen2013Contribution).

Patients with UPF2 deletions exhibit a broad phenotypic spectrum, including dysmorphic features, joint contractures, and limb deformities. The transcriptome-wide effects of UPF2 deletions are similar to those observed in patients with UPF3B mutations, suggesting a common molecular pathway involving nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, UPF2 deletions result in more extensive transcriptome deregulation, possibly due to UPF2's additional roles in telomere integrity and multiple NMD branches (Nguyen2013Contribution).

The study of UPF2 in neurodevelopmental disorders highlights its critical role in maintaining normal gene expression and cellular function. Disruptions in UPF2 expression or function can lead to significant clinical outcomes, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopmental health (Domingo2020A; Nguyen2013Contribution).

## Interactions
UPF2 is a crucial component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, interacting with several proteins and complexes to facilitate mRNA degradation. It directly interacts with eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3) and the SURF complex, which includes SMG1, UPF1, eRF1, and eRF3. The interaction between UPF2 and eRF3 occurs at the C-terminal region of UPF2, which overlaps with the UPF3-binding site (LópezPerrote2016Human).

UPF2 also interacts with UPF1, modulating its RNA binding properties and enhancing its ATPase activity. This interaction involves a bipartite binding mode where the C-terminal region of UPF2 binds to the CH-domain of UPF1 through alpha-helical and beta-hairpin elements. The beta-hairpin binds more strongly, and mutations in this region can disrupt NMD (Clerici2009Unusual; Chakrabarti2011Molecular).

UPF2 forms a ternary complex with UPF1 and UPF3b, which reduces UPF1's RNA-binding ability and enhances its ATPase activity. This complex formation is crucial for the activation of UPF1 and the NMD process (Clerici2009Unusual; Xue2022Modulation). UPF2 also associates with ribosomes independently of UPF3, indicating its versatile role in the NMD pathway (LópezPerrote2016Human).
