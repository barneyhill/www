# OR4C12

## Overview
OR4C12 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 12, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell (Hughes2014Loss). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR4C12 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including sensory perception, behavior regulation, and immune system activity (Xu2021Enterochromaffin). Additionally, alterations in the gene have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both neurological and oncological contexts (Morello2017Copy; Miller2011Genomewide). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and broader biological roles of OR4C12 remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Function
OR4C12 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4C12 is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory sensation (Hughes2014Loss).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4C12 has been implicated in various physiological processes. It is involved in sensory perception, behavior and emotion regulation, immune system activity, and inflammation regulation (Xu2021Enterochromaffin). The gene has also been associated with pain perception, as studies have linked its activity to pain occurrence after adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer patients (Lee2019Genomewide).

In addition to its sensory functions, OR4C12 may play a role in neuronal injury and nerve regeneration, with dysregulation linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Morello2017Copy). Despite these associations, the specific molecular mechanisms and functions of OR4C12 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4C12 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and oncological conditions through alterations in its copy number. In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), copy number variations (CNVs) involving OR4C12 have been identified in patients, suggesting a potential link between this gene and ALS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of OR4C12 has been associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, indicating its possible involvement in neuronal injury or nerve regeneration (Morello2017Copy).

In the realm of oncology, OR4C12 has been observed to undergo copy number loss in central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS PNETs) and pineoblastomas. This loss was noted in a significant percentage of both primary and recurrent CNS PNETs, as well as in pineoblastomas, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. However, the specific function of OR4C12 in the normal brain or its exact role in cancer development remains unclear, necessitating further research to validate these findings (Miller2011Genomewide).
