# CLXN

## Overview
The CLXN gene encodes the protein calaxin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of flagellar motility. Calaxin is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are essential for calcium binding, and it functions as a Ca2+-dependent regulator. The protein is involved in the modulation of dynein motor activity, crucial for processes such as sperm chemotaxis and ciliary movement. Calaxin's interaction with components of the outer arm dynein (OAD) complex and its role in stabilizing the docking of OAD onto ciliary doublet microtubules underscore its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function. Mutations in the CLXN gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder marked by impaired ciliary and flagellar motility, leading to clinical manifestations such as respiratory issues and male infertility (Mizuno2009A; Yamaguchi2023Calaxin; Morikawa2024Calaxin).

## Structure
Calaxin, encoded by the CLXN gene, is a Ca2+-dependent regulator of flagellar motility and a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family. The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures crucial for calcium binding. Calaxin contains four EF-hand motifs, with EF1 and EF2 having conserved residues for Ca2+ binding, while EF3 features a unique Asp residue that results in a more compact Ca2+ binding motif (Shojima2018Crystal). The protein is composed of 11 helices and is divided into two domains: the N-terminal domain, which includes EF0 and EF1, and the C-terminal domain, which includes EF2 and EF3 (Shojima2018Crystal).

The tertiary structure of calaxin reveals conformational differences between open and closed states, influenced by Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding. The open state is characterized by a C-shaped groove and a relaxed α10 helix, while the closed state shows inward movement of the α7 and α8 helices (Shojima2018Crystal). The C-terminal domain may interact with dynein, a protein largely composed of α-helices, suggesting a role in the regulation of dynein-mediated motility (Shojima2018Crystal). The protein is not myristoylated, unlike other NCS proteins, and does not exhibit the Ca2+-myristoyl switch property (Inaba2015Calcium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CLXN gene, which encodes the protein Calaxin, have been associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by defects in ciliary function. Patients with PCD often exhibit symptoms such as respiratory issues, laterality defects, and male infertility due to impaired ciliary and flagellar motility (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin; Morikawa2024Calaxin). In zebrafish models, mutations in Calaxin lead to abnormal ciliary movement and randomization of left-right body patterning, a condition known as laterality defect, which is similar to the phenotype observed in other ciliary component mutations (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin).

Calaxin's role in stabilizing the docking of outer arm dyneins (OAD) onto ciliary doublet microtubules is crucial for proper ciliary motility. Mutations in Calaxin result in the partial loss of OAD, leading to unstable docking and impaired ciliary function (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin). This instability contributes to the clinical manifestations of PCD, including recurrent respiratory infections and male infertility due to abnormal sperm motility (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin; Morikawa2024Calaxin). The calcium-binding ability of Calaxin is also linked to the regulation of asymmetric flagellar beating, essential for proper sperm motility, further implicating its role in fertility issues (Morikawa2024Calaxin).

## Interactions
Calaxin (CLXN) is a neuronal calcium sensor protein that interacts with several components of the outer arm dynein (OAD) complex in a calcium-dependent manner. It binds specifically to the β-dynein heavy chain in the presence of calcium, facilitating the regulation of dynein motor activity, which is crucial for flagellar motility and sperm chemotaxis (Mizuno2012Calaxin; Mizuno2009A). Calaxin also interacts with β-tubulin, a component of microtubules, forming a cross-linked product, indicating its role in the structural organization of the axoneme (Mizuno2009A).

Calaxin is part of a pentameric docking complex (DC) that includes ARMC4, CCDC151, CCDC114, and TTC25, which is essential for the stabilization of OAD onto ciliary doublet microtubules (DMT) in vertebrates (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin). The interaction with ARMC4 is particularly important for its localization to cilia, suggesting that Calaxin may be part of pre-assembled complexes for transport into the ciliary compartment (Yamaguchi2023Calaxin). Calaxin's role in stabilizing the OAD-DMT interaction is calcium-independent, but its ability to bind calcium is linked to the regulation of asymmetric flagellar beating (Morikawa2024Calaxin).
