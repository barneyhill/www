# OR7G1

## Overview
The OR7G1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily G member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR7G1, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating a neuronal response upon binding specific odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, allowing them to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. The OR7G1 gene is part of a large gene family, which is the largest in the human genome, dedicated to olfactory reception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
