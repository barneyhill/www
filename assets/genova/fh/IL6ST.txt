# IL6ST

## Overview
The IL6ST gene encodes the gp130 protein, a pivotal transmembrane signal transducer within the interleukin 6 (IL-6) cytokine family. Gp130 is integral to the formation of receptor complexes that mediate cytokine signaling, playing a crucial role in various biological processes, including immune response, inflammation, and cellular growth and differentiation. As a type I transmembrane protein, gp130 is characterized by its large extracellular domain, which facilitates cytokine binding and subsequent intracellular signaling through pathways such as JAK/STAT and MAPK. The protein's structural and functional versatility is underscored by its involvement in both classical and trans-signaling pathways, essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and development. Mutations in IL6ST can lead to significant clinical manifestations, including immunological and skeletal disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Hunter2015IL6; Schwerd2020A; Metcalfe2023Structures).

## Structure
The IL6ST gene encodes the gp130 protein, a critical component of the interleukin 6 cytokine family signaling pathway. Gp130 is a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular region composed of six domains, D1-D6. The membrane-distal domains (D1-D3) are primarily involved in cytokine binding, while the membrane-proximal domains (D4-D6) play a crucial role in signal transduction by orienting intracellularly bound JAK molecules for activation (Metcalfe2023Structures).

The gp130 protein forms part of a hexameric complex with cytokines such as IL-11 and IL-11Rα, with specific domains forming a structure resembling a table, where the gp130 extracellular complex shows crossover of domains D5-D6 (Metcalfe2023Structures). The D4 and D5 domains form an 'elbow-like' fold critical for signal transduction (Gardner2024Structural).

Post-translational modifications of gp130 include glycosylation, which is suggested by the presence of N-linked glycans in the extracellular domains (Metcalfe2023Structures). Splice variants of IL6ST can result in different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the provided context. The structural dynamics and flexibility of gp130 are crucial for its function in cytokine signaling (Metcalfe2023Structures).

## Function
The IL6ST gene encodes the protein gp130, a critical signal transducer for the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines. Gp130 is ubiquitously expressed in various cell types and is involved in the signaling pathways of several cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, and oncostatin M (OSM) (Hunter2015IL6; Kang2020Historical). It forms multimeric receptor complexes on the cell surface, facilitating the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 or the activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway (Schwerd2020A). These pathways are crucial for diverse biological functions, including immune responses, inflammation, hematopoiesis, and cellular proliferation and differentiation (Hunter2015IL6; HEINRICH2003Principles).

Gp130 is essential for the classical and trans-signaling pathways of IL-6, which are involved in acute-phase reactions, angiogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis (Kang2020Historical). The protein's role in these processes is central to maintaining normal cellular functions and homeostasis in healthy human cells. Its deletion in mice results in embryonic death, underscoring its critical role in development and cellular survival (Hunter2015IL6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IL6ST gene, which encodes the GP130 protein, are associated with several immunological and skeletal disorders. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in IL6ST can lead to autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome, characterized by recurrent infections and skeletal abnormalities (MaternaKiryluk2021Mosaic). These mutations can also cause a variant of Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome, marked by severe skeletal dysplasia and other complications (Chen2020Absence). Specific mutations, such as p.R281Q, are linked to selective IL-11 signaling defects, contributing to conditions like craniosynostosis (Schwerd2020A).

Dominant-negative variants of IL6ST expand the clinical spectrum of gp130-dependent hyper-IgE syndrome, with symptoms including elevated IgE levels, recurrent infections, and skeletal issues like scoliosis (Arlabosse2023New). The p.(Ser731Valfs*8) and p.(Arg768*) variants are associated with varying severities of hyper-IgE syndrome, depending on their accumulation at the cell surface (Arlabosse2023New).

Somatic gain-of-function mutations in IL6ST, such as small in-frame deletions, are linked to inflammatory hepatocellular tumors, leading to constitutive activation of GP130 and systemic amyloidosis (MaternaKiryluk2021Mosaic). These mutations highlight the diverse clinical implications of IL6ST gene alterations.

## Interactions
The IL6ST gene encodes the gp130 protein, a critical component of receptor complexes for several cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, LIF, CNTF, OSM, and CT-1. Gp130 is a common signal transducing receptor subunit that interacts with various cytokine receptors to facilitate signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt (Chen2023The; Rose-John2017Interleukin-6).

Gp130 forms part of a hexameric complex with cytokines and their specific α-receptors, such as IL-6 and IL-6R or IL-11 and IL-11Rα, which is essential for activating intracellular signaling pathways. This complex is stabilized by interactions at several sites, including domain D3 of gp130 and the α-receptor (Gardner2024Structural; Schwerd2020A). The IL-6/sIL-6R complex can bind to gp130, allowing cells that express gp130 but not IL-6R to respond to IL-6, a process known as trans-signaling (Rose-John2017Interleukin-6).

Mutations in IL6ST, such as the R281Q variant, selectively impair IL-11 signaling by disrupting the interaction between gp130 and IL11RA, highlighting the importance of specific residues in these interactions (Gardner2024Structural; Schwerd2020A). These interactions are crucial for gp130's role in immune functions, hematopoiesis, and organ development (Chen2023The).
