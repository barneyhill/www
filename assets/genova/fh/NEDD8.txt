# NEDD8

## Overview
NEDD8 is a gene that encodes the NEDD8 ubiquitin-like modifier, a small protein that plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification process known as neddylation. This protein is structurally similar to ubiquitin, sharing a significant sequence identity and a conserved β-grasp fold, which is crucial for its function in cellular processes (Santonico2019New; Whitby1998Crystal). NEDD8 primarily targets cullin proteins, enhancing the activity of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which are essential for protein ubiquitination and degradation (Xirodimas2008Novel; Yeh2000Ubiquitinlike). The neddylation pathway, in which NEDD8 is a key player, is vital for regulating protein stability and function, impacting cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (Jones2008A). Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting the clinical significance of NEDD8 and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2024Protein; He2021Role).

## Structure
The human NEDD8 protein is a ubiquitin-like modifier with a molecular structure that closely resembles ubiquitin. Its primary structure consists of a sequence with approximately 57% identity to ubiquitin, and it is highly conserved across species, showing about 80% identity between human and yeast orthologs (Santonico2019New; Whitby1998Crystal). The secondary structure of NEDD8 includes an α-helix packed against an antiparallel β-sheet, forming a globular core known as the β-grasp fold. This core comprises a five-stranded mixed β-sheet and an α-helix, with a flexible C-terminal tail ending in a Gly-Gly motif (Santonico2019New; Whitby1998Crystal).

NEDD8's tertiary structure is characterized by a compact globular fold, similar to ubiquitin, with a distinct electrostatic surface distribution. It features a hydrophobic patch centered around Ile44, crucial for protein-protein interactions (Santonico2019New). NEDD8 functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure, and is involved in the post-translational modification of target proteins through neddylation (Whitby1998Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of NEDD8 include phosphorylation at serine 65, which can activate the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, similar to phosphorylated ubiquitin (Stuber2021Structural). This phosphorylation induces a conformational equilibrium between two states, affecting its interaction with other proteins (Stuber2021Structural).

## Function
NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein that plays a crucial role in the neddylation process, which is essential for regulating protein function and stability in healthy human cells. NEDD8 primarily targets the cullin family of proteins, which are components of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). This modification enhances the ubiquitin-ligase activity of CRLs, promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, transcription, and signal transduction (Xirodimas2008Novel; Yeh2000Ubiquitinlike).

NEDD8 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, viability, and development. It is essential for cell viability in fission yeast and required for development in animals, with inactivation of the NEDD8 pathway resulting in embryonic lethality (Jones2008A). NEDD8 also modifies other proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53, affecting its transcriptional activity and cellular localization (Xirodimas2008Novel).

NEDD8 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and its modification of proteins is crucial for maintaining cellular function and stability. The neddylation process involves a series of enzymes, including the E1 activating enzyme (APP-BP1/Uba3 heterodimer) and the E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc12 (Jones2008A; Rabut2008Function).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the NEDD8 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of various diseases. Dysregulation of the neddylation pathway, in which NEDD8 plays a crucial role, is linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In AD, neddylation affects the degradation of proteins like amyloid-beta and tau, which are associated with disease pathology (He2021Role). In PD, impaired neddylation of proteins such as Parkin and PINK1 may contribute to disease progression (He2021Role).

In cancer, overactivation of the neddylation pathway is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Elevated levels of NEDD8 and related proteins are observed in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer (Zhang2024Protein). The pathway's dysregulation promotes cancer cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis and facilitating the degradation of tumor suppressors (Zhang2024Protein).

Neddylation also plays a role in metabolic disorders, where elevated NEDD8 levels are linked to obesity and type II diabetes, affecting insulin resistance and inflammation (Zhang2024Protein). These findings highlight the potential of targeting the neddylation pathway for therapeutic interventions in these diseases.

## Interactions
NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein that interacts with various proteins, primarily through the process of neddylation. It is known to modify cullin proteins, which are part of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), thereby activating them for protein degradation. NEDD8 interacts with all eight cullin family members, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin and enhancing the efficiency of polyubiquitin chain assembly (Jones2008A; Enchev2014Protein).

NEDD8 also forms interactions with enzymes involved in its conjugation and deconjugation. It interacts with the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), which is crucial for initiating the neddylation process, and with NEDP1, a NEDD8-specific protease responsible for its deconjugation (Enchev2014Protein). The protein interacts with the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc12 and the E3 ligases RBX1 and RBX2, which are components of CRL complexes (Jones2008A; Enchev2014Protein).

NEDD8 also associates with non-cullin proteins, such as pVHL, p53, BCA3, and the EGF receptor, affecting various cellular functions (Jones2008A). It interacts with the proteasome, particularly the 19S regulatory complex, suggesting a role in proteasomal degradation pathways (Jones2008A).
