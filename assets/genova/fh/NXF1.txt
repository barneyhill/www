# NXF1

## Overview
The NXF1 gene encodes the nuclear RNA export factor 1, a pivotal protein in the process of mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This protein, also known as TAP in vertebrates, is categorized as a multidomain transport factor and is essential for the proper functioning of cellular mRNA export mechanisms. NXF1 operates independently of the GTPase Ran, distinguishing it from other nuclear transport factors. It forms a heterodimer with NXT1, facilitating the translocation of mRNA-protein complexes through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by interacting with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats of nucleoporins. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an NTF2-like domain, and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which collectively contribute to its role in mRNA binding and export (Aibara2015The; Herold2000TAP). NXF1's interactions with various proteins, including those in the TREX complex and SR proteins, underscore its importance in linking RNA processing to export, thereby ensuring efficient gene expression (Viphakone2012TREX; MüllerMcNicoll2016SR).

## Structure
The NXF1 protein, also known as TAP in vertebrates, is a modular protein involved in mRNA export from the nucleus. It contains several distinct domains: an RNA recognition motif (RRM), a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an NTF2-like domain, and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (Aibara2015The; Herold2000TAP). The RRM and LRR domains are involved in binding both viral and cellular mRNAs, likely with the help of adaptor proteins (Zhang2011Evolutionary). The NTF2-like domain forms a heterodimer with NXT1, which is crucial for mRNA export and association with nucleoporins (Aibara2015The; Grant2002Structure). The UBA domain binds FG repeats of nucleoporins, targeting NXF1 to the nuclear pore complex for translocation (Zhang2011Evolutionary).

The C-terminal domain of NXF1, known as TapC, is characterized by a four-helix fold related to a UBA domain, with a hydrophobic core formed by specific side chains (Grant2002Structure). This domain is joined to the next module by a flexible 12-residue Pro-rich linker, allowing for simultaneous binding of nucleoporins by the TapC and NTF2-like domains (Grant2002Structure).

NXF1 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its structural and functional properties (Herold2000TAP). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, affecting its function and interactions (Herold2000TAP).

## Function
NXF1, also known as TAP, is a crucial protein in the export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in human cells. It functions as a multidomain protein that binds mRNA, mRNA adaptor proteins, and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to facilitate mRNA export (Zhang2011Evolutionary). Unlike other nuclear transport factors, NXF1 operates independently of the GTPase Ran, which is typically involved in nuclear transport processes (Rodriguez2004Nuclear).

NXF1 forms a heterodimer with NXT1, acting as a general export receptor that binds to RNA without sequence specificity. This receptor is responsible for signaling the completion of nuclear mRNP assembly and mediating the targeting and translocation of mRNPs through the NPC (Xie2019Mechanisms). The transport directionality is regulated by DEAD-box ATPases, specifically UAP56 in the nucleus and DDX19 at the cytoplasmic side (Xie2019Mechanisms).

In addition to its role in mRNA export, NXF1 interacts with SR proteins, which serve as adaptors linking alternative RNA processing to mRNA export. This interaction is crucial for the proper expression of genes, ensuring efficient mRNA transport out of the nucleus after processing (MüllerMcNicoll2016SR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NXF1 gene have been linked to several hematological conditions. In mice, germline heterozygous mutations in NXF1 lead to thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, conditions characterized by low platelet and lymphocyte counts, respectively. These mutations result in impaired RNA metabolism, triggering apoptosis pathways that particularly affect platelets and lymphocytes, while erythrocytes remain largely unaffected (Chappaz2020Germline). The mutations in NXF1 can alter the cytoplasmic representation of transcripts encoding RNA metabolism regulators, indicating differential requirements for NXF1-mediated mRNA export across blood cell lineages (Chappaz2020Germline).

The NXF1 gene has also been implicated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), suggesting a potential role in its pathogenesis (Chappaz2020Germline). The mutations may sensitize cells to apoptosis by altering the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression, which could be a therapeutic target in diseases involving RNA-metabolism regulator mutations (Chappaz2020Germline).

Additionally, the NXF1 gene is involved in the suppression of RNA processing defects induced by Intracisternal A Particles (IAPs) in mice, with specific variants like E610G acting as semi-dominant suppressors of these defects (Concepcion2015Nxf1).

## Interactions
NXF1, also known as TAP in humans, is a key player in mRNA export and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with the TREX complex, which includes components such as Aly, Thoc5, and Hpr1. These interactions are crucial for mRNA export, with Aly enhancing the RNA-binding activity of NXF1 and Thoc5 binding to its NTF2L domain (Viphakone2012TREX). NXF1 also interacts with the Nxf1-p15 heterodimer, which is facilitated by RanBP2/Nup358 at the nuclear pore complex, playing a significant role in mRNA export (Forler2004RanBP2Nup358).

NXF1 can self-associate to form oligomeric complexes, which may enhance its interaction with nucleoporins and are independent of RNA binding (Matzat2008Formation). It also interacts with SR proteins, such as SRSF3, which act as adaptors linking alternative RNA processing to mRNA export. SRSF3 recruits NXF1 to specific mRNA sites, particularly in the last exons or 3' UTRs, facilitating mRNA export (MüllerMcNicoll2016SR).
