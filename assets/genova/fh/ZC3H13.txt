# ZC3H13

## Overview
ZC3H13 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 13 protein, which is integral to RNA processing and stability. This protein is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic CCCH-type zinc finger domain, which plays a pivotal role in m6A RNA methylation, a critical post-transcriptional modification influencing mRNA expression and stability (Wu2022Identification). ZC3H13 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to mRNA export and degradation pathways, essential for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular function (Wu2022Identification). The protein's interactions with other components of the m6A methylation machinery, such as WTAP and RBM15, underscore its importance in the regulation of mRNA methylation and cellular homeostasis (Wen2018Zc3h13; Knuckles2018Zc3h13Flacc). Additionally, ZC3H13 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and mutations are associated with tumor progression and prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhu2018ZC3H13; Guo2021N6Methyladenosine).

## Function
ZC3H13, a zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein, plays a significant role in RNA processing and stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in m6A RNA methylation, a post-transcriptional modification that influences mRNA expression and stability (Wu2022Identification). This protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to mRNA export and degradation pathways, which are crucial for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular function (Wu2022Identification). 

In the nucleus, ZC3H13 acts as a recruiter protein, promoting the localization of the m6A writer complex, which is essential for the methylation process (Wu2022Identification). This activity impacts cellular growth and differentiation by regulating the stability and translation of mRNAs. Although the specific functions of ZC3H13 in healthy cells are not fully understood, its involvement in these fundamental processes suggests a role in maintaining normal cellular homeostasis and function (Wu2022Identification). 

The protein's activity in RNA processing and its influence on gene expression highlight its importance in cell biology, potentially affecting organismal outcomes such as development and immune response regulation (Wu2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZC3H13 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA methylation and gene expression regulation. In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ZC3H13 is expressed at lower levels in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This reduced expression is associated with higher tumor grade and stage, indicating a poor prognosis. High ZC3H13 expression correlates with a non-inflamed tumor phenotype and a lower response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, suggesting its potential as a predictor of immune phenotype and therapeutic response in KIRC (Guo2021N6Methyladenosine).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZC3H13 acts as a tumor suppressor by inactivating the Ras-ERK signaling pathway. Lower expression of ZC3H13 is linked to advanced TNM stage and regional lymph node metastasis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhu2018ZC3H13).

In breast cancer, ZC3H13 is downregulated in more aggressive subtypes, such as ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancers. Its expression is associated with better prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor immune environment (Gong2020Analysis).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZC3H13 is frequently mutated and downregulated, correlating with poor overall and recurrence-free survival. It functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting migration and invasion of cancer cells, and its expression is associated with immune system components, indicating its involvement in immune regulation (Wu2022Identification).

## Interactions
ZC3H13 is a critical component of the m6A methylation machinery, interacting with several proteins to form a complex that regulates mRNA methylation. It is part of a biochemical complex with WTAP, Virilizer, and Hakai, which is essential for anchoring the m6A regulatory complex in the nucleus. The C-terminal domain of ZC3H13 is necessary and sufficient for these interactions, indicating its crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the complex (Wen2018Zc3h13).

ZC3H13 interacts with the mRNA-binding factor RBM15 and the m6A machinery component WTAP, stabilizing their interaction, which is vital for the proper functioning of the m6A pathway. This interaction is conserved across species, as demonstrated by experiments in both Drosophila and mouse embryonic stem cells (Knuckles2018Zc3h13Flacc).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, ZC3H13 is crucial for the nuclear localization of WTAP, Virilizer, and Hakai. Its depletion results in the mislocalization of these proteins to the cytoplasm, leading to a decrease in m6A methylation levels (Wen2018Zc3h13). These interactions highlight ZC3H13's role as an adaptor, bridging various components of the m6A methylation complex to ensure proper mRNA methylation and cellular function.
