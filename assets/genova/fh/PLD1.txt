# PLD1

## Overview
Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase D1, which is a critical component of cellular signaling pathways. This enzyme belongs to the phospholipase family and is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid and choline, playing a pivotal role in membrane dynamics and signal transduction (Du2003Regulation). The PLD1 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes conserved HKD motifs essential for its catalytic function, as well as pleckstrin homology (PH) and phox homology (PX) domains that facilitate membrane association and activation (Yao2021Structural; Bowling2021Structure). PLD1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking and exocytosis, and is regulated by interactions with small GTPases and other proteins (LISCOVITCH2000Phospholipase; Yamazaki1999Interaction). Clinically, mutations in the PLD1 gene have been associated with congenital heart defects and certain cancers, underscoring its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Nagumo2021PLD1; Lahrouchi2021Biallelic).

## Structure
Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains essential for its function. The protein contains two conserved HKD motifs, which are critical for its catalytic activity. These motifs form a beta sandwich core flanked by peripheral alpha helices, contributing to the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (Yao2021Structural; Bowling2021Structure). The C-terminal region of PLD1 includes unique structural elements such as beta hairpins and flexible loops that form the entrance to the active site tunnel, with a short alpha helix crucial for enzymatic activity (Bowling2021Structure).

PLD1 also features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a phox homology (PX) domain, which are involved in membrane association and enzyme activation. The PX domain binds various phosphoinositides, with PI(3,4,5)P3 having the highest affinity, while the PH domain, although lacking a canonical phosphoinositide binding motif, contains basic residues that may bind PI(4,5)P2 (Yao2021Structural; Bowling2021Structure). The PX/PH domain's role in PLD1 differs from PLD2, where its deletion can severely diminish activity (Yao2021Structural).

PLD1 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, such as PLD1a and PLD1b, which may differ in regulatory and functional properties (Yao2021Structural). The protein's structure is modifiable, with post-translational modifications like phosphorylation influencing its activity (Yao2021Structural).

## Function
Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. PA acts as a lipid signal that can activate enzymes like phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, which produces PI4,5P2, and may also serve as a lipid anchor for proteins involved in membrane trafficking (Du2003Regulation). PLD1 is involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, promoting the outward movement of secretory vesicles and the fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane during exocytosis (Du2003Regulation).

PLD1 is dynamically localized within cells, found in various cellular membranes, including the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane. It is particularly associated with the endosomal/lysosomal compartment (LISCOVITCH2000Phospholipase). In endothelial cells, PLD1 is specifically required for the regulated secretion of von Willebrand factor, a process crucial for thrombosis and hemostasis (Disse2009Phospholipase).

The enzyme's activity is regulated by interactions with small GTPases such as ARF1 and RhoA, and it is activated by factors like ADP-ribosylation factor and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (LISCOVITCH2000Phospholipase). PLD1's function involves regulated cycling through subcellular sites, mediated by interactions with various membrane components (Du2003Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLD1 gene are associated with several congenital and acquired conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in PLD1 have been linked to congenital right-sided cardiac valve defects and neonatal cardiomyopathy. These defects often involve abnormalities in the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, hypoplastic right ventricles, and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. Some patients with these mutations have been diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly or Uhl's anomaly (Lahrouchi2021Biallelic). A specific founder variant, p.I668F, has been identified among Ashkenazi Jews, which is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects in this population (Lahrouchi2021Biallelic).

In the context of cancer, PLD1 expression levels have been implicated in the progression of bladder cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In bladder cancer, higher PLD1 expression is correlated with worse overall survival and increased tumor invasion, as PLD1 promotes cellular invasion through the regulation of MMP-13 expression via NF-κB signaling (Nagumo2021PLD1). In AML, low PLD1 expression is associated with reduced overall survival and event-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Lu2020Expression). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PLD1 in both congenital heart defects and cancer.

## Interactions
Phospholipase D1 (PLD1) interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions is with protein kinase C alpha (PKCα), which binds to PLD1 and is crucial for its activation. The major PKCα binding sites on PLD1 are located within the N-terminal region, specifically between residues 1-49 and 256-275, while the PX domain is not involved in this interaction (Kook2005Identification). 

PLD1 also interacts with small GTPases such as RhoA, which binds to the C-terminal region of PLD1. This interaction is specific to the active form of RhoA and is essential for PLD1 activation (Yamazaki1999Interaction). 

Additionally, PLD1 binds to phosphocofilin, a phosphorylated form of cofilin, which activates PLD1 through interaction with residues 585-712, including the second catalytic HKD domain (Bowling2021Structure). 

The protein PED/PEA15 also interacts with PLD1, specifically binding to the C-terminal fragment, although this interaction does not directly modulate PLD1 activity but may stabilize its expression (Farina2013Molecular; Bowling2021Structure). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving PLD1 in cellular processes.
