# NDRG2

## Overview
NDRG2 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2) is a gene that encodes the NDRG family member 2 protein, which is part of the NDRG family characterized by an α/β-hydrolase fold. Unlike other members of this superfamily, NDRG2 is nonenzymatic due to the absence of a catalytic triad and a substrate-binding pocket. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response, and is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic β cells. NDRG2 plays a crucial role in protecting pancreatic β cells from lipotoxicity and is implicated in neural plasticity and neurodegenerative conditions. It interacts with several proteins, including MSP58, and is regulated by the Myc oncoprotein. Clinically, NDRG2 is often downregulated in various cancers, with its expression linked to tumor suppression and prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Tepel2008Frequent; Zhang2007The; Shen2010NDRG2; Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

## Structure
The NDRG2 protein is a member of the NDRG family and is characterized by its α/β-hydrolase fold, which is a common structural motif in the superfamily it belongs to (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). Despite this structural similarity, NDRG2 is considered a nonenzymatic member due to the absence of the classical catalytic triad and a substrate-binding pocket, which is occluded by helix α7 (Hwang2011Crystal). The protein consists of a large canonical α/β-hydrolase fold domain and a smaller cap-like domain, with the large domain comprising an eight-stranded β-sheet and eight α-helices, while the small domain contains five α-helices (Hwang2011Crystal).

NDRG2 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as Thr330, Ser332, and Thr348, which are crucial for its regulatory functions in cellular processes (Li2019Astrocytespecific). Additionally, NDRG2 can be SUMOylated at Lys 333, a modification that influences its stability and degradation (Li2019Astrocytespecific).

The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, with significant sequence identity among NDRG family members, particularly in the α/β-hydrolase domain, which is the most conserved region (Hwang2011Crystal). The NDRG2 gene encodes a protein of 371 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 40.7 kDa (Li2019Astrocytespecific).

## Function
NDRG2 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2) is a member of the NDRG gene family, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, and stress response. In healthy human cells, NDRG2 is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreatic β cells, indicating its involvement in the normal physiological functions of these tissues (Shen2010NDRG2; Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

NDRG2 is a substrate of protein kinase Akt, a key component of the insulin signaling pathway, and is involved in protecting pancreatic β cells against lipotoxicity by promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis (Shen2010NDRG2). This protective role is crucial under conditions of high free fatty acid levels, which can otherwise lead to β-cell apoptosis and reduced insulin secretion (Shen2010NDRG2).

In the nervous system, NDRG2 is expressed in astrocytes and is involved in inhibiting the proliferation of astrocytoma/glioblastoma cells, promoting neurite outgrowth, and is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role in neural plasticity and potentially in neurodegenerative conditions (yao2008ndrg2). NDRG2 also regulates vertebral specification during development, influencing vertebral identity and morphology through pathways such as Bmp/Smad signaling and Hox gene expression (Zhu2012Ndrg2).

## Clinical Significance
The NDRG2 gene is implicated in various cancers, with its expression often downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is frequently associated with promoter hypermethylation, a common mechanism for gene silencing in cancer. In glioblastoma, particularly primary glioblastomas, NDRG2 is often downregulated due to promoter hypermethylation, which is not commonly observed in lower-grade astrocytomas or secondary glioblastomas (Tepel2008Frequent). In gastric cancer, the loss of NDRG2 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic indicator (lt; italic&amp; :; gt; NDRG2&amp; Yao2008&amp). 

NDRG2 also plays a role in the regulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by interacting with PTEN. The loss of NDRG2 expression leads to increased phosphorylation of PTEN and AKT, promoting cell proliferation and tumor development in various cancers, including lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (Nakahata2014Loss). In colorectal cancer, NDRG2 expression is significantly reduced, with a trend of decreasing expression correlating with increasing Dukes' stage of cancer (Lorentzen2007Expression). These findings highlight NDRG2's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
NDRG2 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in cellular processes such as differentiation and stress response. One significant interaction is with MSP58, a 58-kDa microspherule protein, also known as MCRS1. This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed through glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays. The forkhead-associated domain of MSP58 is crucial for its interaction with NDRG2, and their co-localization in the nucleus of HeLa cells during cell stress suggests a role in cell cycle regulation (Zhang2007The).

NDRG2 is also a substrate for kinases such as AKT and SGK1, indicating that phosphorylation may influence its interaction with MSP58. Under certain conditions, such as treatment with NiCl2, NDRG2 translocates to the nucleus, which is necessary for its physical association with MSP58 in vivo (Zhang2007The).

Additionally, NDRG2 expression is regulated by the Myc oncoprotein, which represses NDRG2 through a Miz-1-dependent interaction with the NDRG2 core promoter. This repression involves the recruitment of epigenetic factors like histone deacetylases, although Myc does not directly alter histone acetylation at the NDRG2 promoter (Zhang2006The).
