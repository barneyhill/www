# USP31

## Overview
USP31 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 31, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in the regulation of protein ubiquitination. This enzyme is categorized as a deubiquitinase and plays a critical role in modulating various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific protein substrates. The USP31 protein exists in two isoforms, with the long isoform being particularly noted for its ability to cleave lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains preferentially (Tzimas2006Human). Functionally, USP31 is implicated in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for inflammatory responses and cell survival (PU2022The). Additionally, USP31 interacts with several key proteins, such as TRAF2 and IκBα, influencing pathways related to cancer progression and mitosis (Tzimas2006Human; Bertsoulaki2022The). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including intracerebral hemorrhage, cancer, and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (PU2022The; Lockhart2004Identification).

## Structure
The human ubiquitin specific peptidase 31 (USP31) gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with two identified isoforms: a long isoform consisting of 1035 amino acids and a short isoform with 485 amino acids. Both isoforms share a common amino terminal region of 483 amino acids, which shows significant similarity to known deubiquitinases, with 29% identity and 45% homology to a known S. pombe deubiquitinase (Tzimas2006Human). The long isoform contains a conserved ubiquitin hydrolase region, a DUSP domain, and a ubiquitin-like domain (Lockhart2004Identification). The short isoform, USP31S1, has an additional glycine and leucine residue at its carboxyl terminus (Tzimas2006Human).

USP31 is characterized by eight motifs typical of deubiquitinases, and its enzymatic activity is dependent on the presence of cysteine 98, as mutations at this site render the enzyme inactive (Tzimas2006Human). The protein is dynamically phosphorylated in a CDK1-dependent manner during mitosis, which affects its localization and function (Bertsoulaki2022The). The long isoform of USP31 is capable of cleaving lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains preferentially, with a lesser activity on lysine-48-linked chains (Tzimas2006Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the USP31 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), USP31 expression is downregulated, which correlates with increased cell apoptosis and inflammation. This downregulation is associated with the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, contributing to the pathological processes observed in ICH (PU2022The).

In cancer, USP31 has been linked to the regulation of the NF-κB pathway, which is often implicated in cancer progression. Its expression is altered in various cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Tzimas2006Human). Specifically, in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), USP31 interacts with the RUNX1 gene, affecting its stability and expression. This interaction is crucial for RUNX1's role in promoting cancer progression, highlighting USP31 as a potential drug target in COAD treatment (Tian2024RUNX1).

USP31 is also associated with Parkinson's disease, as it is located in a critical region linked to the disorder. Its involvement in the ubiquitin proteasomal system suggests a role in the disease's etiology, particularly in the context of impaired proteasomal function (Lockhart2004Identification).

## Interactions
USP31, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular pathways. One significant interaction is with TRAF2, a protein involved in NF-κB activation. USP31 binds to TRAF2 through the RING finger domain of TRAF2 and the amino terminal 483 residues of USP31. This interaction is specific and has been demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Tzimas2006Human). USP31 also interacts with IκBα, a protein that inhibits NF-κB. By decreasing the ubiquitination of IκBα, USP31 inhibits the NF-κB pathway, which is crucial in inflammatory responses (PU2022The).

In the context of colorectal adenocarcinoma, USP31 is associated with RUNX1, a transcription factor. This interaction stabilizes RUNX1 by deubiquitination, thereby regulating its transcriptional activity on target genes like CDC20 and MCM2, which are involved in cancer progression (Tian2024RUNX1). USP31 also plays a role in mitosis by interacting with components of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC), such as INCENP and Aurora B, affecting their stability and localization during cell division (Bertsoulaki2022The). These interactions highlight USP31's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes.
