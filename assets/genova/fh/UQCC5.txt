# UQCC5

## Overview
UQCC5 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 5, which plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. This protein is involved in the biogenesis of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex, also known as complex III, which is essential for the electron transport chain and ATP production in mitochondria. UQCC5 is categorized as an assembly factor, a type of protein that assists in the proper assembly and stabilization of protein complexes within the cell. The proper functioning of UQCC5 is vital for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and its dysfunction can lead to various mitochondrial disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
