# TCEA2

## Overview
TCEA2, or transcription elongation factor A2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription elongation and DNA repair processes. The protein, categorized as a transcription elongation factor, plays a pivotal role in assisting RNA polymerase II to navigate pause sites and transcription-arresting sites, thereby facilitating efficient transcription elongation. TCEA2 is also implicated in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly through its interactions with BRCA1, a protein crucial for managing transcription-associated DNA damage and R-loops. Additionally, TCEA2 is associated with the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The gene's involvement in these critical cellular processes highlights its significance in maintaining genomic integrity and proper cellular function (Hill2014Systematic; Pankaew2021Singlecell).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the TCEA2 gene can significantly impact gene regulation, potentially contributing to the development of various diseases, including cancer. TCEA2 is involved in the transcription process by aiding RNA polymerase II, and disruptions in its function can lead to aberrant transcriptional regulation. Such disruptions may affect cellular processes, leading to pathological conditions. Alterations in TCEA2 expression levels or its interactions with other molecular components can result in the misregulation of genes that are critical for maintaining normal cellular functions. This misregulation can contribute to oncogenesis by promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation or by inhibiting apoptosis, thereby facilitating tumor development and progression. The precise mechanisms by which TCEA2 mutations or expression changes lead to specific diseases are still under investigation, but its role in transcriptional elongation suggests that it is a crucial factor in maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function. Understanding the clinical significance of TCEA2 alterations could provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with its dysfunction.

## Interactions
TCEA2, also known as transcription elongation factor A2, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in transcription and DNA repair processes. TCEA2 is genetically associated with BRCA1, a protein involved in DNA damage response, particularly in managing transcription-associated DNA damage and R-loops. This interaction suggests that TCEA2 may participate in processes through which BRCA1 prevents or repairs DNA damage (Hill2014Systematic).

TCEA2 is also linked to the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Pankaew2021Singlecell). Although specific physical interactions of TCEA2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its association with transcription and DNA repair pathways highlights its functional importance in these processes (Pankaew2021Singlecell).

In transcription, TCEA2 assists RNA polymerase II in overcoming pause sites and transcription-arresting sites, contributing to transcription elongation and the response to DNA damage during transcription (Hill2014Systematic). These interactions underscore TCEA2's role in transcription regulation and DNA repair.
