# ST7

## Overview
The ST7 gene, also known as Suppression of Tumorigenicity 7, encodes a protein that is implicated in tumor suppression and cellular homeostasis. The ST7 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it plays a role in signal transduction and cell communication, contributing to the regulation of cell growth and prevention of tumorigenic transformations (CHARONG2019Identification). Although the precise molecular mechanisms of ST7 are not fully understood, it is considered a potential tumor suppressor due to its involvement in oncogenic pathways and interactions with other proteins that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis (Chêne2004Extensive). Despite its proposed tumor-suppressing functions, the expression levels of ST7 mRNA do not significantly differ between tumoral and normal tissues, suggesting that its activity may be context-dependent or modulated by additional regulatory factors (Chêne2004Extensive). The protein's interactions with complexes such as PRMT5 and BRD7 further underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and cancer development (Tae2011Bromodomain).

## Function
The ST7 gene, known as Suppression of Tumorigenicity 7, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and regulating cell proliferation. In healthy human cells, the ST7 protein is involved in cellular maintenance and is differentially expressed across various tissues, suggesting its importance in normal cellular functions (CHARONG2019Identification). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by participating in signal transduction and cell communication processes. These activities are essential for regulating cell growth and preventing tumorigenic transformations (CHARONG2019Identification).

Although the specific molecular mechanisms of ST7 in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its role in maintaining cellular integrity and structure is evident. The gene's involvement in oncogenic pathways and its potential interactions with other proteins suggest that it may help control cell proliferation and apoptosis, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (CHARONG2019Identification). Despite its proposed function as a tumor suppressor, studies have shown that ST7 mRNA levels are similar in tumoral and normal tissues, indicating that its tumor-suppressing activity might be context-dependent or influenced by other regulatory factors (Chêne2004Extensive).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the ST7 gene are associated with various cancers. Overexpression of PRMT5, which interacts with hSWI/SNF complexes, leads to the transcriptional repression of ST7, contributing to increased cell growth and transformation similar to MYC/RAS-transformed cells. This repression is linked to several cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, colon, head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, and renal cell carcinomas (Pal2004Human).

In pancreatic cancer, the E3 ubiquitin ligase MIB1 targets ST7 for proteasomal degradation, promoting cancer progression. This interaction is part of the MIB1/ST7/IQGAP1 axis, which is crucial for tumor growth, suggesting that inhibiting MIB1 could be a therapeutic strategy (Zhang2021MIB1).

In colitis-associated cancer (CAC), the CRL4 DCAF4 E3 ligase complex, activated by c-Myc overexpression due to inflammation, targets ST7 for degradation. This degradation is essential for CAC tumorigenesis, indicating that dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system involving ST7 plays a significant role in the disease (Liu2019Inflammation‐dependent).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of ST7 in cancer, where its altered expression or degradation contributes to tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

## Interactions
The ST7 gene encodes a protein involved in tumor suppression and participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. ST7 is a target of transcriptional repression mediated by the bromodomain protein 7 (BRD7), which interacts with the PRMT5 and PRC2 complexes. BRD7 co-localizes with PRMT5 and PRC2 on the promoters of ST7, leading to transcriptional repression through histone methylation marks such as H3R8, H4R3, and H3K27 (Tae2011Bromodomain). 

PRMT5 is also directly involved in the methylation of histone H3 at arginine 8 (H3R8) at the ST7 promoter, which inhibits H3K9 acetylation and contributes to the repression of ST7 expression (Pal2004Human). In the context of colitis-associated cancer, ST7 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the CRL4 DCAF4 E3 ligase complex, which is regulated by c-Myc. This interaction leads to the down-regulation of ST7, contributing to tumorigenesis (Liu2019Inflammation‐dependent). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving ST7 in tumor suppression and cancer development.
