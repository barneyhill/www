# TRPM7

## Overview
TRPM7 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7, a unique protein that functions as both an ion channel and a kinase, often referred to as a "chanzyme." This protein is integral to various physiological processes due to its dual functionality, which includes regulating the homeostasis of essential divalent cations such as magnesium (Mg²⁺) and calcium (Ca²⁺) (Meng2021Role). TRPM7 is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, underscoring its importance in cellular activities like proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Meng2021Role). Structurally, the protein features a combination of transmembrane domains and a kinase domain, allowing it to form a tetrameric complex that facilitates ion selectivity and signaling (Chubanov2018TRPM7). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as cytoskeletal proteins and CNNM family members, further highlight its role in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Bai2021CNNM; Middelbeek2016The). TRPM7's clinical significance is evident in its association with various diseases, including cardiovascular disorders and cancer, where its dysregulation can lead to pathological conditions (Köles2024The; Liu2023Cardiovascular).

## Structure
TRPM7 is a large protein consisting of 1863 amino acid residues in humans, featuring a unique structure that combines an ion channel with a protein kinase domain (Chubanov2018TRPM7). The primary structure includes a long N-terminus, six transmembrane helices (S1-S6), a pore helix, and a pore loop, which contribute to the formation of a tetrameric complex. This complex is crucial for ion selectivity, as the pore loops of the four subunits form a common ion selectivity filter (Chubanov2018TRPM7).

The secondary structure of TRPM7 involves alpha helices and beta sheets, which are typical of ion channels. The tertiary structure is characterized by a complex folding pattern that allows the protein to form a channel through the cell membrane. The quaternary structure involves interactions between the subunits, facilitated by the N-terminal ankyrin repeats and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, which aid in tetrameric assembly (Chubanov2018TRPM7).

TRPM7 contains specific domains such as the TRP domain and an α-type kinase domain, which are involved in its regulatory functions. Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, play a role in regulating TRPM7's activity (Chubanov2018TRPM7). The protein is permeable to divalent cations like Ca2+ and Mg2+, with its cation selectivity influenced by specific residues in the pore-forming loop (Chubanov2018TRPM7).

## Function
TRPM7 is a unique protein that functions as both an ion channel and a kinase, often referred to as a "chanzyme." It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, indicating its essential role in various physiological processes (Meng2021Role). TRPM7 is crucial for maintaining magnesium (Mg²⁺) and calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis, which are vital for cellular functions such as proliferation, viability, migration, adhesion, and apoptosis (Jimenez2020TRPM; Meng2021Role). The channel is permeable to divalent cations, with a preference for Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺, and its activity is regulated by intracellular Mg²⁺ and Mg·ATP levels (Nadler2001LTRPC7).

TRPM7 plays a significant role in cellular magnesium homeostasis, acting as both a magnesium uptake mechanism and a sensor for magnesium status in cells (Schlingmann2007TRPM6). It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, proliferation, differentiation, and Ca²⁺ signaling events (Chubanov2020Mapping). The kinase domain of TRPM7 influences cytoskeletal dynamics, gene expression, and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which is essential for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ concentrations (Meng2021Role). TRPM7's function is integral to embryonic development, immune responses, and the organismal balance of Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Ca²⁺ (Chubanov2020Mapping).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TRPM7 gene are linked to various diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular health, TRPM7 is implicated in cardiac fibrosis, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Its deficiency can exacerbate hypertension and related cardiac issues, while its inhibition has been shown to reduce hypertension induced by leptin (Liu2023Cardiovascular). TRPM7 is also associated with ischemic heart disease, where increased expression is noted in patients (Liu2023Cardiovascular). In cancer, TRPM7 is overexpressed in several types, including breast, ovarian, and gastric cancers, where it influences tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis (Köles2024The). In breast cancer, TRPM7 is linked to increased proliferation and migration, partly through its kinase domain and calcium signaling pathways (Köles2024The). In unexplained stillbirths, genetic variants in TRPM7 have been identified, potentially affecting ion channel function and leading to fatal arrhythmias in utero (Cartwright2019Genetic). TRPM7's role in Mg2+ and Ca2+ homeostasis is crucial, and its dysregulation can lead to pathological conditions, including cardiac fibrosis and cancer progression (Hu2020Role).

## Interactions
TRPM7 is a channel-kinase protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, forming complex networks that influence cellular functions. It is known to interact with a large number of proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, including conventional myosin II, non-conventional myosins, and proteins regulating actin dynamics such as components of the Arp2/3 complex, F-actin capping proteins, drebrin, tropomyosins, tropomodulin, gelsolin, and cofilin. These interactions are crucial for cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion, particularly in the context of neuroblastoma progression (Middelbeek2016The).

TRPM7 also forms complexes with CNNM proteins (CNNM1-4) and ARL15, which are involved in divalent cation transport. These interactions are significant for the regulation of TRPM7 channel activity, influencing the influx of ions such as Mg2+ and Zn2+ into cells. CNNM proteins can act as regulatory subunits, modulating TRPM7 activity and forming complexes that facilitate divalent cation entry (Bai2021CNNM).

Additionally, TRPM7 interacts with proteins from the Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver (PRL) family, which may further modulate its function in cation transport (Kollewe2021The). These interactions highlight TRPM7's role in cellular signaling and homeostasis.
