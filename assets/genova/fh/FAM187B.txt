# FAM187B

## Overview
FAM187B is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as family with sequence similarity 187 member B. This protein is implicated in several biological processes, particularly in reproductive biology, where it is suggested to play a role in sperm development and function. The protein is localized in the cytoplasmic region of elongating spermatids, indicating its potential involvement in spermiogenesis. Beyond its reproductive functions, FAM187B has been studied in the context of immune recognition and various health conditions, including non-obstructive azoospermia and melanoma metastasis. Despite these associations, the precise molecular functions and clinical significance of FAM187B remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its roles in human health and disease (Vandenbrouck2016Looking; Barbai2015The; Zhong2022Integrative).

## Function
FAM187B is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein, which is suggested to play a role in sperm development and function. Immunohistochemistry staining has localized FAM187B in the cytoplasmic region of elongating spermatids, indicating a potential involvement in cytoplasm displacement and elimination during spermiogenesis. This suggests that FAM187B may be crucial in the processes related to sperm maturation and fertility (Vandenbrouck2016Looking).

The expression of FAM187B mRNA in sperm has been proposed as a diagnostic indicator of sperm survival, fertility, and the capacity to promote early embryogenesis, highlighting its potential significance in reproductive biology (Vandenbrouck2016Looking). Despite these insights, the exact molecular functions of FAM187B in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

In addition to its role in spermatogenesis, FAM187B has been identified in studies related to non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), suggesting its involvement in the biological processes associated with this condition (Zhong2022Integrative). However, specific details about its molecular activities and interactions in healthy cells are not well-documented in the current literature.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the FAM187B gene is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), FAM187B was identified among genes with strong biological function similarities in a protein-protein interaction analysis, suggesting a potential role in this form of male infertility (Zhong2022Integrative). However, specific clinical outcomes related to FAM187B in NOA are not detailed.

In studies on diabetic cognitive impairment, FAM187B was identified as a candidate gene with altered expression in the hippocampi of db/db mice treated with 2-Dodecyl-6-methoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione (DMDD), a compound with potential therapeutic effects. Despite its identification, the expression of FAM187B was too low to be reliably detected, indicating limited information on its clinical significance in this context (Wang20212Dodecyl6Methoxycyclohexa2).

FAM187B has also been mentioned in the context of melanoma metastasis, where it was one of the genes showing significant expression differences between metastatic and non-metastatic models. However, the study primarily focused on other genes, leaving the specific role of FAM187B in metastasis unclear (Barbai2015The). Overall, while FAM187B is associated with various conditions, its precise clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
FAM187B is a protein that has been studied in the context of its potential interactions with other proteins, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In one study, FAM187B was expressed as a full-length protein fused with a C-terminal HA tag for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This involved expressing the protein in HEK293 cells and co-transfecting it with other proteins tagged with a FLAG tag to study their interactions. The resulting protein complexes were analyzed by western blotting, but the study did not provide specific details about the physical interactions of FAM187B with other proteins or nucleic acids (Verschueren2020The).

Another study identified FAM187B as a potential binding partner for BTN2A1, a member of the butyrophilin family, in the context of immune recognition by γδ T cells. However, the study did not elaborate on the specific nature of the interaction between FAM187B and BTN2A1 (Uldrich2020Immune).

Overall, while FAM187B has been implicated in potential protein interactions, detailed information about its specific binding partners and the nature of these interactions remains sparse.
