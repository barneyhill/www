# C8orf48

## Overview
C8orf48 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 48. This protein is currently uncharacterized in terms of its specific biological functions and interactions, but it is implicated in cancer-associated signaling pathways, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene is thought to act as a tumor suppressor, as its expression is significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression in CRC cells has been shown to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion (Lei2021C8orf48). C8orf48 interacts with several oncoproteins and is involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Lei2021C8orf48; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the protein's role and interactions within cellular processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C8orf48 has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. The gene's expression is inversely correlated with its methylation level, indicating that hypermethylation may suppress its expression and contribute to CRC development (Lei2021C8orf48). Overexpression of C8orf48 in CRC cells has been shown to decrease proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its inhibition promotes these processes, highlighting its potential as a tumor suppressor (Lei2021C8orf48).

C8orf48 also interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial in cancer progression. High expression of C8orf48 increases sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors, suggesting therapeutic implications (Lei2021C8orf48). The gene is targeted by the oncogenic microRNA miR-556, which reduces its expression and promotes CRC cell proliferation and migration (Lei2021C8orf48).

In addition to its role in CRC, C8orf48 is associated with proteins involved in cancer biology, such as CCNE1, FGFR3, HRAS, and TSC1, indicating its involvement in cancer-related pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These findings suggest that C8orf48 could serve as a biomarker for early CRC detection and a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
C8orf48 is a protein encoded by the C8orf48 gene, located on chromosome 8. The protein's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented. However, it is noted for its involvement in cancer-associated signaling pathways through its subinteractome. C8orf48 interacts with several oncoproteins, including CCNE1, FGFR3, HRAS, and TSC1, suggesting a potential role in cancer-related signaling pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions indicate that C8orf48 may influence biological processes in colorectal cancer cells, where its overexpression has been associated with reduced cell invasion and proliferation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite these findings, the specific physical interactions of C8orf48 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely uncharacterized. The study emphasizes the need for further research to clarify these interactions and the protein's exact functions within cellular processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The potential involvement of C8orf48 in cancer signaling pathways highlights its importance as a subject for future studies aimed at understanding its role in disease mechanisms and exploring its potential as a target for pharmacological interventions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
