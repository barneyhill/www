# INHA

## Overview
The INHA gene encodes the inhibin alpha subunit, a critical component of the inhibin protein complex, which belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) superfamily. The inhibin alpha subunit is a glycoprotein that forms a heterodimer with a beta subunit to create inhibin A or B, which are key regulators of reproductive physiology. These proteins primarily function to inhibit the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, thereby playing a vital role in the regulation of gametogenesis and steroidogenesis (Corre2009A; Depoix2017HIF1A). The inhibin alpha subunit is expressed in various tissues, including the gonads, placenta, and adrenal cortex, and is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation control and tumor suppression (Hofland2014Inhibin; AndreuVieyra2007Effects). The gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q33-q36) and is highly conserved across species, underscoring its biological importance (Makanji2014Inhibin).

## Structure
The INHA gene encodes the inhibin α-subunit, a component of the inhibin heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones within the TGFβ superfamily. The human α-subunit precursor consists of 366 amino acids, including an 18-amino acid signal peptide, a 43-amino acid proregion, a 171-amino acid N-terminus (αN) region, and a 134-amino acid C-terminus (αC) mature region (Antenos2007NLinked). The mature α-subunit features seven conserved cysteine residues that form a cysteine knot motif, essential for the protein's three-dimensional structure and dimerization (Ahmad2018Molecular).

The α-subunit contains three N-linked glycosylation sites: one in the pro-αN region (Asn 146) and two in the mature αC region (Asn 268, Asn 302). These glycosylation sites are crucial for the assembly and secretion of inhibin A (Antenos2007NLinked). Glycosylation influences the stability and secretion of the protein, with specific glycan positioning affecting dimer formation (Antenos2007NLinked).

Inhibin is a heterodimer composed of an α-subunit and a β-subunit, linked by disulfide bridges, which are necessary for protein stability and folding (Makanji2014Inhibin). The α-subunit gene is located on chromosome 2 (2q33-q36) and is highly conserved (Makanji2014Inhibin).

## Function
The INHA gene encodes the inhibin alpha subunit, which is a crucial component of the inhibin protein complex. Inhibins, primarily inhibin A and B, are glycoproteins that play a significant role in the negative feedback regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production by the pituitary gland. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal reproductive function, as it influences gametogenesis and steroidogenesis (Corre2009A; Depoix2017HIF1A).

In healthy human cells, the inhibin alpha subunit is expressed in the gonads, placenta, and adrenal cortex. In the gonads, inhibins are involved in controlling the proliferation of granulosa cells in the ovary, thereby preventing excessive cell proliferation and tumor formation (AndreuVieyra2007Effects). In the placenta, inhibin A is produced by syncytiotrophoblasts, with its expression increasing throughout gestation. This production is regulated by transcription factors such as HIF1A and EPAS1, particularly under hypoxic conditions, which are typical during early placental development (Depoix2017HIF1A).

The inhibin alpha subunit also has a tumor suppressive role in gonadal tissue and potentially in the adrenal cortex, although its function in human adrenocortical carcinoma remains unclear due to conflicting evidence regarding its expression levels (Hofland2014Inhibin).

## Clinical Significance
The INHA gene, encoding the inhibin alpha-subunit, has been implicated in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare and aggressive tumor. Inhibin alpha-subunit knockout mice develop ACCs after gonadectomy, suggesting a tumor suppressive role for INHA. In humans, INHA expression varies in ACC tissues, and its circulating peptide, inhibin pro-aC, is considered a novel tumor marker for ACC. Genetic analysis of ACC samples has revealed novel heterozygous variants, including missense variants, which are associated with decreased INHA mRNA levels. Aberrant methylation of the INHA promoter has also been observed, correlating inversely with INHA mRNA levels, indicating that both genetic and epigenetic alterations in the INHA gene are linked to decreased expression in ACC (Hofland2014Inhibin).

Despite these findings, the study concludes that INHA mutations are unlikely to play a significant role in ACC formation in humans due to their low incidence. Serum inhibin pro-aC levels do not correlate with INHA expression or tumor characteristics, suggesting other factors may influence these levels (Hofland2014Inhibin). The variability in serum inhibin pro-aC levels could aid in differentiating between malignant and benign tumors and in patient follow-up (Hofland2014Inhibin).
