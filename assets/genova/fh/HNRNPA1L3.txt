# HNRNPA1L3

## Overview
HNRNPA1L3 is a gene that encodes the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 like 3, which is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family. These proteins are primarily involved in the processing and transport of pre-mRNA in the nucleus. The hnRNP A1 like 3 protein plays a crucial role in RNA binding and is implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, stability, and transport. It is also involved in the regulation of gene expression and may participate in cellular stress responses. The protein's function and interactions are significant for understanding its role in cellular processes and potential implications in disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
