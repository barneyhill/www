# HPGD

## Overview
The HPGD gene encodes the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme is pivotal in the catabolism of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), by catalyzing the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group to form inactive 15-keto products. The regulation of prostaglandin levels by 15-PGDH is essential for maintaining physiological processes such as inflammation control and gastrointestinal integrity (Backlund200515Hydroxyprostaglandin; Frank2010Association). Structurally, 15-PGDH is characterized by a homodimeric formation with a central beta-sheet flanked by alpha-helices, a configuration known as the Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Niesen2010HighAffinity). The enzyme's role extends to acting as a tumor suppressor, particularly in colorectal cancer, by counteracting the effects of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and maintaining inflammation homeostasis (Myung200615Hydroxyprostaglandin; Edwards2012A). Mutations in the HPGD gene are linked to disorders such as primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and cranio-osteoarthropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Pang2019The; Seifert2009HPGD).

## Structure
The 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) protein, encoded by the HPGD gene, is characterized by a homodimeric structure, with each subunit having a molecular weight of approximately 29 kDa (Niesen2010HighAffinity). The protein belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and exhibits an alpha/beta folding pattern typical of SDRs, featuring a central beta-sheet flanked by arrays of alpha-helices, known as the Rossmann fold (Niesen2010HighAffinity). This structural motif is crucial for nucleotide binding and is a common feature among oxidoreductases (Kavanagh2008Medium).

The tertiary structure of 15-PGDH includes a catalytic tetrad composed of Asn107, Ser138, Tyr151, and Lys155, which is essential for the hydride transfer mechanism conserved among SDRs (Niesen2010HighAffinity). The quaternary structure involves the interaction between the artificial C-terminus of one protomer and the opposing protomer, with specific interactions noted between residues such as Phe264 and Tyr217 (Niesen2010HighAffinity).

The enzyme's active site is involved in binding NAD+ and is crucial for its catalytic activity. The nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ is positioned near the catalytic tetrad, facilitating the enzyme's function (Niesen2010HighAffinity). The enzyme's structure and interactions make it a significant target for inhibitor design, with implications for therapeutic applications (Niesen2010HighAffinity).

## Function
The HPGD gene encodes the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In healthy human cells, 15-PGDH catalyzes the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of prostanoids, converting them into inactive 15-keto products. This process is essential for maintaining balanced prostaglandin levels, which are important for various physiological functions, including inflammation regulation and maintaining gastrointestinal integrity (Backlund200515Hydroxyprostaglandin; Frank2010Association).

15-PGDH is highly expressed in normal colon mucosa and acts as a physiological antagonist to the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of PGE2. The balance between COX-2 biosynthesis and 15-PGDH-dependent degradation is crucial for regulating the steady-state levels of PGE2 in the extracellular microenvironment (Pereira2014Genetic). By degrading prostaglandins, 15-PGDH reduces their inflammatory activity, thus playing a significant role in maintaining inflammation homeostasis (Edwards2012A).

The enzyme's activity is not only vital for normal cellular processes but also acts as a tumor suppressor by preventing the progression of colonic epithelial cells to dysplasia and tumors (Myung200615Hydroxyprostaglandin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPGD gene, which encodes the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, are associated with primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO), a rare genetic disorder. PHO is characterized by symptoms such as digital clubbing, periostosis, pachydermia, and joint swelling. These symptoms arise due to elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) resulting from the loss of 15-PGDH function, which is crucial for PGE2 degradation (Pang2019The; Lu2022Clinical). The c.310_311delCT frameshift mutation is a common mutation in Asian populations, leading to a truncated protein that lacks essential residues for catalytic activity (Lu2022Clinical).

HPGD mutations have also been linked to cranio-osteoarthropathy (COA), a condition characterized by delayed closure of cranial sutures and fontanels, digital clubbing, and periostosis (Seifert2009HPGD). Additionally, alterations in HPGD expression levels have been implicated in colorectal cancer. The enzyme acts as a tumor suppressor by degrading PGE2, and its reduced expression is associated with increased cancer risk (Fink2014Aspirin; Myung200615Hydroxyprostaglandin). Genetic polymorphisms in the HPGD gene have been linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer, suggesting a protective role against tumorigenesis (Pereira2014Genetic).
