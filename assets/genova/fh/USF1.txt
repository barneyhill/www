# USF1

## Overview
USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family. The USF1 protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by binding to E-box sequences in DNA, thereby influencing various biological processes such as lipid and glucose metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and chromatin structure maintenance. It functions as a homodimer or heterodimer, often partnering with USF2, to modulate transcriptional activity. USF1 is also involved in chromatin remodeling by interacting with histone modification complexes, which helps maintain active chromatin states and prevent heterochromatin spread. Clinically, alterations in USF1 have been linked to metabolic disorders, including familial combined hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, as well as playing a role in gastric carcinogenesis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection (Costa2019USF1; Corre2009Target; Huang2007USF1).

## Structure
The USF1 protein is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family of transcription factors. It contains a DNA-binding domain characterized by a basic region, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA, and a leucine zipper motif that facilitates dimerization. The bHLH-LZ domain of USF1 is approximately 90 amino acids long and is known for its modular structure, allowing it to retain DNA-binding function independently of other domains (Henrion1996Mouse; Popa2019The).

USF1 can form homodimers or heterodimers, often with USF2, to bind DNA at E-box sequences. The protein's structure includes two amphipathic alpha-helices connected by a loop, which is important for protein-protein interactions and DNA-binding specificity. The loop in USF1 is longer than in similar proteins, allowing for additional DNA contacts, which influences its binding preference (Henrion1996Mouse; Popa2019The).

USF1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and stability. The gene is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions (Wu2013Molecular; Gregor1990The).

## Function
USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family and binds to E-box regulatory elements (CANNTG) to modulate a wide array of gene networks. USF1 is involved in various cellular processes, including lipid and glucose metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and cell proliferation (Corre2009Target; Huang2007USF1).

In the context of chromatin structure, USF1 maintains chromatin barrier function by recruiting histone modification complexes. It interacts with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) to facilitate histone modifications that prevent the spread of repressive chromatin into active regions, thereby protecting against heterochromatic silencing (Huang2007USF1).

USF1 also plays a role in the pigmentation process, particularly in response to UV irradiation. Upon UV exposure, USF1 is phosphorylated, leading to the activation of genes involved in the pigmentation signaling pathway (Corre2009Target). Additionally, USF1 is involved in energy metabolism, regulating genes associated with energy production and ATP biosynthesis (RadaIglesias2008Wholegenome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USF1 gene have been implicated in several metabolic disorders. USF1 is associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), a common genetic dyslipidemia linked to premature coronary heart disease. Variants in USF1, particularly intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may serve as transcriptional regulatory elements affecting the expression of USF1-regulated genes, contributing to FCHL (Naukkarinen2005USF1). A novel mutation in exon 8 of the USF1 gene, resulting in a tryptophan to arginine substitution at position 196 (p. Arg196Trp), has been linked to FCHL in affected family members (Taghizadeh2019A).

USF1 gene variants also influence lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis development, particularly in women. Specific polymorphisms, such as rs2516839, are associated with changes in lipoprotein metabolism and carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis (Fan2014Upstream). Additionally, USF1 expression is significantly lower in atherosclerotic plaques compared to non-atherosclerotic tissues (Fan2014Upstream).

In the context of Helicobacter pylori infection, USF1 plays a role in gastric carcinogenesis. The infection induces DNA hypermethylation in the promoter regions of USF1, inhibiting its expression and contributing to gastric preneoplasia. Low expression levels of USF1 are associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients (Costa2019USF1).

## Interactions
USF1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various multiprotein complexes that influence chromatin structure and gene expression. It interacts with PRMT1, a histone methyltransferase, both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is crucial for recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to nucleosomes surrounding insulators, maintaining an active chromatin environment (Huang2007USF1). USF1 also forms complexes with histone acetyltransferases such as p300 and PCAF, which are involved in chromatin modification (Huang2007USF1).

USF1 interacts with TFII-I, a protein that enhances its function through E-box and Inr elements. This interaction is necessary for transcriptional synergy, requiring both the dimerization and activation domains of USF1 (Roy1997Cloning). In pancreatic β-cells, USF1 interacts with PDX-1, a transcription factor involved in insulin regulation. This interaction is modulated by protein kinase CK2, which phosphorylates USF1, affecting its binding to the PDX-1 promoter and its transrepression activity (Spohrer2017Functional).

USF1 also forms heterodimers with USF2, another transcription factor, and this interaction is influenced by CK2-mediated phosphorylation (Lupp2014The).
