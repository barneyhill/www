# SKOR1

## Overview
The SKOR1 gene encodes the SKI family transcriptional corepressor 1, a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS). As a transcriptional corepressor, SKOR1 is involved in modulating various neurodevelopmental processes and maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing pathways related to axon guidance, glial cell development, and ferroptosis (Sarayloo2020SKOR1). The protein is notably expressed in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemispheres, where it acts as a corepressor of the Lbx1 transcription factor, impacting the differentiation of interneurons in the spinal cord (Catoire2018A). Beyond its role in the CNS, SKOR1 is implicated in cancer biology, particularly in breast cancer, where it interacts with signaling pathways such as TGFβ/BMP, influencing tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Sluimer2022SKOR1). Additionally, SKOR1's interaction with the transcription factor MEIS1 and its regulation by microRNAs highlight its involvement in conditions like Restless Legs Syndrome and immune responses (Ma2023NKderived; Catoire2018A).

## Function
The SKOR1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor, primarily involved in regulating gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS). It is highly expressed in the CNS, particularly in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemispheres, and plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental processes (Sarayloo2020SKOR1). SKOR1 acts as a corepressor of the Lbx1 transcription factor, influencing the cell fate of interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which is important for generating the GABAergic phenotype and may affect pain and sensory processing (Catoire2018A).

In healthy human cells, SKOR1 is involved in the repression of genes associated with neurodevelopmental pathways, such as axon guidance and glial cell development, and the activation of genes involved in ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death linked to iron metabolism and oxidative stress (Sarayloo2020SKOR1). This regulatory activity suggests that SKOR1 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and may play a role in pathways related to iron metabolism, which is significant given the association of brain iron dysregulation with certain neurological conditions (Sarayloo2020SKOR1).

## Clinical Significance
The SKOR1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily restless legs syndrome (RLS) and certain types of cancer. In the context of RLS, SKOR1 is associated with the regulation of genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes and iron metabolism, both of which are relevant to the pathogenesis of the disorder. Alterations in SKOR1 expression, influenced by its interaction with the MEIS1 gene, have been linked to RLS. Specifically, a risk haplotype within the MEIS1 gene is associated with decreased expression of both MEIS1 and SKOR1, suggesting that SKOR1 plays a role in the development of RLS through its transcriptional regulatory functions (Sarayloo2020SKOR1; Catoire2018A).

In cancer, SKOR1 has been studied for its role in breast cancer progression. It is involved in tumor cell proliferation and invasion, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer. SKOR1 mediates FER kinase-dependent invasive growth, and its phosphorylation at tyrosine 234 is crucial for promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Mutations at this site can affect SKOR1's ability to regulate signaling pathways, such as BMP/TGFβ, which are important in cancer cell dynamics (Sluimer2022SKOR1). These findings suggest that SKOR1 may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis in certain cancer types.

## Interactions
SKOR1, a transcriptional corepressor, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It is a direct substrate of the FER kinase, which phosphorylates SKOR1 at tyrosine 234 (Y234). This phosphorylation is crucial for SKOR1's function in promoting breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The interaction between SKOR1 and FER kinase is significant for the regulation of TGFβ/BMP signaling pathways, as it affects SKOR1's binding to Smad3, a component of the TGFβ signaling pathway. This binding influences the expression of Smad3 effectors, such as PAI-1, which are linked to tumor progression (Sluimer2022SKOR1).

SKOR1 also interacts with the transcription factor MEIS1, which regulates SKOR1 expression by binding to its promoter region. This interaction is relevant in the context of Restless Legs Syndrome, where a single nucleotide polymorphism in the SKOR1 promoter affects MEIS1 binding and subsequently SKOR1 expression (Catoire2018A).

Additionally, SKOR1 is targeted by miR-1249-3p, a microRNA enriched in NK-cell-derived exosomes. This interaction plays a role in inhibiting Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in macrophages by promoting apoptosis and reducing inflammation (Ma2023NKderived; Ma2024NKderived).
