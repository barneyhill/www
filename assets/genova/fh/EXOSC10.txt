# EXOSC10

## Overview
EXOSC10 is a gene that encodes the exosome component 10 protein, a critical part of the RNA exosome complex involved in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The protein is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, characterized by its catalytic activity and RNA-binding capabilities, and is classified as a DEDD-Y enzyme due to its unique active site configuration. EXOSC10 is essential for ribosome biogenesis, DNA repair, and the maintenance of genomic stability, playing a significant role in the processing of precursor rRNA and the turnover of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (Stuparević2021Regulation; Chen2023The). The protein's function is regulated by various post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which are crucial for its interactions and stability (Chen2023The). EXOSC10's involvement in DNA repair, particularly in the homologous recombination pathway, underscores its importance in cellular processes beyond RNA metabolism (DomingoPrim2019EXOSC10). The gene's dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including autoimmune disorders and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Stuparević2021Regulation).

## Structure
EXOSC10, also known as Rrp6 in yeast, is a conserved 3'-5' exoribonuclease that is a catalytic and RNA-binding subunit of the nuclear RNA exosome. The protein structure is highly conserved across species, including yeast and humans, and contains several functional domains. These include the polycystin 2 N-terminal (PMC2NT) domain, the exoribonuclease (EXO) domain, and the regulatory helicase and RNase D carboxy terminal (HRDC) domain. The EXO domain features a DEDD active site, crucial for enzymatic activity, and is classified as a DEDD-Y enzyme due to an additional tyrosine residue that stabilizes the transition state. The HRDC domain regulates the activity of the EXO domain (Stuparević2021Regulation).

The C-terminal domain of EXOSC10, known as the exosome associating region (EAR) domain, interacts with the RNA exosome. The C-terminal tail, termed Lasso, is highly basic and unstructured, binds RNA, activates the exosome, and contains a nuclear localization signal (Stuparević2021Regulation; Chen2023The). EXOSC10 undergoes extensive post-translational modifications, including methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation, which are crucial for its interactions and stability (Stuparević2021Regulation). The protein has three known isoforms with varying amino acid lengths and expression levels across different tissues (Stuparević2021Regulation).

## Function
EXOSC10, also known as exosome component 10, is a crucial part of the RNA exosome complex, which is involved in the processing and degradation of various RNA species in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, EXOSC10 plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis by processing precursor rRNA, including the 5'-external transcribed spacer (ETS) and internal transcribed spacers (ITS), and in the turnover of mature small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) (Chen2023The). It is primarily localized in the nucleolus during interphase, where it is involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, ensuring efficient protein translation and cell growth (Stuparević2021Regulation).

EXOSC10 is also involved in DNA repair, particularly in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It facilitates the assembly of replication protein A (RPA) and the controlled resection of DNA ends, which are essential for proper DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (DomingoPrim2019EXOSC10). The protein's activity in RNA clearance is crucial for the recruitment of RAD51 to DSBs, a key step in HR (DomingoPrim2019EXOSC10). EXOSC10's function is regulated by post-translational modifications, including SUMOylation, which is essential for its role in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Chen2023The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EXOSC10 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. EXOSC10 is implicated in autoimmune disorders, particularly polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndrome, where antibodies against EXOSC10 are produced, affecting skeletal muscle and skin (Stuparević2021Regulation). In cancer, EXOSC10 plays a role in DNA repair and is linked to resistance against DNA-damage-inducing chemotherapeutic agents like 5-fluorouracil. It serves as a prognostic marker for liver and thyroid cancers and exhibits tumor-suppressive potential in bladder urothelial carcinoma (Stuparević2021Regulation). Altered expression of EXOSC10 is observed in various cancers, with increased levels in several types, including bladder, liver, and lung cancers, while decreased expression is noted in renal cancer (Stuparević2021Regulation). The gene is also associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, due to its role in degrading pathogenic repeat RNA and maintaining telomeres (Stuparević2021Regulation). Mutations or dysregulation of EXOSC10 can disrupt RNA metabolism, contributing to disease pathogenesis, and its interactions and stability are influenced by post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function in cell division and differentiation (Stuparević2021Regulation).

## Interactions
EXOSC10, a component of the RNA exosome complex, is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in RNA processing and degradation. It interacts with the exosome cofactor C1D, providing a scaffold for interaction with RNA helicase MTR4 and exosome cofactor MPP6, which facilitate RNA degradation (Filippopoulou2024Hypoxiadriven). EXOSC10 also interacts with USP36, a ubiquitin-specific protease that acts as an E3 SUMO ligase, promoting the SUMOylation of EXOSC10 at lysine 583. This modification is essential for EXOSC10's role in pre-rRNA processing and its binding to rRNA precursors (Chen2023The).

EXOSC10 is necessary for DNA double-strand break repair, where it aids in RNA clearance at damage sites, facilitating the recruitment of replication protein A (RPA) and interacting with RAD51, a key protein in homologous recombination (DomingoPrim2019EXOSC10). The protein also forms a complex with Rrp47, which is crucial for the stability of both proteins (Stuparević2021Regulation). These interactions highlight EXOSC10's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and DNA repair processes.
