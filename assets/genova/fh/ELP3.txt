# ELP3

## Overview
The ELP3 gene encodes the elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 3, a catalytic component of the Elongator complex, which is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation, histone acetylation, and tRNA modification. The ELP3 protein is characterized by its radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) domain and lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain, which facilitate its enzymatic activities. As a histone acetyltransferase, ELP3 plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation by acetylating histones H3 and H4. Additionally, it is involved in tRNA methylation, impacting protein synthesis and cell cycle progression. ELP3's interactions within the Elongator complex and with other proteins, such as PCNA, underscore its significance in DNA replication, repair, and synaptic function. Clinically, ELP3 has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), due to its role in motor neuron function and axonal integrity (Simpson2008Variants; Nguyen2010Elongator).

## Structure
The ELP3 protein is a catalytic subunit of the elongator complex, involved in transcriptional elongation and tRNA modification. It contains two main domains: a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) domain and a lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domain. The SAM domain includes an iron-sulfur [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is crucial for its function in tRNA methylation (Boutoual2022A; Lin2019The). The KAT domain is similar to GCN5-like acetyltransferases and is essential for the protein's enzymatic activity, specifically recognizing and responding to tRNA substrates (Boutoual2022A; Lin2019The).

The ELP3 protein's structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its tertiary structure. It can undergo post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation (Lin2019The). The protein forms part of a larger complex, the Elongator, which consists of two copies of six subunits (Elp1-6), with ELP3 acting as the catalytic subunit (Lin2019The). A novel splice variant, mt-ELP3, localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and is involved in mitochondrial tRNA modification, enhancing mitochondrial translation and expression of OXPHOS complexes (Boutoual2022A).

## Function
The ELP3 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the Elongator complex, which plays a significant role in transcriptional elongation, histone acetylation, and tRNA modification. ELP3 is involved in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4, which is crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. This acetylation activity is linked to its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, homologous to the GCN5 HAT domain, and is essential for maintaining nucleosomal DNA length and influencing nucleosome positioning in gene promoters (Simpson2008Variants; Matsumoto2011Comparative).

ELP3 also contains a radical S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) binding domain, which is involved in tRNA methylation, affecting the formation of specific modified uridines in tRNAs. This modification is crucial for protein synthesis and translational efficiency, impacting cell cycle progression and pluripotency gene expression in embryonic stem cells (Yoo2016Indispensable).

In the context of cellular stress response, ELP3 regulates the expression of heat shock proteins, such as HSP70, by acetylating histones, which helps cells respond to stress and may provide protection against stressors in motor neurons (Simpson2008Variants). ELP3's functions are vital for normal motor neuron function and axonal integrity, with its dysfunction potentially contributing to neurodegenerative conditions (Simpson2008Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Variants of the ELP3 gene have been associated with motor neuron degeneration, particularly in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive motor neuron disease that leads to death from respiratory failure within a few years. The genetic causes of ALS are largely unknown, but ELP3 has been implicated in axonal biology and neuronal degeneration. Studies have shown that allelic variants of ELP3 are associated with ALS in multiple human populations, and these variants correlate with reduced brain expression of ELP3 (Simpson2008Variants).

Experimental models, including Drosophila and zebrafish, have demonstrated that loss of function mutations and knockdown of ELP3 lead to defects in neuronal communication and motor neuron abnormalities, respectively. These findings suggest that ELP3 is critical for axonal biology and may play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS (Simpson2008Variants).

ELP3 is also involved in the acetylation of α-tubulin in microtubules, a process crucial for neuronal function. Impaired Elongator complex activity, including that of ELP3, has been observed in neurological disorders such as familial dysautonomia and Huntington's disease, indicating its broader role in neurodegenerative conditions (Nguyen2010Elongator).

## Interactions
ELP3, a subunit of the Elongator complex, participates in several key interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a part of the Elongator complex, which consists of six subunits: Elp1, Elp2, Elp3, Elp4, Elp5, and Elp6. Within this complex, ELP3 interacts with Elp2, a crucial interaction for the incorporation of Elp2 into the Elongator complex (Li2009The). ELP3 also interacts with PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. This interaction is direct and occurs both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by the co-purification of PCNA with Elp3 (Li2009The). 

ELP3 is involved in posttranscriptional tRNA modifications, specifically binding to the anticodon stem loop of tRNA through a cleft formed by its radical S-adenosyl methionine (rSAM) and lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) domains (Lin2019The). In Drosophila, ELP3 acetylates the ELKS family member Bruchpilot (BRP), a component of the presynaptic density, which is crucial for regulating neurotransmitter release efficiency (Miśkiewicz2011ELP3). These interactions highlight ELP3's role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and synaptic function.
