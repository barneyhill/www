# ERGIC3

## Overview
ERGIC3 is a gene that encodes the ERGIC and Golgi 3 protein, which is an integral membrane protein involved in the transport processes between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a crucial role in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, facilitating the movement and stability of other proteins within this pathway. ERGIC3 is part of a complex with ERGIC1 and ERGIC2, contributing to protein stability and trafficking. The protein's interactions suggest its involvement in the transport of glycoproteins and enzymes critical for cellular functions, such as glycosylation. Due to its significant role in cellular transport mechanisms, ERGIC3 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including lung adenocarcinoma and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2013Suppression; Järvelä2021Exome; Thornbrough2016Human).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ERGIC3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. In lung adenocarcinoma, ERGIC3 is significantly overexpressed, with studies showing its upregulation in 89% of lung cancer specimens. This overexpression is associated with increased cellular proliferation and migration, suggesting that ERGIC3 may contribute to cancer progression and could serve as a potential biomarker for lung cancer (Wu2013Suppression).

In the context of intellectual disability (ID), a homozygous splice site variant in ERGIC3 (c.717 + 1G > A) has been identified in affected siblings, suggesting its potential role as an autosomal recessive ID candidate gene. This variant is associated with phenotypic abnormalities such as growth retardation, microcephaly, and learning disabilities (Järvelä2021Exome).

Additionally, ERGIC3 has been mentioned in studies exploring genetic variants in specific populations, such as the Finnish founder population, where it is considered a potential novel founder variant associated with autosomal recessive disorders (Järvelä2021Exome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ERGIC3 in both cancer and genetic disorders.

## Interactions
ERGIC3 is an integral membrane protein involved in the transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It has been shown to interact with other proteins within this transport pathway. ERGIC3 is closely co-localized with MUC1, a high molecular weight transmembrane glycoprotein, and ST, a key enzyme involved in glycosylation processes in the Golgi apparatus. This suggests that ERGIC3 may participate in the transport of MUC1 and ST from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Wu2013Suppression).

ERGIC3 also interacts with ERGIC1 and ERGIC2, forming a complex that is involved in protein stability. Depleting cells of ERGIC1 increases the turnover rate of ERGIC3, indicating that ERGIC1 may stabilize ERGIC3 within the ERGIC2-ERGIC3 complex. However, the depletion of ERGIC3 does not affect ERGIC1, suggesting a unidirectional stabilizing interaction (Thornbrough2016Human).

There is no direct evidence from the provided context that ERGIC3 interacts with nucleic acids. The interactions of ERGIC3 primarily involve its role in protein transport and stability within the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment.
