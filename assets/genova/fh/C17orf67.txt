# C17orf67

## Overview
C17orf67 is a gene located on chromosome 17, encoding the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 67. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms remain largely unknown. Despite this, C17orf67 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including its involvement in the 17q22 microdeletion syndrome and its potential role in auditory development and function, particularly in otitis media with effusion (Laurell2013Molecular; Stabenau2021RNA). Additionally, alterations in C17orf67 have been observed in cancer-related pathways, suggesting its potential significance in oncological research and its inclusion in multigene transcriptomic panels for predicting disease dynamics (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Clinical Significance
C17orf67, located on chromosome 17, has been implicated in several clinical conditions, although its specific role remains largely uncharacterized. The gene is part of the 17q22 microdeletion syndrome, which is associated with symptoms such as microcephaly, intellectual disability, and distinctive facial features. However, the study suggests that haploinsufficiency of C17orf67 is unlikely to be the primary cause of intellectual disability in these patients, as other dosage-sensitive genes outside the region of overlap are also deleted (Laurell2013Molecular).

In otitis media with effusion (OME), C17orf67 is downregulated, suggesting a potential role in auditory development and function. This downregulation may contribute to conductive hearing loss due to ossicular chain fusion, a symptom observed in microdeletion syndromes at 17q21.31 and 17q23.1-q23.2 (Stabenau2021RNA).

C17orf67 has also been associated with cancer-related pathways. Genetic alterations in ORF genes, including C17orf67, are noted, with gene amplifications being prevalent. These alterations may have prognostic significance in cancers, as C17orf67 is part of multigene transcriptomic panels used to predict disease dynamics or tumor responses (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
