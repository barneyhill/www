# SLC20A2

## Overview
SLC20A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 20 member 2 (PiT-2), a type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter. This transmembrane protein is integral to maintaining phosphate homeostasis within the body, facilitating the uptake of inorganic phosphate across cellular membranes. PiT-2 is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains and is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, functioning as a 'housekeeping' protein essential for cellular processes such as energy production and intracellular signaling (Li2022SLC20A2Associated; Li2020A). Beyond its primary role in phosphate transport, PiT-2 also serves as a retroviral receptor and is implicated in neurological health, particularly in preventing primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) by regulating phosphate levels in the brain (Lemos2015Update). Mutations in SLC20A2 are linked to PFBC, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Coppola2020Cortical).

## Structure
The SLC20A2 gene encodes the PiT-2 protein, a type III sodium-dependent phosphate transporter involved in phosphate homeostasis. PiT-2 is a transmembrane protein composed of 652 amino acids and is predicted to have 12 transmembrane spanning domains with a large intracellular domain (Li2022SLC20A2Associated; RamosBrossier2024Slc20a1). The protein contains two copies of the PD001131 protein homology domain, located at amino acid positions 111-113 and 591-593, in the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions, respectively (Lemos2015Update). These domains are essential for its function in inorganic phosphate transport and are highly conserved across different taxa.

PiT-2 is involved in both sodium and phosphorus cotransport and also functions as a retroviral receptor (Li2022SLC20A2Associated). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, functioning as a 'housekeeping' transport protein crucial for maintaining phosphate homeostasis (Li2020A). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context, the protein's role in phosphate transport and its structural domains suggest potential regulatory mechanisms that could involve such modifications.

## Function
The SLC20A2 gene encodes the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter PiT-2, which plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in healthy human cells. PiT-2 is involved in the uptake of inorganic phosphate (Pi) across the plasma membrane, a process essential for various cellular functions, including energy production, intracellular signaling, and acid-base buffering (LópezSánchez2020Interplay). This transporter is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, where it is particularly important for preventing disorders like primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) by regulating phosphate levels (Lemos2015Update).

In the brain, SLC20A2 is associated with maintaining neuronal homeostasis and survival, impacting cognitive functions such as spatial and episodic memory (RamosBrossier2024Slc20a1). The protein's activity is crucial for phosphate homeostasis, as it modulates phosphate uptake and efflux, working in concert with other transporters like XPR1 to maintain cellular phosphate balance (LópezSánchez2020Interplay). SLC20A2's role extends beyond phosphate transport, influencing neuronal integrity and plasticity, which are vital for proper brain function (RamosBrossier2024Slc20a1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC20A2 gene are a major cause of primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symmetrical calcifications in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia, thalami, and cerebellum. These calcifications can lead to a variety of symptoms, including movement disorders, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures (Lemos2015Update; Guo2019Spectrum). SLC20A2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of PFBC, accounting for a significant proportion of familial cases (Coppola2020Cortical).

The mutations in SLC20A2 often result in loss of function, leading to impaired phosphate transport and subsequent calcium phosphate buildup in the brain (Oliva2019A; Shen2021Case). This disruption in phosphate homeostasis is believed to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of PFBC (Cassinari2020Haploinsufficiency). Alterations in the regulatory elements of SLC20A2 can also affect gene expression, contributing to the disease (Cassinari2020Haploinsufficiency).

In addition to PFBC, SLC20A2 mutations have been implicated in other conditions, such as hereditary multiple exostoses, where they affect chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (Li2020A). The gene's role in phosphate regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, and its disruption can lead to diverse clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
SLC20A2, a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter, interacts with other proteins involved in phosphate metabolism and transport. It plays a significant role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis, particularly in the context of primary familial brain calcification (PFBC). SLC20A2 is known to interact with XPR1, another phosphate transporter, to regulate phosphate fluxes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining intracellular phosphate and ATP levels. The modulation of SLC20A2 expression affects XPR1-mediated phosphate efflux, indicating a regulatory interplay between these two transporters (LópezSánchez2020Interplay).

The interaction between SLC20A2 and XPR1 is dependent on inositol polyphosphates (PP-IPs), which are essential for controlling phosphate efflux through the SPX domain of XPR1. This suggests that SLC20A2 may influence XPR1's function by modulating its interaction with PP-IPs, thereby affecting phosphate homeostasis (LópezSánchez2020Interplay).

In addition to its role in phosphate transport, SLC20A2 is involved in neuronal homeostasis and survival, with its expression linked to neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. This indicates that SLC20A2 may have interactions beyond phosphate transport, potentially involving regulatory pathways related to inflammation and neuronal integrity (RamosBrossier2024Slc20a1).
