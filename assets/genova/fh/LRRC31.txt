# LRRC31

## Overview
LRRC31, or leucine-rich repeat-containing 31, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of multiple leucine-rich repeat domains. These domains are known for their role in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes. The LRRC31 protein is particularly significant in the context of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining pluripotency. It achieves this by interacting with key signaling pathways, notably the JAK1/STAT3 pathway, which is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of pluripotency genes. The protein's ability to modulate STAT3's binding to super-enhancers further underscores its importance in stem cell biology (Wang2020Defining).

## Interactions
LRRC31 is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). It contains nine leucine-rich repeat domains, which serve as protein recognition motifs. A study identified 18 high-confidence protein interactions with LRRC31, with JAK1 being one of the top hits. JAK1 is known to phosphorylate STAT3, a key factor in maintaining pluripotency. Knockdown of LRRC31 results in reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 and decreased binding of STAT3 to its target genes, including pluripotency factors like Oct4 and Esrrb. This suggests that LRRC31 is involved in the regulation of pluripotency through the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway (Wang2020Defining).

LRRC31 also regulates the binding of the STAT3 protein to super-enhancers in mESCs. When LRRC31 is knocked down, there is a significant reduction in STAT3 binding at specific sites, indicating its crucial role in STAT3's interaction with these genomic regions. The study identified 4,267 LRRC31-regulated STAT3 binding sites and highlighted its involvement in pluripotency-related signaling pathways, such as TGF-beta and Wnt. LRRC31 affects the phosphorylation of STAT3 through its interaction with JAK1, essential for STAT3's nuclear translocation and subsequent binding to pluripotency gene promoters and super-enhancers (Wang2020Defining).
