# ZNF276

## Overview
ZNF276 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 276, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. The protein plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, and gene silencing, primarily within the nucleus of human cells (Ito2023ZNF276; Lei2022ZNF276). ZNF276 is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and cancer progression, by interacting with specific DNA sequences and other proteins, such as the CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Ito2023ZNF276; Lei2022ZNF276). Its interaction with this complex is significant for its degradation, particularly in the presence of thalidomide, highlighting its potential role in therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases (Ito2023ZNF276). Additionally, ZNF276 has been implicated in the regulation of telomeres, suggesting broader implications in cellular aging and stability (Kappei2017Phylointeractomics).

## Structure
ZNF276 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The protein contains five C2H2 domains, which are essential for its function in binding to specific DNA sequences, such as the promoter region of CYP1B1, thereby influencing gene expression (Lei2022ZNF276). The fourth zinc finger motif (ZF4) of ZNF276 includes a 'CXXCG' motif, which is critical for its interaction with the CRL4 CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to its degradation in the presence of thalidomide and related drugs (Ito2023ZNF276).

The primary structure of ZNF276 consists of amino acid sequences forming these zinc finger domains. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of zinc finger proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional conformation, enabling its functional interactions with DNA and other proteins. There is no information on the quaternary structure of ZNF276, suggesting it may function as a monomer. Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination are significant for its regulation and degradation (Ito2023ZNF276).

## Function
ZNF276, a zinc finger protein, is involved in transcriptional regulation within healthy human cells. It functions primarily in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences gene expression. ZNF276 is known to play a role in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing, which are crucial for maintaining proper gene expression patterns and cellular function (Ito2023ZNF276). The protein contains a C2H2 zinc finger domain, which is essential for its DNA-binding capability and transcriptional activity (Lei2022ZNF276).

In the context of cellular processes, ZNF276 has been identified as a neosubstrate of the CRL4 CRBN complex, which is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. This interaction suggests that ZNF276 may have a role in modulating endothelial cell function and angiogenic processes, as evidenced by its involvement in tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Ito2023ZNF276). The degradation of ZNF276 through ubiquitin-mediated pathways further indicates its regulatory role in cellular processes, potentially impacting cell proliferation and migration (Ito2023ZNF276). These molecular activities highlight ZNF276's significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF276 has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer, where it functions as an oncogene. It is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. ZNF276 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating CYP1B1, a key downstream target, which contributes to the malignant phenotype of breast carcinoma (Lei2022ZNF276). The interaction between ZNF276 and MAGEB2 further enhances CYP1B1 expression and Wnt signaling, suggesting that targeting the ZNF276/MAGEB2 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Lei2022ZNF276).

In prostate cancer, ZNF276 is included in a prognostic model for predicting patient outcomes related to bicalutamide resistance. High expression of ZNF276, among other genes, is associated with a worse prognosis, indicating its potential role in prostate cancer progression and prognosis (Li2023Identification).

ZNF276 is also involved in angiogenesis, as it is a neosubstrate of CRL4 CRBN, which is degraded in a thalidomide-dependent manner. This degradation is linked to the anti-angiogenic effects of thalidomide and immunomodulatory drugs, suggesting a role for ZNF276 in angiogenesis-related diseases (Ito2023ZNF276).

## Interactions
ZNF276 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In breast cancer, ZNF276 interacts with CYP1B1 and MAGEB2. It binds directly to the promoter region of the CYP1B1 gene, activating its expression and facilitating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for the malignant phenotype of breast carcinoma (Lei2022ZNF276). The interaction with MAGEB2 enhances ZNF276's ability to bind to the CYP1B1 promoter, further promoting CYP1B1 expression and Wnt signaling activation (Lei2022ZNF276).

ZNF276 is also identified as a neosubstrate of the CRL4 CRBN complex, which is involved in the anti-angiogenic activity of thalidomide and related drugs. This interaction is thalidomide-dependent and leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of ZNF276, affecting angiogenesis (Ito2023ZNF276). The degradation of ZNF276 by thalidomide or pomalidomide is crucial for the anti-angiogenic effects of these drugs (Ito2023ZNF276).

Additionally, ZNF276 has been identified as a potential telomere-binding protein, suggesting it may have roles in telomere regulation by binding to the TTAGGG repeat sequence (Kappei2017Phylointeractomics).
