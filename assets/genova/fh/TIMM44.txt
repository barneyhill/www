# TIMM44

## Overview
The TIMM44 gene encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 44 (Tim44) protein, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. Tim44 functions as a scaffold protein within the mitochondrial import motor, facilitating the translocation of pre-proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. This process is essential for mitochondrial integrity and function, impacting cellular energy production and metabolism (Ting2017Dual; Rassow1994Mitochondrial). Structurally, Tim44 is characterized by its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which are involved in regulatory interactions and anchoring to the translocase, respectively (Ting2017Dual; Handa2007Structure). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial components, such as Tim23 and mtHsp70, underscore its role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and cellular health (Ting2017Dual; Ma2023The). Additionally, TIMM44 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where its altered expression can influence tumor progression and cellular metabolism (Bonora2006Novel; Zhang2024A).

## Structure
The TIMM44 protein, also known as Tim44, is a crucial component of the mitochondrial protein import machinery. It is composed of two main domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD, spanning residues 43 to 209, is intrinsically disordered and interacts with various components such as Tim23, mtHsp70, and Pam16, playing a regulatory role in the protein import process (Ting2017Dual). The CTD, spanning residues 210 to 431, forms an alpha+beta barrel structure, consisting of six alpha-helices and four beta-strands, and is responsible for anchoring Tim44 to the translocase (Ting2017Dual; Handa2007Structure).

The CTD of Tim44 also features a large hydrophobic cavity, which is proposed to interact with acyl chains in the mitochondrial inner membrane, suggesting a role in lipid binding (Handa2007Structure). This domain exhibits structural similarities with the association domain of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), despite weak sequence similarity (Handa2007Structure). The interaction with negatively charged phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin, is mediated by helices A1 and A2, which are crucial for membrane association (Marom2009Interaction).

## Function
The TIMM44 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that is integral to the import of pre-proteins into the mitochondrial matrix, a process essential for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. TIMM44 operates as a scaffold protein within the mitochondrial import motor, interacting with components such as Tim23, Tim17, and mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) (Ting2017Dual). This interaction is crucial for the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating their entry into the mitochondrial matrix (Rassow1994Mitochondrial).

In endothelial cells, TIMM44 is vital for pro-angiogenic activities, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary tube formation. Disruption of TIMM44 impairs these processes by affecting mitochondrial functions, leading to reduced mitochondrial protein import, decreased complex I activity, and lower ATP production (Ma2023The). The protein's role in mitochondrial dynamics is further underscored by its involvement in maintaining the expression of genes like Opa1, Mfn1, and Mfn2, which are essential for mitochondrial dynamics (Ma2023The). TIMM44's function is critical for cellular energy production and overall cellular metabolism, highlighting its importance in both cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TIMM44 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, TIMM44 is significantly overexpressed, contributing to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Inhibition of TIMM44 using a blocker, MB-10, or genetic depletion via CRISPR-Cas9, has shown potent anti-cancer effects by reducing cell viability and inducing apoptosis. These interventions also disrupt mitochondrial function, leading to oxidative stress and decreased ATP production, which are crucial for cancer cell survival (Zhang2024A).

In thyroid cancer, specifically oncocytic thyroid carcinomas, germline variants of TIMM44 have been identified as potential predisposing factors. A missense mutation in exon 9 (P308Q) and a silent variant in exon 13 have been found to co-segregate with the oncocytic carcinoma phenotype in families. These variants may subtly affect mitochondrial protein import, potentially leading to increased reactive oxygen species production and tumor development (Bonora2006Novel).

TIMM44 is also associated with ovarian cancer, where it is stabilized by the human antigen R (HuR), promoting cancer cell proliferation. This interaction suggests that TIMM44 may play a role in the progression of ovarian cancer (Yu2020HuR).

## Interactions
TIMM44 is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial import motor by interacting with various components of the translocase complex. It is part of the Presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) complex and interacts with the translocon subunits Tim17 and Tim23. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of TIMM44 anchors it to the translocase, interacting with both Tim17 and Tim23, while the N-terminal domain (NTD) is involved in regulatory interactions (Ting2017Dual).

The NTD of TIMM44 is intrinsically disordered, allowing it to interact with multiple partners, including Tim23, mtHsp70, and Pam16. This domain is critical for the recruitment of mtHsp70 and the association with the translocon, particularly involving residues between 160 and 180 (Ting2017Dual). TIMM44's interaction with Tim23 is particularly significant, with both the NTD and CTD capable of crosslinking to loop 1 of Tim23 (Ting2017Dual).

TIMM44 also plays a role in mitophagy regulation, interacting with proteins such as ANT-1, PARL, and prohibitin. These interactions are crucial for the trafficking and stabilization of PINK1, a key protein in mitophagy, under stress conditions (Michaelis2024Mitochondrial; Conti2022A).
