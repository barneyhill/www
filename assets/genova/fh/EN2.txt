# EN2

## Overview
The EN2 gene encodes the engrailed homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the Engrailed family of homeoproteins. This protein is characterized by its homeodomain, which facilitates DNA binding and plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes. EN2 is crucial for the proper development and organization of the cerebellum, influencing the formation and patterning of cerebellar structures. Beyond its developmental roles, EN2 is involved in cell signaling through interactions with glycosaminoglycans and phosphoinositides, which are essential for its secretion and internalization. Clinically, alterations in EN2 expression have been linked to neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and structural brain anomalies, as well as oncological conditions like prostate cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker (Wizenmann2014Engrailed; GómezGómez2019Oncogenic; Poudel2022Role).

## Structure
The EN2 (engrailed homeobox 2) protein is a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain, a conserved DNA-binding domain crucial for its role in regulating gene expression (Wizenmann2014Engrailed). This homeodomain is part of the Engrailed family of homeoprotein transcription factors, which also include domains for active transcriptional repression and binding to co-factors such as Groucho and Extradenticle (Exd)/Pbx (Wizenmann2014Engrailed). The EN2 protein can interact with cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), particularly heparan sulfate (HS), through a high-affinity GAG-binding hexadecapeptide located upstream of the homeodomain. This region is enriched in basic amino acids and resembles nuclear localization signals (Cardon2021A). The internalization motif within the homeodomain is similar to the cationic hexadecapeptide Penetratin, known for its cell-penetrating properties (Cardon2021A).

The EN2 protein also possesses domains that allow it to be secreted and internalized, facilitating cell-to-cell signaling (Wizenmann2014Engrailed). The interaction with GAGs affects its secondary and tertiary structure, emphasizing the importance of the intrinsically disordered basic region preceding the homeodomain (Cardon2021A). The protein's structure and interactions are primarily driven by electrostatic contacts, as evidenced by studies using techniques like NMR and ITC (Cardon2021A).

## Function
The EN2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and organization of the cerebellum. It is involved in the morphological organization and pattern formation of the cerebellum, influencing the development of its lobules and the positioning of fissures. EN2 is expressed in various parts of the developing cerebellum, with high expression in the external granular, Purkinje, and internal granular layers, but not in the molecular layer. It is essential for the proper formation of cerebellar foliation, patterning, and growth of the folia, as well as the timing and positioning of folia formation along the anteroposterior axis (Poudel2022Role).

EN2 also maintains the cerebellar neural circuitry and the morphology of neurons, ensuring the targeted termination of mossy fibers and the formation of afferent bands of olivocerebellar and mossy fibers. It is expressed in the precursors of granule cells, deep cerebellar nuclei, and neuroglial cells, maintaining the shape, number, and connections of these neurons (Poudel2022Role). The EN2 protein is involved in the guidance and migration of retinal axons, particularly in the retinotectal system, where it helps position nasal and temporal retinal axons along the anteroposterior axis of the tectum/superior colliculus (Di2020Homeoprotein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the EN2 gene have been associated with several neurological and oncological conditions. In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), genetic studies have linked EN2 to ASD, with specific intronic SNPs showing significant associations. These genetic variations may alter EN2 expression during brain development, potentially contributing to ASD pathology by disrupting neuronal differentiation and development (Benayed2005Support). EN2 mutations have also been observed in patients with encephalic structural anomalies, where they are associated with higher rates of mental retardation, epilepsy, and behavioral disorders, although a direct relationship with specific clinical phenotypes is not established (CarratalaMarco2018Clinical).

In oncology, EN2 is implicated in prostate cancer, where it is overexpressed in cancerous tissues and can serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker. EN2 expression influences cell proliferation and migration, and its elevated levels in urine can help distinguish prostate cancer patients from controls (GómezGómez2019Oncogenic). The gene's role in modulating androgen receptor signaling pathways further underscores its significance in prostate cancer progression (GómezGómez2019Oncogenic).

## Interactions
EN2 (engrailed homeobox 2) is involved in several interactions that facilitate its function as a transcription factor. It interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is crucial for its translocation across the plasma membrane during both secretion and internalization. This interaction is similar to that of other proteins like FGF2 and HIV Tat, which also require PIP2 for their secretion (Amblard2020Bidirectional).

EN2 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), particularly heparan sulfate (HS). A high-affinity GAG-binding sequence upstream of the EN2 homeodomain is essential for its internalization, interacting selectively with highly sulfated HS. This interaction is primarily driven by electrostatic contacts and is crucial for EN2's entry into cells (Cardon2023A).

In the context of retinal growth cone guidance, EN2 interacts with the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) to potentiate ephrin A5 function. This interaction enhances ephrin A5 signaling, which is important for the guidance of temporal retinal ganglion cell axons (Stettler2012Engrailed).
