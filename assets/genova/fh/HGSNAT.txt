# HGSNAT

## Overview
The HGSNAT gene encodes the enzyme heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, a critical component of the lysosomal membrane involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme is categorized as a transmembrane protein, featuring 11 transmembrane domains and a unique luminal domain with a β-sandwich fold (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo; Navratna2024Structure). The enzyme's primary function is to facilitate the acetylation of terminal glucosamine residues, a necessary step for the subsequent hydrolysis by α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, thus enabling the complete breakdown of heparan sulfate within lysosomes (Fedele2010Functional; Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo). Mutations in the HGSNAT gene can lead to lysosomal storage disorders, such as Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC), characterized by the accumulation of undegraded heparan sulfate, resulting in severe neurological and developmental impairments (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo; Fedele2015Sanfilippo). Additionally, certain mutations are associated with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting the gene's significance in both neurological and visual health (HaerWigman2015Nonsyndromic).

## Structure
The HGSNAT protein is encoded by the HGSNAT gene and is involved in the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate. It is composed of 635 amino acids and features a cleavable signal peptide at the N-terminus, which is typical for lysosomal proteins (Fedele2010Functional). The protein structure includes 11 transmembrane domains and a luminal domain (LD) that forms a unique β-sandwich fold, described as 'transthyretin-like' due to its distinct strand arrangement (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo; Navratna2024Structure). The LD consists of two β-sheets, one mixed and one anti-parallel, with a top sheet arrangement of β4-β1-β7-β8 (Navratna2024Structure).

HGSNAT forms a dimer, with protomers related by twofold rotational symmetry, and the dimer interface is stabilized by disulfide bonds and π-π interactions (Navratna2024Structure). The protein undergoes proteolytic maturation into two fragments, α-HGSNAT and β-HGSNAT, which remain associated (Navratna2024Structure). The transmembrane domains are evolutionarily conserved and form a catalytic core and scaffold domain, with the acetyl-CoA binding site located within the catalytic core (Navratna2024Structure). The protein also contains five potential N-glycosylation sites oriented towards the lysosomal lumen (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo).

## Function
The HGSNAT gene encodes the enzyme heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, which is crucial for the lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan. This enzyme is localized to the lysosomal membrane and facilitates the transmembrane acetylation of terminal glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate. This acetylation is a necessary step before the hydrolysis of these residues by α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, allowing for the complete degradation of heparan sulfate within lysosomes (Fedele2010Functional; Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo).

The enzyme's activity involves the interaction with acetyl CoA from the cytoplasm, which binds to HGSNAT on the cytoplasmic side of the lysosomal membrane. This binding induces a conformational change that relocates the acetyl group into the lysosomal interior, where glucosamine binds to the enzyme and becomes acetylated (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo). This process is essential because lysosomal glycosidases cannot act on unacetylated glucosamine, making HGSNAT's function critical for cellular waste processing and recycling (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of HGSNAT is vital for maintaining normal cellular and neurological function, as deficiencies in this enzyme lead to the accumulation of undegraded heparan sulfate, resulting in lysosomal storage disorders such as Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC) (Fedele2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HGSNAT gene are primarily associated with mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS IIIC), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type C. This rare autosomal recessive disorder results from a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, leading to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in lysosomes. The clinical manifestations of MPS IIIC include progressive neurological deterioration, severe hyperactivity, sleep disorders, loss of speech, and behavioral abnormalities. Patients may also experience mild visceral and skeletal abnormalities, such as coarse facial features and joint stiffness (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo; Fedele2015Sanfilippo).

In addition to MPS IIIC, mutations in HGSNAT have been linked to a non-syndromic form of retinitis pigmentosa, a retinal degenerative disease. This condition affects the rod photoreceptors more severely than the cones, leading to night blindness and visual field loss. The retina may require higher HGSNAT activity to maintain proper function, which explains why some patients with HGSNAT mutations develop retinitis pigmentosa without the neurological symptoms typical of MPS IIIC (HaerWigman2015Nonsyndromic).

The spectrum of mutations in HGSNAT includes missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, with some mutations leading to complete loss of enzymatic activity (Feldhammer2009Sanfilippo).
