# PIWIL3

## Overview
PIWIL3 is a gene that encodes the protein piwi like RNA-mediated gene silencing 3, which is a member of the PIWI protein family. This family is known for its role in RNA-mediated gene silencing processes, particularly through interactions with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The PIWIL3 protein is involved in regulating gene expression and cellular behavior, particularly in the context of cancer biology. It participates in complex regulatory networks that influence cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as evidenced by its interactions with various nucleic acids and proteins. PIWIL3 has been implicated in several types of cancer, including pancreatic, gastric, and melanoma, where it may contribute to oncogenic processes and chemoresistance (Liu2018PIWIL3OIP5AS1miR3673pCEBPA; Jiang2017Downregulation; Li2020The).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIWIL3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including pancreatic, gastric, and melanoma. In pancreatic cancer, PIWIL3 is overexpressed in tumor-derived cell lines compared to non-tumor cell lines. Its downregulation has been shown to decrease cell motility and enhance drug toxicity, suggesting a role in maintaining pancreatic cell homeostasis and potentially contributing to chemoresistance (Li2020The). However, PIWIL3 expression does not significantly correlate with survival outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients, indicating it may not serve as a reliable prognostic biomarker (Li2020The).

In gastric cancer, PIWIL3 is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. High PIWIL3 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and its downregulation leads to cell cycle arrest and reduced expression of metastasis-related genes. This suggests that PIWIL3 promotes oncogenic processes in gastric cancer, potentially through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (Jiang2017Downregulation).

In melanoma, PIWIL3 expression is higher in primary melanomas compared to metastatic subtypes and correlates with tumor thickness, although it is not an independent predictor of relapse or death (Gambichler2016Expression). These findings highlight PIWIL3's potential role in cancer progression and its value as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PIWIL3, a member of the PIWI protein family, is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins that influence gene expression and cellular behavior. In glioma cells, PIWIL3 interacts with piR-30188, a PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA), to modulate the expression of OIP5-AS1, an oncogene. This interaction is confirmed through RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pulldown experiments, which demonstrate that PIWIL3 binds to piR-30188 (Liu2018PIWIL3OIP5AS1miR3673pCEBPA). The binding of piR-30188 to PIWIL3 is crucial for the regulation of OIP5-AS1, as shown by dual-luciferase reporter assays indicating that piR-30188 targets OIP5-AS1 (Liu2018PIWIL3OIP5AS1miR3673pCEBPA).

PIWIL3 is also part of a feedback loop involving miR-367-3p and CEBPA. Overexpression of PIWIL3 leads to increased levels of miR-367-3p, which acts as a tumor suppressor by reducing the expression of oncogenic targets like CEBPA and TRAF4 (Liu2018PIWIL3OIP5AS1miR3673pCEBPA). CEBPA, in turn, can regulate PIWIL3 expression by binding to its promoter, suggesting a reciprocal feedback mechanism (Liu2018PIWIL3OIP5AS1miR3673pCEBPA). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network in which PIWIL3 participates, influencing glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
