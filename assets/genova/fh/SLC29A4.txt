# SLC29A4

## Overview
The SLC29A4 gene encodes the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), a member of the solute carrier family 29. This protein functions as a polyspecific organic cation transporter, primarily involved in the transport and regulation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, and epinephrine. PMAT is characterized by its role in the uptake 2 system, which is Na+ and Cl- independent, and is known for its low-affinity but high-capacity transport capabilities. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis and is involved in the clearance of neurotoxins and drugs at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Wang2016The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and depressive disorders, as well as its potential impact on drug tolerance in type 2 diabetes (Dawed2018Variation; Adamsen2014Autism).

## Function
The SLC29A4 gene encodes the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), which is a polyspecific organic cation transporter primarily involved in the transport of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, and epinephrine. PMAT plays a crucial role in the regulation of these neurotransmitters, which are essential for various physiological, endocrine, behavioral, and cognitive processes (Wang2016The). 

PMAT is part of the uptake 2 system, characterized by Na+ and Cl- independent, low-affinity, and high-capacity transport, serving as a backup for the uptake 1 system in brain monoamine clearance (Wang2016The). It is predominantly expressed in neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and is thought to play a critical role in monoamine regulation, with higher expression in most brain regions compared to other uptake 2 transporters like OCT3 (Wang2016The). 

In addition to its role in neurotransmitter regulation, PMAT is the principal organic cation transporter at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, responsible for removing neurotoxins and drugs from the cerebrospinal fluid (Wang2016The). This transporter is also involved in the disposition of cationic drugs and toxins in epithelial barrier tissues (Wang2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC29A4 gene, which encodes the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and depressive disorders. In ASD, rare non-synonymous mutations such as p.Ala138Thr and p.Asp326Glu have been identified in patients, leading to reduced uptake of serotonin and potentially contributing to abnormal serotonin neurotransmission. These mutations are linked to low levels of serotonin metabolites in the brain and elevated serotonin levels in blood and platelets, suggesting a role in the neurodevelopmental aspects of ASD (Adamsen2014Autism).

In depressive disorders, PMAT is considered a potential target for enhancing antidepressant treatment response. Inhibition of PMAT has been shown to potentiate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), indicating its role in serotonin homeostasis. Studies using PMAT knockout mice suggest that PMAT may influence anxiety and coping behaviors, and its inhibition could enhance antidepressant-like effects (Vieira2021Brain).

Additionally, genetic variations in SLC29A4 have been linked to metformin intolerance in individuals with type 2 diabetes, with the intronic SNP rs38899348 associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal intolerance to the drug (Dawed2018Variation).

## Interactions
The SLC29A4 gene encodes the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT), which is involved in the transport of monoamine neurotransmitters and organic cations. PMAT is known to interact with various organic cations, functioning as a polyspecific transporter similar to organic cation transporters (OCTs). It can transport substrates such as MPP+, TEA, guanidine, and histamine, and is inhibited by OCT inhibitors like cimetidine (Engel2005Interaction). 

PMAT's interaction with substrates and inhibitors involves a positively charged nitrogen atom and a hydrophobic mass, with a planar aromatic mass associated with high-affinity interaction (Wang2016The; Vieira2021Brain). The transporter is sensitive to HIV protease inhibitors, with lopinavir identified as a potent and selective inhibitor (Wang2016The). 

PMAT's substrate and inhibitor specificity overlaps with OCTs, complicating the distinction of their roles in monoamine and organic cation uptake in vivo (Shirasaka2017Interspecies). Despite these similarities, PMAT exhibits distinct specificity and kinetics, efficiently transporting serotonin and dopamine but not ASP+, a substrate for OCTs (Vieira2021Brain).
