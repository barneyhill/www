# LEFTY1

## Overview
LEFTY1 is a gene that encodes the protein left-right determination factor 1, which is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This protein plays a pivotal role in embryonic development by establishing left-right asymmetry, primarily through the inhibition of Nodal signaling, a critical pathway for determining the left-right axis in embryos (Saijoh1999Distinct). LEFTY1 is expressed on the left side of the embryo, where it acts as an antagonist to Nodal, ensuring the correct positioning of visceral organs (Saijoh1999Distinct). Beyond its developmental functions, LEFTY1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is implicated in fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Li2021Lefty1; Zhang2020Lefty1). This makes LEFTY1 a potential therapeutic target for conditions characterized by excessive fibrosis, such as renal and cardiac fibrosis (Li2021Lefty1; Zhang2020Lefty1).

## Function
LEFTY1, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, plays a critical role in establishing left-right asymmetry during embryonic development. It functions primarily by inhibiting Nodal signaling, a pathway crucial for determining the left-right axis in developing embryos. LEFTY1 is expressed on the left side of the embryo, where it acts as an antagonist to Nodal, ensuring the correct positioning of visceral organs (Saijoh1999Distinct).

In addition to its role in embryonic development, LEFTY1 is involved in various cellular processes. It has been shown to inhibit the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is implicated in fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By blocking this pathway, LEFTY1 can reduce fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, thereby exerting anti-fibrotic effects in tissues such as the kidney and heart (Li2021Lefty1; Zhang2020Lefty1). This inhibition is achieved through the suppression of Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which is a key step in the TGF-β signaling cascade (Li2021Lefty1; Zhang2020Lefty1).

LEFTY1's ability to modulate these signaling pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions characterized by excessive fibrosis, such as renal and cardiac fibrosis (Li2021Lefty1; Zhang2020Lefty1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LEFTY1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), LEFTY1 expression is upregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to reduce cardiac fibrosis by inhibiting the p-Smad2 and p-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. This suggests that LEFTY1 could be a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating post-infarction fibrosis (Li2021Lefty1).

In inflammatory bowel diseases, LEFTY1 expression varies between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). It is upregulated in UC and downregulated in CD, indicating its potential as a diagnostic marker to distinguish between these conditions (Skok2021Expression). LEFTY1's role as a repressor of TGF-β signaling, which is involved in fibrosis and fistula formation in CD, further underscores its clinical significance in these diseases (Skok2021Expression).

LEFTY1 also plays a role in renal fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, which is crucial in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and renal interstitial fibrosis. This suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for fibrotic kidney diseases (Zhang2020Lefty1).

## Interactions
LEFTY1 interacts with several proteins and pathways, playing a significant role in modulating TGF-β signaling. It acts as an antagonist to EGF-CFC coreceptors, such as Cripto, by blocking their interactions with ligands like Nodal and Vg1/GDF1. This inhibition prevents the activation of these ligands, which are crucial for certain developmental processes (Cheng2004Lefty). LEFTY1 does not affect Activin signaling, as Activin does not require EGF-CFC coreceptors for its activity (Cheng2004Lefty).

In the context of endometrial carcinoma, LEFTY1 interacts with the TGF-β/Smad2 pathway and is regulated by ovarian hormones. It is associated with decreased cell proliferation, likely through the suppression of Smad2-dependent cyclin A2 expression (Fei2017A). LEFTY1 expression is positively correlated with estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen and ERα (Fei2017A).

In embryonic stem cells, LEFTY1 expression is regulated by transcription factors Oct3/4 and Sox2, which bind to a specific enhancer region upstream of the gene. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (Nakatake2006Klf4).
