# KIF1C

## Overview
KIF1C is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 1C, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-3 family, which plays a pivotal role in intracellular transport processes. The protein is characterized by its N-terminal motor domain, responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, a stalk domain with coiled-coil segments, and a unique C-terminal tail domain that facilitates its transport functions (Nakajima2002Molecular; Kendrick2019Hook3). KIF1C is involved in the transport of vesicles, particularly within the Golgi apparatus, and is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Lee2015The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the 14-3-3 family and Hook3, modulate its activity and are crucial for its role in bidirectional cargo transport (Dorner1999The; Siddiqui2019PTPN21). Mutations in the KIF1C gene have been linked to neurological disorders, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and spastic ataxia, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases (YücelYılmaz2018Clinical; Gabrych2019Going).

## Structure
KIF1C is a kinesin-3 family protein involved in intracellular transport, characterized by a distinct molecular structure. The protein consists of an N-terminal motor domain, a stalk domain with several coiled-coil segments, and a unique C-terminal tail domain. The motor domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, facilitating the protein's transport function (Nakajima2002Molecular; Kendrick2019Hook3).

The C-terminal tail domain of KIF1C is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) enriched with proline, arginine, glycine, and serine residues. This IDR is crucial for the protein's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming dynamic puncta in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Geng2023KIF1C). The IDR also contains a prion-like domain (PLD), a feature common in RNA-binding proteins, which contributes to its RNA transport function (Geng2023KIF1C).

KIF1C's quaternary structure is that of an autoinhibited dimer, maintained by intramolecular electrostatic interactions. This autoinhibition is mediated by interactions between the motor and stalk domains, influenced by salt concentration (Siddiqui2019PTPN21). The protein's interaction with other proteins, such as Hook3, is facilitated by specific regions in its tail domain (Kendrick2019Hook3).

## Function
KIF1C is a kinesin motor protein that plays a critical role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the organization and function of the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the transport of vesicles within cells, including the movement of Rab6A-labeled vesicles, which is essential for maintaining their directionality and confinement. Depletion of KIF1C results in increased vesicle speed but decreased directionality, indicating its importance in promoting vesicle directionality and preventing backward movement (Lee2015The).

KIF1C also contributes to the structural integrity of the Golgi complex. Its depletion leads to Golgi fragmentation, which can be rescued by reintroducing wild-type KIF1C, highlighting its role in maintaining normal Golgi structure (Lee2015The). The protein is involved in the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, a process regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (Dorner1998Characterization).

In cell migration, KIF1C is crucial for the stabilization of trailing adhesions and the transport of integrins, such as the α5β1-integrin complex, to the cell membrane. This transport is necessary for focal adhesion maturation and cell migration, ensuring directional persistence and stability of cell tails (Theisen2012Directional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIF1C gene are associated with several neurological disorders, most notably hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and spastic ataxia. HSP, specifically type SPG58, is characterized by lower extremity spasticity and weakness due to the degeneration of long axons in central motoneurons. These mutations often result in loss-of-function, affecting the gene's role in intracellular transport, leading to misdelivery of critical cargos within neurons (Gabrych2019Going; Nagel2022The). 

In humans, KIF1C mutations can also cause spastic ataxia type 2 (SPAX2), which involves cerebellar complications and is marked by symptoms such as ataxic gait and tremor. Neuroimaging often reveals cerebral and upper cervical spinal atrophy, as well as demyelinating lesions in the brain (YücelYılmaz2018Clinical; Duchesne2018Progressive). 

In Charolais cattle, a specific mutation in KIF1C leads to progressive ataxia, a condition that mimics human SPG58/SPAX2 mutations, resulting in demyelination and coordination issues. This mutation is associated with better muscular development in heterozygous states, suggesting a potential selection advantage (Duchesne2018Progressive). 

Overall, KIF1C mutations disrupt normal cellular transport mechanisms, contributing to the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
KIF1C, a kinesin motor protein, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It forms dimers and associates with proteins of the 14-3-3 family, specifically the β, γ, and ε isoforms. The interaction with 14-3-3γ is dependent on the phosphorylation of serine 1092 by casein kinase II (CKII), which regulates the binding (Dorner1999The). KIF1C also interacts with components of the exon junction complex (EJC) in neuronal cells, including eIF4A3, RBM8A, and MAGOH. This interaction is RNA-mediated, as RNAse treatment reduces the binding of EJC components to KIF1C (Nagel2022The).

KIF1C's activity is modulated by interactions with PTPN21 and Hook3, which relieve its autoinhibition and activate its transport function. PTPN21 binds to the stalk region of KIF1C, and its FERM domain is sufficient for activation. Hook3, known for activating dynein/dynactin, also interacts with KIF1C's C-terminus, enhancing its microtubule engagement (Siddiqui2019PTPN21). These interactions highlight KIF1C's role in bidirectional cargo transport and its involvement in various cellular processes.
