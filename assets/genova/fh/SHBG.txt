# SHBG

## Overview
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a gene that encodes a plasma protein of the same name, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation and transport of sex steroids, including androgens and estrogens, in the bloodstream. The SHBG protein is a homodimeric glycoprotein primarily synthesized in the liver, characterized by its unique structure comprising two laminin G-like domains. This protein is crucial for modulating the bioavailability of sex hormones, thereby influencing their access to various tissues and affecting numerous physiological processes, including reproductive and metabolic functions (Rosner2010Interactions; Grishkovskaya2000Crystal). SHBG's interaction with cell membranes and its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways further underscore its significance in cellular regulation and its potential impact on conditions such as breast cancer, metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome (Catalano2005Sex; Xita2010Genetic).

## Structure
The human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a homodimeric glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in transporting sex steroids in the blood. Each monomer of SHBG consists of two laminin G-like domains, with the N-terminal G domain being primarily responsible for steroid transport (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal). The N-terminal domain comprises residues 1-205 and features a jellyroll motif formed by two seven-stranded, antiparallel β-sheets (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal). This domain is spherical, approximately 40 Å in diameter, and includes a highly conserved disulfide bridge between Cys164 and Cys188 (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal).

The quaternary structure of SHBG is characterized by its dimeric form, with monomers related by a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis, creating a large hydrophobic interface (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal). The dimerization is supported by eight main chain hydrogen bonds and is crucial for its function in steroid binding (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal). SHBG also contains a calcium-binding site located 20 Å away from the steroid-binding site, which is distinct from the dimerization interface (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal).

SHBG undergoes glycosylation, a common post-translational modification, and may have splice variant isoforms that affect its function and binding affinity (Grishkovskaya1999Crystallization). The protein's structure is unique compared to other plasma proteins that bind lipophilic molecules, such as albumin, due to its specific β-sheet configuration and the proximity of its N- and C-termini (Grishkovskaya2000Crystal).

## Function
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a plasma protein primarily synthesized in the liver, playing a crucial role in regulating the bioavailability of sex steroids such as androgens and estrogens by binding to them in the bloodstream (Rosner2010Interactions; Xita2010Genetic). SHBG is involved in the transport of these hormones, modulating their access to tissues and influencing various cellular processes (Willnow2010Cellular).

SHBG interacts with cell membranes through specific binding sites, which are present in various tissues, including the prostate, breast, and endometrium (Willnow2010Cellular; Rosner2010Interactions). This interaction is mediated by a receptor structure, although the exact identity of the receptor remains unclear (Catalano2005Sex). SHBG binding to cell membranes can lead to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways, such as the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, which can influence cell proliferation and apoptosis (ROSNER1990The; Fortunati2010Sex).

In breast cancer cells, SHBG has been shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent cell growth by interfering with estradiol's biological effects, promoting apoptosis, and modulating gene expression related to cell growth and estrogen sensitivity (Catalano2005Sex; Fortunati2010Sex). These functions highlight SHBG's role in modulating hormone action at the cellular level, contributing to its regulatory effects on reproductive and metabolic processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SHBG gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Low levels of SHBG are linked to metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, and hormone-dependent cancers (Xita2010Genetic). Specific genetic variations, such as the (TAAAA)n repeat polymorphism in the SHBG promoter, are associated with lower serum SHBG concentrations and an increased risk of PCOS. Women with eight or more repeats have lower SHBG levels, suggesting this polymorphism as a susceptibility factor for PCOS (Xita2010Genetic; Li2021Association).

Mutations in the SHBG gene, such as the P156L variant, can lead to abnormal glycosylation and inefficient secretion of SHBG, contributing to low serum levels and conditions like hyperandrogenism and ovarian dysfunction (Hogeveen2002Human). The D327N polymorphism, although not significantly associated with PCOS risk, is linked to increased SHBG levels in postmenopausal women and a reduced risk of breast cancer (Xita2010Genetic). These genetic variations highlight the role of SHBG in regulating androgen bioactivity and its impact on various diseases.

## Interactions
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in modulating the bioavailability of sex steroids. SHBG is known to bind specifically to a receptor on cell membranes, a process that is influenced by the presence of steroids. When SHBG is fully liganded to a steroid, it cannot bind to its receptor, indicating that only unliganded SHBG can interact with the receptor (Hryb1990The; Rosner2010Interactions). This interaction is crucial for its role in cellular signaling, as demonstrated by its ability to generate intracellular cAMP in certain cell types when bound to steroids like estradiol (Rosner2010Interactions).

SHBG also interacts with members of the fibulin protein family, such as fibulin-1D and fibulin-2, in a ligand-dependent manner. Estrogen-bound SHBG shows enhanced interaction with these fibulins compared to androgen-bound SHBG (round2019sex). These interactions are influenced by structural differences in SHBG when bound to different ligands, highlighting the complexity of SHBG's role in cellular processes. Additionally, SHBG has been shown to bind zinc, which affects its steroid-binding specificity, particularly for estrogens (GuadarramaGarcía2020Molecular).
