# TALDO1

## Overview
TALDO1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme transaldolase 1, a crucial component of the nonoxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This enzyme is classified as a class I aldolase and plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by facilitating the transfer of three-carbon units between sugar phosphates. The transaldolase 1 protein is involved in the conversion of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, linking the PPP to glycolysis and contributing to the synthesis of ribose 5-phosphate and NADPH. These products are essential for nucleotide synthesis and maintaining cellular redox balance, respectively (Balasubramaniam2011Novel; Moriyama2016Two). The TALDO1 gene produces two isoforms, TALDO1L and TALDO1S, which differ in their subcellular localization and influence various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Moriyama2016Two). Mutations in TALDO1 can lead to transaldolase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder with diverse clinical manifestations, including liver dysfunction and hematological abnormalities (Stincone2014The; Williams2019Clinical).

## Structure
The TALDO1 protein, encoded by the TALDO1 gene, is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. It consists of 337 amino acids and forms a single domain protein with a core structure characterized by an eight-stranded K/L barrel, comprising eight parallel L-strands and seven K-helices (Thorell2000The). The enzyme's tertiary structure is a compact, globular shape, typical of class I aldolases, and it forms a dimer in its quaternary structure, with an interface involving 18 residues from each subunit (Thorell2000The).

The active site of TALDO1 includes invariant residues such as Asp-27, Asn-45, Glu-106, Lys-142, Asn-165, Thr-167, Ser-187, and Arg-192, which are crucial for catalysis and substrate binding (Thorell2000The). The enzyme operates through a Schiff base intermediate, a characteristic feature of class I aldolases (Thorell2000The).

TALDO1 has two isoforms, TALDO1L and TALDO1S, generated by alternative translational initiation. These isoforms differ in their nucleocytoplasmic distribution, with TALDO1L being primarily nuclear due to a nuclear localization signal in the first 10 N-terminal amino acids, while TALDO1S is cytoplasmic (Moriyama2016Two). The structural differences between these isoforms play a significant role in their cellular localization and function (Moriyama2016Two).

## Function
TALDO1 encodes transaldolase 1, a key enzyme in the nonoxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which is crucial for cellular metabolism. This enzyme facilitates the transfer of three-carbon units between sugar phosphates, specifically converting sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. This reaction is essential for linking the PPP to glycolysis and for the production of ribose 5-phosphate, which is necessary for nucleotide synthesis, and NADPH, which is vital for reductive biosynthesis and antioxidant defense (Balasubramaniam2011Novel; Moriyama2016Two).

TALDO1 exists in two isoforms, TALDO1L and TALDO1S, which differ in their subcellular localization. TALDO1L is primarily nuclear, while TALDO1S is cytoplasmic. These isoforms regulate the global metabolic network by affecting various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, purine metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, depending on their localization (Moriyama2016Two).

In healthy human cells, TALDO1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance by influencing NADPH and glutathione levels, which are crucial for neutralizing reactive oxygen intermediates and protecting against oxidative stress (Banki1996Glutathione; Perl2011Oxidative).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TALDO1 gene lead to transaldolase deficiency, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by significant phenotypic variability. This condition is associated with liver dysfunction, including hepatosplenomegaly, cholestatic jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes, which can progress to hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis in older patients (Stincone2014The; Williams2019Clinical). Some patients with TALDO1 mutations have developed hepatocellular carcinoma, necessitating liver transplantation (Williams2019Clinical). 

Transaldolase deficiency also presents with hematological abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia and anemia, as well as renal issues like tubulopathy and renal failure (Williams2019Clinical; Eyaid2013Transaldolase). Dysmorphic features, congenital heart defects, and endocrine disorders, including hypothyroidism and growth abnormalities, are also observed (Stincone2014The; Williams2019Clinical).

Alterations in TALDO1 expression have been linked to oxidative stress, contributing to conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hanczko2009Prevention). TALDO1 is identified as a tumor suppressor in the liver, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and reduced levels of NADPH and glutathione, which are crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance (Hanczko2009Prevention).

## Interactions
TALDO1, or transaldolase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in cellular metabolism. The protein exists in two isoforms, TALDO1L (long) and TALDO1S (short), which are generated by alternative translational initiation and exhibit differential nucleocytoplasmic distribution. TALDO1L is recognized by importin α1 and α4, facilitating its nuclear import in an importin α/β-dependent manner, while TALDO1S remains in the cytoplasm due to its lack of recognition by these importins (Moriyama2016Two). TALDO1 can form both homo- and hetero-dimers, with the presence of TALDO1L influencing the subcellular distribution of TALDO1S. This dimerization is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and the deletion of the first 10 amino acids of TALDO1L does not affect its dimerization potential (Moriyama2016Two).

TALDO1 also interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In TALDO1-deficient livers, there is reduced phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation and nuclear translocation, which suggests a regulatory role for TALDO1 in β-catenin signaling (Hanczko2009Prevention). These interactions highlight TALDO1's involvement in both metabolic and signaling pathways, impacting cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis.
