# ANGPTL8

## Overview
ANGPTL8, also known as betatrophin, is a gene that encodes the angiopoietin-like 8 protein, which is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of triglycerides. ANGPTL8 is predominantly expressed in the liver and adipose tissues, where it forms complexes with other angiopoietin-like proteins, such as ANGPTL3, to regulate plasma triglyceride levels (Chi2017ANGPTL8). The expression of ANGPTL8 is influenced by nutritional status and insulin signaling, linking it to both lipid and glucose metabolism (Zhang2016The; AbuFarha2020The). Variants in the ANGPTL8 gene have been associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (ElLebedy2018Interaction; Xu2021Analysis).

## Structure
The ANGPTL8 protein is encoded by the ANGPTL8 gene located on chromosome 19 and consists of four exons that encode a protein of 198 amino acids. The protein includes a signal peptide of 20 amino acids at the N-terminus, a specific epitope 1 domain, and two coiled coil domains. The specific epitope 1 domain is necessary for the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), while the coiled coil domains are essential for forming complexes with ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 (Akimoto2019Histology).

Post-translational modifications of ANGPTL8 include eight O-glycosylation sites and a potential ubiquitination site at position 158. A cysteine residue at position seven is a high-potential palmitoylation site. Lysine residues at positions 62, 124, and 158 have high potential for acetylation (Iqbal2023An).

The study identified two splice variants of ANGPTL8 mRNA in the liver. Splice Variant 1 lacks 146 base pairs of exon 1, resulting in a truncated protein with 63 amino acids due to a premature stop codon in exon 2. Splice Variant 2 lacks 162 base pairs, including the entire exon 2, producing a shorter version of ANGPTL8 (Akimoto2019Histology).

## Function
ANGPTL8, also known as betatrophin, is a protein that plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It is primarily expressed in the liver and adipose tissues and is involved in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which is crucial for the hydrolysis of circulating triglycerides into free fatty acids for uptake by peripheral tissues (Chi2017ANGPTL8; AbuFarha2020The). ANGPTL8 functions by forming a complex with ANGPTL3, enhancing ANGPTL3's ability to inhibit LPL, thereby modulating plasma triglyceride levels (Chi2017ANGPTL8).

The expression of ANGPTL8 is influenced by nutritional status, being upregulated during feeding and downregulated during fasting. This regulation is mediated by insulin signaling and other pathways, affecting lipid storage and mobilization in tissues such as white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle (Zhang2016The; AbuFarha2020The). ANGPTL8 is also implicated in glucose metabolism and has been linked to the regulation of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (AbuFarha2020The). These functions highlight ANGPTL8's role in maintaining lipid and glucose homeostasis in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANGPTL8 gene have been linked to several metabolic disorders. The c194C>T variant allele in ANGPTL8 is associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The presence of this allele, along with specific variants in the CETP and NOS3 genes, can elevate the risk of T2DM by 13.22-fold and CVD by 8.86-fold, highlighting the gene's clinical impact when combined with other genetic factors (ElLebedy2018Interaction).

The rs2278426 variant in ANGPTL8, which results in an arginine to tryptophan substitution, is associated with changes in cholesterol levels, specifically decreasing total cholesterol and HDL-C levels in certain populations. This variant also affects the cleavage of ANGPTL3, which is modulated by insulin, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism and potential implications for conditions related to cholesterol levels (Hanson2016The).

ANGPTL8 expression is also implicated in cancer prognosis. It is expressed at higher levels in certain cancers, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and is associated with poor prognosis in these cases. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker in cancer (Xu2021Analysis).

## Interactions
ANGPTL8 interacts with several proteins, forming complexes that play crucial roles in lipid metabolism and other physiological processes. A significant interaction is with ANGPTL3, where ANGPTL8 enhances ANGPTL3's ability to bind and inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This interaction is essential for the regulation of plasma triglyceride levels, as the ANGPTL3-ANGPTL8 complex is necessary for efficient LPL inhibition. The complex formation occurs primarily when ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 are co-expressed, indicating a specific and robust interaction within the cell (Chi2017ANGPTL8).

ANGPTL8 also interacts with RASSF5, as demonstrated by protein-protein docking analysis, which revealed a reliable structure involving multiple hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts. This interaction suggests a role for ANGPTL8 in cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Iqbal2023An).

In addition to these interactions, ANGPTL8 is involved in various signaling pathways. It interacts with nuclear SREBP1 to inhibit AMPK, influencing lipogenesis and tumor growth. ANGPTL8 also affects the ERK and AKT pathways, impacting glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis (Navaeian2021ANGPTL8). These interactions highlight ANGPTL8's multifaceted role in metabolic regulation and disease processes.
