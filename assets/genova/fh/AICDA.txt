# AICDA

## Overview
The AICDA gene encodes the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a member of the cytidine deaminase family, which plays a pivotal role in the adaptive immune system. AID is primarily involved in the processes of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in B lymphocytes, which are essential for antibody diversification and the effective immune response. The enzyme functions by deaminating cytidine residues in single-stranded DNA, a critical step in the generation of antibody diversity. AID's activity is tightly regulated through interactions with various proteins and post-translational modifications, ensuring its precise function within the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Dysregulation or mutations in the AICDA gene can lead to immunodeficiencies and contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Durandy2006Activationinduced; Shinkura2004Separate; Zan2013Regulation).

## Structure
The AICDA gene encodes the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a 198-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 24 kDa. AID contains a functional cytidine deaminase domain crucial for its role in class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B cells (Durandy2006Activationinduced). The protein shares homology with Apolipoprotein B editing complex 1 (APOBEC-1) and includes a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminus and a nuclear export signal (NES) at the C-terminus. A leucine-rich region at the C-terminus is likely involved in protein-protein interactions (Durandy2006Activationinduced).

AID's active site features a catalytic proton-donating residue E58 and a Zn2+ ion coordinated by H56, C87, C90, and a fourth ligand, such as water or cacodylic acid. The substrate channel is formed by specific loops, with the b4-a4 loop being crucial for hotspot specificity (Qiao2017AID). AID prefers G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures, which mimic immunoglobulin switch regions, due to their bundled single-stranded DNA overhangs (Qiao2017AID). The protein can oligomerize upon G4 binding, which may enhance its recruitment and accumulation in immunoglobulin switch regions (Qiao2017AID). 

Post-translational modifications, such as serine phosphorylation by protein kinase A, regulate AID's activity, enabling it to deaminate cytidine residues on single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (Durandy2006Activationinduced).

## Function
The AICDA gene encodes the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which plays a critical role in the adaptive immune response by facilitating antibody diversification in B lymphocytes. AID is essential for two key processes: somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR). SHM introduces point mutations in the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, enhancing the affinity of antibodies for their antigens (Shinkura2004Separate). CSR involves the recombination of the heavy chain constant region genes, allowing B cells to produce antibodies of different isotypes, thereby diversifying their effector functions without altering antigen specificity (Ta2003AID; Shinkura2004Separate).

AID functions by deaminating cytidine residues in single-stranded DNA, converting them to uracil, which initiates DNA cleavage and repair processes necessary for SHM and CSR (Shinkura2004Separate; Barreto2003CTerminal). The enzyme is primarily active in the nucleus of activated B cells, particularly within germinal centers, where it interacts with specific cofactors that guide its activity to either the variable or switch regions of immunoglobulin genes (Ta2003AID; Shinkura2004Separate). Mutations in AICDA can lead to immunodeficiencies such as hyper-IgM syndrome type 2, characterized by defective CSR but retained SHM (Fiorini2004A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the AICDA gene, which encodes activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), are associated with several immunodeficiency disorders and contribute to genomic instability, leading to various diseases. Hyper-IgM Syndrome Type 2 (HIGM2) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by mutations in AICDA, characterized by elevated IgM levels and low levels of other immunoglobulins. This condition can result from both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, with specific mutations such as R190X and L189X leading to impaired class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) (Della2024A; Imai2005Analysis).

Aberrant expression of AID is linked to autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, where increased AID expression correlates with higher levels of autoantibodies (Zan2013Regulation). Dysregulated AID expression is also implicated in tumorigenesis, contributing to mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, which can lead to lymphomas and other cancers such as gastric, colonic, and breast cancers (Zan2013Regulation). The misexpression of AID in epithelial tissues connects inflammation, somatic mutations, and cancer development, underscoring the importance of regulating AID expression to maintain genomic stability (Zan2013Regulation).

## Interactions
AICDA, also known as activation-induced cytidine deaminase, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids that regulate its function in class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). AICDA interacts with Replication Protein A (RPA), specifically the 32-kDa subunit RPA32, which is part of a heterotrimeric complex including RPA70 and RPA14. This interaction is crucial for AICDA's role in deaminating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) within transcription bubbles, facilitating access to its substrates (Chaudhuri2004Replication; Vuong2012Combinatorial). The interaction between AICDA and RPA is not mediated by ssDNA, as demonstrated by DNase treatment, and is specific, as other ssDNA-binding proteins cannot substitute for RPA (Chaudhuri2004Replication).

AICDA also interacts with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), which processes uracil residues resulting from AICDA-mediated deamination, leading to abasic sites and single-strand DNA breaks necessary for CSR (Durandy2006Activationinduced). Additionally, AICDA is associated with proteins such as RAG1/RAG2, XRCC6, MDM2, and PKA, which are involved in the diversification of immunoglobulin genes and may direct AICDA towards specific DNA regions (Wang2008A). These interactions highlight AICDA's role in antibody diversification and its involvement in a complex network of protein interactions.
