# LBP

## Overview
Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is a gene that encodes a critical component of the innate immune system, the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. This protein is a glycoprotein primarily synthesized by hepatocytes and is classified as an acute-phase protein within the lipid transfer/LBP family. LBP plays a pivotal role in the immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infections by binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a major component of the bacterial outer membrane. It facilitates the transfer of LPS to CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complexes, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of immune cells to LPS and triggering necessary inflammatory responses. Structurally, LBP is characterized by a unique tertiary structure with two pseudosymmetric barrel domains, which are essential for its function in LPS binding and transfer. The protein's interactions with other immune components, such as CD14 and TLR4, underscore its importance in modulating immune responses and its potential implications in various infectious and inflammatory conditions (JERALA2007Structural; Eckert2013The; Schumann1990Structure).

## Structure
Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) is a 58-60 kDa serum glycoprotein primarily synthesized by hepatocytes. It belongs to the acute-phase proteins and is part of the lipid transfer/LBP family, which includes bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (JERALA2007Structural). The primary structure of LBP includes a signal peptide and a mature protein of 452 residues, with four cysteines and five potential glycosylation sites (Schumann1990Structure).

LBP's tertiary structure is characterized by two pseudosymmetric barrel domains in a banana-like shape, connected by a proline-rich linker. Each domain contains an antiparallel beta-stranded layer twisted around a long alpha-helix (JERALA2007Structural). The N-terminal domain is crucial for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding, featuring cationic residues that interact with LPS (Eckert2013The). The C-terminal domain contains a negatively charged groove and a hydrophobic 'phenylalanine core,' which is involved in interactions with CD14 and the transfer of LPS to the MD-2-TLR4 complex (Eckert2013The).

LBP does not typically form quaternary structures but interacts with other proteins like CD14 to facilitate LPS transfer and signaling (JERALA2007Structural). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in the immune response, with mutations potentially affecting its function and stability (Eckert2013The).

## Function
Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in the recognition and response to Gram-negative bacterial infections. LBP is a 60 kDa glycoprotein synthesized mainly by hepatocytes and is present in the bloodstream. It binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating their transfer to CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) complexes on host cells. This interaction enhances the sensitivity of immune cells to LPS, triggering inflammatory responses essential for combating bacterial infections (Weiss2003Bactericidalpermeabilityincreasing; Schumann1990Structure).

LBP also plays a role in intracellular LPS signaling. It is internalized by host cells and colocalizes with LPS in the cytoplasm, suggesting a function in delivering LPS to intracellular compartments. This process is significant for activating pro-inflammatory caspases, such as caspase-4 and -5, which are involved in inflammatory cell activation and pyroptosis (Kopp2016Lipopolysaccharidebinding). LBP's ability to bind and transport LPS both extracellularly and intracellularly highlights its versatile role in immune regulation and response to bacterial infections (Kopp2016Lipopolysaccharidebinding).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LBP gene have been associated with various infectious and inflammatory conditions. The rs2232613 SNP, for instance, leads to a structural alteration in LBP, impairing its ability to bind bacterial ligands and induce cytokine production. This mutation is linked to increased mortality in patients with sepsis and pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacteria, suggesting a diminished inflammatory response and a higher risk of severe infections (Eckert2013The). Another mutation, rs2232618, is associated with traumatic sepsis and increased TNF-a production, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Meng2021Effects).

Alterations in LBP expression levels are also clinically significant. Elevated LBP levels are observed during systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, as well as in individuals with obesity or metabolic disorders, likely due to chronic low-grade inflammation (Meng2021Effects). These changes in LBP levels and function can influence the course of infections and inflammatory diseases, highlighting the importance of LBP in the immune response and its potential as a therapeutic target (Meng2021Effects; Eckert2013The).

## Interactions
Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) interacts with several proteins to facilitate immune responses. LBP binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria and forms complexes that are recognized by CD14, which can be either membrane-bound (mCD14) or soluble (sCD14). In mCD14-positive cells, LBP significantly enhances cytokine expression, while in mCD14-negative cells, LBP transfers LPS to sCD14, which is then recognized by receptors such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Ding2013The). LBP also interacts with moesin, forming a complex with CD14 that induces TLR4-MD2 signaling (Ding2013The).

LBP acts as a carrier protein for LPS in plasma, controlling LPS-dependent monocytic responses and functioning as an opsonin. This interaction induces the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by macrophages, mediated by CD14 (Wright1990CD14). LBP can also bind to phospholipid membranes, particularly those containing negatively charged lipids like phosphatidylserine, and this interaction is crucial for LPS-mediated activation of mononuclear cells (Gutsmann2001Dual). LBP's interaction with lipoproteins, particularly LDL and VLDL, enhances the binding of LPS to these lipoproteins, which is crucial for mitigating the toxic effects of LPS (Vreugdenhil2001LPSbinding).
