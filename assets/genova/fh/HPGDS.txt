# HPGDS

## Overview
The HPGDS gene encodes the enzyme hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS), which is a member of the sigma class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). This enzyme is primarily involved in the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a key lipid mediator in various physiological processes, including immune response and inflammation regulation (Urade2021Biochemical). H-PGDS is predominantly expressed in mast cells and antigen-presenting cells, where it plays a significant role in modulating immune functions and inflammatory pathways (Farhat2011HematopoieticProstaglandin). Structurally, H-PGDS is characterized by its homodimeric form, with each monomer containing a thioredoxin-like domain and a C-terminal domain, and is activated by metal ions such as calcium and magnesium (Inoue2003Mechanism; Kanaoka1997Cloning). The enzyme's activity and expression have been implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer suppression and allergic inflammation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Rittchen2019Therapeutic; Park2007Hematopoietic).

## Structure
The human hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) is a member of the sigma class of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and is composed of 198 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa (Inoue2003Mechanism; Kado2012Human). The protein structure includes two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, connected by a region with two turn structures (Kanaoka2000Structure). The N-terminal domain is highly conserved across species, while the C-terminal domain is more diverse (Kanaoka2000Structure).

H-PGDS forms a homodimer, with each monomer featuring a thioredoxin-like domain and a C-terminal domain (Kanaoka1997Cloning). The enzyme's active site contains a glutathione-binding site, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (Kanaoka1997Cloning). The structure is characterized by a deep and wide substrate binding cleft, distinct from other GST classes, which enhances its catalytic efficiency and specificity (Kanaoka1997Cloning).

The enzyme is activated by metal ions such as calcium and magnesium, which bind at the dimer interface and induce structural changes that affect its activity (Inoue2003Mechanism). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a lipid mediator involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, HPGDS is primarily active in mast cells and antigen-presenting cells, where it plays a crucial role in immune responses and inflammation regulation (Urade2021Biochemical).

In the context of ovarian physiology, HPGDS-produced PGD2 enhances follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) signaling by increasing the expression of FSH and luteinizing hormone receptors, which leads to the activation of steroidogenic genes and progesterone secretion. This process is essential for regulating follicular growth and maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation of granulosa cells (Farhat2011HematopoieticProstaglandin).

HPGDS also influences macrophage polarization in adipose tissue, promoting an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. This polarization is associated with improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting a protective role in metabolic health. In obesity, despite increased PGD2 and HPGDS expression, the receptor CRTH2 is downregulated, indicating potential impairment in PGD2 signaling (Virtue2015Prostaglandin).

Overall, HPGDS is integral to the production of PGD2, impacting various biological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the HPGDS gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, particularly familial adenomatous polyposis, HPGDS has been shown to play a suppressive role in tumor development. Studies using Apc Min/+ mice, a model for this condition, demonstrated that disruption of the HPGDS gene leads to a significant increase in the number of intestinal adenomas, while transgenic expression of human HPGDS results in a substantial reduction in adenoma formation (Park2007Hematopoietic).

In allergic inflammation, HPGDS is involved in the production of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which mediates inflammatory responses. Its expression in macrophages, dendritic cells, and Th2 cells is linked to allergic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. Inhibitors of HPGDS have shown potential in reducing PGD2 synthesis, thereby alleviating symptoms and reducing airway remodeling in asthma (Rittchen2019Therapeutic).

The Val187Ile variant of HPGDS, common among African Americans, is characterized by increased stability but has not been associated with a significant change in colorectal cancer risk (Tippin2012Hematopoietic).
