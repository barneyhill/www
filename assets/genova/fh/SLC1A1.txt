# SLC1A1

## Overview
The SLC1A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 1 member 1, also known as excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) or EAAC1. This protein is a transmembrane transporter primarily involved in the high-affinity uptake of glutamate, an essential neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. EAAT3 plays a critical role in maintaining glutamate homeostasis by regulating extracellular glutamate levels, thereby preventing excitotoxicity and ensuring proper synaptic transmission (Bianchi2013Changes; Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The). Additionally, EAAT3 is involved in cysteine uptake, which is vital for glutathione synthesis, contributing to antioxidant defense mechanisms in neurons (Bianchi2013Changes). The protein's function is modulated by various interactions and regulatory mechanisms, including alternative splicing and protein-protein interactions, which influence its trafficking and activity (Kanai2004The; Porton2013Isoforms). Mutations and polymorphisms in the SLC1A1 gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in glutamatergic neurotransmission (Afshari2015Characterization; Samuels2011Comprehensive).

## Structure
The SLC1A1 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), a member of the neuronal high-affinity glutamate transporter family. The protein is integral to the plasma membrane, facilitating the transport of glutamate across cell membranes. It features multiple transmembrane domains, with eight predicted alpha-helical segments that are crucial for its function (Afshari2015Characterization; Kanai2004The). The protein's structure includes a highly conserved hydrophobic stretch near the C-terminus, which is important for its activity (Kanai2004The).

The tertiary structure of SLC1A1 involves a complex arrangement of transmembrane helices, forming a trimeric assembly that is essential for its function (Yernool2004Structure). The protein's quaternary structure is characterized by the trimerization of its subunits, which is necessary for effective glutamate transport (Yernool2004Structure).

SLC1A1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that can negatively modulate glutamate uptake, which may be relevant to conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (Porton2013Isoforms). These isoforms involve in-frame deletions that potentially affect the protein's transmembrane helices, altering its function (Porton2013Isoforms).

## Function
The SLC1A1 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), also known as EAAC1, which is a high-affinity glutamate transporter primarily expressed in neurons and epithelial cells. In the central nervous system, EAAT3 is crucial for maintaining glutamate homeostasis by regulating extracellular glutamate levels, thereby preventing excitotoxicity and ensuring proper synaptic transmission (Bianchi2013Changes; Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The). This transporter is predominantly located post-synaptically, where it buffers glutamate receptors and modulates excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The).

EAAT3 also plays a significant role in cysteine uptake, which is essential for the synthesis of glutathione, a major antioxidant in the central nervous system. This function is particularly important in neurons, where it contributes to the antioxidant defense and protection against oxidative stress (Bianchi2013Changes). In the kidneys, SLC1A1 is involved in the reabsorption of glutamate and aspartate from the renal proximal tubules, highlighting its role in amino acid transport and homeostasis (Bailey2011Lossoffunction; Kanai2004The). The transporter's activity is regulated by rapid membrane trafficking mechanisms, which modulate its abundance and function in response to cellular needs (Bianchi2013Changes).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC1A1 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In schizophrenia, a specific hemi-deletion in the SLC1A1 gene has been identified, which affects the promoter and first exon, leading to impaired glutamate transport. This deletion co-segregates with psychosis in a family from Palau, suggesting a new susceptibility locus, SCZD18 (Afshari2015Characterization). The deletion impacts the transmembrane domain crucial for glutamate transport, potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through altered glutamate signaling and increased oxidative stress (Afshari2015Characterization; Myles‐Worsley2013Deletion).

In OCD, several studies have reported significant associations between the disorder and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC1A1. These genetic variations are linked to altered glutamate neurotransmission, which is thought to play a role in OCD pathogenesis (Samuels2011Comprehensive). The gene's expression in brain regions such as the cortex, striatum, and thalamus, which are important for glutamate neurotransmission, further supports its involvement in OCD (Samuels2011Comprehensive).

Overall, the SLC1A1 gene's role in maintaining normal extracellular glutamate levels is crucial, and its disruption is linked to dysfunctions in glutamatergic transmission, contributing to the development of these disorders (Myles‐Worsley2013Deletion).

## Interactions
The SLC1A1 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3), also known as EAAC1, which is involved in the transport of glutamate across cell membranes. EAAT3 interacts with several proteins that modulate its function and trafficking. One significant interaction is with GTRAP3-18, a protein that inhibits EAAT3 by decreasing its affinity for glutamate and delaying its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction affects EAAT3 levels and is associated with oxidative stress protection and enhanced learning in mice (Kanai2004The; Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The).

EAAT3 is also regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) through intracellular trafficking events, which can increase its presence on the plasma membrane, potentially enhancing synaptic potentiation and neuroprotection (Kanai2004The; Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The). Additionally, EAAT3 interacts with Rab proteins, particularly Rab11, which are involved in its endocytosis and recycling processes (Bjørn-Yoshimoto2016The).

Alternative isoforms of EAAT3, such as ex2skip and ex11skip, can negatively modulate glutamate uptake by interacting with the full-length EAAC1 protein, potentially disrupting the formation of a functional transporter complex (Porton2013Isoforms). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing EAAT3 function and its role in maintaining glutamate homeostasis.
