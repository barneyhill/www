# AMIGO2

## Overview
AMIGO2 is a gene that encodes the adhesion molecule with Ig-like domain 2, a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which facilitate its role as a cell adhesion molecule. AMIGO2 is crucial for neuronal growth, survival, and axon tract development, contributing to the stability and function of neural networks (KujaPanula2003AMIGO; Chen2006AMIGO). Beyond its physiological roles, AMIGO2 is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression is often altered, influencing tumor progression and metastasis. This makes it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (NAKAMURA2020AMIGO2; Han2022Integrated).

## Structure
AMIGO2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by a tandem array of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain. The primary structure of AMIGO2 includes a putative signal sequence for secretion, six LRRs flanked by cysteine-rich LRRNT and LRRCT domains, and an Ig domain near the transmembrane region (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The extracellular portion of AMIGO2 is similar to other AMIGO family members, with conserved motifs in the NH2-terminal cysteine-rich domain and the LRRs (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). 

The secondary structure likely involves the LRRs forming a solenoid structure, which is common in proteins with LRRs (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). The tertiary structure is expected to involve the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional conformation, potentially forming a horseshoe shape typical of LRR proteins (KujaPanula2003AMIGO). 

AMIGO2's cytoplasmic tail is rich in serine and threonine residues, suggesting a role in signal transduction, and it may be phosphorylated by several kinases (Rabenau2004DEGAAMIGO2). The protein is also glycosylated, which may influence its function and stability (Chen2012AMIGO). AMIGO2 is involved in cell adhesion and is differentially expressed in certain cancers, such as gastric adenocarcinoma (Rabenau2004DEGAAMIGO2).

## Function
AMIGO2, a member of the AMIGO family of proteins, is primarily expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in neuronal growth and survival. It is involved in axon tract development and functions as a cell adhesion molecule, facilitating cell-cell interactions crucial for neural development (KujaPanula2003AMIGO; Chen2006AMIGO). The protein is characterized by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin-like domain, which are important for its interactions with other proteins and extracellular ligands (KujaPanula2003AMIGO).

AMIGO2 promotes depolarization-dependent survival of cerebellar granule neurons and possibly hippocampal neurons, suggesting its role in maintaining neuronal viability under specific conditions (Chen2006AMIGO). It is also involved in modulating neuronal cell adhesion, which is essential for processes like axonal pathfinding and synapse organization (Chen2006AMIGO). The expression of AMIGO2 is regulated by neuronal activity, indicating its dynamic role in response to cellular signals (Chen2006AMIGO).

In healthy human cells, AMIGO2's primary function is related to neuronal growth and survival, acting as a cell adhesion molecule that facilitates these processes, contributing to the stability and function of neural networks (Chen2006AMIGO).

## Clinical Significance
AMIGO2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In gastric cancer, AMIGO2 is overexpressed and associated with a higher-grade malignant phenotype, shorter disease-free survival, and overall survival, indicating poor clinical outcomes. Its expression correlates with genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis (NAKAMURA2020AMIGO2). In prostate cancer, AMIGO2 is linked to poor recurrence-free survival and resistance to the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. It promotes cancer progression through EMT and is considered a reliable prognostic marker (Han2022Integrated).

In colorectal cancer, AMIGO2 expression is associated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis. A specific monoclonal antibody has been developed to improve the accuracy of detecting AMIGO2 expression, which is a significant prognostic biomarker for liver metastases (Goto2022Establishment). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, AMIGO2 is linked to immune microenvironment alterations, particularly the polarization of M2 macrophages, which are associated with poor antitumor immunity (Chen2024AMIGO2). These findings suggest that AMIGO2 plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
AMIGO2 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with PDK1, a key regulator of the Akt signaling pathway, which is important for cell survival and angiogenesis. The interaction occurs between the CD domain of AMIGO2 and the PH domain of PDK1, facilitating the localization and activation of PDK1 at the plasma membrane, which in turn activates Akt (Park2015AMIGO2). This interaction is specific and can be disrupted by a PIP3 antagonist, indicating the involvement of PIP3 in the binding process (Park2015AMIGO2).

AMIGO2 also interacts with CAPN2 in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) cells. This interaction promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, and overexpression of CAPN2 can counteract the effects of AMIGO2 knockdown, suggesting a functional synergy between these proteins in tumorigenesis (Gu2022AmphoterinInduced).

Additionally, AMIGO2 can engage in homophilic and heterophilic interactions with other members of the AMIGO protein family, such as AMIGO and AMIGO3. These interactions are mediated by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs and are involved in cell adhesion and signaling (Rabenau2004DEGAAMIGO2; KujaPanula2003AMIGO).
