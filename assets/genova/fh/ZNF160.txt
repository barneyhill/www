# ZNF160

## Overview
ZNF160 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 160, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. As a transcription factor, zinc finger protein 160 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of immune response and cellular differentiation. It is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of the tlr4 gene and interactions with microRNAs, which modulate its activity in different cellular environments (Kong2017Differences; Kriegel2010MicroRNAtarget). The protein's involvement in diseases such as Alzheimer's, breast cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis highlights its significance in pathogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Morello2023A; Kong2017Differences). Additionally, alterations in the methylation patterns of ZNF160 have been associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor and its potential utility as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF160 has been implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) through alterations in its DNA methylation patterns. Studies have shown that ZNF160 is hypermethylated in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, which is associated with decreased gene expression. This hypermethylation suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, as it may contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressor functions (Gaykalova2015Outlier). The methylation status of ZNF160, along with other zinc finger proteins, has been proposed as a biomarker for HNSCC due to the significant differences in methylation between tumor and normal samples (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

The clinical significance of ZNF160 in HNSCC is underscored by its potential use in early detection and diagnosis. The gene's hypermethylation in tumor cells, leading to reduced expression, supports its role as a tumor suppressor gene. This is further supported by the presence of a KRAB-A domain in ZNF160, which is associated with transcriptional repression (Gaykalova2015Outlier). Despite these findings, the sensitivity of ZNF160 as a biomarker is low, indicating the need for additional biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

## Interactions
ZNF160, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and breast cancer (BC), ZNF160 acts as a transcription factor (TF) with increased activity in AD-affected samples. It is involved in the regulation of the tlr4 gene, which plays a role in immune response and T cell generation (Kong2017Differences). 

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ZNF160 is identified as a hub gene within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, suggesting its significant role in transcriptional regulation and potential involvement in ALS pathogenesis (Morello2023A). 

ZNF160 is also a target of several microRNAs, including hsa-miR-369-5p, hsa-miR-188-3p, hsa-miR-493, and hsa-miR-127-5p, indicating its regulation by these miRNAs in human renal epithelial cells treated with transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) (Kriegel2010MicroRNAtarget). 

In leukemic K562 cells, ZNF160 interacts with both wild-type and mutant TRIM28, indicating its involvement in the regulation of gene expression through interactions with TRIM28 (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
