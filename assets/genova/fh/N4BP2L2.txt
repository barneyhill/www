# N4BP2L2

## Overview
N4BP2L2 is a gene that encodes the protein NEDD4 binding protein 2 like 2, also known as PFAAP5. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of neutrophil production and differentiation, functioning as a nuclear adapter that facilitates interactions between neutrophil elastase and the transcription factor Gfi1. PFAAP5 is expressed in bone marrow and peripheral blood, indicating its role in hematopoietic processes. It is implicated in transcriptional regulation and cellular response to DNA damage, suggesting a broader role in cellular stress responses. The protein's interactions with Gfi1 and neutrophil elastase are crucial for transcriptional repression, and it may also play a role in viral infections and cancer progression through its involvement in ubiquitination processes and as a competing endogenous RNA (Ghildiyal2021Deciphering; Salipante2009Contributions; Yang2022CircN4BP2L2).

## Function
The N4BP2L2 gene encodes a protein known as PFAAP5, which plays a significant role in the regulation of neutrophil production and differentiation. PFAAP5 is a nuclear protein that acts as an adapter, facilitating interactions between neutrophil elastase and the transcription factor Gfi1. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of neutrophil elastase, which is important for neutrophil differentiation and function (Salipante2009Contributions). 

PFAAP5 is expressed in bone marrow and peripheral blood, indicating its involvement in hematopoietic processes. It is implicated in transcriptional regulation, sharing homology with B3BP, a protein known to interact with transcriptional regulators (Salipante2009Contributions). The protein is also phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, suggesting a role in cellular regulation and response to stress (Salipante2009Contributions).

In cellular processes, PFAAP5 is necessary for the enhanced repressor activity of Gfi1 in the presence of neutrophil elastase, particularly when the elastase contains an intact carboxyl terminus. This suggests that PFAAP5 may facilitate the nuclear trafficking of neutrophil elastase, enhancing its corepressor activity with Gfi1 (Salipante2009Contributions).

## Clinical Significance
The N4BP2L2 gene has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the circular RNA derived from N4BP2L2, known as circN4BP2L2, is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is associated with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis. Functional studies have shown that circN4BP2L2 promotes CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its knockdown reduces tumor growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, circN4BP2L2 acts as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-340-5p, leading to increased expression of CXCR4, a gene involved in cancer progression (Yang2022CircN4BP2L2).

In membranous nephropathy (MN), the long non-coding RNA N4BP2L2-IT2 is identified as a hub gene with potential diagnostic value. It is scarcely expressed in MN samples and is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Han2023Identification).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), N4BP2L2 is noted for its upstream functional interactions with ATM, indicating a potential role in signaling pathways that contribute to CLL progression (Griffen2021Multivariate). These findings highlight the clinical significance of N4BP2L2 in various diseases, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
N4BP2L2, also known as PFAAP5, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with Gfi1, a transcriptional repressor, and neutrophil elastase, a protease encoded by the ELA2 gene. These interactions suggest that N4BP2L2 mediates transcriptional repressor cooperation between Gfi1 and neutrophil elastase, allowing neutrophil elastase to enhance the repression of Gfi1 target genes. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of neutrophil production and is implicated in conditions like cyclic neutropenia and severe congenital neutropenia (Salipante2009Contributions).

N4BP2L2 also interacts with the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) nsP3 protein. This interaction may contribute to neutropenia observed during CHIKV infections and could influence the viral replication process. N4BP2L2's role in this context is linked to its transcription co-repressor activity and potential involvement in ubiquitination processes (Ghildiyal2021Deciphering).

In colorectal cancer, a circular RNA derived from N4BP2L2, known as circN4BP2L2, acts as a competing endogenous RNA by binding to miR-340-5p, thereby regulating the expression of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor involved in cancer progression (Yang2022CircN4BP2L2).
