# TACC2

## Overview
TACC2, or transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the TACC family, which is characterized by a conserved TACC domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's role in centrosome function and microtubule dynamics, particularly during mitosis. The TACC2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, through its interactions with histone acetyltransferases and other chromatin-associated proteins (Gergely2000The; Still2004Functional). TACC2's involvement in cell cycle progression and genomic stability underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Thakur2013Role). Clinically, TACC2 has been implicated in several cancers, such as prostate and breast cancer, where it may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Takayama2012TACC2; Tei2009Simian).

## Structure
TACC2 is characterized by a conserved TACC domain, approximately 200 amino acids in length, which is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure. This domain is crucial for the protein's localization to centrosomes and microtubules (Gergely2000The). The TACC domain is located at the carboxy terminus of the protein and is encoded by the final exons of the gene (Still2004Structurefunction). TACC2 can form large polymeric structures in the cytoplasm when overexpressed, consisting of many layers of a regularly spaced electron-dense matrix with an interlayer spacing of about 35 nm, which aligns with the expected length of the TACC domain's coiled-coil (Gergely2000The).

TACC2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, such as TACC2s and TACC2l, which may have significant functional differences (Still2004Structurefunction). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Thakur2013Role). The TACC domain is a defining feature that distinguishes TACC proteins from other coiled-coil-rich proteins and plays a role in microtubule dynamics during mitotic cell division (Thakur2013Role).

## Function
TACC2 (transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 2) is a member of the TACC family of proteins, which are involved in centrosome function and microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, TACC2 is strongly concentrated at centrosomes throughout the cell cycle and plays a crucial role in mitotic spindle assembly and stability, which is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Gergely2000The). The TACC domain, a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil region, is vital for the localization of TACC2 to centrosomes and its interaction with microtubules (Gergely2000The).

TACC2 is also involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It interacts with histone acetyltransferases, such as pCAF and hGCN5, suggesting a role in modulating histone acetylation and gene expression (Still2004Functional). This interaction indicates that TACC2 may coordinate elements of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional machinery within the nucleus, impacting cell growth and differentiation (Still2004Functional).

In addition to its role in mitosis, TACC2 is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and cell cycle progression, contributing to the overall cellular and organismal homeostasis (Thakur2013Role).

## Clinical Significance
The TACC2 gene is clinically significant in various cancers, particularly prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, TACC2 is identified as an androgen-regulated gene that promotes cell proliferation and tumor progression. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and castration-resistant tumor growth, making it a potential prognostic marker for aggressive prostate cancer (Takayama2012TACC2). TACC2's role in cell cycle regulation is crucial, as its knockdown leads to cell cycle arrest, while overexpression accelerates cell cycle progression, particularly in the G2/M phase (Takayama2012TACC2).

In breast cancer, TACC2 is often downregulated as tumors become more malignant, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. Overexpression of TACC2 has been shown to revert malignant phenotypes to benign ones, indicating its involvement in tumor suppression (Raff2002Centrosomes; Tei2009Simian).

TACC2 is also implicated in chromosomal stability and mitotic spindle assembly. Its interaction with the Simian virus 40 large T antigen can lead to microtubule dysfunction and chromosomal instability, contributing to cancer development (Tei2009Simian). Additionally, a rare FGFR2-TACC2 fusion mutation has been identified in pancreatic cancer, which responds well to targeted therapy with FGFR inhibitors (Poon2021Stage).

## Interactions
TACC2 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It forms complexes with the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) pCAF and hGCN5, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. TACC2 does not directly affect the acetylation activity of pCAF but can negate the inhibitory effect of DNA-PK on pCAF's HAT activity, suggesting a modulatory role in histone acetylation (Still2004Functional). TACC2 also interacts with the SWI/SNF core component INI-1 and GAS41, indicating its involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional processes (Still2004Functional).

In the context of microtubule dynamics, TACC2 interacts with tubulin and is strongly concentrated at centrosomes, particularly during mitosis. It forms large cytoplasmic structures that sequester tubulin in nocodazole-treated cells, indicating a role in microtubule organization (Gergely2000The). TACC2 also interacts with Aurora-C kinase, but not with Aurora-A or Aurora-B, suggesting a selective involvement in protein interaction networks related to cell division (Tien2004Identification). These interactions highlight TACC2's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and microtubule dynamics.
