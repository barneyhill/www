# NAA30

## Overview
The NAA30 gene encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 30, NatC catalytic subunit, a key component of the NatC complex involved in N-terminal acetylation, a prevalent post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. This protein, characterized by a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein stability, folding, and subcellular localization (Starheim2009Composition; Varland2018Identification). NAA30 is essential for mitochondrial function and is implicated in the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus and the TOR signaling pathway, which are vital for cell growth and metabolism (Starheim2009Composition). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and associated with ribosomes, impacting protein synthesis and function (Varland2018Identification). Additionally, NAA30 has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Chelban2024Biallelic; Varland2018Identification).

## Structure
The NAA30 gene encodes the Naa30 protein, a catalytic subunit of the NatC complex, which is involved in N-terminal acetylation. Naa30 adopts a conserved Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) fold, characterized by a mixed α/β secondary structure. This includes four α-helices and seven β-strands, forming a typical NAT fold (Deng2021Molecular; grunwald2020structural). The protein contains a conserved Ac-CoA binding motif, R82XXG85XA87, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Deng2021Molecular).

Naa30 exists in two isoforms: the full-length Naa30 362 and the truncated Naa30 288. The latter lacks parts of the GNAT fold, including helices α1 and α2, which are important for the peptide binding pocket, potentially affecting its structure and enzymatic activity (Varland2018Identification).

In the quaternary structure, Naa30 forms part of the NatC complex with auxiliary subunits Naa35 and Naa38. Naa35 wraps around Naa30 in an open ring-like structure, while Naa38 is tethered to the complex through interactions with Naa35 (Deng2021Molecular; grunwald2020structural). The complex features two tunnels at the Naa30-Naa35 interface, with the thiol group of coenzyme A located in the 'side tunnel' containing the active site of Naa30 (grunwald2020structural).

## Function
The NAA30 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the NatC complex, which is involved in N-terminal acetylation, a common post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. This modification is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein stability, folding, and subcellular localization (Starheim2009Composition; Varland2018Identification). NAA30 primarily acetylates proteins with specific N-terminal sequences, such as Met-His and Met-Ile, influencing their function and stability (Varland2018Identification).

NAA30 is essential for mitochondrial function, as its knockdown leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of membrane potential (Varland2018Identification). It also plays a role in the structural organization of the Golgi apparatus and is involved in the TOR signaling pathway, which is important for cell growth and metabolism (Starheim2009Composition). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and associated with ribosomes, impacting protein synthesis and function (Varland2018Identification).

In addition to its cytoplasmic functions, an alternatively spliced variant of NAA30, known as Naa30 288, localizes to the nucleus, suggesting potential nuclear roles independent of its acetyltransferase activity (Varland2018Identification). The exact functions of this nuclear variant remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NAA30 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer. NAA30 is upregulated in several cancers, including glioblastoma, where its knockdown reduces cell viability and the sphere-forming ability of glioblastoma-initiating cells (Varland2018Identification). In thyroid cancer, a splice variant of NAA30, named Naa30 288, is predominantly found in the nucleus and is abundantly present in thyroid cancer tissues and various human cancer cell lines. This variant lacks significant acetyltransferase activity and does not inhibit apoptosis, unlike the full-length Naa30, which increases cell viability by inhibiting apoptosis (Varland2018Identification).

NAA30 is also associated with mitochondrial function, as its knockdown causes mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of membrane potential, which may contribute to its role in cancer (Varland2018Identification). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and low-grade glioma (LGG), NAA30 expression is associated with patient survival, indicating a potential negative association with survival in KIRC (Koufaris2020NTerminal).

Additionally, NAA30 variants have been linked to developmental delay, suggesting a role in neurodevelopmental disorders (Chelban2024Biallelic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NAA30 in both cancer and neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Interactions
NAA30, the catalytic subunit of the NatC complex, interacts with auxiliary subunits NAA35 and NAA38 to form a heterotrimeric complex essential for its function in N-terminal acetylation. The NAA35 subunit wraps around NAA30, forming a significant interface that stabilizes the complex, while NAA38 is tethered through interactions with NAA35, creating a ring-like structure around NAA38 (grunwald2020structural). The interaction between NAA30 and NAA35 is particularly extensive, involving specific hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, which are crucial for the complex's stability and function (Deng2021Molecular).

NAA30 also interacts with the ribosome, facilitated by the electropositive tip region of NAA35, which is necessary for the association of the NatC complex with the ribosome in vitro. This interaction suggests potential binding sites on the ribosome, particularly involving ribosomal RNA helices (grunwald2020structural). Additionally, NAA30's interaction with inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) at the interface with NAA35 contributes to the stability of the NatC complex, enhancing its thermal stability (Deng2021Molecular). These interactions highlight NAA30's role in protein modification and its involvement in various cellular processes.
