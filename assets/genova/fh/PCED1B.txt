# PCED1B

## Overview
PCED1B is a gene that encodes the protein PC-esterase domain containing 1B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its PC-esterase domain, suggesting a role in enzymatic activities related to ester hydrolysis. Although the precise biological functions of PC-esterase domain containing 1B are not fully elucidated, its interactions with long non-coding RNAs, such as PCED1B-AS1, have been shown to influence gene expression and cellular pathways associated with cancer progression. The gene's expression and its regulatory mechanisms are of particular interest in the context of oncogenesis, as alterations in its activity have been linked to the development and progression of several cancers, including glioma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancer (Yang2019LncRNA; Zhang2021Long; Cao2024LncRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCED1B gene, particularly through its interaction with the long non-coding RNA PCED1B-AS1, have been implicated in several diseases. In glioma, PCED1B-AS1 is upregulated and affects the expression of PCED1B, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This is mediated through the PCED1B-AS1/miR-194-5p/PCED1B axis, suggesting a significant role in glioma progression (Yang2019LncRNA).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), PCED1B-AS1 is also upregulated and promotes cancer progression by interacting with the miR-411-3p/HIF-1α axis. This interaction is associated with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, indicating its potential role in cancer aggressiveness (Zhang2021Long).

In gastric cancer, PCED1B-AS1 influences the expression of MAP2K7 through the miR-3681-3p/MAP2K7 axis, promoting metastasis, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This suggests that PCED1B-AS1 may contribute to the malignant progression of gastric cancer (Cao2024LncRNA).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PCED1B and its interactions, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for these cancers.
