# HUS1

## Overview
The HUS1 gene encodes the HUS1 checkpoint clamp component, a pivotal protein involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. This protein is a part of the RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex, a heterotrimeric DNA clamp that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating DNA repair processes. Structurally, the HUS1 protein shares similarities with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), forming a sliding clamp structure that interacts with DNA and other proteins involved in DNA repair (Venclovas2000Structurebased; Sohn2009Crystal). The HUS1 protein is essential for checkpoint signaling and DNA repair at sites of DNA damage, and its interactions within the 9-1-1 complex are critical for its function (Lim2015Genome). Clinically, alterations in HUS1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the cancer type, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Weiss2000Inactivation; Lindner2022HUS1).

## Structure
The HUS1 protein is a component of the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex, which forms a heterotrimeric ring structure crucial for DNA damage response. Each subunit, including HUS1, consists of topologically similar N-terminal and C-terminal domains, each composed of two helices and nine strands, connected by a long interdomain connecting (IDC) loop (S9-S10) (Sohn2009Crystal). The HUS1 protein shares structural similarities with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), possessing a PCNA-like fold that allows it to form a sliding clamp structure (Venclovas2000Structurebased).

The IDC loop in HUS1 is highly variable compared to Rad9 and Rad1, forming a hydrophobic groove that serves as an interaction site for clamp-binding proteins. This groove involves residues such as Pro149, Val151, Pro152, and Pro154 (Sohn2009Crystal). The HUS1 subunit also features a narrow hydrophobic cleft on its inner surface, capable of accommodating a DNA base, formed by residues like Arg18, Ile19, and Met22 (Doré2009Crystal).

The quaternary structure of the 9-1-1 complex is a heterotrimer with a chiral arrangement of Rad9, Rad1, and HUS1, with extensive interfaces between the subunits, particularly between Rad9 and HUS1 (Doré2009Crystal). The positive electrostatic potential around the central hole of the complex, contributed by basic residues in the IDC loop, is thought to facilitate interactions with other proteins (Sohn2009Crystal).

## Function
The HUS1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the 9-1-1 complex, a heterotrimeric DNA clamp involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. This complex, which includes RAD9A and RAD1, is essential for checkpoint signaling and DNA repair at sites of DNA damage, playing a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability (Lim2015Genome). HUS1 interacts with other subunits to form a stable clamp structure necessary for its function, particularly through its interaction with RAD9A. Mutations at the HUS1-RAD9A interface can disrupt the formation and function of the 9-1-1 complex (Lim2015Genome).

HUS1 is involved in various DNA repair pathways, including base excision, mismatch, and nucleotide excision repair, as well as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (Lim2015Genome). The protein interacts with DNA through its inner surface, which contains positively charged residues crucial for DNA binding and mobility. These interactions help the 9-1-1 complex properly load onto DNA and perform its scaffolding activity on chromatin (Lim2015Genome). HUS1 also has roles independent of ATR-mediated signaling, which are necessary for the cellular response to DNA damage (Lim2015Genome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the HUS1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In urothelial cancer, HUS1 acts as an oncogene, with its expression linked to poor prognosis and resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Knockdown of HUS1 in cisplatin-sensitive cells inhibits proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lindner2022HUS1). In ovarian cancer, high HUS1 expression is associated with poor prognosis, while in breast cancer, it contributes to chemotherapy resistance (Lindner2022HUS1).

In contrast, HUS1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its dual role depending on the cancer type (Lindner2022HUS1). In lung cancer, HUS1 is targeted by MiR-340-3p, promoting cell proliferation and migration (Lindner2022HUS1). The gene's role in genomic stability is underscored by studies in mice, where inactivation leads to genomic instability and increased sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting its importance in preventing tumorigenesis (Levitt2007Genome; Weiss2000Inactivation). These findings indicate that HUS1's expression and function are critical in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The HUS1 protein is a critical component of the RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex, which plays a significant role in the DNA damage response. HUS1 interacts with RAD9A and RAD1 to form a heterotrimeric clamp structure essential for DNA repair processes. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the 9-1-1 complex, as evidenced by the disruption of the complex when specific residues, such as Arg-128, are mutated (Lim2015Genome).

HUS1 also interacts with DNA, facilitated by positively charged residues on its inner surface, which are important for binding to the DNA phosphate backbone. This interaction is necessary for the proper loading and mobility of the 9-1-1 complex on DNA, similar to the function of PCNA (Lim2015Genome).

In addition to its role in the 9-1-1 complex, HUS1 interacts with other proteins involved in DNA repair, such as the DNA glycosylase MYH. The interdomain connecting loop of HUS1 is crucial for MYH binding, and mutations in this region can affect the stimulation of MYH activity (Hwang2015Association). These interactions highlight HUS1's role in coordinating DNA repair and checkpoint signaling pathways.
