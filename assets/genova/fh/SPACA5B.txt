# SPACA5B

## Overview
SPACA5B is a gene that encodes the sperm acrosome associated 5B protein, which is involved in the reproductive process. The protein is primarily expressed in the acrosome of sperm cells, a specialized organelle that plays a crucial role in fertilization by facilitating the penetration of the sperm into the egg. SPACA5B is categorized as an acrosomal protein, and its function is essential for the proper execution of the acrosome reaction, a critical step in the fertilization process. The gene's expression and the protein's activity are tightly regulated, and any dysregulation can have implications for male fertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
