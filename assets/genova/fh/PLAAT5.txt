# PLAAT5

## Overview
PLAAT5 is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipase A and acyltransferase 5, which is a member of the HRAS-like suppressor (HRASLS) family. This protein is categorized as an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically in the remodeling of phospholipids within cell membranes. It plays a critical role in the formation of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) through its N-acyltransferase activity, which is essential for the production of bioactive lipids that participate in various physiological processes, including inflammation modulation and energy regulation (Uyama2012Generation; Mardian2015The). Unlike other members of its family, PLAAT5 is predominantly located in the cytosol and operates independently of calcium ions, highlighting its unique functional properties (Uyama2012Generation; Mardian2015The). Despite its established role in lipid metabolism, the full spectrum of PLAAT5's physiological functions in human health remains to be elucidated (Mardian2015The).

## Function
PLAAT5, also known as phospholipase A and acyltransferase 5, is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the remodeling of phospholipids within cell membranes. It exhibits N-acyltransferase activity, which is crucial for the formation of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by transferring an acyl chain from the sn-1 position of a glycerophospholipid to the amino group of PE (Mardian2015The). NAPEs serve as precursors for bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), which are involved in various biological activities, including inflammation modulation and energy regulation (Uyama2012Generation; Mardian2015The).

PLAAT5 is predominantly found in the cytosol, likely due to the absence of a C-terminal hydrophobic span, which distinguishes it from other HRASLS family members (Mardian2015The). The enzyme's activity is independent of calcium ions, which is a unique feature compared to other N-acyltransferases (Uyama2012Generation). While the specific physiological functions of PLAAT5 in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, its role in lipid metabolism suggests it may influence cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Mardian2015The).
