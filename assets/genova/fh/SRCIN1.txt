# SRCIN1

## Overview
SRCIN1 is a gene that encodes the protein SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1, also known as p140Cap. This protein is a critical regulator of cell signaling pathways, particularly those involving the Src family of kinases. As a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein, p140Cap functions primarily as an inhibitor of Src kinase activity, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing aberrant cell growth and differentiation (Lu2019Role; Sun2018MicroRNA181a). The protein achieves this regulatory function through interactions with other signaling molecules, such as C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), and is involved in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell adhesion and migration (Shen2024Hypermethylation). SRCIN1 is expressed in a variety of normal tissues, including the mammary glands, lungs, colon, and kidneys, underscoring its broad physiological significance (Sun2018MicroRNA181a). Additionally, p140Cap has been implicated in cancer biology, where it acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating key signaling pathways and influencing cell motility and invasion (Salemme2020The; Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1).

## Structure


## Function
SRCIN1, also known as p140Cap, is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cell signaling pathways, particularly those involving the Src kinase. In healthy human cells, SRCIN1 functions as an inhibitor of Src kinase activity, which is crucial for maintaining normal cell signaling and preventing excessive cell growth and differentiation (Lu2019Role). This regulation is achieved through its interaction with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), which phosphorylates Src at specific sites to reduce its activity (Sun2018MicroRNA181a).

SRCIN1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it modulates interactions between signaling proteins, contributing to cellular homeostasis and tissue integrity. It is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell adhesion and migration (Shen2024Hypermethylation). SRCIN1's role in these processes is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and ensuring proper cellular communication.

The protein is widely expressed in normal tissues, including the mammary glands, lungs, colon, and kidneys, indicating its broad role in normal cellular functions (Sun2018MicroRNA181a). By inhibiting Src activity, SRCIN1 helps regulate pathways involved in cell growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis, thereby maintaining normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SRCIN1 gene, also known as p140Cap, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SRCIN1 is overexpressed and correlates with tumor progression. Its knockdown in CRC cells leads to cell differentiation and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, indicating its role in promoting cell growth, migration, and invasion. SRCIN1 also activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, crucial for CRC progression, and its suppression increases sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis, suggesting potential therapeutic implications (Zhang2017Overexpression).

In breast cancer, SRCIN1 hypermethylation is associated with increased gene expression and cell proliferation. It serves as a potential blood-based biomarker for early detection and prognosis, with high methylation levels linked to poorer survival outcomes. The gene's expression is modulated by its methylation status, and silencing SRCIN1 reduces cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines (Shen2024Hypermethylation).

In neuroblastoma, high SRCIN1 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, correlating with better overall and event-free survival. It acts as a tumor suppressor, reducing tumor growth and metastasis likelihood, and its expression levels are clinically relevant for prognosis (Grasso2019The).

## Interactions
The SRCIN1 gene encodes the p140Cap protein, which is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. p140Cap interacts with Src family kinases, inhibiting their activity by binding to Csk through tyrosines in the EGLYA/EPLYA motif and to Src via proline-rich domains. This interaction is crucial for controlling cell motility and invasion, as it inhibits Src activation (Salemme2020The; Centonze2021p130CasBCAR1).

p140Cap also interacts with other proteins such as β-catenin, vinexin, cortactin, and EB3, indicating its role in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (Salemme2020The). These interactions contribute to its function as a tumor suppressor by enhancing cell adhesion and reducing cancer cell migration.

In neuroblastoma, p140Cap impairs the Src/p130Cas and STAT3/Jak2 signaling pathways, which are associated with tumor aggressiveness. It reduces the phosphorylation of Src Tyr 416, p130Cas, STAT3 Tyr 705, and JAK2, thereby controlling these pathways and limiting tumor progression (Grasso2019The). These interactions highlight the role of p140Cap in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
