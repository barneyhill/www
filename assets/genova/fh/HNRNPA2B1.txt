# HNRNPA2B1

## Overview
The HNRNPA2B1 gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1), a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in RNA metabolism. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, transport, translation, and stability of RNA molecules. HnRNP A2/B1 is characterized by its two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a glycine-rich low complexity region, which facilitate its interaction with RNA and other proteins. It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it participates in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA transport, but also functions in miRNA processing and exosomal miRNA sorting, highlighting its importance in intercellular communication (Wu2018Molecular; Thibault2021hnRNP; Villarroya-Beltri2013Sumoylated). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which influence its binding capabilities and functional roles (Villarroya-Beltri2013Sumoylated). HnRNP A2/B1's involvement in these diverse processes underscores its essential role in maintaining RNA homeostasis and cellular function.

## Structure
The HNRNPA2B1 gene encodes the hnRNP A2/B1 protein, an RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is produced in two isoforms, A2 and B1, through alternative splicing, with the B1 isoform containing an additional 12 amino acids at its N terminus (Wu2018Molecular). The primary structure of hnRNP A2/B1 includes two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), RRM1 and RRM2, which are crucial for RNA binding. These RRMs are separated by a 15-amino acid linker and are responsible for recognizing specific RNA sequences, such as AGG and UAG motifs (Wu2018Molecular).

The secondary structure of the RRMs consists of an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet adjacent to two α-helices, forming a typical RRM fold (Wu2018Molecular). The protein also contains a C-terminal glycine-rich low complexity region, which includes a prion-like domain, an RGG box, and a PY-motif with a nuclear localization signal (Wu2018Molecular).

The tertiary structure of hnRNP A2/B1 has been elucidated through crystal structures, revealing that the RRMs interact in a fixed antiparallel orientation, allowing the protein to bind RNA strands in an antiparallel manner (Wu2018Molecular). The protein can form various orientations when bound to RNA, which may facilitate RNA-templated aggregation and the formation of protein-RNA granules in vivo (Wu2018Molecular).

## Function
The HNRNPA2B1 gene encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, which plays a significant role in RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, transport, translation, storage, and stability. This protein is crucial for cellular and organismal viability, as it regulates mRNA metabolism and telomere maintenance by interacting with telomeric DNA and influencing telomerase activity (Thibault2021hnRNP). HnRNP A2/B1 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in pre-mRNA and mature mRNA splicing and transport, acting as part of the spliceosome E complex to influence alternative splicing (Thibault2021hnRNP). It also plays a role in mRNA trafficking, particularly in neurons, by forming RNP trafficking granules that transport mRNAs to specific cellular sites (Thibault2021hnRNP).

In addition to its nuclear functions, hnRNP A2/B1 is involved in miRNA processing and trafficking, binding to specific motifs to control miRNA sorting into exosomes, which is essential for intercellular communication (Villarroya-Beltri2013Sumoylated). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which affects its binding to miRNAs (Villarroya-Beltri2013Sumoylated). HnRNP A2/B1's involvement in these processes underscores its multifaceted role in maintaining RNA homeostasis and cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HNRNPA2B1 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. In neurodegenerative conditions, mutations in HNRNPA2B1, such as the D290V mutation, are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). These mutations lead to significant splicing defects and protein aggregation, contributing to motor neuron degeneration and stress responses in ALS (Martinez2016ProteinRNA). In Alzheimer's disease, hnRNP A2/B1 is depleted in patient brains, correlating with the death of cholinergic neurons (Martinez2016ProteinRNA).

In cancer, HNRNPA2B1 is implicated in breast cancer and melanoma. Its expression is significantly higher in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels are associated with poor prognosis and immune cell infiltration. This suggests its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for breast cancer (Ayoufu2023HNRNPA2B1). In melanoma, increased expression of HNRNPA2B1 is linked to cell cycle regulation and DNA replication, with frequent genetic alterations observed in patients (Li2020Increased). The gene's overexpression is also noted in BRCA1-deficient cells, potentially contributing to metastatic traits in BRCA1-associated tumors (Santarosa2010BRCA1).

## Interactions
HNRNPA2B1 is involved in various interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a significant role in RNA metabolism. It binds to RNA and DNA, particularly interacting with telomeric DNA to regulate telomerase activity and protect telomeres from the DNA damage response. A specific isoform, A2*, has a higher affinity for telomeric DNA and can enhance telomerase processivity (Thibault2021hnRNP).

HNRNPA2B1 is a component of the heterogeneous nuclear 40S RNA:protein complex, interacting with pre-mRNAs and mature mRNAs, and is involved in splicing and mRNA transport. It binds to splicing enhancer sequences and interacts with non-coding RNAs to modulate splicing (Thibault2021hnRNP). The protein also interacts with NXF1 for mRNA export and Transportin-1 for nuclear import, with its localization modulated by post-translational modifications (Thibault2021hnRNP).

In the context of the immune response, HNRNPA2B1 binds viral DNA and interacts with TBK1, activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway to produce type I interferons. It also interacts with Src and STING proteins, enhancing IFN-β induction (Wang2019Nuclear). HNRNPA2B1's role in miRNA sorting into exosomes involves binding to specific RNA motifs, facilitated by sumoylation (Villarroya-Beltri2013Sumoylated).
