# LACC1

## Overview
LACC1, or laccase domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune response regulation, particularly in the context of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The protein, characterized by a laccase domain, functions as a multicopper oxidase, facilitating oxidation-reduction reactions crucial for immune signaling pathways (Lahiri2017Human; Rabionet2019Biallelic). LACC1 is primarily expressed in myeloid-derived cells and localizes to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it plays a pivotal role in modulating cytokine secretion and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in response to pattern recognition receptor stimulation (Lahiri2017Human). The protein's interactions with other signaling molecules, such as NOD2, RIP2, and succinate dehydrogenase, underscore its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and effective microbial clearance (Lahiri2017Human). Variants and mutations in the LACC1 gene have been linked to several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including Crohn's disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis (Butbul2021A; Assadi2016Functional).

## Structure
The LACC1 protein, encoded by the human LACC1 gene, is a 430-amino-acid protein characterized by a laccase domain, also known as the Cu-oxidase-4 domain. This domain is highly conserved across species, with sequence identity ranging from 91% to 33% (Lahiri2017Human). The laccase domain is involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, typical of multicopper oxidases, which catalyze the oxidation of aromatic substrates while reducing molecular oxygen to water (Rabionet2019Biallelic).

The protein's structure includes a metal-binding groove formed by histidines at positions 249 and 250, which are crucial for its function. The Val254 variant, associated with disease risk, is located near these histidines and is highly conserved (Lahiri2017Human). LACC1 is involved in forming a complex with NOD2, RIP2, IRAK1, and TRAF6, essential for optimal signaling and cytokine production (Lahiri2017Human).

Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation have been noted, although they are not required for NOD2-induced cytokine production (Lahiri2017Human). The protein's interaction with succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) suggests a role in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and immune signaling pathways (Lahiri2017Human).

## Function
The LACC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in modulating immune responses in human cells. It is involved in the regulation of cytokine secretion induced by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), particularly in response to NOD2 stimulation, which is crucial for maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis (Lahiri2017Human). LACC1 is expressed in both peripheral and intestinal myeloid-derived cells and is found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it associates with the NOD2-signaling complex. This association is essential for optimal NOD2-induced signaling, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, cytokine secretion, and bacterial clearance (Lahiri2017Human).

LACC1 enhances the activation of key signaling pathways, including MAPK and NFkB, which are crucial for cytokine production and immune responses (Lahiri2017Human). It also interacts with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to amplify PRR-induced mtROS and subsequent signaling, contributing to effective microbial clearance (Lahiri2017Human). The protein's role in ER stress responses is also significant, as it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum upon PRR stimulation, influencing the unfolded protein response pathways necessary for immune functions (Huang2019LACC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LACC1 gene, also known as FAMIN, have been implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Genetic variants of LACC1 are associated with an increased risk of conditions such as Crohn's disease, leprosy, ulcerative colitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (Assadi2016Functional). A specific rare homozygous mutation, Cys284Arg, has been identified in children with severe systemic JIA and pediatric Crohn's disease, potentially disrupting the catalytic site within the laccase-like domain of LACC1 (SkonHegg2019LACC1). Another variant, Ile254Val, is linked to a reduced ability to induce pattern recognition receptor-mediated responses, affecting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and cytokine secretion, which are crucial for immune regulation (Lahiri2017Human).

Loss-of-function mutations, such as the p.Glu348Ter variant, have been associated with hereditary forms of JIA, leading to a complete loss of gene product due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Butbul2021A). These mutations can result in severe polyarthritis and other complications, including renal amyloidosis and Crohn's disease (Butbul2021A). LACC1 mutations have also been linked to rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA, with frameshift mutations leading to truncated proteins (Rabionet2019Biallelic). These findings underscore the role of LACC1 in modulating immune responses and its involvement in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
LACC1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various signaling complexes that are crucial for immune responses. It localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) like NOD2, where it interacts with ER stress sensors such as PERK, IRE1a, and ATF6. This interaction is essential for the activation of ER stress pathways, which are necessary for subsequent PRR-induced signaling, cytokine secretion, and bacterial clearance (Huang2019LACC1).

LACC1 is also involved in the assembly of a signaling complex that includes RIP2, IRAK1, and TRAF6, which are part of the NOD2 signaling pathway. This complex is important for the induction of MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways, which are critical for immune responses (Lahiri2017Human; Kang2020Myeloid). LACC1's interaction with succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) enhances NOD2-induced succinate dehydrogenase activity, contributing to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and cytokine secretion (Lahiri2017Human).

LACC1 variants, such as Val254 and Arg284, show altered interactions and reduced efficacy in these pathways, impacting immune responses and disease outcomes (Huang2019LACC1).
