# GPR157

## Overview
GPR157 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 157, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation during brain development, particularly within the developing neocortex. GPR157 is localized to the primary cilia of radial glial progenitors (RGPs) and is known to interact with cerebrospinal fluid components to mediate its effects. It is coupled with the Gq-class of heterotrimeric G-proteins, activating intracellular signaling pathways that are crucial for neurogenesis (Takeo2016The). Additionally, GPR157 has been shown to interact with Gi proteins, indicating its potential versatility in signaling pathways (Jang2022Nucleotidedecoupled; Jang2023The). The receptor's expression is developmentally regulated, being prominent during embryonic stages and diminishing postnatally, highlighting its specific role in early brain development (Takeo2016The).

## Function
GPR157 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in the neuronal differentiation of radial glial progenitors (RGPs) in the developing neocortex. It is localized to the primary cilia of RGPs, where it interacts with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to mediate its effects. GPR157 is coupled with the Gq-class of heterotrimeric G-proteins, activating the phospholipase C (PLC)-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway. This activation leads to the release of calcium from intracellular stores, which is essential for the differentiation of RGPs into neurons (Takeo2016The).

The receptor's activity is developmentally regulated, with its expression being robust during embryonic day 13 (E13) in mice, a critical period for neurogenesis, but not detectable postnatally. This suggests that GPR157's function is specific to early corticogenesis (Takeo2016The). The presence of putative ligands in the CSF, which activate GPR157 more effectively during the neurogenic phase, further underscores its role in brain development (Takeo2016The). GPR157's signaling is tightly regulated, as its overexpression does not further enhance neuronal differentiation, indicating a precise control mechanism in neurogenesis (Takeo2016The).

## Interactions
GPR157 is a G protein-coupled receptor that has been studied for its interactions with G proteins, particularly in the context of its coupling specificity. Research indicates that GPR157 may interact with G proteins, specifically showing high basal bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) with Gi1 4A mutants, suggesting it is a Gi-coupled GPCR. This interaction is sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), indicating a specific coupling to Gi proteins (Jang2022Nucleotidedecoupled; Jang2023The). 

The receptor's interaction with G proteins is influenced by the conformational flexibility of the G proteins and the receptor-G protein interface. Studies using nucleotide-decoupled G proteins have shown that GPR157 can form complexes with these proteins, suggesting that it may sample active states even without agonist-induced activation (Jang2022Nucleotidedecoupled; Jang2023The). 

While GPR157's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond G proteins are not detailed in the available studies, the receptor's potential to activate G proteins under specific conditions, such as in the presence of ligands or cofactors, has been suggested (Jang2023The).
