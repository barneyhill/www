# MANBA

## Overview
The MANBA gene encodes the enzyme β-mannosidase, a lysosomal exoglycosidase that plays a critical role in the degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyl hydrolase and is essential for the hydrolysis of β-linked mannose residues, facilitating the breakdown of complex carbohydrates within the lysosome (Gytz2019The; Huynh2011A). The β-mannosidase enzyme is characterized by a TIM barrel structure, which is a common fold among glycosyl hydrolases, and includes several sites of N-glycosylation and disulfide bridges that contribute to its stability and function (Gytz2019The). Mutations in the MANBA gene can lead to β-mannosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disorder, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Blomqvist2019βMannosidosis). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular metabolism and preventing the accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharides, which can result in various pathological conditions if not properly managed (Samra2008Cloning).

## Structure
The MANBA gene encodes the enzyme β-mannosidase, which is involved in the degradation of N-glycosylated proteins. The enzyme is a 100-kDa exo-acting β-glycosidase with a catalytic (β/α)8 barrel, also known as a TIM barrel structure, which is a common fold in glycosyl hydrolases (Gytz2019The). The enzyme's active site is located within this TIM barrel domain and is characterized by a deep pocket formed by conserved amino acids crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (Huynh2011A). The catalytic mechanism involves a two-step, double-displacement hydrolysis process, with key residues such as E457 and E554 playing critical roles (Gytz2019The).

The enzyme is monomeric in solution and includes several sites of N-glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function (Gytz2019The). The structure also features four disulfide bridges, which are absent in prokaryotic β-mannosidases, indicating a level of structural complexity unique to mammalian forms (Gytz2019The). The enzyme's structure is highly conserved across species, with significant similarities between human and mouse β-mannosidase, sharing 76% identity and 91% similarity (Gytz2019The).

## Function
The MANBA gene encodes the enzyme β-mannosidase, which is a lysosomal exoglycosidase involved in the degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. This enzyme specifically hydrolyzes the single β-linked mannose residue at the non-reducing end of these glycoproteins, facilitating the breakdown of complex carbohydrates within the lysosome, a cellular organelle responsible for waste processing and recycling (Gytz2019The; Huynh2011A). The enzyme operates optimally at a pH of 4.5 to 5.0, which is consistent with the acidic environment of the lysosome (Gytz2019The).

β-mannosidase is crucial for maintaining cellular metabolism and homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of undegraded oligosaccharides, which can lead to lysosomal storage disorders if not properly managed (Samra2008Cloning). The enzyme's active site contains highly conserved amino acids, such as E457 and E554, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Gytz2019The; Huynh2011A). The enzyme's structure includes a TIM barrel domain that houses the catalytic pocket, allowing it to interact with substrates like β-D-mannose through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Gytz2019The). This enzymatic activity is vital for the proper catabolism of glycoproteins, contributing to the overall health and function of human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MANBA gene are associated with β-mannosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of disaccharides due to deficient activity of the enzyme β-mannosidase, leading to a range of symptoms including developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral disturbances, hearing loss, and frequent infections (Gytz2019The; Blomqvist2019βMannosidosis). Other symptoms may include angiokeratomas, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures (Blomqvist2019βMannosidosis).

Specific mutations, such as the c.1922G>A (p.Arg641His) missense mutation, have been identified and are associated with residual enzyme activity and severe neurological symptoms, suggesting a possible pseudodeficiency variant (Sabourdy2009A). Another variant, c.2158-2A>G, is a significant cause of hereditary hearing loss and β-mannosidosis in the Czech and Slovak Roma populations, highlighting its ethnic-specific nature (Safka2020Variant).

Alterations in MANBA gene expression have also been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Variants such as rs4496586 are associated with improved kidney function markers and reduced CKD risk, suggesting a role for MANBA in kidney function (Kim2021Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MANBA gene mutations and expression alterations in various diseases.
