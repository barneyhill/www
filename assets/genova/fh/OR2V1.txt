# OR2V1

## Overview
The OR2V1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily V member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals, playing a pivotal role in the sensory perception of smell. Located in the olfactory epithelium, the protein binds to specific odor molecules, initiating a cascade of neuronal responses that contribute to olfactory perception (Olender2016The). Although the gene is part of a co-expression module associated with olfactory receptor activity, mutations in the genome may disrupt its open reading frame, potentially rendering it inactive in certain individuals (Zhang2022Identification). Despite these variations, OR2V1 remains a significant component of the molecular framework that facilitates the sense of smell.

## Function
OR2V1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR2V1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. This binding triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Olender2016The).

The gene OR2V1 has been identified as part of a co-expression module enriched in 'sensory perception of smell' and 'olfactory receptor activity', indicating its involvement in olfactory processes (Zhang2022Identification). However, the gene may have a disrupted open reading frame due to genome-encoded mutations, suggesting it might be inactive in some cases (Olender2016The). Despite this, OR2V1's role in olfactory receptor activity highlights its potential importance in the molecular mechanisms underlying the sense of smell. The presence of transcription factor binding sites upstream of OR2V1 suggests regulatory elements that may influence its expression and function in the olfactory system (Olender2016The).
