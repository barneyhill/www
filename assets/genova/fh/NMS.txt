# NMS

## Overview
The NMS gene encodes the neuropeptide neuromedin S, which is primarily involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, energy homeostasis, and stress responses. Neuromedin S is a 36 amino-acid peptide that acts as an endogenous ligand for G-protein-coupled receptors, specifically FM-4/TGR-1 and FM-3/GPR66, which are also known as NMUR2 and NMUR1, respectively (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins; Mori2005Identification). The gene is located on chromosome 2q11.2 in humans and shares structural similarities with the neuromedin U gene, indicating an evolutionary divergence (Mitchell2009Emerging; Mori2005Identification). Neuromedin S is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, and plays a crucial role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways, such as calcium mobilization and the ERK pathway, which are essential for various physiological processes (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins; Mori2005Identification).

## Structure
The neuromedin S (NMS) peptide is a 36 amino-acid residue neuropeptide with a primary structure that includes the sequence LPRLLHTDSRMATIDFPKKDPTTSLGRPFFLFRPRN-NH2. This sequence features a C-terminal amidation, which is crucial for its biological activity (Mori2005Identification). The peptide is generated from a precursor protein that includes a 152-residue sequence with an N-terminal signal peptide and four potential processing sites. The active NMS peptide is produced by cleavage at the third and fourth sites, with Gly 145 serving as an amide donor for C-terminal amidation (Mori2005Identification).

NMS shares a C-terminal core structure with neuromedin U (NMU), which is essential for receptor binding, but the N-terminal portion of NMS has no sequence homology to known peptides (Mori2005Identification). The NMS gene is composed of 10 exons, and its exon-intron boundaries are conserved with those in the NMU gene, indicating evolutionary divergence before the rodent/primate split (Mori2005Identification). The peptide's structure is confirmed by mass spectrometry, and synthetic NMS matches the natural peptide in retention time on RP-HPLC (Mori2005Identification). The NMS gene is located on chromosome 2q11.2 in humans (Mitchell2009Emerging).

## Function
Neuromedin S (NMS) is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in regulating circadian rhythms, energy homeostasis, and stress responses in humans. It is primarily expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus, with the highest expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is the master circadian pacemaker in mammals (Mori2005Identification). NMS acts as an endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptors FM-4/TGR-1 (also known as NMU2R) and FM-3/GPR66, sharing these receptors with neuromedin U (NMU) (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins; Mori2005Identification).

NMS influences intracellular signaling pathways by increasing intracellular calcium levels and activating the ERK pathway, which are crucial for various cellular responses (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins). It is involved in the modulation of circadian rhythms by inducing phase shifts in locomotor activity, suggesting its role in the regulation of the circadian pacemaker within the SCN (Mori2005Identification). NMS also affects feeding behavior and energy balance, although its expression in brain regions associated with feeding is low (Mori2005Identification). The peptide's expression pattern and receptor interactions suggest it functions in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner within the SCN, contributing to the regulation of circadian rhythms (Mori2005Identification).

## Interactions
Neuromedin S (NMS) is a neuropeptide that interacts with G protein-coupled receptors, specifically FM-3/GPR66 and FM-4/TGR-1, which are also known as neuromedin U receptors NMUR1 and NMUR2, respectively (Mori2024Neuromedin; Miyazato2008Identification). NMS has a higher binding affinity for FM-4/TGR-1 compared to neuromedin U (NMU), although both peptides exhibit similar potency and efficacy for these receptors (Mori2024Neuromedin; Miyazato2008Identification). 

In mammals, NMS is predominantly expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, where it plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms and energy balance. It can induce phase shifts in circadian rhythms and decrease food intake when administered intracerebroventricularly in rats (Novak2009Neuromedin; Miyazato2008Identification). NMS also influences the expression of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the arcuate nucleus and corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus, suggesting its involvement in energy balance and stress response (Miyazato2008Identification).

In chickens, NMS activates NMUR1 and NMUR2 receptors, with NMUR2 being more selectively activated by NMS, indicating a preference for NMS over NMU in avian species (Wan2018Characterization). These interactions stimulate signaling pathways such as calcium mobilization and MAPK/ERK, which are crucial for various physiological processes (Wan2018Characterization).
