# C2CD4A

## Overview
C2CD4A is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 4A, which functions as a transcriptional coregulator involved in critical cellular processes such as insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus of pancreatic β cells, where it plays a significant role in regulating glycolytic genes and suppressing β cell 'disallowed' genes to ensure efficient glucose metabolism. C2CD4A is part of a superenhancer locus associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility and is involved in key signaling pathways, including AMPK and PKA, which are essential for maintaining β cell function and insulin secretion. Additionally, C2CD4A interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, promoting its degradation and influencing cancer cell proliferation, particularly in colorectal cancer. This interaction highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Kuo2019Identification; Rong2021The).

## Function
The C2CD4A gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism in healthy human cells. It functions as a transcriptional coregulator, potentially in cooperation with the transcription factor FoxO1, to regulate glycolytic genes and suppress β cell 'disallowed' genes, which are expressed at low levels to ensure efficient glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (Kuo2019Identification). C2CD4A is involved in the regulation of glycolytic enzymes and fatty acid oxidation, with its expression pattern similar to that associated with FoxO1 gain-of-function, which inhibits glucose utilization and primes β cells for fatty acid oxidation (Kuo2019Identification).

The protein is localized in the nucleus of β cells, where it is part of a superenhancer locus that includes the C2CD4B and VPS13C genes, associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility (Kuo2019Identification). Functional studies in β cell-specific C2CD4A knockout mice have shown glucose intolerance and reduced insulin levels, indicating its essential role in maintaining β cell function and insulin secretion, particularly in response to glucose (Kuo2019Identification). C2CD4A's regulatory role in glycolysis and insulin secretion is supported by its involvement in key signaling pathways such as AMPK and PKA (Kuo2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the C2CD4A gene have been linked to several diseases, most notably type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. In the context of diabetes, C2CD4A is identified as a susceptibility gene that plays a significant role in insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells. Variants in the VPS13C-C2CD4A-C2CD4B locus on chromosome 15 are associated with reduced β cell function, leading to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance. This gene acts as a transcriptional coregulator, influencing glycolytic pathways and maintaining β cell identity, which is crucial for proper insulin secretion (Kuo2019Identification).

In colorectal cancer, C2CD4A is frequently upregulated, promoting cancer cell growth and inhibiting apoptosis. It interacts with the p53 signaling pathway, a crucial tumor suppressor mechanism, by enhancing the degradation of p53 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction leads to decreased p53 function, contributing to cancer progression. The C2CD4A gene is part of a regulatory axis involving circSLC6A6 and miR-1265, which further promotes colorectal cancer growth by suppressing p53 activity (Rong2021The).

## Interactions
C2CD4A interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, playing a significant role in its regulation. C2CD4A promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53 by enhancing its interaction with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction leads to increased poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53, thereby reducing its protein expression levels (Rong2021The). The interaction between C2CD4A and p53 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, demonstrating a direct binding that facilitates the degradation process (Rong2021The).

C2CD4A is also involved in a regulatory axis with circSLC6A6 and miR-1265. CircSLC6A6 acts as a sponge for miR-1265, which normally suppresses C2CD4A expression by binding to its mRNA. This interaction modulates the expression of C2CD4A and subsequently affects the p53 signaling pathway. The circSLC6A6/miR-1265/C2CD4A axis is implicated in promoting colorectal cancer growth by facilitating the degradation of p53 (Rong2021The). These interactions highlight the role of C2CD4A in cancer cell proliferation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
