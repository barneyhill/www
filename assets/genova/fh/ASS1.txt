# ASS1

## Overview
The ASS1 gene encodes the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase 1, a critical component of the urea cycle, which is responsible for detoxifying ammonia in the liver by converting it into urea. This enzyme is categorized as a synthetase and functions by catalyzing the conversion of citrulline and aspartate into argininosuccinate, a reaction that is essential for the synthesis of arginine, an important amino acid (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Karlberg2008Structure). The protein is a homotetrameric enzyme, with each monomer comprising a nucleotide-binding domain, a synthetase domain, and a C-terminal helix involved in oligomerization (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Karlberg2008Structure). Mutations in the ASS1 gene can lead to citrullinemia type I, a disorder characterized by impaired urea cycle function and elevated ammonia levels (DiezFernandez2017Mutations). Beyond its metabolic role, ASS1 is involved in cellular signaling and has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and response to therapies (Silberman2019AcidInduced; Zou2021Naturallyoccurring).

## Structure
The human argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) protein is a homotetrameric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of three domains: a nucleotide-binding domain, a synthetase domain, and a C-terminal helix involved in oligomerization (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Karlberg2008Structure). The nucleotide-binding domain is structurally similar to N-type ATP pyrophosphatases and is crucial for the enzyme's function (Lemke2001The). The synthetase domain forms the core of the enzyme and is involved in catalysis, while the C-terminal helix is essential for oligomerization, which is critical for enzyme activity (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Karlberg2008Structure).

The enzyme's structure is highly conserved across species, with significant similarities to bacterial argininosuccinate synthetases (Karlberg2008Structure). The active site of ASS1 includes binding sites for citrulline and aspartate, with specific hydrogen bonds and salt bridges anchoring these substrates (Karlberg2008Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as the regulatory nitrosylation of Cys132, can inactivate the enzyme and are conserved in mammalian ASS1 (Karlberg2008Structure). Mutations in the ASS1 gene can affect the enzyme's structure and function, leading to conditions such as citrullinemia type I (DiezFernandez2017Mutations).

## Function
The ASS1 gene encodes the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase, which plays a crucial role in the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that detoxifies ammonia by converting it into urea in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of citrulline and aspartate into argininosuccinate, utilizing ATP in the process (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Karlberg2008Structure). The reaction is essential for the synthesis of arginine, an important amino acid, and for maintaining nitrogen balance in the body (Engel2008Mutations).

Argininosuccinate synthetase is primarily expressed in the periportal hepatocytes of the liver but is also present in smaller amounts in most body tissues. In these tissues, it contributes to the production of arginine and nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes (DiezFernandez2017Mutations). The enzyme's activity is regulated by various factors, including hormones and nutrients, ensuring that its function aligns with the body's metabolic needs (DiezFernandez2017Mutations).

In the context of the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, ASS1 works alongside argininosuccinate lyase and nitric oxide synthase to facilitate NO production, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and vascular function (DiezFernandez2017Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASS1 gene are primarily associated with citrullinemia type I (CTLN1), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired urea cycle function. This condition leads to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood, resulting in symptoms ranging from severe neonatal hyperammonemia to milder, late-onset forms with neurological or psychiatric manifestations (DiezFernandez2017Mutations; Liu2023Functional). Biochemically, CTLN1 is marked by elevated plasma citrulline, low plasma arginine, and elevated urinary orotic acid (Engel2008Mutations).

The ASS1 gene is also implicated in cancer biology. Its downregulation in certain cancers, such as breast cancer, is linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis. This downregulation facilitates cancer cell proliferation by increasing aspartate availability for pyrimidine synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining an alkalized intracellular pH under acidic and hypoxic conditions (Silberman2019AcidInduced). In some tumors, ASS1 expression is epigenetically silenced, making them dependent on external arginine, which has led to the development of arginine deprivation therapies (Zou2021Naturallyoccurring). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ASS1 in both metabolic disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
ASS1 (argininosuccinate synthase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, particularly with SMARCC1, a component of this complex. This interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage, suggesting a role for ASS1 in chromatin remodeling through SMARCC1 succination, which affects chromatin accessibility and gene transcription (Lim2024ASS1). ASS1 also interacts with importin 7 (IPO7), facilitating its nuclear import, which is crucial for its role in the DNA damage response (Lim2024ASS1).

In the context of arginine starvation, ASS1 expression is regulated by a chromatin remodeling system involving p300, HDAC2, and Sin3A. Under these conditions, p300 dissociates from the ASS1 promoter, allowing HDAC2 and Sin3A to deacetylate histones, which facilitates the degradation of HIF-1α, a repressor of ASS1 (Tsai2017Chromatin). This process is crucial for the derepression of ASS1 and involves interactions with other proteins such as PHD2, which is part of the HIF-1α degrading complex (Tsai2017Chromatin).

ASS1 also forms a complex with argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for efficient nitric oxide production, highlighting its role in the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle (DiezFernandez2017Mutations).
