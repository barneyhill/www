# PRKAG1

## Overview
PRKAG1 is a gene that encodes the protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 1, a regulatory component of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis by responding to fluctuations in intracellular energy levels. The gamma 1 subunit, encoded by PRKAG1, is integral to the energy-sensing capability of the AMPK complex, as it binds adenine nucleotides such as AMP, ADP, and ATP, thereby modulating the kinase's activity in response to cellular energy status (Shaikh2023Evidence; ProszkowiecWeglarz2006Molecular). The protein's structure includes cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, which are essential for its function as an energy sensor (Loan2003The). PRKAG1 is involved in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism, autophagy, and cellular stress responses, and its expression is influenced by nutritional states, highlighting its importance in metabolic regulation and potential implications in health and disease (Puustinen2020DNAdependent; Ripa2023Refeedingassociated).

## Structure
The PRKAG1 gene encodes the gamma 1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a crucial component of the AMPK complex involved in cellular energy regulation. The protein structure includes cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains, which form a Bateman domain. This domain is essential for binding AMP and ATP, acting as a sensor for the cellular energy status (Foretz2010The; Loan2003The). The CBS domains are highly conserved and play a critical role in the protein's function (Foretz2010The).

PRKAG1 is part of a heterotrimeric complex, consisting of one catalytic alpha subunit and two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma, with the gamma subunit being the energy-sensing module (ProszkowiecWeglarz2006Molecular). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific sites such as Ser192 and Thr284, which are crucial for its activation and function within the AMPK complex (Puustinen2020DNAdependent).

Alternative splicing of the PRKAG1 gene results in different transcript variants, which encode proteins with varying numbers of CBS domains, affecting their functional properties (ProszkowiecWeglarz2006Molecular). These structural features and modifications are vital for the regulation of AMPK activity and its role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis.

## Function
The PRKAG1 gene encodes the gamma 1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex composed of an alpha catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits, beta and gamma, with PRKAG1 representing the gamma subunit. This subunit is essential for AMPK's ability to sense and respond to changes in the intracellular ATP-ADP-AMP ratio, as it can bind all three adenine nucleotides, thus playing a pivotal role in energy balance and cellular metabolism (Shaikh2023Evidence).

PRKAG1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of energy metabolism, autophagy, and cellular stress responses. It is phosphorylated at specific sites, such as Ser192 and Thr284, which enhances AMPK activity and its localization to lysosomal membranes, crucial for its activation and function in autophagy (Puustinen2020DNAdependent). The expression of PRKAG1 is modulated by nutritional states, being downregulated during fasting and upregulated upon refeeding, which is important for transitioning from catabolic to anabolic states (Ripa2023Refeedingassociated). This regulation is linked to metabolic health and longevity, as higher PRKAG1 expression correlates with better health outcomes in older individuals (Ripa2023Refeedingassociated).

## Interactions
PRKAG1, a regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular energy homeostasis. PRKAG1 interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PRKDC), which phosphorylates PRKAG1 at Ser192 and Thr284. These phosphorylation events are essential for the activation of the AMPK complex, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress such as amino acid or glucose starvation (Puustinen2020DNAdependent). The phosphorylation of PRKAG1 by PRKDC enhances the lysosomal localization of the AMPK complex, facilitating its activation by STK11 (serine/threonine kinase 11) and promoting autophagy (Puustinen2020DNAdependent).

PRKAG1 is also identified as a novel interactor in the malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) interactome, where it is found among exosome-derived proteins from mesothelioma cell lines (Karunakaran2021Malignant). Additionally, PRKAG1 is involved in the schizophrenia interactome, where it participates in pathways related to axonal guidance signaling and dopamine regulation, suggesting its role in neuronal function and neurotransmission (Ganapathiraju2016Schizophrenia). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PRKAG1 in various cellular processes and disease contexts.
