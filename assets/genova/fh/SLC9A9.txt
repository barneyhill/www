# SLC9A9

## Overview
SLC9A9 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 9 member A9, commonly referred to as the Na+/H+ exchanger 9 (NHE9). This protein is a transmembrane cation-proton exchanger involved in the regulation of pH within the endosomal system, playing a critical role in cellular processes such as endocytosis, receptor internalization, and protein localization (Patak2020Sodium). NHE9 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and glycosylation sites, which are essential for its function and trafficking within the Golgi network (Patak2020Sodium). The protein is primarily localized on the membranes of late recycling endosomes and is implicated in neurotransmitter receptor recycling, synaptic transmission, and plasticity, with significant associations to neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and ADHD (Patak2020Sodium; Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9). Additionally, SLC9A9 has been linked to various cancers, where its altered expression can influence disease progression and treatment resistance (Patak2020Sodium).

## Structure
The SLC9A9 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 9 (NHE9), a protein involved in ion transport across membranes. NHE9 is predicted to have 12 or 13 transmembrane domains, forming a cation-proton exchanger structure (Patak2020Sodium). These transmembrane regions are highly conserved, particularly TMs 4, 5, 8, 9, and 11, which are crucial for its pore-forming function (Patak2020Sodium). The protein structure has been predicted using conservation analysis tools, highlighting conserved residues that are essential for its function (Patak2020Sodium).

NHE9 is characterized by several glycosylation sites, with one experimentally determined and three predicted, which are important for its trafficking within the Golgi network (Patak2020Sodium). The C-terminal domain of NHE9 is highly variable and shares significant sequence homology with other organelle-localized NHEs, suggesting a role in localization and regulation (Patak2020Sodium). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including neurotransmitter release and receptor recycling, and is associated with neuropsychiatric conditions such as ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (Patak2020Sodium).

## Function
The SLC9A9 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 9 (NHE9), a protein involved in regulating the pH of the endosomal system, which is crucial for cellular processes such as endocytosis, receptor internalization, and protein localization (Patak2020Sodium). NHE9 functions by counteracting endosomal acidification, allowing hydrogen ions to exit the endosome while transporting sodium or potassium ions into the endosomal lumen, thus maintaining pH balance (Patak2020Sodium). This pH regulation is essential for proper endosomal function and cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K pathway (Patak2020Sodium).

NHE9 is also involved in the recycling of neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, such as glutamate receptors and the dopamine transporter, which are critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9). The protein is primarily localized on the membranes of late recycling endosomes and is involved in processes like long-term potentiation, important for learning and memory (Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9).

In addition, SLC9A9 plays a role in iron metabolism by regulating transferrin receptor recycling, which is vital for iron uptake across the blood-brain barrier (Patak2020Sodium). It is also associated with cell survival and proliferation through its interaction with signaling pathways such as Bcl-2 and PI3K-AKT (Patak2020Sodium).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC9A9 gene, also known as NHE9, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and cancer-related conditions. In neuropsychiatric disorders, SLC9A9 is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Mutations in SLC9A9 can lead to changes in synapse-level gene expression, potentially causing an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the brain, which may contribute to the core symptoms of ASDs and comorbidities like epilepsy (Patak2020Sodium). In ADHD, SLC9A9 mutations have been linked to inattentive phenotypes and autism-like traits in rodent models, with specific mutations affecting protein interactions and neuronal activity (Patak2020Sodium; Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9).

In Alzheimer's disease, SLC9A9 shows differential expression across brain regions, influencing glutamate signaling, which is crucial in disease progression. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified an association between SLC9A9 and decreased response to cholinesterase-inhibitor treatment in Alzheimer's patients (Patak2020Sodium).

In cancer, SLC9A9 is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal, esophageal, and ovarian cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis and treatment resistance. For instance, in esophageal cancer, SLC9A9 upregulation confers resistance to chemoradiotherapy by activating the Bcl-2 pro-survival pathway (Patak2020Sodium).

## Interactions
SLC9A9, also known as the sodium hydrogen exchanger 9 (NHE9), participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with calcineurin homologous protein (CHP), which enhances its binding affinity and stabilizes its localization on the plasma membrane, increasing pH sensitivity (Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9; Frommelt2024The). SLC9A9 also interacts with receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1), a scaffolding protein involved in multiple signaling pathways, including the Src/Akt/beta-catenin pathway, which influences cell survival and proliferation (Patak2020Sodium; Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9).

Mutations in SLC9A9 can alter its interactions with these proteins, potentially impacting synaptic transmission and plasticity. For instance, specific mutations in rat models of ADHD have been shown to increase the interaction with CHP without affecting the interaction with RACK1 (Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9). These interactions are significant for the regulation of endosomal pH and neurotransmitter receptor recycling, processes essential for synaptic function and neuronal activity (Patak2020Sodium; Zhang‐James2011SLC9A9).
