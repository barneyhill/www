# HID1

## Overview
HID1 is a gene that encodes the HID1 domain-containing protein, a peripheral membrane protein primarily associated with the medial- and trans-Golgi apparatus. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis and function of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in neuroendocrine cells, influencing processes such as cargo sorting and trans-Golgi network (TGN) acidification. HID1 is crucial for maintaining the acidic environment necessary for LDCV formation, which is essential for the regulated secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters. The protein's function is particularly significant in specialized secretory cells, such as pancreatic beta-cells, where it impacts insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis (Hummer2017HID1; Du2014HID1). Mutations in the HID1 gene have been linked to early onset neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical importance in neurodevelopmental and neuroendocrine health (Bartsch2024HID1).

## Structure
The HID1 protein is a peripheral membrane protein primarily associated with the medial- and trans-Golgi apparatus. It is not a transmembrane protein, as initially predicted, but associates with membranes through conformational structures like amphipathic helices and hydrophobic loops, as well as electrostatic interactions (Wang2011HID1). The N-terminus of HID1 contains a myristoyl group and a polybasic amino acid patch that mediate membrane binding, although they do not confer specificity for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Hummer2023Identification). Myristoylation is crucial for Golgi localization, as mutation of this site results in a loss of Golgi association (Wang2011HID1).

The C-terminus of HID1, specifically amino acids 687-788, is identified as the functional domain necessary for its role in dense core vesicle biogenesis. This region is highly conserved across species and is preceded by a predicted disordered region (Hummer2023Identification). The structure of HID1 is not fully characterized, and detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not available. However, the protein's dynamic shuttling between the Golgi apparatus and the cytosol has been demonstrated, with a half-time recovery of 16.4 seconds in fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (Wang2011HID1).

## Function
The HID1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in neuroendocrine cells. HID1 is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it influences cargo sorting and TGN acidification, essential processes for LDCV biogenesis (Hummer2017HID1; Wang2011HID1). The protein acts as a gatekeeper, preventing the leakage of certain proteins into the regulated secretory pathway, thereby ensuring proper localization and function of LDCV cargoes (Hummer2017HID1).

HID1 is involved in maintaining the acidic environment of the TGN, which is necessary for the aggregation of soluble LDCV cargo and dense core formation. This function is critical for the regulated secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, impacting physiological processes such as glucose homeostasis and brain function modulation (Hummer2017HID1). In pancreatic beta-cells, HID1 deficiency leads to impaired insulin secretion, highlighting its role in glucose regulation (Du2014HID1). The protein's activity is primarily localized to specialized secretory cells, where it ensures efficient Golgi acidification and prevents the degradation of defective LDCVs (Hummer2017HID1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HID1 gene have been implicated in early onset neurological disorders, characterized by symptoms such as incomplete pituitary insufficiency, severe developmental delays, recurring hypoglycemia, microcephaly, obstipation, and seizures. These disorders are autosomal-recessive, with biallelic mutations leading to disease manifestation (Bartsch2024HID1). A specific frameshift mutation, HID1 p.G320Rfs*3, results in a truncated protein that lacks functional domains, leading to a loss-of-function effect. This mutation is associated with reduced mRNA levels due to nonsense-mediated decay and affects protein stability and function (Bartsch2024HID1).

HID1 mutations disrupt neurosecretory pathways, particularly affecting large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) biogenesis and secretion. This disruption leads to altered levels of secretogranin II (SGII) and chromogranin A (CHGA), impacting vesicle transport and secretion processes (Bartsch2024HID1). The mutations also impair neuronal differentiation, as evidenced by reduced neurite outgrowth and increased apoptosis, potentially contributing to brain malformations observed in patients (Bartsch2024HID1). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HID1 mutations in neurodevelopmental and neuroendocrine disorders.

## Interactions
The HID1 protein is primarily associated with the medial- and trans-Golgi apparatus and is involved in intracellular trafficking processes. While specific physical interactions of HID1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed, its role in vesicular trafficking and dense core vesicle (DCV) formation suggests potential interactions. HID1 co-localizes with Dymeclin, a protein associated with the Golgi apparatus, indicating that they may reside on the same subdomain of the Golgi apparatus (Wang2011HID1). This co-localization persists even after Golgi structure disruption, implying a stable association within the Golgi subdomain.

HID1 is also implicated in the regulation of trans-Golgi network (TGN) acidification, which affects the sorting and retention of the V-ATPase subunit a2 at the Golgi. The absence of HID1 leads to the mislocalization of the a2 subunit, suggesting an indirect interaction through its role in maintaining proper V-ATPase localization (Hummer2017HID1). Although direct interactions with other proteins are not specified, HID1's involvement in processes related to LDCV formation and secretion implies interactions with proteins involved in these pathways (Hummer2017HID1). The exact mechanisms of these interactions remain to be fully elucidated.
